00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.769
Today we are going to do a last
serious topic on the Laplace

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.215
transform, the last topic for
which I don't have to make

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:24.065
frequent and profuse apologies.
One of the things the Laplace

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:29.077
transform does very well and one
of the reasons why people like

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:33.119
it, engineers like it,
is that it handles functions

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.000
with jump discontinuities very
nicely.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.250
Now, the OR function with a
jump discontinuity is-- Purple.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.000
Is a function called the unit
step function.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.637
I will draw a graph of it.
Even the graph is

00:01:03.637 --> 00:01:07.359
controversial,
but everyone is agreed that it

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:12.012
zero here and one there.
What people are not agreed upon

00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:16.241
is its value at zero.
And some people make it zero,

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:20.640
some people make it one,
and some equivocate like me.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.700
I will leave it undefined.
It is u of t.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.000
It is called the unit step.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.952
Because that is what it is.
And let's say we will leave u

00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:38.000
of zero undefined.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.442
If that makes you unhappy,
get over it.

00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:51.333
Of course, we don't always want
the jump to be at zero.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:55.590
Sometimes we will want to jump
in another place.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.572
If I want the function to jump,
let's say at the point a

00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:05.735
instead of jumping at zero,
I am going to start doing what

00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:10.481
everybody does.
You put in the vertical lines,

00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:15.112
even though I have no meaning,
whatever, but it makes the

00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:19.496
graph look more connected and a
little easier to read.

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:24.458
So that function I will call u
sub a is the function

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:28.345
which jumps at the point a.
How shall I give its

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:32.633
definition?
Well, you can see it is just

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:36.959
the translation by a of the unit
step function.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.507
So that is the way to write it,
u of t minus a.

00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:46.927
Now I am not done.
There is a unit box function,

00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:51.159
which we will draw in general
terms like this.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.639
It gets to a,
then it jumps up to one,

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.000
falls down again at b and
continues onto zero.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.811
This happens between a and b.
And the value to which it

00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.000
arises is one.
I will call this the unit box.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.161
It is a function of t,
a very simple one but an

00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:23.116
important one.
And what would be the formula

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:26.072
for the unit box function?
Well, in general,

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:30.058
almost all of these functions,
as you will see when you use

00:03:30.058 --> 00:03:33.357
jump discontinuity,
the idea is to write them all

00:03:33.357 --> 00:03:37.000
cleverly using nothing but u of.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.302
Because it is that will have
the Laplace transformer.

00:03:41.302 --> 00:03:43.866
The way to write this is (u)ab.

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:47.341
And, if you like,
you can treat this as the

00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:50.982
definition of it.
Let's make it a definition.

00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:53.712
Okay, three lines.
Or, better yet,

00:03:53.712 --> 00:03:57.600
a colon and two lines.
I am defining this to be,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.761
what would it be?
Make the unit step at a step up

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:07.304
at a, but then I would continue
at one all the time.

00:04:07.304 --> 00:04:10.422
I should, therefore,
step down at b.

00:04:10.422 --> 00:04:15.678
Now, the way you step down is
just by taking the negative of

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:20.488
the unit step function.
I step down at b by subtracting

00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:24.140
u sub b of t .
In other words,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.396
it is u of t minus a minus u of
t minus b.

00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:32.654
And now I have expressed it

00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:35.288
entirely in terms of the unit
step function.

00:04:35.288 --> 00:04:39.087
That will be convenient when I
want take the Laplace transform.

00:04:39.087 --> 00:04:41.170
What is so good about these
things?

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.743
Well, these functions,
when you use them in

00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:46.562
multiplications,
they transform other functions

00:04:46.562 --> 00:04:48.277
in a nice way.
Not transform.

00:04:48.277 --> 00:04:51.218
That is not the right word.
They operate on them.

00:04:51.218 --> 00:04:53.853
They turn them into other
strange creatures,

00:04:53.853 --> 00:04:56.978
and it might be these strange
creatures that you are

00:04:56.978 --> 00:05:01.986
interested in.
Let me just draw you a picture.

00:05:01.986 --> 00:05:07.189
That will be good enough.
Suppose we have some function

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.584
like that, f of t,
what would the function u sub

00:05:12.584 --> 00:05:16.438
ab,
I will put in the variable,

00:05:16.438 --> 00:05:21.448
t times f of t,
what function would that be?

00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:24.627
I am just going to draw its
graph.

00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:30.391
What would its graph be?
Well, in between a and b this

00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:34.927
function (u)ab of t has the
value one.

00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:39.546
All I am doing is multiplying f
of t by one.

00:05:39.546 --> 00:05:43.340
In short, I am not doing
anything to it at all.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.463
Outside of that interval,
(u)ab has the value zero,

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:51.835
so that zero times f of t makes
zero.

00:05:51.835 --> 00:05:55.298
And, therefore,
outside of this it is zero.

00:05:55.298 --> 00:06:00.164
The effect of multiplying an
arbitrary function by this unit

00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:03.958
box function is,
you wipe away all of its graph

00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:10.173
except the part between a and b.
Now, that is a very useful

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:14.521
thing to be able to do.
Well, that is enough of that.

00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:17.364
Now, let's get into the main
topic.

00:06:17.364 --> 00:06:22.046
That is just preliminary.
I will be using these functions

00:06:22.046 --> 00:06:25.976
all during the period,
but the real topic is the

00:06:25.976 --> 00:06:29.070
following.
Let's calculate the Laplace

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.000
transform of the unit step
function.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.064
Well, this is no very big deal.
It is the integral from zero to

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.332
infinity e to the minus s t
times y of t, dt.

00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:49.664
But, look, when t is bigger
than zero,

00:06:49.664 --> 00:06:53.504
this has the value one.
So it is the same of the

00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:56.771
Laplace transform of one.
In other words,

00:06:56.771 --> 00:07:02.000
it is one over s for
positive values of s.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.159
Or, to make it very clear,
the Laplace transform of one is

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:09.516
exactly the same thing.
As you see, the Laplace

00:07:09.516 --> 00:07:13.456
transform really is not
interested in what happens when

00:07:13.456 --> 00:07:17.835
t is less than zero
because that is not part of the

00:07:17.835 --> 00:07:21.483
domain of integration,
the interval of integration.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:24.037
That is fine.
They both have Laplace

00:07:24.037 --> 00:07:26.445
transform of one over s.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:30.790
What is the big deal?
The big deal is,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:37.393
what is the inverse Laplace
transform of one over s?

00:07:37.393 --> 00:07:41.758
Will the real function please

00:07:41.758 --> 00:07:45.787
stand up?
Which of these two should I

00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:49.815
pick?
Up to now in the course we have

00:07:49.815 --> 00:07:56.530
been picking one just because I
never made a fuss over it and

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.979
one was good enough.
For today one is no longer

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:05.329
going to be good enough.
And we have to first

00:08:05.329 --> 00:08:09.517
investigate the thing in a
slightly more theoretical way

00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:13.248
because this problem,
I have illustrated it on the

00:08:13.248 --> 00:08:17.360
inverse Laplace transform of one
over x,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.939
but it occurs for any inverse
Laplace transform.

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:23.223
Suppose I have,
in other words,

00:08:23.223 --> 00:08:27.791
that a function f of t has as
its Laplace transform capital F

00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:32.612
of s?
And now, I ask what the inverse

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:37.162
Laplace transform of capital F
of s is.

00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:41.292
Well, of course you want to
write f of t.

00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:45.758
But the same thing happens.
I will draw you a picture.

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:50.308
Suppose, in other words,
that here is our function f of

00:08:50.308 --> 00:08:53.089
t.
Well, one answer certainly is f

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:54.606
of t.
That is okay.

00:08:54.606 --> 00:09:00.000
That is the answer we have been
using up until now.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.141
But, you see,
I can complete this function in

00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:08.564
many other ways.
Suppose I haven't told you what

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:14.023
it was for s less than zero.
Any of these possibilities all

00:09:14.023 --> 00:09:17.694
will produce the same Laplace
transform.

00:09:17.694 --> 00:09:20.705
In fact, I can even make it
this.

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:23.247
That is okay.
Each of these,

00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:28.988
f of t with any one of
these tails, all have the same

00:09:28.988 --> 00:09:32.000
Laplace transform.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.006
Because the Laplace transform,
remember the definition,

00:09:41.006 --> 00:09:44.567
integral zero to infinity,
e to the negative s t,

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:49.167
f of t, dt

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:53.619
because the Laplace transform
does not care what the function

00:09:53.619 --> 00:09:56.141
was doing for negative values of
t.

00:09:56.141 --> 00:10:00.000
Now, if we have to have a
unique answer --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.378
And most of the time you don't
because, in general,

00:10:03.378 --> 00:10:07.229
the Laplace transform is only
used for problems for future

00:10:07.229 --> 00:10:09.527
time.
That is the way the engineers

00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:13.648
and physicists and other people
who use it habitually think of

00:10:13.648 --> 00:10:15.945
it.
If your problem is starting now

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:20.202
and going on into the future and
you don't have to know anything

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:23.040
about the past,
that is a Laplace transform

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.608
problem.
If you also have to know about

00:10:25.608 --> 00:10:30.000
the past, then it is a Fourier
transform problem.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.502
That is beyond the scope of
this course, you will never hear

00:10:34.502 --> 00:10:37.784
that word again,
but that is the difference.

00:10:37.784 --> 00:10:41.294
We are starting at time zero
and going forward.

00:10:41.294 --> 00:10:44.194
All right.
It does not care what f of t

00:10:44.194 --> 00:10:46.789
was doing for negative values of
t.

00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:51.215
And that gives us a problem
when we try to make the Laplace

00:10:51.215 --> 00:10:54.878
transform unique.
Now, how will I make it unique?

00:10:54.878 --> 00:10:59.000
Well, there is a simple way of
doing it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.579
Let's agree that wherever it
makes a difference,

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:06.388
and most of the time it
doesn't, but today it will,

00:11:06.388 --> 00:11:09.891
whenever it makes a difference
we will declare,

00:11:09.891 --> 00:11:14.233
we will by brute force make our
function zero for negative

00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:16.746
values of t.
That makes it unique.

00:11:16.746 --> 00:11:20.174
I am going to say that to make
it unique, now,

00:11:20.174 --> 00:11:24.515
how do I make f of t zero
for negative values

00:11:24.515 --> 00:11:27.029
of t?
The answer is multiply it by

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:32.384
the unit step function.
That leaves it what it was.

00:11:32.384 --> 00:11:37.418
It multiplies it by one for
positive values but multiplies

00:11:37.418 --> 00:11:42.805
it by zero for negative values.
The answer is going to be u of

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:48.015
t times f of t.
That will be the function that

00:11:48.015 --> 00:11:53.225
will look just that way that I
drew, but I will draw it once

00:11:53.225 --> 00:11:56.228
more.
It is the function that looks

00:11:56.228 --> 00:11:58.789
like this.
And when I do this,

00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:04.000
it makes the inverse Laplace
transform unique.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.230
Out of all the possible tails I
might have put on f of t,

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.615
it picks the least
interesting one,

00:12:11.615 --> 00:12:13.000
the tail zero.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.673
That is a start.
But what we have to do now is

00:12:26.673 --> 00:12:27.000
--

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.719
What I want is a formula.
What we are going to need is,

00:12:38.719 --> 00:12:42.438
as you see right even in the
beginning, if for example,

00:12:42.438 --> 00:12:46.019
if I want to calculate the
Laplace transform of this,

00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:50.151
what I would like to have is a
nice Laplace transform for the

00:12:50.151 --> 00:12:52.768
translate.
If you translate a function,

00:12:52.768 --> 00:12:55.730
how does that effect this
Laplace transform?

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.898
In other words,
the formula I am looking for is

00:12:58.898 --> 00:13:00.000
--

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.869
I want to express the Laplace
transform of f of t minus a.

00:13:12.869 --> 00:13:15.565
In other words,

00:13:15.565 --> 00:13:19.739
the function translated,
let's say a is positive,

00:13:19.739 --> 00:13:25.130
so I translate it to the right
along the t axis by the distance

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.739
a.
I want a formula for this in

00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:34.000
terms of the Laplace transform
of the function I started with.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.149
Now, my first task is to
convince you that,

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:40.750
though this would be very
useful and interesting,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.674
there cannot possibly be such a
formula.

00:13:43.674 --> 00:13:46.000
There is no such formula.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.708
Why not?
Well, I think I will explain it

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:05.224
over there since there is a
little piece of board I did not

00:14:05.224 --> 00:14:07.412
use.
Waste not want not.

00:14:07.412 --> 00:14:10.550
Why can't there be such a
formula?

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:15.780
What is it we are looking for?
Let's take a nice average

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.726
function f of t.
It has a Laplace transform.

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:23.959
And now I am going to translate
it.

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:29.000
Let's say this is the point
negative a.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.483
And so the corresponding point
positive a will be around here.

00:14:34.483 --> 00:14:38.438
I am going to translate it to
the right by a.

00:14:38.438 --> 00:14:43.921
What is it going to look like?
Well, then it is going to start

00:14:43.921 --> 00:14:48.146
here and is going to look like
this dashy thing.

00:14:48.146 --> 00:14:51.292
That is f of t minus a.

00:14:51.292 --> 00:14:54.977
That is not too bad a picture.
It will do.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:15:01.000
I just took that curve and
shoved it to the right by a.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.764
Now, why is it impossible to
express the Laplace transform of

00:15:09.764 --> 00:15:18.674
the dashed line in terms of the
Laplace transform of the solid

00:15:18.674 --> 00:15:23.056
line?
The answer is this piece.

00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:28.898
I will write it this way.
The trouble is,

00:15:28.898 --> 00:15:37.224
this piece is not used for the
Laplace transform of f of t.

00:15:37.224 --> 00:15:41.196
Why isn't it used?

00:15:41.196 --> 00:15:44.916
Well, because it occurs to the
left of the vertical axis.

00:15:44.916 --> 00:15:47.176
It occurs for negative values
of t.

00:15:47.176 --> 00:15:51.295
And the Laplace transform of f
of t simply does not

00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:55.282
care what f of t was
doing to the left of that line,

00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:58.671
for negative values of t.
It does not enter into the

00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:01.579
integral.
It was not used when I

00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:04.019
calculated this piece of the
curve.

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:07.896
It was not used when I
calculated the Laplace transform

00:16:07.896 --> 00:16:10.767
of f of t.
On the other hand,

00:16:10.767 --> 00:16:13.638
it is going to be needed.
It occurs here,

00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:17.801
after I shift it to the right.
It is going to be needed for

00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:21.750
the Laplace transform of f of t
minus a,

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.267
because I will have to start
the integration here,

00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:29.000
and I will have to know what
that is.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.009
In other words,
when I took the Laplace

00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:41.445
transform, I automatically lost
all information about the

00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:44.059
function for negative values of
t.

00:16:44.059 --> 00:16:48.415
If I am later going to want
some of that information for

00:16:48.415 --> 00:16:51.346
calculating this,
I won't have it and,

00:16:51.346 --> 00:16:56.019
therefore, there cannot be a
formula expressing one in terms

00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:59.007
of the other.
Now, of course,

00:16:59.007 --> 00:17:02.501
that cannot be the answer,
otherwise I would not have

00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:05.457
raised your expectations merely
to dash them.

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:07.741
I don't want to do that,
of course.

00:17:07.741 --> 00:17:09.689
There is a formula,
of course.

00:17:09.689 --> 00:17:13.720
It is just, I want to emphasize
that you must write it my way

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.684
because, if you write it any
other way, you are going to get

00:17:17.684 --> 00:17:21.043
into the deepest trouble.
The formula is-- the good

00:17:21.043 --> 00:17:24.000
formula, the right formula --

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.579
-- accepts the given.
It says look,

00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:35.084
we have lost that pink part of
it.

00:17:35.084 --> 00:17:37.739
Therefore, I can never recover
that.

00:17:37.739 --> 00:17:42.292
Therefore, I won't ask for it.
The translation formula I will

00:17:42.292 --> 00:17:46.314
ask for is not one for the
Laplace transform of f of t

00:17:46.314 --> 00:17:50.108
minus a,
but rather for the Laplace

00:17:50.108 --> 00:17:54.737
transform of this thing where I
have wiped away that pink part

00:17:54.737 --> 00:17:59.407
from the translated function.
In other words,

00:17:59.407 --> 00:18:04.475
the function I am talking about
now is the formula for,

00:18:04.475 --> 00:18:10.011
I will put it over here to show
you the function what we are

00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:13.577
talking about.
It is the function f of,

00:18:13.577 --> 00:18:17.425
well, in terms of the pink
function it is,

00:18:17.425 --> 00:18:21.648
I will have to reproduce some
of that picture.

00:18:21.648 --> 00:18:26.621
There is f of t.
f of t minus a,

00:18:26.621 --> 00:18:32.168
then, looked like this.
And so the function I am

00:18:32.168 --> 00:18:36.144
looking for is,
this is the thing translated,

00:18:36.144 --> 00:18:39.759
but when I get down to the
corresponding,

00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:43.915
this is the point that
corresponds to that one,

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:48.162
I wipe it away and just go with
zero after that.

00:18:48.162 --> 00:18:53.403
So this is u of t minus a times
f of t minus a times f of t

00:18:53.403 --> 00:19:00.000
minus a.
What is this Laplace transform?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.231
Now that does have a simple
answer.

00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:10.330
The answer is it is e to the
minus as,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:16.553
a funny exponential,
times the Laplace transform of

00:19:16.553 --> 00:19:23.150
the original function.
Now, this formula occurs in two

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.759
forms.
This one is not too bad

00:19:26.759 --> 00:19:29.990
looking.
The trouble is,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.422
when you want to solve
differential equations you are

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:37.250
going to be extremely puzzled
because the function that you

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.144
will have to take to do the
calculation on will not be given

00:19:41.144 --> 00:19:44.180
to you in the form f of t minus
a.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.008
It will look sine t
or t squared or some

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:50.846
polynomial in t.
It will not be written as t

00:19:50.846 --> 00:19:53.023
minus a.
What do you do?

00:19:53.023 --> 00:19:56.455
If your function does not look
like that but instead,

00:19:56.455 --> 00:20:00.218
in terms of symbols looks like
this, you can still use the

00:20:00.218 --> 00:20:03.718
formula.
Just a trivial change of

00:20:03.718 --> 00:20:06.869
variable means that you can
write it instead.

00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:10.664
Now, this is one place,
there is no way of writing the

00:20:10.664 --> 00:20:13.672
answer in terms of capital F of
s.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:17.682
This is one of those cases
where this notation is just no

00:20:17.682 --> 00:20:20.762
good anymore.
I am going to have to write it

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:24.414
using the L notation.
The Laplace transform of f of,

00:20:24.414 --> 00:20:28.424
and wherever you see a t,
you should write t plus a.

00:20:28.424 --> 00:20:31.910
Basically, this is the same

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.448
formula as that one.
But I will have to stand on my

00:20:35.448 --> 00:20:38.844
head for one minute to try to
convince you of it.

00:20:38.844 --> 00:20:42.452
I won't do that now.
I would like you just to take a

00:20:42.452 --> 00:20:45.707
look at the formula.
You should know what it is

00:20:45.707 --> 00:20:48.254
called.
There are a certain number of

00:20:48.254 --> 00:20:51.721
idiots who call this the
exponential shift formula

00:20:51.721 --> 00:20:55.683
because on the right side you
multiply by an exponential,

00:20:55.683 --> 00:21:00.000
and that corresponds to
shifting the function.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.928
Unfortunately,
we have preempted that.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.460
We are not going to call it
this.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.467
I will call it what your book
calls it.

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:13.136
The difficulty is there is no
universal designation for this

00:21:13.136 --> 00:21:17.647
formula, important as it is.
However, your book calls this

00:21:17.647 --> 00:21:21.683
t-axis translation formula.
Translation because I am

00:21:21.683 --> 00:21:25.956
translating on the t-axis.
And that is what I do to the

00:21:25.956 --> 00:21:30.071
function, essentially.
And this tells me what its new

00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:33.000
Laplace transform is.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.374
The other formula,
remember it?

00:21:40.374 --> 00:21:44.964
The exponential shift formula,
the shift or the translation

00:21:44.964 --> 00:21:47.812
occurs on the s-axis.
In other words,

00:21:47.812 --> 00:21:51.690
the formula said that F of s
minus a,

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.726
you do the translation in s
variable corresponded to

00:21:55.726 --> 00:22:00.000
multiplying this by e
to the a t.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.761
In other words,
the formulas are sort of dual

00:22:02.761 --> 00:22:05.586
to each other.
This guy translates on the left

00:22:05.586 --> 00:22:08.787
side and multiplies by the
exponential on the right.

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:12.051
The formula that you know
translates on the right and

00:22:12.051 --> 00:22:14.625
multiplies by the exponential on
the left.

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:18.140
What are we going to calculate?
I am trying to calculate,

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.777
so I am trying to prove this
first formula.

00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:23.413
The second one will be an easy
consequence.

00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:27.179
I am trying to calculate the
Laplace transform of that thing.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:31.188
What is it?
Well, it is the integral from

00:22:31.188 --> 00:22:35.566
zero to infinity of e to the
minus st times u of t minus a,

00:22:35.566 --> 00:22:39.716
f of t minus a times dt.

00:22:42.132 --> 00:22:46.358
That is the formula for it.
But I am trying to express it

00:22:46.358 --> 00:22:49.754
in terms of the Laplace
transform of f itself.

00:22:49.754 --> 00:22:54.207
Now, it is trying to be the
Laplace transform of f.

00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:58.433
The problem is that here,
a (t minus a) occurs,

00:22:58.433 --> 00:23:03.153
which I don't like.
I would like that to be just a

00:23:03.153 --> 00:23:05.307
t.
Now, in order not to confuse

00:23:05.307 --> 00:23:09.615
you, and this is what confused
everybody, I will set t1 equal

00:23:09.615 --> 00:23:13.564
to t minus a.
I will change the variable.

00:23:13.564 --> 00:23:17.799
This is called changing the
variable in a definite integral.

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:21.605
How do you change the variable
in a definite integral?

00:23:21.605 --> 00:23:24.333
You do it.
Well, let's leave the limits

00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:27.348
for the moment.
e to the minus s

00:23:27.348 --> 00:23:31.107
times --
Now, t, remember you can change

00:23:31.107 --> 00:23:33.962
the variable forwards,
direct substitution,

00:23:33.962 --> 00:23:37.089
but now I have to use the
inverse substitution.

00:23:37.089 --> 00:23:40.081
It's trivial,
but t is equal to t1 plus a.

00:23:40.081 --> 00:23:42.256
To change this I must

00:23:42.256 --> 00:23:45.995
substitute backwards and make
that t1 plus a.

00:23:45.995 --> 00:23:49.462
How about the rest of it?
Well, this becomes u of t1.

00:23:49.462 --> 00:23:51.910
This is f of t1.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.377
I have to change the dt,
too, but that's no problem.

00:23:55.377 --> 00:24:00.000
dt1 equals dt
because a is a constant.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.230
That is dt1.
And the last step is to put in

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.230
the limits.
Now, when t is equal to zero,

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.076
t1 has the value
negative a.

00:24:10.076 --> 00:24:13.692
So this has to be negative a
when t is infinity.

00:24:13.692 --> 00:24:17.615
Infinity minus a is still
infinity, so that is still

00:24:17.615 --> 00:24:19.461
infinity.
In other words,

00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:22.384
this changes to that.
These two things,

00:24:22.384 --> 00:24:25.692
whatever they are,
they have the same value.

00:24:25.692 --> 00:24:30.000
All I have done is changed the
variable.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.542
Make it change a variable.
But now, of course,

00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:34.293
I want to make this look
better.

00:24:34.293 --> 00:24:37.344
How am I going to do that?
Well, first multiply out the

00:24:37.344 --> 00:24:40.564
exponential and then you get a
factor e to the minus s(t1).

00:24:40.564 --> 00:24:42.090
That is good.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:44.971
That goes with this guy.
Now I get a factor e to the

00:24:44.971 --> 00:24:47.909
minus s times a from
the exponential law.

00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:51.016
But that does not have anything
to do with the integral.

00:24:51.016 --> 00:24:54.519
It is a constant as far as the
integral is concerned because it

00:24:54.519 --> 00:24:56.440
doesn't involve t1.
And, therefore,

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.000
I can pull it outside of the
integral sign.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.065
And write that e to the minus s
times a.

00:25:05.065 --> 00:25:10.626
Let's write it the other way.
Times the integral of what?

00:25:10.626 --> 00:25:14.599
Well, e to the negative st1.

00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:18.969
Now, u of t1,
f of t1 times dt1.

00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:22.445
Still integrated from minus a

00:25:22.445 --> 00:25:29.000
to infinity.
And now the final step.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.357
This u of t1 is zero
for negative values of t.

00:25:34.357 --> 00:25:38.837
And, therefore,
it is equal to one for positive

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:42.246
values of t.
It is equal to zero for

00:25:42.246 --> 00:25:47.214
negative values of t,
which means I can forget about

00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:52.766
the part of the integral that
goes from negative a to zero.

00:25:52.766 --> 00:25:56.175
I better rewrite this.

00:25:56.175 --> 00:26:00.077
Okay, leave that.
In other words,

00:26:00.077 --> 00:26:04.029
this is equal to e to the minus
as times the

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:08.485
integral from zero to infinity
of e to the minus s --

00:26:08.485 --> 00:26:11.000
Let me do the shifty part now.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.257
And this is since u of t1 is
equal to zero for

00:26:23.257 --> 00:26:29.515
t1 less than zero.
That is why I can replace this

00:26:29.515 --> 00:26:33.154
with zero.
Because from negative a to

00:26:33.154 --> 00:26:37.214
zero, nothing is happening.
The integrand is zero.

00:26:37.214 --> 00:26:40.362
And why can I get rid of it
after that?

00:26:40.362 --> 00:26:43.180
Well, because it is one after
that.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.571
And what is this thing?
This is the Laplace transform.

00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:51.299
No, it is not the Laplace
transform they said.

00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:53.868
Because you had t1 there,
not t.

00:26:53.868 --> 00:26:58.011
It is the Laplace transform
because this is a dummy

00:26:58.011 --> 00:27:01.886
variable.
The t1 is integrated out.

00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:05.962
It is a dummy variable.
It doesn't matter what you call

00:27:05.962 --> 00:27:07.924
it.
It is still the Laplace

00:27:07.924 --> 00:27:12.679
transform if I make that wiggly
t or t star or tau or u.

00:27:12.679 --> 00:27:16.905
I can call it anything I want
and it is still the Laplace

00:27:16.905 --> 00:27:20.000
transform of f of t.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.776
What is the answer?
That is e to the negative as

00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:33.000
times the Laplace transform of
the function f.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.802
That is what I promised you in
that formula.

00:27:35.802 --> 00:27:37.887
Now, how about the other
formula?

00:27:37.887 --> 00:27:39.972
Well, let's look at that
quickly.

00:27:39.972 --> 00:27:42.513
That is, as I say,
just sleight of hand.

00:27:42.513 --> 00:27:46.423
But since that is the formula
you will be using at least half

00:27:46.423 --> 00:27:50.268
the time you better learn it.
This little sleight of hand is

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:53.656
also reproduced in one page of
notes that I give you,

00:27:53.656 --> 00:27:57.631
but maybe you will find it easy
to understand if I talk it out

00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:00.696
loud.
The problem now is for the

00:28:00.696 --> 00:28:03.503
second formula.
I am going to have to recopy

00:28:03.503 --> 00:28:07.353
out the first one in order to
make the argument in a form in

00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:09.703
which you will understand it,
I hope.

00:28:09.703 --> 00:28:13.031
This goes to e to the minus as
F s,

00:28:13.031 --> 00:28:16.816
except I am now going to write
that not in F of s;

00:28:16.816 --> 00:28:20.667
since I will not be able to
write the second formula using F

00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:24.256
of s, I am not going to write
the first formula that way

00:28:24.256 --> 00:28:26.671
either.
I will write it as the Laplace

00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:30.000
transform with f of t.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.985
Now, formally if somebody says,
okay, how do I calculate the

00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:39.380
Laplace transform of this thing?
I say put down this.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.859
Well, that has no t in it.
It doesn't have the f in it

00:28:43.859 --> 00:28:45.802
either.
Then write this.

00:28:45.802 --> 00:28:50.197
What formula did I do?
I looked at that and changed t

00:28:50.197 --> 00:28:55.267
minus a to t. Now, 
how did I change t minus a?

00:28:55.267 --> 00:28:58.647
The way to say it is 

00:28:58.647 --> 00:29:02.834
I changed t.
Because the t is always there.

00:29:02.834 --> 00:29:08.503
t to t plus a.
You get this by replace t by t

00:29:08.503 --> 00:29:12.000
plus a to get the right-hand
side.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.075
I replace this t by t plus a,
and that turns this 

00:29:20.075 --> 00:29:22.792
into f of t.
And that is the f of t

00:29:22.792 --> 00:29:26.120
that went in there.
That is the universal rule for

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.837
doing it.
Now I am going to use that same

00:29:28.837 --> 00:29:32.845
rule for transforming u of t
minus a times f of t.

00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:36.025
See, the problem is now I have

00:29:36.025 --> 00:29:39.672
a function like t squared
or sine t,

00:29:39.672 --> 00:29:42.509
which is not written in terms
of t minus a.

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:44.872
And I don't know what to do
with it.

00:29:44.872 --> 00:29:46.831
The answer is,
by brute force,

00:29:46.831 --> 00:29:49.532
write it in terms of t minus a.

00:29:49.532 --> 00:29:52.841
What is brute force?
Brute force is the following.

00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:56.893
I am going to put a t minus a
there if it kills me.

00:29:56.893 --> 00:30:01.264
t minus a plus a.
No harm in that,

00:30:01.264 --> 00:30:04.425
is there?
Now there is a t minus a there,

00:30:04.425 --> 00:30:06.874
just the way there was up
there.

00:30:06.874 --> 00:30:11.062
And now what is the rule?
I am just going to follow my

00:30:11.062 --> 00:30:13.749
nose.
What's sauce for the goose is

00:30:13.749 --> 00:30:17.779
sauce for the gander.
Minus as, Laplace transform of

00:30:17.779 --> 00:30:20.861
f of, now what am I going to
write here?

00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:24.732
Wherever I see a t,
I am going to change it from t

00:30:24.732 --> 00:30:29.000
plus a.
Here I see a t.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I will change that 
to t plus a.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.599
What do I have?
t plus a minus a plus a,

00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:41.400
well,
if you can keep count,

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.400
what does that make?
It makes t plus a in

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.000
the end.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.639
The peace that passeth
understanding.

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:08.891
Let's do some examples and
suddenly you will breathe a sigh

00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:11.824
of relief that this all is
doable anyway.

00:31:11.824 --> 00:31:16.002
Let's calculate something.
I hope I am not covering up any

00:31:16.002 --> 00:31:19.521
crucial, yes I am.
I am covering up the u of t's,

00:31:19.521 --> 00:31:22.087
but you know that by now.
Let's see.

00:31:22.087 --> 00:31:27.000
What should we calculate first?
What I just covered up.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.069
Let's calculate the Laplace
transform of (u)ab of t.

00:31:31.069 --> 00:31:34.488
What is that going to be?

00:31:34.488 --> 00:31:38.395
Well, first of all,
write out what it is in terms

00:31:38.395 --> 00:31:41.000
of the unit step function.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.616
Remember that formula?
There.

00:31:47.616 --> 00:31:50.327
Now you see it.
Now you don't.

00:31:50.327 --> 00:31:54.158
Its Laplace transform is going
to be what?

00:31:54.158 --> 00:31:59.112
Well, the Laplace transform of
t minus a,

00:31:59.112 --> 00:32:05.000
that is a special case here
where this function is one.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.066
Well, that one.
Either one.

00:32:07.066 --> 00:32:11.119
It makes no difference.
It is simply going to be the

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:15.649
Laplace transform of what f of t
would have been,

00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:17.000
which is --

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.134
See, the Laplace transform of u
of t is what?

00:32:30.134 --> 00:32:31.906
That's one over s,
right?

00:32:31.906 --> 00:32:36.261
Because this is the function
one, and we don't care the fact

00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:39.140
that it is zero or negative
values of t.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.201
That is my f of s.
And so I multiply it by e to

00:32:43.201 --> 00:32:46.671
the minus as times one over s.

00:32:46.671 --> 00:32:50.436
I am using this formula,
e to the minus as times the

00:32:50.436 --> 00:32:53.610
Laplace transform of the unit
step function,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:59.000
which is one over s.
How about the translation?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.013
That was taken care of by the
exponential factor.

00:33:03.013 --> 00:33:06.024
And it's minus because this is
minus.

00:33:06.024 --> 00:33:10.623
The same thing with the b.
This is the Laplace transform

00:33:10.623 --> 00:33:14.721
of the unit box function.
It looks a little hairy.

00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:19.069
You will learn to work with it,
don't worry about it.

00:33:19.069 --> 00:33:23.000
How about the Laplace transform
of --

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.575
Okay.
Let's use the other formula.

00:33:25.575 --> 00:33:29.791
What would be the Laplace
transform of u of t minus one

00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:33.537
times t squared, for example?

00:33:33.537 --> 00:33:38.299
See, if I gave this to you and
you only had the first formula,

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:41.578
you would say,
hey, but there is no t minus

00:33:41.578 --> 00:33:44.388
one in there.
There is only t squared.

00:33:44.388 --> 00:33:46.964
What am I supposed to do?

00:33:46.964 --> 00:33:51.647
Well, some of you might dig way
back into high school and say

00:33:51.647 --> 00:33:56.409
every polynomial can be written
in powers of t minus one,

00:33:56.409 --> 00:34:02.089
that is what I will do.
That would give the right

00:34:02.089 --> 00:34:05.097
answer.
But in case you had forgotten

00:34:05.097 --> 00:34:08.857
how to do that,
you don't have to know because

00:34:08.857 --> 00:34:12.701
you could use the other formula
instead, which,

00:34:12.701 --> 00:34:15.376
by the way, is the way you do
it.

00:34:15.376 --> 00:34:19.805
What are we going to do?
It goes into e to the minus s.

00:34:19.805 --> 00:34:22.896
The a is one in this case,

00:34:22.896 --> 00:34:25.821
plus one.
e to the minus s times the

00:34:25.821 --> 00:34:30.000
Laplace transform of what
function?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.183
Change t to t plus one.

00:34:33.183 --> 00:34:38.209
The Laplace transform of t plus
one squared.

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:41.811
What is that?
That is e to the minus s times

00:34:41.811 --> 00:34:46.000
the Laplace transform of t
squared plus 2t plus one.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.267
What's that?

00:34:49.267 --> 00:34:54.376
Well, by the formulas which I
am not bothering to write on the

00:34:54.376 --> 00:34:59.235
board anymore because you know
them, it is e to the minus s

00:34:59.235 --> 00:35:04.102
times --
Laplace transform of t squared

00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:07.045
is two factorial over s cubed.

00:35:07.045 --> 00:35:09.498
Remember you always have to

00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:12.862
raise the exponent by one.
This is two factorial,

00:35:12.862 --> 00:35:15.455
but that is the same as two.
Plus two.

00:35:15.455 --> 00:35:19.309
This two comes from there.
The Laplace transform of t is

00:35:19.309 --> 00:35:21.902
one over s squared.

00:35:21.902 --> 00:35:24.986
And, finally,
the Laplace transform of one is

00:35:24.986 --> 00:35:30.138
one over s.
You mean all that mess from

00:35:30.138 --> 00:35:34.891
this simple-looking function?
This function is not so simple.

00:35:34.891 --> 00:35:38.613
What is its graph?
What is it we are calculating

00:35:38.613 --> 00:35:42.653
the Laplace transform of?
Well, it is the function t

00:35:42.653 --> 00:35:45.980
squared.
But multiplying it by that

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.970
factor u of t minus one 
means that the only part of

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:55.564
it I am using is this part,
because u of t minus one is one

00:35:55.564 --> 00:36:00.000
when t is
bigger than one.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.623
But when t is less than one it
is zero.

00:36:02.623 --> 00:36:05.938
That function doesn't look all
that simple to me.

00:36:05.938 --> 00:36:09.942
And that is why its Laplace
transform has three terms in it

00:36:09.942 --> 00:36:13.809
with this exponential factor.
Well, it is a discontinuous

00:36:13.809 --> 00:36:16.502
function.
And it gets discontinuous at a

00:36:16.502 --> 00:36:19.471
very peculiar spot.
You have to expect that.

00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:23.752
Where in this does it tell you
it becomes discontinuous at one?

00:36:23.752 --> 00:36:29.000
It is because this is e to the
minus one times s.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.698
This tells you where the
discontinuity occurs.

00:36:32.698 --> 00:36:37.465
The rest of it is just stuff
you have to take because it is

00:36:37.465 --> 00:36:41.328
the function t squared.
It's what it is.

00:36:41.328 --> 00:36:44.534
All right.
I think most of you are going

00:36:44.534 --> 00:36:49.136
to encounter the worst troubles
when you try to calculate

00:36:49.136 --> 00:36:53.657
inverse Laplace transforms,
so let me try to explain how

00:36:53.657 --> 00:36:56.698
that is done.
I will give you a simple

00:36:56.698 --> 00:37:01.689
example first.
And then I will try to give you

00:37:01.689 --> 00:37:06.981
a slightly more complicated one.
But even the simple one won't

00:37:06.981 --> 00:37:11.232
make your head ache.
We are going to calculate the

00:37:11.232 --> 00:37:16.004
inverse Laplace transform of
this guy, one plus e to the

00:37:16.004 --> 00:37:18.000
negative pi s --

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
-- divided by s squared plus
one.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.502
All right.
Now, the first thing you must

00:37:37.502 --> 00:37:40.839
do is as soon as you see
exponential factors in there

00:37:40.839 --> 00:37:44.625
like that you know that these
functions, the answer is going

00:37:44.625 --> 00:37:48.411
to be a discontinuous function.
And you have got to separate

00:37:48.411 --> 00:37:52.005
out the different pieces of it
that go with the different

00:37:52.005 --> 00:37:54.572
exponentials.
Because the way the formula

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:59.000
works, it has to be used
differently for each value of a.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.216
Now, in this case,
there is only one value of a

00:38:02.216 --> 00:38:03.894
that occurs.
Negative pi.

00:38:03.894 --> 00:38:07.599
But it does mean that we are
going to have to begin by

00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:11.794
separating out the thing into
one over s squared plus one

00:38:11.794 --> 00:38:15.779
and this other
factor e to the negative pi s

00:38:15.779 --> 00:38:19.625
divided by s squared plus one.

00:38:19.625 --> 00:38:23.819
Now all I have to do is take
the inverse Laplace transform of

00:38:23.819 --> 00:38:26.616
each piece.
The inverse Laplace transform

00:38:26.616 --> 00:38:32.000
of one over s squared plus one
is --

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.113
Well, up to now we have been
saying its sine t,

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:38.783
right?
If you say it is sine t you are

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:41.309
going to get into trouble.
How come?

00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:43.690
We didn't get into trouble
before.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:47.876
Yes, but that was because there
were no exponentials in the

00:38:47.876 --> 00:38:50.907
expression.
When there are exponentials you

00:38:50.907 --> 00:38:54.515
have to be more careful.
Make the inverse transform

00:38:54.515 --> 00:38:56.391
unique.
Make it not sine t,

00:38:56.391 --> 00:39:00.000
but u of t sine t.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.682
You will see why in just a
moment.

00:39:02.682 --> 00:39:07.317
If this weren't there then sine
t would be perfectly okay.

00:39:07.317 --> 00:39:11.707
With that factor there,
you have got to put in the u of

00:39:11.707 --> 00:39:16.585
t, otherwise you won't
be able to get the formula to

00:39:16.585 --> 00:39:18.699
work right.
In other words,

00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:23.414
I must use this particular one
that I picked out to make it

00:39:23.414 --> 00:39:26.422
unique at the beginning of the
period.

00:39:26.422 --> 00:39:31.677
Otherwise, it just won't work.
Now, I know that is fine.

00:39:31.677 --> 00:39:35.436
But now what is the inverse
Laplace transform of e to the

00:39:35.436 --> 00:39:38.322
minus pi?
In other words,

00:39:38.322 --> 00:39:41.946
it is the same function,
except I am now multiplying it

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:44.563
by e to the negative pi s.

00:39:44.563 --> 00:39:46.778
Well, now I will use that
formula.

00:39:46.778 --> 00:39:50.738
My f of s is one over s squared
plus one,

00:39:50.738 --> 00:39:54.093
and that corresponds it to
sine t.

00:39:54.093 --> 00:39:57.651
If I multiply it by e to the
minus pi s,

00:39:57.651 --> 00:40:02.045
just copy it down.
It now corresponds,

00:40:02.045 --> 00:40:08.395
the inverse Laplace transform,
to what the left side says it

00:40:08.395 --> 00:40:12.055
does.
u of t minus pi

00:40:12.055 --> 00:40:17.114
times, in other words,
this corresponds to that.

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:23.357
Then if I multiply it by e to
the minus pi s,

00:40:23.357 --> 00:40:31.000
it corresponds to change the t
to t minus pi.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.670
What is the answer?
The answer is you sum these two

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:47.639
pieces.
The first piece is u of time

00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:53.195
sine t.
The second piece is u of t

00:40:53.195 --> 00:41:00.000
minus pi sine t of minus pi.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.240
Now, if you leave the answer in
that form it is technically

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.759
correct, but you are going to
lose a lot of credit.

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:13.825
You have to transform it to
make it look good.

00:41:13.825 --> 00:41:16.716
You have to make it
intelligible.

00:41:16.716 --> 00:41:20.692
You are not allowed to leave it
in that form.

00:41:20.692 --> 00:41:24.036
What could we do to it?
Well, you see,

00:41:24.036 --> 00:41:30.000
this part of it is interesting
whenever t is positive.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.262
This part of it is only
interesting when t is greater

00:41:34.262 --> 00:41:37.540
than or equal to pi because
this is zero.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.803
Before that this is zero.
What you have to do is make

00:41:41.803 --> 00:41:44.590
cases.
Let's call the answer f of t.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.131
The function has to be

00:41:47.131 --> 00:41:50.737
presented in what is called the
cases format.

00:41:50.737 --> 00:41:54.590
That is what it is called when
you type in tech,

00:41:54.590 --> 00:42:00.000
which I think a certain number
of you can do anyway.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.402
You have to make cases.
The first case is what happened

00:42:04.402 --> 00:42:08.152
between zero and pi?
Well, between zero and pi,

00:42:08.152 --> 00:42:12.961
only this term is operational.
The other one is zero because

00:42:12.961 --> 00:42:16.630
of that factor.
Therefore, between zero and pi

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:21.114
the function looks like,
now, I don't have to put in the

00:42:21.114 --> 00:42:24.701
u of t because that is
equal to one.

00:42:24.701 --> 00:42:30.000
It is equal to sine t
between zero and pi.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.622
What is it equal to bigger than
pi?

00:42:32.622 --> 00:42:36.632
Well, the first factor,
the first term still obtains,

00:42:36.632 --> 00:42:40.565
so I have to include that.
But now I have to add the

00:42:40.565 --> 00:42:43.727
second one.
Well, what is the second term?

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:48.123
I don't include the t minus
pi, u of t minus pi

00:42:48.123 --> 00:42:51.593
anymore because
that is now one.

00:42:51.593 --> 00:42:55.218
That has the value one.
It is sine of t minus pi.

00:42:55.218 --> 00:43:00.000
But what is sine of t minus pi?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.707
You take the sine curve and you
translate it to the right by pi.

00:43:07.707 --> 00:43:13.457
So what happens to it?
It turns into this curve.

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:18.228
In other words,
it turns into the curve,

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:23.000
what curve is that?
Minus sine t.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.756
The other factor,
this factor is one and this

00:43:33.756 --> 00:43:37.000
becomes negative sine t.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:50.059
And so the final answer is f of
t is equal to sine t

00:43:50.059 --> 00:43:58.656
between zero and pi and
zero for t greater than or equal

00:43:58.656 --> 00:44:03.866
to pi.
That is the right form of the

00:44:03.866 --> 00:44:04.866
answer.
