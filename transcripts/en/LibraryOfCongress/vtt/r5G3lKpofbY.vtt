00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.610
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson: Good afternoon.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.910
I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.210
I'm Director for the
Center for the Book here

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.510
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.100
I'd like to welcome you to this
afternoon's Books and Beyond talk.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.220
And thank you so much
for being with us.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.450
We at the Center for the
Book, are part of the national

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.290
and international outreach unit
of the Library of Congress,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.590
and it's our mission here at the
library as the nation's first,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.210
cultural institution, to provide a
rich, enduring source of knowledge,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.730
one that can be relied
upon for endeavoring.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.100
Endeavoring intellectually
and creatively.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.940
And that's definitely
what our author has done

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.240
with his project today.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.450
So, we're excited to talk
about that project shortly.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.540 position:56%
At the Center for the Book, we
promote reading and literacy, books,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.000
and libraries, poetry, and
literature, and we do so to promote

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.280
and sustain informed,
and engaged societies,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.940
knowing that they're the
best defenders of democracy.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.620
And we hold that as our mission,
and have talks like these

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.740 position:56%
for the purpose of engaging one
another and sharing ideas and points

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.350
of views that may be ones that
we don't always have access to.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.610
So, we like to have the
opportunity for unique

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.910
and interesting discussions
and access

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.140
to diverse knowledge and research.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.370
And we have that with
today's author as well.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.960
Our mission at the Center for the
Book is carried out nationwide.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.350
We have a Center for the Book
in every state, including the --

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.790
and, the District of Columbia
and the Virgin Islands.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.620
And we also administer the Library
of Congress Literacy Awards Program

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.230
which allows us to have a
national and international network

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.880 position:56%
of partners and organizations around
the world, who are promoting reading

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.960
and literacy in very
innovative and interesting ways,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.040
which helps us fulfill
on what we're here to do

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.570
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.730
Just quick housekeeping
before we get started.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.850
If you'd take a moment to
make sure your devices are

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.590
on silent or vibrate.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.330 position:56%
And that is in part so that it isn't
distraction for our speaker today,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.070
but also, we are recording
today's event, so the webcast is --

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.570
will be available online, and you
can visit our webcasts at Read.gov.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.560
Please also know that
if during the Q

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.420
and A portion you are asking
questions, you are recorded

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.190
and part of our recording.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.990
So, please know that.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.260
And then finally, one item
to mention as we begin,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.170
the author will make
a presentation today.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.150
As I mentioned, there'll
be an opportunity

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.290
for question and answer after that.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.550
And then his book is available for
signing out in the lobby at the end

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.990
of our hour talk this afternoon.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.390 position:56%
So, the chief criteria for the Books
and Beyond Series is that the books

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.620 position:56%
that we share about here, are
either about the Library of Congress

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.500
or published by the Library of
Congress, or researched here

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.800
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.950
And using our collections,
most of them maps in the book

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.410
that we'll learn about today, are
from the library's collections.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.170 position:56%
And today's author has published the
book in partnership with the Library

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.910
of Congress publishing office.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.300
So, we're very excited
about the project.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.280
And here is Stephen Hornsby.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.130
He's the Director of the
Canadian-American Center,

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.440
and a professor of
geography in Canadian studies

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.100
at the University of Maine.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.900
He's the author and
coeditor of several books,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.470
including the prize winning
historical "Atlas of Maine."

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.620
So, his new book, "Picturing
America," and I have it,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.090
"The Golden Age of Pictorial Maps"
which is lavishly illustrated

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.150
and available as I
mentioned for sale out front.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.800
And the note I saw on
it, that there were more

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.170
than 150 pictorial
jewels in this book.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.090
So, we're very excited to see some
of them in today's presentation.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.510
Please welcome, Stephen Hornsby.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.600
[ Applause ]

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby:
Well, thank you Pam,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.430
for that very kind introduction,
and thank you for all --

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.510
to all of you for coming today,
giving up your lunch break

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.420
to hear something about
pictorial maps,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.410
a passion of mine as you will see.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.070
Before I get started, I
really do want to recognize

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.020
and reiterate what Pam had said
about the central importance

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.320
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.650 position:56%
This project and the resulting
book, simply could not have happened

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.640
without the Library of Congress.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.870
It began with a chance
and fortuitous meeting

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.630
with Ralph Ehrenberg, Chief
of Geography and Map Division.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.050 position:56%
I was just starting the project, met
Ralph, and right from the word "Go,"

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.410
he was supportive and put me in
touch with the publishing office,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.430
with Peggy Wagner [phonetic] -
delighted to see her here today -

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.560
who was -- I'm sure, those
of you who know Peggy,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.680
will know that she's extremely
enthusiastic and she really ran

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.680
with this project and gave me all
the support that I could wish for.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.980
And Susan Rayburn [phonetic],

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.060
also of the publishing
office was a delight to work

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.030
with during the copy
editing of the manuscript,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.000
and helping in other ways as well.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.600
Pam mentioned that this is a
co-publication with the University

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.460 position:56%
of Chicago Press, and I want to
recognize also Mary Lauer [phonetic]

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.810 position:56%
who was the editor I worked with and
it was a very pleasant experience.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.650
In fact, for an author, this
project went remarkably smoothly

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.950
and quickly.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.700
So, hence the big grin on my face.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.150
It's been a joy to put together.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.750
Well, like many things in life, the
origins of this project and book,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.700
really go back to my childhood as
so many things do in one's life.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.740
And when I was very young, I
spent about a year with my family

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.060
in the Island of Ceylon,
now Sri Lanka,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.870
and my mother who was a teacher,

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.920
had this map by the English
graphic artist MacDonald Gill

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.290
and she I think, used
it in classrooms.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.140
Hence, its rather battered
appearance.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.620
And the map kicked around our
house for many years and it's now

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.970
in my collection of pictorial maps.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.890
And I think it was this map
that really sparked my interest.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.860 position:56%
And I should say that many pictorial
maps were created for children

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.510
in an educational role, as
we shall see in a minute.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.940
And this map with the
elephants, the galleons, the sun,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.070
the jungle, sparked my imagination.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.530
But we grow up, of course,
and I went off to school

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.920
and was interested in geography.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.270
And went through the
English school system,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.500
and then a university in Scotland.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.350
And it was quite clear
that if you were going

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.490
to be a professional
geographer, one could not take

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.500
such maps as this seriously.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.170
What one had to focus on was
a scientific map, in England,

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.990
the ordinate survey one
inch to one-mile map.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.270
Here in the United States, it
would be the USGS topographic quad

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.000
which may be familiar to you.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.480
Of course, the younger members
of the audience know nothing

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.790
about such paper maps, because they
find all their cartography off the

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.470
internet, particularly Google Maps.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.660
But in the old days, when
we looked at paper maps,

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.030
it would be the USGS quads here

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.710
and the ordinate survey
topo maps in the UK.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:48.250
And it was not until
much later in my career,

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.290 position:56%
when I was involved co-editing and
contributing to the historical atlas

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.120
of Maine, which has been mentioned,
that I began to think again

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.520
about the use of pictorial
imagery in cartography.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:11.600
The atlas is in many ways, a
standard cartographic production,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.350
presenting information
in a very objective way,

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.680
which can get a bit tedious, map
after map of sort of bar graphs

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.860
and pie charts and so forth,
and proportional circles.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.810
And so, I try to leaven
the graphic imagery

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.900
by bringing in pictorial elements.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.430
On one of the maps that we did
this was on Portland, Maine --

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.160
the land use of Portland, Maine.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.300
I'm not going to get into the sort
of triangle that you can see here,

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.950
but just draw your attention
to the images of buildings

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.560
around the central graphic.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.880
These were from a map published
I think in the 1840s or 1850.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:00.000
And we had them digitally removed
and scattered around on this map

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.870
to try and give a sort of
three-dimensional sense

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.680
to the Portland landscape.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.820 position:56%
And then almost, one of the last
maps I was working on for the atlas,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.080
was tourism and thought
about tourist maps.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.290
And these are often pictorial.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.340 position:56%
And so, we've got two examples here.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:25.530
One on the right is a gas
map from I think the 1940s.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.770
The one on the left is an artistic
map that was produced a series

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.220
of state maps, in fact
for the country.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.980
And it was while bringing
these maps --

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.540
researching these maps and
putting them in the atlas,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.530
that got me interested
in graphic presentation,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.170
and the way different types
of information are presented.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.250
USGS and ordinate survey maps
do certain things very well,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.230
but other things they don't do.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.760
And pictorial maps are excellent
at presenting perhaps softer,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:10.340 position:56%
more cultural features, such as
landscape, history, memory, emotion.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.570
Many pictorial maps are great fun.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.010
They have humor in them.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:21.780
They show pride of place or pride
of state or pride of region,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.930
and they also show that rather
nebulous sense of place,

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.840
which is often talked about,
particularly in literature and art.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.580
And it's that cultural sense
of particular places and states

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.790
and regions that I think
pictorial maps present so well.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.380 position:56%
And these kind of cultural elements,

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:47.190
just were not being captured
in the USGS topo maps.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.720
So, I began to think about this
and particularly having worked

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.760
so closely on this atlas
for more than a decade,

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.370
about how we convey information,

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.820
pictorial graphic information,
to the reader.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.110
And once the atlas was finished,

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.720
I was somewhat intellectually
exhausted and thought,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.650 position:56%
"I really need to do something fun."

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:17.030
And it seemed that pictorial maps
was an obvious outlet and a sort

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.270
of recreational project almost.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.050
And when I started to look into
it, I realized that you know,

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.770
scholars had looked at it.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.100
It had simply not been
treated seriously at all.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.170
There were maybe one article I
think, or one of two articles

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.850
about the genre of pictorial maps.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.210
So, I thought, this is excellent.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.230
There's a big gap here
in the literature

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.360
and our cartographic knowledge.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.890
I'm going to explore the topic.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:49.620
And that led me of course here
to the Library of Congress.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:55.040
Now, pictorial images are
maps, and not a phenomenon

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.170
of 20th Century American.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:03.450
They go right back to Medieval Map
of Mundi and through the Great Age

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.030
of Dutch Cartography as shown here.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.050 position:56%
This map by Lynn Showton
[phonetic], and you can see galleons

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.730
and various beasts
I think in Africa,

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:17.130
and the very elaborate
toniquolin [phonetic] and cartouche

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.510 position:56%
with the inset of the islands below.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:28.590
So, not a new phenomenon, but the
pictorial elements start to drop

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.730
out through the 18th Century
with the enlightenment

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:37.550
and a push towards a more
scientific type of cartography.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.570
There is a revival, particularly
here in the United States,

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.230
in the late 19th Century
and early 20th century,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.170
with the rise of bird's eye views.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.400
And the United States was
really a great producer

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.030
of bird's eye views
of towns and cities.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.950
And here we have a map from
the early the early 1920s,

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:02.800 position:56%
which is a bird's eye view of Fresno
County amid California's Garden

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.080
of the Sun, which is
called a pictorial map.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.280
And I think you can start to see
a bit of a shift from that sort

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:16.180
of classic, bird's eye, into a
more consciously pictorial map.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.650
And you can see around the
borders, these various photographs

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:28.540
and artistic renderings of
the Sierras and Yosemite.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:35.970
Perhaps the greatest influence
on the genre, actually comes

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:42.300 position:56%
from the UK, and it's the map on the
left, again done by MacDonald Gill.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.320 position:56%
It's the Wonderground map of London.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.700
It was produced in 1914
for the London Underground.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.790
Frank Pick, a very
innovative general manager

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.940
of the London Underground,
wanted to publicize the system,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.690
and hired various artists
to produce maps

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:07.250
and among them was MacDonald Gill,
who produced this spectacular map

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.410
that was put up in
Underground railway stations,

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.760
and then was produced for retail

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.620
to the general public,
it was so popular.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.090
So, this is 1914, the beginnings

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.420
of the First World War,
at least in Europe.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:29.200
And it must have come across to the
United States in the late teens,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.310
early twenties, because
the map on the right is

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:35.830
by two American commercial
artists, Olsen and Blake,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.440
who were based in Boston.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.270
And this is a map of Boston,
published by Houghton Mifflin,

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:45.910
again a Boston publishing
firm, a very famous firm.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.210
And it shows Boston.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.890 position:56%
And I think by pairing them, you can
see that really the direct influence

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.870
from MacDonald Gill, across the
Atlantic to this map of Boston

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.310
and the way the map is created,

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:02.020
I think the yellow roads
is a dead giveaway.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.150
Blake and Olsen denied,
or said they had not,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.200
looked at other artistic maps,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.370
but I think they must have
known MacDonald Gill maps.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:16.190
And certainly, Gill's map is being
retailed over here by the 1930s.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.730
I found advertisements
for Gill's map.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.980
But I suspect copies were
circulating here earlier.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.230
So, that is an influence.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.650
Bird's eye views are an influence.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.220
And then 1925 is the
Great Exposition in Paris

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.890
that becomes known as art deco.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.760
And art deco comes across the
Atlantic, to the United States,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.790
and really influences everything
from jewelry to skyscrapers.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.720
Think of the great
Manhattan skyscrapers,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.980
many of them art deco
pieces of architecture.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.060
And it comes into the graphic arts.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:58.740
This is just a publicity folder for
Reno, trying to intercept tourists

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.870
on the way to San Francisco,
and the Pageant

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.400
of the Pacific Exhibition
there on Treasure Island.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.440
And it has the various art
deco motifs which I'm sure many

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.480
of you are familiar with.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.830
The United States in the 20s, we
think of it as the Roaring 20s.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.970
The country is booming.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.960
Companies have -- are
flush with income.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.940 position:56%
They have large advertising budgets.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.230
They can hire innovative commercial
artists to sell products as,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.160
I think you can see in
this illustration here.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.960
And so, everything is
really set for an explosion

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.760
of genre of pictorial maps.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.000
A great interest in
graphics and advertising.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.070
And from really 1926, we start

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:54.350
to see just a massive
outpouring of pictorial maps.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.550
There's one or two,
1925, a bit earlier,

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:02.870
but really 1926 is the key year,
just after that Paris exhibition,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.820
and a number of the exhibits
from Paris were brought over

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.520
and exhibited in major museums
here in the United States.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:15.940
So, avant-garde commercial artists,
could go to, say, the Boston Museum

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.030
of Fine Arts, and see the
latest work coming out of Paris,

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:26.540
and could use it for their
own work here in the states.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.840
This is really a genre
pushed by commercial artists.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.950
We're not dealing with the Great
American Artist at the 20s and 30s.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:42.360
I think Rockwell Kent did a
few commissions of estates

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.320
in a pictorial map genre,
but almost overwhelmingly,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.360
these maps were produced by
commercial artists such as here,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.840
George Annand in his
studio, in his apartment,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.990
in Manhattan, in the 1930s.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:05.240 position:56%
He's just actually got a
commission and he's smoking a cigar.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.080
I had the great pleasure of meeting
his daughter who's now in her 80s.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.280
She lives in Brookline,
Mass., and she could tell me

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.000
about this picture and
the context for it.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.110
In fact, supplied me
with the photograph.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:21.890
And I love it because he's at
his drafting desk and he was a --

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.020
perhaps a very typical commercial
artist who did pictorial maps.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:32.170 position:56%
He did commissions of -- for wealthy
New Yorkers, of their estates there

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.830
on Long Island and in Connecticut.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.800
But he was also working
with major companies

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.950
like Nabisco to advertise products.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:48.340
And I think that's a more general
point, is that many of the artists

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.190
who produced pictorial maps,
are turning their hands

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.830
to many types of product.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.300
Book jackets, book
illustrations, etcetera, etcetera.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:00.180 position:56%
In fact, George Annand may well have
produced the first pictorial map

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.480
as a book jacket.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.750
This is the period where we're
shifting from embossed book --

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.070
book covers, to the
paper wraparound jacket.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.370
And so, that's gives
opportunity to people like Annand

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.280
to produce colorful book jackets.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:26.870
Th major American map publishers
gets involved in pushing these maps

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:32.880 position:56%
and commissioning maps, selling
maps, and hear is Hagstrom's catalog

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.160
of what they call Decorative
and Historical Maps.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.460
But you can see, two pictorial
maps are framed in this room.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.140
This is basically showing how
you can use pictorial maps

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.520
to decorate your house.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:55.130
So, by the late 20s, 30s, into
the 50s, the major map producers,

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.840
map publishers in the United
States, are behind the genre.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.310
I should say that the United
States is really the leader

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.200
in pictorial map production,

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.560
although I've mentioned
MacDonald Gill.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:15.400
He was almost a lone artist in the
UK, producing this type of map.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.900
Produced superb maps, but
really, he's one of a kind.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.170
And it's here in the United States

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.860
that we see the explosion
of the genre.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.310
And perhaps that's not surprising
given the prosperity of the US

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:34.790
in the 20s, and even the 30s
and then post-Second World War.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:40.310
And the great attention
to advertising.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:44.140
And of course, the importance
of American popular culture.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.760
These maps are a form of
American popular culture.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.340 position:56%
And I think because of that, they're
not being treated very seriously

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.780 position:56%
until perhaps I got going with them.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.250
Maybe they still won't be
treated seriously, who knows?

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.550
I've not had any scullery
reviews of the book yet,

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.370
but they haven't been
treated seriously.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:13.100
And I think that perhaps reflects
their embodiment of an aspect

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.270
of American popular culture, but
as I think, we all are aware,

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.870
American popular culture just takes
over much of the western world.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.720
From the 20s onwards,
think of Hollywood

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.380
and as we shall see, Disney.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.920 position:56%
And it is still very dominant today.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:36.120
So, I think no surprise to find
this genre so well developed here

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.700 position:56%
in the U.S. Now, I've mentioned that
these maps were not taken seriously

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.320
by the academics and scholars.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.440
I certainly never came across
some in my geographical training.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.770 position:56%
And it's really thanks to these two
women about whom I know very little.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.260
Ethel Fair on the left.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.020
Muriel Parry on the right.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:03.800
And these two ladies, both
librarians, collected maps -

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.310
these pictorial maps - when they
were really I think, unfashionable.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.100
Ethel Fair, remarkably was
collecting back in the 30s.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.130
She actually has an article in
the Wilson Journal for Librarians

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.330
from the 1930s, about
her collection.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.050
So, even then, it was recognized

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.050
that she put together an
extraordinary collection

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.350
of these maps.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.220
Muriel Parry is more
Second World War, post-war.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.280 position:56%
You see her here in the map library
of the American Geographical Society

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:37.020
when it was headquartered at that
time in the 1940s, in Manhattan.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.080
And then she later
worked as a map librarian

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.190
in the State Department
here in Washington.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:49.870
And these two women, for
whatever reason, become interested

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.550
in the genre, they collect
them, and then they donate them

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.420
to the Library of Congress.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.950
And it was Ralph Ehrenberg who told
me about these two collections.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.810
I think in total, about 2,000 maps.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:07.710
And in a mad three days, I
went through those 2,000 maps,

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.210
looking at what they'd collected.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.610
And they really have, not only
a representative collection,

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.590
but many of the great
stars of the genre.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.920
And most of the maps are
in immaculate condition

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.690
because they were buying them
as they were being published.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.230
For those of us, like myself,
who try to pick up some

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:30.410
of these maps today, they're
often in a rather battered state.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.630
So, the collections we've
got down in the Geography

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:38.620 position:56%
and Map Division here in the Madison
Building, in outstanding quality.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.940
So, these two collections
formed the basis of the book,

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.000
at least 90% I think of
the maps in the book,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.010
are based on the Fair
and Parry collections.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.720
As you well know, the Library of
Congress is a copywrite library,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.430
however many of these maps,

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:58.090
because they were ephemera
essentially, were not copywrited.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:03.460 position:56%
And so, the Library of Congress does
not have a comprehensive collection

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.460
of pictorial maps.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.040
Certainly, the Fair and Parry
collections are outstanding.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.940
But the Library of Congress,
unlike perhaps books,

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.960
does not have everything
that was published.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.920
And so, I looked elsewhere,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.760
the American Geographical
Society Library in Milwaukee,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.340
the Los Angeles Public Library,
the Boston Public Library,

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.430
the Newberry Library in Chicago,
and found a few maps that,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:35.620
and don't appear to be in the
LOC collection, but as I say,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.560
the foundation of the
research was here

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.260 position:56%
in the Geography and Map Collection.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.760
And I'm most grateful that
these two women put these

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.060
collections together.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:50.370
Another point to make here is that
women play a very important role

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:54.620
as creators, as graphic
designers in this genre.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.570
And I'll mention one or two
women as I go through examples.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:03.660
And that's perhaps not surprising,
given we're talking about the 20s,

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:10.920 position:56%
30s, 40s, even into the 50s, where a
traditional employment for women was

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.990
as teachers and as librarians.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.710
And so, they would be interested
in communication and educating,

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.030
particularly to children.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:25.290
And so, naturally I think, they
found the pictorial map format

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:31.830
of great interest and become
creators of pictorial maps.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:36.610
Well, as I say, there were 2,000
maps in the two collections

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.450
and many more maps
I found elsewhere.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.430
And so, the challenge was to
create some kind of order.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:47.290
So, I essentially created five
categories which I'm going to go

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:52.400 position:56%
through rapidly, to give you a sense
of the breadth and the creativity

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.360
and the vitality of the
pictorial map genre.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.930
I've mentioned Disney
and Disney, Walt Disney,

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.960
gets into the genre very early
with this Mickey Mouse map

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.710
of the United States that was
produced as a map that was folded

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:13.770
up in a pencil case, that was
distributed to school children

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.070
across the United States.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.610
So, you can imagine the
millions of boxes of pencils

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:23.750
with this map rolled up and what
an extraordinary way to get Mickey

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.700
and Goofy and Donald
into children's minds.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.420
They didn't even need
to see the cartoons.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.630
They could just see
it on a pictorial map.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.370
And this is just the beginnings
of Disney's involvement.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.080
So, this is what I
call "Maps to Amuse."

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.450
So, this is one example.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:47.640
The Lindgren Family of
Spokane, Washington State,

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:55.080
during The Depression, decided to
create smiles on people's faces

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.740
and also perhaps make a bit of
money, by creating pictorial maps

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.900
of western national parks.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.200
They were very successful.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.150
There's an example here of
Yellowstone and Jackson Hole,

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.380
and after the end of
the Second World War,

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.000
they got into the decal
market and produced --

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.590
I think they became the leading
decal manufacturer and producer.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.370
And so, we've got a decal

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.330
on the right showing
the simplification

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.350
of the map on the left.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.790
And so, if you were a tourist to
one of those great national parks,

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.060
you could pick up a decal and
put it in your car window.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:34.040
And that of course was very
popular for many decades,

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.720
and perhaps collect
these decals as well.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:42.410
And then, the phenomenon
of the brag map.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:46.030
You've perhaps all seen that
famous New Yorker cover of the view

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.010
from Manhattan and
how the world kind

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:53.650
of just falls away beyond
Manhattan Island and the center

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.170
of the universe is Manhattan.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.510
And so, showing a very
narrow view perhaps

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.800
or perspective of average
New Yorker.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.600
Well that type of map, is not
just confined to New York City,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.900
but is found across the country

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:17.610
and the usual suspects here is
the Texan view and I hardly need

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.670
to say anything about it, except
Texas, as you can see protrudes

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.580
into Canada which according

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.710
to my geographical
training is not the case.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:32.450
So, we get this brag maps, being
produced to boost particular states

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:38.070 position:56%
or cities, Los Angeles, and
Florida, New York, involved in this.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:43.950
So, the various types of maps
to amuse, to create a chuckle

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.160
or put a smile on someone's face.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:52.240 position:56%
Then there's a second category which
are maps with a didactic function.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.770
Maps to educate.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:59.900
And here is a publicity blurb
for picture history maps

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.690
from the Graphic History
Association based in New York.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.600
And notice, designed by
Elizabeth Shirtcliff [phonetic].

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.540
She produced several
wonderful pictorial maps,

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.300
but I found almost nothing
about Elizabeth Shirtcliff.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.780
I wish perhaps the family
might still have an archive.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.410
One of the challenges of
this work was not only --

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.040
it was one thing to find the maps.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.400
The second thing was to find
the archives about the artists.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.940
I had some strokes of good fortune,
but then there are other artists

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.480
such as Shirtcliff, I could
find very little about.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.330
But she was interested
in producing maps

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.650
to educate particularly children.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.490
And so, we get this kind
of map being produced.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:48.300
This is by actually an English
ex-patriot, Ernest Clegg,

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.120
who came to the United States after
the end of the First World War.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.960
He was a military officer.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.600
And his maps are distinguished
by a very fine calligraphy.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.840
And this is a map produced
or published

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.480
by Washington's National Cathedral
in honor of an anniversary

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.900
of George Washington, and it's --

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.590
if you look at, a very
splendidly designed map.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.080
But clearly, this is
not a map to amuse.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.890
This is a map to educate
about George Washington.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:23.940
And there are a number of maps of
American presidents and great men

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.600
and women as well,
that are produced.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:34.050
A map produced by another
woman, Emma Bourne, in 1940.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:38.570
America: A Nation of One
People from Many Countries,

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:45.110
published by the Council
Against Intolerance in America.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:50.380
This map, I am fortunate to have
a copy of this map, and it was put

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.690
on an exhibit at the Osher
Map Library at the University

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:54.290
of Southern Maine, in Portland.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.650
And I was told by the
curator that this was one

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.830
of the most popular maps in the
exhibition because of course,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.270
it resonates so much with
our present situation.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:08.410
So, a map in 1940,
campaigning against any type

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.710
of intolerance here
in the United States.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:15.810
So, clearly again, a map with a
very serious, didactic purpose.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:25.390 position:56%
And a third example, is I think one
of the great literary maps produced.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:28.540
This was produced by
Edward Everett-Henry

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.520
for a printing company
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.590
This is a map that has had a
certain amount of publicity

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.990
through the Library of
Congress's exhibition

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:42.190
and book a few years
ago, about literary maps.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.760
So, this is reasonably well-known,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.410
and of course it's showing
the voyage of the Pequod

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.910
in Hermann Melville's "Moby Dick,"

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:55.100
and I just love the way
Everett-Henry merges the sort

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.430
of two dimensions of the map form.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.460
So, we have the outline of the
South Atlantic and Indian Ocean

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.170
into the Pacific, as
well as the sort

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:09.160 position:56%
of more three-dimensional imagery of
the voyage and the people involved.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.970
So, a very powerful map and there's
a number of these that he produced

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:17.270
in the late 1950s, early 1960s.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.600
Then there are maps,
a third category

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.710
of places and regions and states.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.850
And indeed, of countries as well.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.910
And this is by a Cleveland
artist, Arthur Suki [phonetic],

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.210
of Miami and Miami Beach.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.420
Clearly, it's all about
sun, down there.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:42.180 position:56%
This was a map produced as a
publicity piece by the Miami Herald.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.560
It's I think quite rare
to find and this copy is

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.210
from the Library of Congress.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.540
And you get that art deco sense
of the radiant sun that he's put

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.050
in the bottom right
corner, illuminating

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.660
and warming up the scene.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.370
This is a map I particularly enjoy.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:08.700
And then out on the west coast,
a map by Michael Baltekal Goodman

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:14.950
who was at Berkeley and
this is again, a 1930's map,

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.920
showing Berkeley and Oakland
and San Francisco Bay,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:23.040
and I think you can see the
various art deco tropes.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.880
The sort of chevron
waves, the electric winds.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:32.070
We often have the winds
from the four quarters shown

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.570
on Medieval maps, often
get replicated

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.220
on pictorial maps of
the 20th Century.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.000
And you can see in the top left
that a rather electric wind there,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.810
with the sort of zig zags.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:49.450
And then there's a leaping antelope
among the vegetation back here,

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.180
which is straight out
of French art deco.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.760
So, a wonderfully art deco piece.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.300
This was actually on my first
day, looking at the Fair

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.480
and Parry collections, I had looked
at oh, probably 7 or 800 maps.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.780
I was exhausted.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.340
It was getting towards closing time
at 5 o'clock, and the last folder

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.890
for the day was brought out.

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:13.370 position:56%
And the very last map, was this one.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.750
And I thought, "My goodness.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.770
This is the highlight of the day.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.570
The best has been saved for last."

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.750
There's a large piece,
very colorful.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.360 position:56%
Makes a tremendous impact to see it.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.940
And I urge you to see these
as objects in themselves,

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.380
rather than digital imagery on
the web or in this presentation,

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.580
because there is a certain
physicality and visceral reaction

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.590
to them when you see
them as objects.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:46.850
And then this one by Vernon
Farrow, a glorious bird's eye view

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:52.950
of Manhattan, 1926,
capturing the roaring 20s.

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:58.060
And finally, in terms of pride of
place, a number of universities,

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.740
Harvard, Cornell, and
in this case Chicago,

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.730
produced maps for their alums,
celebrating their campuses.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.040
So, this is the University
of Chicago campus --

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.450
a particularly colorful campus map.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.870
Then industry got into the act,
so another category is maps

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.860 position:56%
for industry, and industry wants to
advertise its services and products.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:25.900 position:56%
So, here we have the Alaska Shipping
Company selling its passenger

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.730
sailings up to Alaska from Seattle.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:33.420
Notice the cartoon
strip at the bottom.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.800
Again, a very cartoony map
done by Joe Schull [phonetic],

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.030
a western artist for
Great Northern Railway,

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:45.910
advertising the Great Northern
service to Glacier National Park.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:50.260
I love the bears confronting
the tourists

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.610
in the [inaudible] back there.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.280
The airlines got involved
in the act.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.560
So, this is Pan-Am, the
great international airline,

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.110
advertising its first
routes to Latin America.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.400
And again, we've got
humor here with the birds

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.340
on the equatorial line there.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.860
And there's lots of humor

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.840
in this particular piece
by Thompson [phonetic].

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.860
And then a final map for
industry is very much industrial.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.930
This is a map done to
celebrate the opening

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.830
of the Cleveland Terminal
Building in 1929.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.890
Some of you may know
it, if you're from Ohio.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.360
And essentially, the story is,
"We've created this skyscraper,"

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.740
I believe at the time the
tallest outside of New York.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.920
"Come and do your business
in Cleveland.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.220
We are the center of
the industrial Midwest."

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:45.360
And area we hear a lot about
today, the so-called Rust Belt.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.970
But here, it's in all its glory
with the steam locomotives,

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:53.280
electric trains, the automobiles,
the Great Lakes freighters,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.660
all focusing in on Cleveland.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.780
So, it's a wonderful sort of
advertisement for this new,

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.340
office complex in downtown
Cleveland.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.430
Then we come to the
Second World War.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:13.940
So, this is my fourth category,
and we have maps for war.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.890
This is actually before
Pearl Harbor.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:20.940 position:56%
The United States feels secure
behind its airplanes and battleships

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.030
and so forth, but I want
to draw your attention

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:27.610
to this very standard
Mercator map here that is used.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:32.990
But we're at the -- on the
verge of the so-called Air Age,

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:34.780
which is going to change
cartography.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.170
As you can see here, classic
Air Age map, as if we're looking

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.900
from outer space, or at
least from an airplane,

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.990
looking down on the globe.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.700
This is a map by Howard
Burke [phonetic],

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.030
I think for the San
Francisco Examiner.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.330
He also did work for the
Los Angeles newspapers.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.080
And you got a very different sense

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.830
of how the world is
shown cartographically.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.220
We moved away from the
Mercator projection,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.250
and we've got these
pictorial elements in it.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:07.700
And then I think the sort of the
grand finale are the maps produced

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:14.610
by the federal government,
the U.S. Navy in particular,

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.390
the Bureau of Naval Personnel.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.390
When I was here, I was down in the
Navy yard, difficult to get into,

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:27.760
but to try and look at the archival
papers behind the production

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.060
of these maps.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:33.420
And I think you can see that it's
really an extraordinary image.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.980
And there was six of
these produced for the --

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.320
covering the American
war effort, globally.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:46.030
And this really powerful image
of, coming across the Atlantic

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.770
and engaging with Nazi
Germany and many types

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:51.310
of pictorial element here.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.610
And I think you can see sort

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:57.320 position:56%
of Madison Avenue advertising behind
this almost sort of cinematic image.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.680
And we know that George Annand was
working for the federal government

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.470 position:56%
as other commercial artists, to
produce this kind of imagery as part

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:10.380
of the propaganda effort
by the United States.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.470
So, a splendid wartime image.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:16.700
And then my final category -- oh,
I'd like just to contrast this

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:22.230
to MacDonald Gill's map,
celebrating the Atlantic Charter,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.790 position:56%
the signing of the Atlantic Charter,
between Roosevelt and Churchill.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:31.890 position:56%
And this map gets published in 1944,
the same date as the previous map.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:35.460
And I think you can see
that Gill is still working

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.810
with Mercator projection, really
a 19th Century image of empire --

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.620
British Empire of sea lanes
and shipping and so forth.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:48.380
And the U.S. has moved into the Air
Age here with a very different way,

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:52.820
a very slick way of
presenting the world.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.420
The final category of the maps

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.780
for the post-war period is
[inaudible] a catch-all.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.640
Essentially, the genre's running
out of steam by the 1960s,

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.930
although there is still wonderful
pictorial maps being produced

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.230
to the present.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:10.100
But this is the last flourish,
and here is an example

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:15.000
of an Air Age map using the polar
projection now which used again

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.790
by another woman, Sally DeLong
[phonetic] for a western airline.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:24.060
Again, I think this is 1944, and
you can see these strange beasts

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.990
on the map that hark
back to Medieval maps.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:33.170
Oil is of course essential to the
booming American economy of the 50s

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:37.090
and 60s, and so here General
Drafting is producing a map,

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.850
a pictorial map, of oil in America.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:43.580
Just a -- probably a
freebie fold-out map,

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.780
you could get at gas stations.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:50.450
The tourist agencies in various
states were getting involved.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:56.380
So, here we're out in California,
pushing the Southland --

00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:00.150
the Los Angeles area to tourists.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:03.720
A map produced from
the 50s into the 60s.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:10.510
Disney is thinking about Disneyland
out in Southern California,

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.700
and to get the financial backing
from the New York bankers,

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.690
he creates this pictorial
map, shown with --

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:20.620
to give the bankers an idea of
what it's going to look like.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.740
So, the power of the
pictorial image.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:29.120
And then, a succession of pictorial
maps are produced for Disneyland.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.660
This is by Sam McKim
[phonetic] who was one

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.170
of his great graphic artists.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:38.160
Was tremendous team of
artistic talent working not just

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.700
on the cartoons and the films,
but producing these maps.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.070
So, Disneyland, the connection

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:48.550
to popular culture, I
think it's all here.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:54.780
And them, Time Life is
also -- gets in on the act.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.130
Dominant American news publisher.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:00.500
And so, we've got the
launch of Sputnik

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:06.170
and Cold War tension being
shown in this map by R.M. Chapin

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.040 position:56%
who was the Time Life staff
cartographer during the Second World

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:13.170
War, and then into
the 50s and early 60s.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:18.880
And this is just showing the
beginnings of that Cold War tension

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.720
and the emerging space race.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.460
And my final map, to sort
of summarize the genre,

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:31.280
comes out in 1969 and commemorates
the landing on the moon.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.450
And there are many
fun elements here,

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:38.120
but notice the presidents
there of Kennedy, Johnson,

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:43.670
and Nixon, flying on the eagle.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:48.000
This map was actually
produced for Merrill Lynch.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.670
I wondered when they gave the
commission to this graphic artist,

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.310
whether they knew what
they were getting.

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:57.700
But it's a very humorous
take on the moon landing.

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.680
And in a sense, picks
up on that sort

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.900
of 60's counterculture at the time.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.200
This is a bit subversive.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:11.420
So, in a sense, getting back to map
as -- to amuse a mapper's humor.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:16.930
By this point, the genre
is pretty well over.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:23.400
And we're not getting the
output that we did in the 20s

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.590
and 30s, even in the 40s.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:31.000
But still to this day, there are
graphic artists producing pictorial

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.730
maps and -- of cities.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:39.450 position:56%
I was just down in Charleston, South
Carolina last week and produced --

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.470
found a wonderful pictorial
map produced

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:45.840
by a not local architectural
firm of the Historic District.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.990
So, it must have been hours
of work to put it together.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:55.060
So, there are still very creative
people producing this kind of map

00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:00.510
for the general public, and
seems to be still alive and well.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:02.510
Thank you.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.790
[ Applause ]

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.790
Very happy to take some questions.

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:12.310
Yes?

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:17.000
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that most of the
pictorial maps were not copywrited,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.250
and I was curious if you could
tell us a little bit more about --

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.510
if you know why that
would be the case?

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:23.810
Given that they were
commercial [inaudible],

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.110
one might expect them
to be [inaudible].

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:28.710
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: Yes,
there was a fee involved.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:33.810
And I've looked at some
of the paperwork on this,

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.030
and two copies had to be sent
to the Library of Congress,

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.790
along with a processing fee.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:42.580 position:56%
And I imagine that a number of these
publications were just so ephemeral

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.600
and were given out as freebies

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:49.260 position:56%
that the artist just didn't think it
was worth paying the processing fee.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.310
And so, they're not in the
Library of Congress collection.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.460
I think it's -- that's the reason.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.760
Yes?

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.780
&gt;&gt; Thank you for a wonderful talk.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:02.990
Most of these maps seem in a
way to be unachievable today.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:10.990
They represent degrees of artistry
that are not valued or [inaudible].

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:13.650
Are there any practitioners
now that you know

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.330
of who are doing [inaudible]?

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: I can't
tell you off the top of my head,

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:21.210
but I think there are some
very creative artists at work.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:27.090
In fact, I've just reviewed a
book by a Boston based artist.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.830
I did the review for Margot
Mundy, and he goes through step

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.470
by step, the artistic process.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.300
And I'm sorry, I'm embarrassed

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.730
to say I can't remember the
artist's name but he talks

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:40.900
about all the types of
commercial work he does

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.740
for university campuses,
for business campuses,

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:49.320 position:56%
anyone who needs some sort of
pictorial guide to where things are.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.670
You can imagine, it could
be done here the Hill area,

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.790
the location of the
different buildings.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:59.970
It would be a wonderful way of
showing Washington, and in fact,

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:04.250 position:56%
in the 20s and 30s, there were maps,
and indeed into the 40s and 50s,

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.620
there were pictorial maps done
of D.C., of the mall area.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:13.510 position:56%
It was just a natural for a creative
artist to show the great landmarks.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:19.520 position:56%
And in fact, Olsen and Blake who did
the map of Boston, did three maps

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.910
for Houghton Mifflin and their
third map was of Washington D.C.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.930
that a copy was presented
to the White House

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:30.460
and Calvin Coolidge
replied very graciously

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.170
or at least his staffer did.

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:35.310
And fortunately, the Houghton
Mifflin archives are in one

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:36.610
of the Harvard libraries.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:39.140
And so, you can see all
of this correspondence.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.050
But I think there are
still very creative people

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:44.810
who are producing these
maps, but not in the quantity

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.980
that we saw in the 20s and 30s.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.700
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: Yes?

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.040
&gt;&gt; Are you going to see any on
Antiques Roadshow that are --

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.490
you know, can you think
about a collectible--

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:55.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: Yes.

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:59.300
&gt;&gt; -realm that you've maybe got
your own or [inaudible] for maybe?

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: Yes,
that's a great question.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:05.850
Probably the greatest
private collection is

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.710
that of David Rumsey
[phonetic] out in San Francisco.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.060
He's really given much of his
collection to Stanford now.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.930
And he -- after I'd really done
this book, he started to collect,

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:21.290
and within the space of just a
few years, got at least 2,000 maps

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:24.440
which he then had scanned, are
on the David Rumsey map site

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.040
which is really a go-to
place to go, to see maps.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.100
So, Rumsey got involved.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:38.670
There are other serious collectors
and there are a few map dealers

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:41.980
that are specializing in the genre.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.690
I was actually giving a
presentation on these maps

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:48.620
at the Miami International Map
Fair back in February of this year,

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:52.080
and the comment was, "No
one's really interested

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.530
in the old maps anymore.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.430
Everybody wants the 20th
Century pictorials."

00:47:56.430 --> 00:48:01.840
And so, the dealers are moving
into it, and cultivating a market.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.320
And there are now collectors who
are putting together collections.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:14.080
So, it is a very exciting,
vibrant area of collection.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.980
&gt;&gt; Is there one out there that
you know people are looking for?

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.860
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: I mean the
Farrow map of Manhattan from 1926,

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.100
is now going for several
thousand dollars.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.310
There's a map of Peiping [phonetic]
as it was then called Peking,

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.570
and I think because
of the Chinese market,

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.130
that's going for 4 or $5,000.

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:38.750
We're still not into the kind
of prices you'd get for a --

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:41.070
maybe a very fine 17th Century map.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:46.930 position:56%
I don't collect those type of maps,
but the prices are certainly rising,

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:50.230
which is reflecting the market.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:56.720 position:56%
I actually put together a reasonable
collection as a research collection,

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.350
because there wasn't a library.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.900
Being up in Maine, I couldn't
get down to the Library

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:05.050
of Congress every week to
look at the collections.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:11.890 position:56%
So, I purchased some maps for my own
research and I'm glad I did it four

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:13.760
or five years ago, and not now.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:19.140
So, yes, it is a growing
area of collection.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.440
Yes?

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.060
&gt;&gt; And what criteria do you
use to distinguish between--

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: Great.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.930
&gt;&gt; -art and just placemats
that we see [inaudible].

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:29.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: Great question.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.560
Yes, yes. I resisted
putting a placemat in,

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.300
but maybe I should have done.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:40.090
What I wanted to do with the
book, was to give the, in a sense,

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:46.780
the greatest highlights, as well
as a representation of the variety

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.460
and diversity of the genre.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:54.110
So, there are maps in the book
that are relatively easy to find.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:58.830
Maps produced by the oil companies,
for example, or by Disney.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:02.260
These are maps that some of you may
well have kicking around at home.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.680
So, they've got very
little intrinsic value

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.950
but they are producing and
showing a pictorial image

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:11.010
of the earth's surface.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:14.790
But I also wanted to show the
maps such as the Vernon Farrow map

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:17.110
of Manhattan, which
are really quite rare

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:21.830
and are splendid examples
of artistic endeavor.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:25.830
It must have taken hours
of work to have created

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:30.760
that three-dimensional image of
the skyscrapers of Manhattan.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.200
So, that's what I wanted to do.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.780
Show the -- some of the great maps
that are particularly in the Fair

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.660
and Parry collections, as well
as the everyday type of map

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.600
that you'd have in
your car or back home.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.810
So, that was the kind of criteria.

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:51.410
A lot of it of course, I was
dealing with 2,000 maps in the Fair

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:54.620
and Parry, and clearly,
I had to make a selection

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.770
and that inevitably comes
down to one's eye and interest

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:01.770
and what you learn about
these maps over time.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.990
And you appreciate them
the more research you do.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.340
You start to realize,
"Oh, this is a key map."

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:09.910
So, for example, the map
of Boston I showed you

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:13.740
that Houghton Mifflin produced,
that's about as early --

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:18.460
I mean there was one of New York
in 1925, but the one of Boston,

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:22.220
published by Houghton Mifflin,
is really almost the first map.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.520
So, that has to kind of go in.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.100
And you've got to talk about
the Houghton Mifflin maps

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.710
and there's a number
of them in the book.

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.650
And then other publishers as well.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.690
So, there are things you've
got to sort of sort out

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.450
and make part of the narrative.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.640
&gt;&gt; So, you really feel that
that copied Gill and so that--

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:38.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: Yes.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:40.240
&gt;&gt; -was really the beginning?

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.600
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: You
can see how clearly.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.730
I mean, they're not just making
this up out of their heads.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:47.990
They've looked at that
Gill Wonderground map.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.370
But what happens is that,
although Gill might be an impetus,

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:54.730
there are many other influences
coming in, such as art deco.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:58.030
I wouldn't say that Gill -- I mean
there are some art deco elements

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:01.300
in later Gill maps, but I
mean, it just takes off here

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.400
in the United States and
creates its own momentum.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.730
And they don't need -- these
commercial artists don't need

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:10.680
to look to the U.K.
or to a French artist.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.090
It becomes an American genre.

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:16.540
And this is something I
argue strongly in the book,

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:21.300
that this is a phenomenon
of American popular culture.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.760
And the greatest achievements
I think,

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.060
are done here in the United States.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.560
Yes?

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:34.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Have you done any similar
research in the Asian pictorial maps

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.640
or any comparison of them?

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Hornsby: Yes,
that's a great question.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:42.300
And there are certainly maps
coming up out of Japan for example.

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:46.200
I am not an Asian specialist.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:51.520
So, and I wanted to keep this
restricted to the United States.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.790
But there certainly are
a woodblock maps coming

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:57.920
out of Japan that I'm aware of.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:04.110
And particularly associated with
the 1930s and the Second World War.

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:07.680
Interestingly, Muriel
Parry as I mentioned,

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.810
was a librarian at
the State Department.

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:12.500
And she was posted
overseas, in fact, to Japan,

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.560
after the end of the
Second World War.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.170
And what distinguishes
her collection

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.940
from Ethel Fair's collection --

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.680
Ethel Fair's collection
is primarily,

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.120
almost entirely American maps,
is that Muriel Parry collected

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:29.090
across the globe, so there's
maps from every continent,

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:31.020
perhaps except Antarctica.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:36.410
But maps from Africa,
Australasia, South Asia, etcetera,

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.000
Latin America, South America.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.190 position:56%
And so, I got a sense looking at her
maps, probably about 900 of them,

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.460
of what other countries
were producing.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:51.790
And I think if there was sort of a
great group of maps, say from Japan

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:55.480
or China, she would probably
have got her hands on them.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:59.450
And I think there are some
Japanese maps in the collection.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:01.780
And so, it was the sort
of the looking at her --

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:05.690
the diversity of her collection
that I began to realize

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:10.110
that in fact the United States
was a leader in this genre.

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:15.350
Okay. Thank you.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:21.970
[ Applause ]

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:25.630
