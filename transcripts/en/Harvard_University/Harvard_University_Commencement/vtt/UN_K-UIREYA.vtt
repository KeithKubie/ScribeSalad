00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.099
hello everyone

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.099
my name is Matthew deSilva and I'm a
marshall for the class of two thousand

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.959
twelve

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:22.959
And my name is francisco Miscliki and i'm
the representative from Winthrop House.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.940
With a diverse range of comedic
talents

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.880
our guest speaker has established
himself as a captivating and hilarious

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.859
entertainer

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.040
do his work and filled and television

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.030
most notably as a cast member in
Saturday Night Live

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.310
for the past seven years

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.420
several films featuring our guest speaker have titles representing the
perhaps idols representing some of the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.940
emotions we feel

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.750
as our time at harvard comes to a close

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.630
parents, for example, will be proudly
repeating the name of his upcoming film

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.820
"That's My Boy" as they watch us receive our
diplomas

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.370
No phrase captures the nostalgia and bromance
we have developed for friends

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.369
and block mates

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.990
like his two thousand nine film "I Love You, Man".

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.390
and some of you in the recent weeks have
articulated the name of his two thousand

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.410
and eleven film "What's Your Number"

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.860
either out of genuine need more romantic
desperation

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.300
you know, come to think of it

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.320
our guest speaker's Emmy- award-winning
SNL digital shorts  kind of parallels the class of two

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.060
thousand twelve's senior week events very
closely

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.260
Well, we had the moonlight cruise... Our guest
speaker had

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.860
"I'm on a Boat".

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.600
than we had "Last Chance Dance"... he had

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.770
"I Just Had Sex"

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.970
and finally we had Senior SoirÃ©e...

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.210
"I Just Had Sex".

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.650
clearly, our guest speaker understands
what it's like to be a Harvard student.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.130
So without further ado,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.070
our two thousand twelve Class Day guest
speaker

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.070
Andy Samberg!

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.539
Wait.... sorry, sorry, sorry

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:47.049
Stop the music, sorry

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.109
What happened there?

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:58.109
That song is just so emotional... I just met that guy!

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.180
alright...

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.609
I have to compose myself- the show must go on here...uh...

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.139
*clears throat*

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.159
students

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.859
faculty

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.589
parents

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.799
grandparents

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.109
Uncles that weren't invited but showed up
anyway

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:25.949
handsome young janitors who are secretly
math geniuses

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.929
and the homeless guy from with honors

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:33.719
my name is Andy Samberg and i was
honored to be here today as I am

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.599
unqualified.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.729
There's a storied history of incredible Class Day speakers here:

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.429
Nobel Prize laureate Mother Teresa

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.109
Former US president Bill Clinton

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.689
and now me

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.769
The fake rap wiener songs guy.

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:55.879
I'm also just

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.759
over the moon to be receiving an
honorary degree here today... I mean,

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:01.769
never

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.279
in my wildest

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.359
dreams, did I... what's that? ...No degree?

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:09.799
So what... I'm just like,

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.649
a professor, or...

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:15.669
Oh- nothing.

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.049
Then why am I here?

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.899
Dean Hammonds,

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:30.300
You've lied to me!

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.419
Alright, then, uh, this crappy speech then...

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.379
I flew my folks in...

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.669
Here we go.

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.689
Class of Two Thousand and Twelve

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.960
You are graduating from college

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.960
that means this is the first day of the
last day of your life... no, that's wrong.

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.150
this

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.749
is the last day of the first day

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:04.180
of school... nope, that's worse. 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.229
Uh....

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.479
This is a day.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.870
You know, I

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.409
too turned to Webster's Dictionary and uh,

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.229
it defined Harvard as

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:26.389
this season for gathering crops

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.189
And admittedly that's actually the definition of "harvest"

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:34.999
but it was the closest word I could find
to Harvard that wasn't a proper noun.

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:37.930
And in the end isn't that what Harvard is really about, though:

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.340
planting the seeds of knowledge that
eventually produce

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.270
crops-A.K.A, money.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.149
in order to this satisfy the farmers...
your parents

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:50.669
who pay, like,

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.979
forty five thousand crops a year

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.659
to send you harvest

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.280
Just so you could major in women's
agriculture

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.509
You see what i'm doing.

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.409
Before I move on, uh, the world outside of
harvard has asked me to make a quick

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:10.759
announcement

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:15.139
the following majors are apparently useless
after tomorrow

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.389
history,

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:17.699
literature,

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.879
all things related to art,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.439
social studies, east asian studies,

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:26.919
pretty much anything that ends with "studies".

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.019
uh... romance languages and uh...

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.999
finally

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:34.889
folklore and mythology? *laughs*

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.219
Come on, guys.

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:42.400
Just study something useful and play World of Warcraft in your free time, okay?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.199
Anyhow, all those majors now useless

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:49.100
unless you can somehow turn them into an
iPhone app.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.869
uh... math and science majors, you guys
are poor.

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:59.869
Finally,

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:05.039
But 2012 is a great time to be
graduating from college

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.499
Sure, the job market's a little slow

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.619
Sure, our health care and social
security systems are going to evaporate in

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:12.069
five years

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.179
Sure, you'll have to work till you're 80 to
support your 110 year old

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:19.409
parents who will live forever because of
nanotechnology

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.599
Sure, the concept of love will soon
disappear, leaving us all lonly robots

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.779
ready to kill our best friend for a
lukewarm cup of microchip soup,

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:32.059
but that doesn't matter, because tomorrow,
you graduate from harvest...Harvard... from

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:33.809
Harvard

00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:36.389
is where you will graduate

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.219
Now, I'm sure a lot of you are looking up here and thinking,

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:40.939
what makes this guy so special

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:42.469
you know, was he accomplished

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:44.520
He didn't even go to Harvard!

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.869
Well to you, I say this:

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:52.719
I didn't even apply to Harvard,

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:57.959
because I knew I wouldn't get in!

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:00.259
Boom, suck on that! I didn't accept you,

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:04.009
esteemed college, I'd break up first.

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:08.149
I move on and you see me with my hot new girlfriend and she's riding shotgun in my

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:11.389
convertible Sebring.

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:15.379
That's right, it's the one Harvard was begging me to rent when we went up the coast, and I'm just laughing

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:17.020
and looking really fit, like,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.569
"Has he been hitting the gym?" Nope.

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:25.179
I've just been eating right and making positive
choices.

00:08:25.179 --> 00:08:29.159
Man, I really wanted that honorary degree!

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:31.340
Well, I guess the old saying is true

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:38.340
"Never trust Dean Hammonds!"

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.229
Regardless,

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:44.850
Harvard remains iconic in our culture

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.230
one thing that sticks out of my mind is
the central role this campus played in

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.780
one of the most important films ever
made about

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.860
social connections and how we
communicate

00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:00.110
i'm referring of course to 1986 whimsical blackface romp, "Soul Man".

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.900
starring C. Thomas Howell as a white
student posing as an African-American in

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.630
order to exploit affirmative action.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.870
He was at Harvard Law that movie,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:14.750
and that movie exists.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.080
Now, most of you don't know this yet,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.100
but Harvard is one of the few schools
you can attend that can also eventually

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.120
become your workplace nickname.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.120
"Whose edamame is this in the break room?" "Probably Harvard's". 

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.590
"Whose Vespa's in my parking spot?" uh, "I'm going with Harvard's!"

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.200
In fact, once you graduate, you can never
wear your Harvard sweatshirt in public

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.450
again without looking like a world-class
a-hole.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.810
I honestly think the Coop should sell University of Michigan T-shirts that

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:46.860
you can wear

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.640
just to blend in once you're out of here.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.209
And to clarify, when I say "The Coop", I mean your campus bookstore,

00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:56.839
and not famous film actor Bradley Cooper

00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:59.630
whom i also referred to as the Coop,

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:05.960
And who also sells books and sweatshirts in his free time.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.050
Speaking of fame, Harvard has many famous
alumni

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.450
Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.230
just a few ex-students that started
successful businesses after dropping out

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.130
which means it here in this crowd today and
graduating

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.190
you're destined to be a massive failure.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.900
Sorry, those are just the facts.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.460
Also a fact,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:33.640
Class Day is a terrible name for a day
when you don't have to go to class,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.130
like, ever again.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.330
It's pretty much like calling New Year's Eve sobriety night.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:47.330
"Hey, you going out for Sobriety Night?" "Yeah, it's gonna suck."

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.570
And now on a more literary note,

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.180
I'd like to read a poem

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.730
by the great W. B. Yeats

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.480
which is actually pronounced, "Yeets".

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.670
A lot of people don't know that.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.330
thanks for the heads up, Barney Frank.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.590
anyways

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.810
This is a truly beautiful and poignant
passage

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.590
from the 1929 collection, "The Winding Stair and Other Poems".

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:16.590
and I think it's especially applicable
to today's ceremonies. It goes like this:

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.320
*sings* "This is how we do it!" 

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.080
*audience laughs*

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.360
*sings* "This is how we do it!"

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:37.360
"It's Friday night and I feel all right"

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.320
"Hit the shore, 'cause I'm faded"

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.230
"Honeys in the streets say, yo, Mama, yeah, we made it!"

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.300
There's more, but you get it... classic Yeats.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.070
An important poet.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:00.550
*Clears throat*. Well, now, I am truly excited to be here today to be honest.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.300
At 33 years of age I haven't endured or lived that much more than you

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.660
guys so

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.560
in order to give you a broader scope of
what's to come,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.450
I reached out and asked for some words of
wisdom from some people that I thought

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.100
were relevant to your experience here

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.450
uh... the aforementioned Mark Zuckerberg

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.820
who as a Harvard student was kind
enough to send me some remarks

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.860
that i will relate to you now

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.240
Uh, hey, guys. It's me, Mark.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.280
Or, as my friend Kofi Annan calls me, Zuckleberry Finn *affected laughter*

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.810
He thought of that.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.810
I just wanted to give a big congrats to you all, but really, more of a

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.450
congrats to me.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.090
You know, since I left, things have gone so good, you guys.
solely because

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.600
like, a six-year-olds fantasy of the future
good.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.610
uh... in fact, I recently completed the Harvard trifecta. 

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.670
Start your own company, have a movie made about you, and marry an Asian doctor.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.390
Trifecta!

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.010
So everyone out there, be sure to upgrade to Timeline, and lay off the Pinocchio's Pizza. *affected laughter*

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:08.670
I went to Harvard!

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.720
That's what he had to say.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.310
Uh... I also, 

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.170
as for the local experience asked

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:20.580
massachusetts native Mark Wahlberg to
send over some thoughts for you guys

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.930
and uh... here is what he had to say.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.980
uh...

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.910
*breathy voice* "Hey Harvard, how's it goin'"?

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.000
So you guys are graduating, huh? I think that's great!

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.490
Hey, we should do a film together, what do you think?

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.810
You guys are super smart, right?

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.200
Okay, just think about it.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.030
Say hi to your mother for me, alright?

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.430
He asked me to say that to you guys.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.550
And then finally

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:58.080
I asked blockbuster superstar Nick
Cage for some remarks

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.590
i realized he didn't go to Harvard and
he's not from Boston

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.550
But he has a special connection in this case that I'll let him explain.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.770
Here's what he wrote.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.500
uh...

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.020
Good afternoon.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.250
As I write to you I am currently digging a tunnel

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.920
into the bowels of the Widener Library

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.850
When I finally breach it's mighty walls

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.010
I will steal the legendary Gutenberg Bible

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.190
And return it to its rightful owner.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.030
Steve Gutenberg.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.120
you know, I've seen some weird stuff in
my day

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.230
In Istanbul, I saw a  small child swallow
a pelican whole.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.140
In the Sahara Desert I saw a herd of oxen

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:48.210
fly into a portal and disappear from
our world forever.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.430
But no matter what I've seen there's
one thing I've held to be true.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.230
Love is the most powerful force this universe has to offer.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.380
And we should show kindness to all around us.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:06.380
With the exception of Dean Hammonds, who is a filthy liar!

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.540
And that my friends

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.300
is the true meaning of Hanukkah.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.940
I'd love to keep writing,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.480
But now the time has come for me to ride on to my next adventure.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.900
What's that, you ask?

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.210
Simple.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:29.140
I'm going to have sex with the statue of John Harvard.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.590
and those

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:37.590
are my three impressions!

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.000
Thank you, you guys... Late night television

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.950
led me straight here.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.060
Now we've been praying a lot of
attention to the students here today,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.140
but I want to take a moment and
acknowledge all the parents. In

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.380
particular

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:58.380
I want to give a shout out to all the
moms in the house. Give it up. Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:01.830
Your moms...

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.310
Put up with so much and they ask for so little.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.440
And as I look out at all the beautiful mothers here today,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.600
I can't help but be filled with an
overwhelming sense

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.180
of horniness.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.630
Oh yes.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.830
You're a fine crop indeed.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.940
And I likes me some

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.790
older ladies

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.250
They know how to do stuff, if you know what I mean.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.880
So to all the moms,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.310
An invitation.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:40.480
Nobody goes to know about it.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.350
Now before all you dads out there get upset,

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.130
No disrespect, really, and

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.820
you've got to be something special to get
such fine ladies on your arms. In fact,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.690
as I look at all these strong loyal men

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.640
I can't help but be filled with an overwhelming sense...

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:03.770
of horniness. Oh yes.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.670
I see a lot of silver foxes out there
today.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.480
And Harvard ain't cheap where my sugar daddy's at.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.900
Yeah, I see you. You don't have to raise your hands.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.520
Open invitation gentlemen.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:25.520
Nobody gots to know.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.020
And now I'd like to get a little serious.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.590
As you move forward in the world there
will be obstacles

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.930
but every challenge

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.090
is a chance for success

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.490
You know, I'm sorry. I had a whole
inspirational section is prepared, but it

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.530
just feels phony now so

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.760
I'm gonna scrap

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.760
These scripted words and just speak to you guys from the heart.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.740
Yeah, this stuff is much more from the heart.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.440
Look, the things I'm about to say to you aren't to make any friends.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.260
And they're not for some cheap applause,
okay...

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.669
it's real talk

00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:15.850
when it comes from my soul so listen up

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:22.850
Yale sucks balls. Am I right? Cheer if I'm right! Uh, they're the worst!

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.940
Yale asked me to do their class day speech but couldn't make it to the stage because 

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.210
I kept slipping in all their drool.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:42.020
So it's a second tier safety school in the worst city in America.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.660
Guys, I'm kidding. New Haven's nicer now. 

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.470
Than Rwanda!

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.370
Little known fact about Yale:

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:55.180
It was built on top of an ancient Native American toilet.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.670
I mean, it's no wonder they're called the bulldogs. They're a bunch of bigheaded, inbreds

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.260
with breathing problems.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.820
and that comes with my apologies to any
inbreds here. Don't let anyone

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.050
compare you to a Yalie.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.340
And look, this all might sound harsh,

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.980
but in truth, Yale is basically a
sewer filled with mole people.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.930
Only replace the word "people" with stinky, dried up dog turds 

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.110
and puppies

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.190
and that's my heart stuff you guys

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.000
from my soul

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.610
For some of you it may have been tough to hear, but I felt it was my duty to give it to you straight.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.880
Also, quick confession: I know literally nothing about Yale.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.860
But I will say this...

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:45.860
Dartmouth can burn in hell!

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.860
Ah, Class Day.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.100
You know, it's hard to know where life will take you from here

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.420
what adventures you'll have

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.990
which sitcoms you'll write for

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:02.549
but my advice to you is simple:

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:04.039
Relax, dude! You just finished college

00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:05.480
at Harvard.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.530
you worked so hard

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.650
Trust me, you're gonna kill it.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:14.030
I went to Santa Cruz and then I
transferred to film school

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.460
and I'm rich!

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.910
And I don't mean spiritually rich or any hippie crap like that.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.310
I'm talking about racks on racks.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:28.059
believe it.

00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:31.710
I'm being a little hyperbolic to seem cool, but I am up against Mother Teresa

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.250
on this thing okay

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.090
Have you guys YouTubed her Class Day Speech? She was, like, crumping and

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.080
throwing back some money into the crowd...

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.700
I'm gonna take some liberties.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.570
In the days ahead a lot of people will
tell you to trust your instincts

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.660
And don't be afraid to take chances

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.100
and I am definitely one of those people

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.240
but i would also say this

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.800
don't rush into the next phase of your
life

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.260
whether it's

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.630
grad school at Harvard or it's

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.250
grad school at MIT or

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:08.260
massively disappointing your parents with an art made out of garbage thing...

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.420
Whatever it is you try,

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.929
Make sure it's what you really want to do.

00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:15.799
because the only person who knows what
that is

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:17.930
is you

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.450
and if all else fails just remember
these beautiful words from the film, "Dead Poet's Society".

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:28.450
"Neil! My Neil is dead! My boy!"

00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:40.490
which now that I have said out loud

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:45.410
did not quite drive home my point as
much as I had hoped

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.090
In fact I'm realizing that only like
seven percent of what I've said today

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.300
has been at all helpful

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.649
or even passable as english

00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:58.770
but in the end i feel I'm only truly
qualified to give you three simple tips

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.740
on how to succeed in life

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.279
one

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:09.279
cut a hole in a box

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:15.970
put your junk in said box

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.480
make her or him

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.570
open the box

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:21.890
and that's

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.660
the way you do it

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:32.059
Also, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but Dean Hammonds, I forgive you, 

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.810
bygones be bygones

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.100
already got that sweet degree from Santa
Cruz and

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.809
film school anyway so thank you graduates!

00:22:40.809 --> 00:22:43.649
Godspeed and congratulations. Play the Yeats!
