Hello. I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics. Today I'm gonna talk

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.930
a little bit about the media. Specifically,
the way the media interacts with the government

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.269
itself, and more specifically, the way the
government regulates the media. Some of you

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.890
might be saying, "Craig, get real, the government
doesn't regulate the media. We live in a free-market

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.539
capitalist society and the only real regulation
on what gets published or broadcast is determined

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.419
by consumers, Craig."
Right Clone: Right on.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.409
Craig: Except that there are things you can't
say on television or print in a newspaper

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.659
either because they're harmful or untrue,
and there are a number of government agencies

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.080
that exist to place limits on the media and
to make sure that we have access to information.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.960
Left Clone: Right on!
Craig: Don't you mean left on? [laughs]

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.880
But wait, so you guys both agree then?
Clones: No.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.620
Craig: Oh, I guess I misunderstood.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.440
[Theme Music]

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.340
Let's start our discussion of government regulation
of the media with a little review. The oldest

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.160
form of media in the US is print, so you might
think that it has been the most regulated,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.810
but you'll remember from our episode on the
freedom of the press that this isn't really

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.920
the case because of the pesky first amendment.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.170
The freedom of the press was written into
the Bill of Rights because the framers wisely

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.860
recognized that without a free press, Americans
would be less able to have the information

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.930
they needed to make good political decisions,
which they do all the time. They also make

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.010
bad political decisions, too.
They just make a lot of decisions.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.380
So there are very few government regulations
on what can and can't appear in the newspaper.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.100
Near v. Minnesota basically said that there
could be no censorship in the form of prior restraint.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.300
In New York Times v. US, the Pentagon Papers
case made it difficult for the government to use

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.820
national security as an excuse to prevent publication
of sensitive, or in that case, embarrassing material.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.420
There are still libel laws that allow individuals
to sue newspapers and magazines when they

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.560
print something that they don't like. But
as far as public figures are concerned, the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.190
Supreme Court's decision in New York Times
v. Sullivan makes it pretty hard to censor

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.340
the press by suing for libel. So I can say anything
I want about public figures. Public figures are dumb.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.119
In order to win this type of lawsuit, the
plaintiff must show that the article, or advertisement,

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.330
was both untrue and published with actual
malice or reckless disregard for the truth,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.490
which is a very, very high bar. What this
means in practice is that the first amendment

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.229
pretty much protects print media from government
regulation. Although as we saw in the last

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.080
episode, the number of Americans getting their
information from print is shrinking. So maybe

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.149
the markets are doing the regulation after
all. Although I don't think people are buying

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.300
fewer newspapers as a way of regulating their
content. They probably just don't want the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.280
papers cluttering up their house and they
don't wanna get that ink on their hands, you

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.800
know, the black ink the rubs off.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.300
The government is taking a larger role in
TV and radio, possibly because it reaches

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.480
the largest numbers. Broadcast media is the most
tightly regulated among the information sources.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.380
The first and probably least transparent way
that the government regulates broadcast media

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.020
is through control of the airwaves, which
is done through licensing. Broadcast spectrum

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.599
is a limited resource and is technically owned
by the public, so if you want to broadcast,

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.720
you need to purchase a license from the federal
government. This gives you the right to operate

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.390
your television or radio station under certain
well-defined conditions. These licenses must

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.930
be renewed every five years and they almost
always are. The licenses are granted and most

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.880
of the government regulation of broadcasters
is managed by the Federal Communications Commission,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.720
the FCC. It was founded in 1934 to oversee
a chaotic radio industry and it soon expanded

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.420
to include television. As part of its mission,
the FCC required that in order for a station

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.700
to be granted a license, it had to show that
it was operating in the public interest. In

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.090
terms of politics, this meant that the FCC
has come up with some rules regarding what

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.360
gets broadcast. Every channel has to have
a CSI.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.590
The first rule, dating back to 1949, is called
the Fairness Doctrine. This requires broadcasters

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.660
to give equal time to each side of a public
issue. So if a station airs a program criticizing

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.319
a war, say the one in Vietnam or the one in
Iraq, it has to air another program of equal

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.780
length that supports the war. What this meant
in practice was that stations shied away from

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.400
controversial programming, even though the
Fairness Doctrine was never rigidly enforced.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.000
The lack of enforcement and generally
non-controversial nature of commercial broadcasting

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.480
didn't stop Ronald Reagan's administration from
pushing for the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1983.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.680
Congress voted to reinstate it in 1987
when Democrats took control, but Reagan said

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.720
"uh-uh," and he vetoed the legislation. As a result,
the Fairness Doctrine is pretty much dead.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.280
Other rules related to the Fairness Doctrine
are the Equal Time Rule, which requires that

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.970
broadcasters not discriminate in selling time
to political candidates, and the Right of

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.140
Rebuttal, which ensures a political candidate
will have the opportunity to respond to a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.440
personal attack if it gets aired. These rules do
not apply to eagles, however. Yeah, you stay down.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.680
There's another important FCC rule that
deals with media ownership, but I'm gonna

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.360
talk about that later because the FCC didn't
tell me I can't.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.920
The FCC also regulates what can be broadcast,
but these rules doesn't relate to politics

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.780
so much as obscenity, indecency, or profanity
showing up on radio or television.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.760
Sometimes these FCC rulings and fines become
Supreme Court cases as people raise concerns

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.270
about whether they deny our precious, precious
free speech. One of the most famous cases

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.740
in this area, FCC v. Pacifica Broadcasting,
dealt with comedian George Carlin's Seven

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.100
Words routine, which I will not be repeating because
Crash Course is a family-friendly educational channel.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.420
This case established that it's okay for the FCC to
require that certain language and images not be

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.300
broadcast during family times,
which is before 10 PM.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.100
The FCC also hands out fines for f-bombs and
wardrobe malfunctions to keep us safe and virtuous.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.220
I should point out here that these FCC rules
only apply to broadcast media and not most

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.550
basic cable channels, which is why there's
so many naked people in Game of Thrones.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.610
I don't know if that's why there is,
but that's why they can do it.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.460
Congress also tried to regulate broadcasters
by passing legislation, as it tried to do

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.620
with the 1996 Telecommuncations Act. This
act was best known for its failed attempts

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.940
to regulate the internet, but it had other
more interesting effects, too. As with any

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.880
congressional legislation, this act was subject
to Supreme Court judicial review. The court

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.980
did strike down part of the law, Title V, which
was called the Communications Decency Act

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.640
and was meant to regulate online pornography,
because its definition of obscenity was overbroad,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.759
and the court said that it violated the first
amendment.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.970
Speaking of the internet, unlike print and
broadcast media, it's largely self-regulating.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.580
This is possibly because Congress has recognized
that it changes so quickly that most laws

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.000
and regulations will be out of date by the
time they're finally written. But this hasn't

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.650
stopped them from trying. After the court
struck down the Communications Decency Act,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.930
Congress tried again with the Child Online
Protection Act in 1998, and they failed.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.340
This one didn't make it all the way to the Supreme
Court, but lower federal courts enjoined the

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.340
government from enforcing it in 2007.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.800
A more effective way to regulate the internet
has been through lawsuits, especially those

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.180
around intellectual property. As viewers of
our IP series know, this is super complicated,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.620
but basically people can use the courts to
restrict the internet. A good example of this

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.780
was the Napster case, where courts ruled against
the file-sharing company and it was shut down.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.100
It takes individuals, and Metallica, and corporations
to bring these suits, but they use the government

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.680
to shape the internet to meet their interests,
so it can be seen as government regulation.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.160
Speaking of corporations, this is a good place
to bring up a couple of very complicated

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.520
regulatory issues involving the internet,
television and newspapers.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.560
The first one has to do with media ownership.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.590
Part of the 1996 Telecommunications Law, Title
III to be more exact, dealt with the regulation

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.490
of cable television. Actually, it was a deregulation
of the cable industry, allowing for companies

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.430
that own newspapers and radio and television
stations to also own cable companies. This

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.090
kind of cross-ownership was supposed to lower
barriers to entry into the cable business,

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.639
and it was clarified by the 2003 FCC ruling
that allows a single company to own and operate

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.169
the leading newspaper, television and cable
companies in a single market. This has led

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.979
to concerns about monopolization of the media
as more and more companies merge. And it's

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.990
hard to argue that this isn't happening. So
the number of companies that provide media

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.060
content and access has been shrinking precipitously
in the past 30 years, which is probably why

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.180
the FCC and Congress scrutinize media mergers
so closely. Critics point out that these kinds

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.979
of super-mergers can lead to a lack of diversity
in media. This can lead to fewer points of

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.380
view represented in our news coverage and
our stories.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.669
Net neutrality has also been a big issue,
you've probably head about it. The question

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.270
revolves around whether the FCC should pass
rules that allow internet service providers

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.069
to charge differential rates to companies
that use their bandwidth. For example, internet

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:16.960
service providers sometimes sell faster or
better service to large companies like Netflix

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.210
at the expense of smaller competitors or individuals
who don't pay as much.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.009
Thanks, Thought Bubble. The net neutrality
issue is a really complex regulatory question,

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:27.490
but the debate over it, which takes place
in Congress, on television, on the internet,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.669
and even through the FCC's website, where
anyone's allowed to make public comments on

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.430
proposed rules, has been fascinating and it
points out a number of key issues involving

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.819
government regulation of the media.

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:39.410
First, it shows that a lot of media regulation
involves a number of actors. In this case,

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.039
George Clooney. No, no, no, not those kinds
of actors. Private media companies, media

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:47.069
organizations themselves and executive agencies
like the FCC. It also points out that the

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:51.000
overarching regulatory structure is built
by Congress but that the real key actors are the

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.200
regulatory rule makers and enforcers of the executive
branch. And George Clooney. He has aged so well.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.300
Even more important though, are the questions
that lie behind the debate. When we think

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.729
about regulation, what comes to mind is regulation
of content or censorship, but with net neutrality

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:08.930
rules as with FCC cross-ownership rules, what
we're really looking at is regulation of access

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.419
and how much media will be available at a
given price. Those who argue that the internet

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:15.970
should be regulated like a public utility
rather than just another set of corporations

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.210
that take their cues from the market are getting
at something. The media is different from

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.490
other corporate entities because it serves
a public function, something that the framers

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.039
realized when they wrote freedom of the press
into the first amendment. Without a robust

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:30.690
media, Americans may have less access to information
that they need to make smarter political choices.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.690
Of course, all the access we have doesn't
mean that we necessarily will make smarter

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.560
choices, but in this case, being able to hear more
points of view is better than only hearing a few.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.840
That's why we're skeptical of censorship and why many
people wanna keep the internet as open as possible.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.700
