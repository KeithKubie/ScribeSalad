00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.689
We finally figured out what’s been making
a huge greek letters by the north and south

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:04.689
poles.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.180
My money’s on frat guys.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.130
Hey there my shining beacons, Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.570
I’m sure you’ve all heard of the Aurora
Borealis, or if you’re a viewer south of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.340
the equator, the Aurora Australis.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.490
They’re dazzling natural light shows that
happen when charged particles like electrons

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.480
and protons from the solar wind excite oxygen
and nitrogen in our upper atmosphere.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.650
Normally the Aurorae can occur 65-70 degrees
north or south of the equator but they can

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.400
happen at higher latitudes.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.890
Occasionally these take the shape of the greek
letter theta and we had no idea why.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.560
You see, the earth is surrounded by a magnetic
field thanks to its spinning iron core.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.850
These magnetic field lines loop between the
north and south pole and form the magnetosphere.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.739
The magnetosphere deflects the charged particles
of the solar wind, and it’s the reason we

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.900
have an atmosphere while poor little Mars
has had its almost totally stripped away.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.920
But the field lines don’t all connect, and
plasma rides the broken ones down to the ionosphere,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.780
getting faster and more dense.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.650
When it meets our air energizes the gases,
which then radiate that energy away as light.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.030
Normally the plasma that moves to the higher
latitudes cools but sometimes it gets more

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.320
energetic and makes these theta auroras.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.750
Combining data from the European Space Agency’s
Cluster satellites and NASA’s IMAGE satellites,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.640
the mystery of why this cold plasma heats
up and forms this shape has been solved.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.159
As it turns out this plasma gets trapped when
broken field lines close, and it causes them

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.110
to become relatively hot again.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.210
See what you can do when you work together?

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.770
It’s another nifty trick of nature and I
don’t care how good your fireworks are on

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.900
new years, nothing beats charged particles
from 150 million kilometers away traveling

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.470
down a magnetic funnel to make green and red
ribbon light shows in the sky.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.830
If you’re a crazy person like Trace then
you want to shoot rockets at everything.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.540
He explains why the Aurora should be one of
those things over here.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.840
Is there another natural occurrence that boggles
your mind?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.210
Do you want us to look into some other mystery
of nature?

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.910
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
