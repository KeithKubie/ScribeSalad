00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.500
The Curious Case of Alien Hand Syndrome

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.450
Although modern medicine has made tremendous
advances in many areas, even mapping the human

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.079
genome, there remain aspects of human health
that continue to elude our full understanding.

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.480
Alien hand syndrome is one of these puzzles-
with its sufferers having one of their hands,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.330
usually the non-dominant one, acting as if
it has a mind of its own.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.080
Many of us have seen people with this condition,
albeit on the big screen.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.890
In the campy 1935 horror film, Mad Love, deranged
surgeon Peter Lorre replaces a pianist’s

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.789
hands with those of a knife-throwing murderer,
and the hands take over.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.329
More recently and more well known, in Dr.
Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.640
and Love the Bomb(1964), Peter Sellers in
the eponymous role repeatedly and compulsively

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.550
fights to keep his right arm from striking
a Nazi salute.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.229
(In fact, the syndrome is also sometimes called
“Dr. Strangelove Syndrome”.)

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.699
Yet what’s entertaining and even hilarious
in the theater is not nearly so funny in real

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:58.699
life.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.210
Inconveniently and often embarrassingly touching,
pinching and pulling, these alien hands may

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.360
compulsively grasp a breast or stroke a penis
while the person it’s attached to rides

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.920
the subway or waits in line; there are also
potential legal ramifications if the hand

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.320
strays to others in such an inappropriate
fashion.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.330
Described by scientists as a “complex, goal-directed
activity in one hand that is not voluntarily

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.860
initiated,” sufferers from the disorder
are aware of the movement, and they feel what

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.060
the hand feels, but often feel as if they
have no control over it.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.090
Almost always occurring on the non-dominant
side (i.e., if you’re right handed, your

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.540
alien hand would be your left), many patients
with this condition get to the point where

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.950
they refer to the hand as if it is another
person, even giving it a different name.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.300
Frequently, suffers may complain, “I can’t
make it listen to me.”

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.850
Symptoms range from compulsively grasping
and releasing an object to fully self-oppositional

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.530
movements, like stubbing out a cigarette immediately
after the other hand has lit it or unbuttoning

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.670
a shirt as the other hand buttons.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.100
In between the extremes, some suffers can
control the arm with great effort, although

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.620
even then, their movements may be imprecise;
for example, while trying to touch the tip

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.330
of the nose, they touch the shoulder instead.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.240
Extreme cases have occurred where the hand
has attacked, and even tried to strangle with

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.200
a cord, the person to which it’s attached.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.780
The syndrome itself is one of a number of
similar conditions, each thought to be the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.470
product of some type of brain trauma or injury.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.180
The most common, or at least most well documented,
cases of alien hand syndrome involve epileptics

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.330
who have voluntarily undergone a procedure
to separate the left and right hemispheres

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.450
of the brain in an effort to control their
seizures; however, it has been known to occur

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.120
in people who suffered from a brain tumor,
stroke, infection or aneurysm.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.290
There is no known cure for this condition,
though it can usually be controlled somewhat

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.319
by giving the alien hand something to do,
like having it hold a cane while you are in

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.709
public, so the hand stays occupied.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.920
A similar, and likewise bizarre, condition
is known as Body Integrity Identity Disorder

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.200
(BIID), which appears to be purely psychological.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.000
People suffering with this condition also
feel as if one of their limbs is not really

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.730
a part of themselves.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.510
But rather than live with it, they have a
very strong desire to have the offending limb

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.890
amputated.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.700
As psychiatrists describe it, the “motivation
for the preferred body modification is believed

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.510
to be a mismatch between actual and perceived
body schema.”

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.440
Not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV), most

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.630
with this condition receive little to no formal
treatment; rather, many take matters into

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.099
their own hands: For instance, in one case
reported by TheGuardian when the man in question

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.400
“was just out of college, he’d tried to
[amputate his leg] using a tourniquet fashioned

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.450
out of an old sock and strong baling twine…

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.860
After two hours the pain was unbearable, and
fear sapped his will.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.170
The leg was always there as a foreign body,
an imposter, an intrusion.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.360
He spent every waking moment imagining freedom
from the leg.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.880
. . . The leg just wasn’t his.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.129
He began to blame it for keeping him single…”

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.440
Another BIID sufferer had more success when
he shot his leg.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.140
As he said, “I’ve wanted to be one-legged
since I was a child . . . . No one can help

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.040
this overwhelming and irrational wish that
I’ve experienced with varying degrees for

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.750
as long as I can remember.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.030
For the first time in my life, I’m finally
happy.”

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.620
In a 2005 study, it was found that of 52 BIID
sufferers interviewed, 9 had a limb amputated

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.730
and six of those used “methods that put
the subject at risk of death.”

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.720
Perhaps even more disturbingly, three had
been able to find a surgeon willing to amputate

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.580
a healthy limb; in fact, in the 1990s, Dr.
Robert Smith of the Farkirk Royal Infirmary

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.970
in Scotland performed at least two such surgeries
before news of them became public.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.440
Another surgeon, who had lost his license
years before, performed an illegal amputation

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.560
of a healthy limb in Tijuana in 1998, but,
sadly, the patient died of gangrene.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.790
Today, there is apparently a surgeon somewhere
in Asia who, for $6,000, will sneak a BIID

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:03.760
sufferer into his hospital and perform an
emergency amputation while pretending to do

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.700
another surgery.
