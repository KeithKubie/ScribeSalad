1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,600
That's will happen. The Joe
Rogan experience. So you're
there every Wednesday,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,740
every Wednesday night. And that's when
the gym is pretty packed and whizzy nice.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,610
We do a live workout and people come,
you take people through this workout.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,530
Oh yeah. If they, if they
come on Wednesday nights, I've
trained people, you know, I,

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,580
I it, it's on Wednesday nights.
Absolutely free. I'll see. That's known.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,190
You don't make them. I have people
come over on Wednesday nights.

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,610
They trained for absolutely free.
All you gotta do is sign the waiver.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,770
So if you get fucked up, it's on you. You
don't try to assume me in it like that.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,020
But if you come on a Wednesday night
and sign the waiver is absolutely free.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,590
That's amazing. Yeah. I
yell and scream at them.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,260
Let me see to call me a
mother fucking people.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,030
It's so funny. They, my
mother fucking, I'm like,

13
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,680
I've been calling people a motherfucker,
you know,

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,220
since the fifth grade for for nothing
man. He wasn't that weird. Yeah.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,790
And now they want me to
call him a motherfucker. You
know, I'm, I'm on, uh, uh,

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,531
cameo,

17
00:00:55,531 --> 00:01:00,450
cameo and on the cameo they can for
25 bucks out a customer out. Oh,

18
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,240
that's how the APP
application became your app.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,190
And a 25 bucks. I cussed him out
and I'm like, damn, I used to cuss.

20
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:12,330
We probably for nothing.
That's how many [inaudible] do I do?

21
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:16,550
About 10 a day. Really? Yeah.
Wow. I'm out, man. Wish,

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,500
wish my, uh, you know,

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,690
wished me happy fucking birthday ECT and
I wish them happy birthday or whatever

24
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:28,300
the fuck they want. Five bucks, man.
That's very reasonable. Yeah. Yeah.

25
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,340
Used to be more and, and a,
and I said, Nah, fuck it.

26
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,340
And make it cheaper so more people
can afford to do it. I don't mind. Oh,

27
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:35,910
my cousin.
