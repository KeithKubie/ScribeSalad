00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:38.633
Chemical properties: so let's put
something up as a hypothesis.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's say, well, maybe it has to do
with the energy that it takes to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.500
remove electrons.
And, one other thing that I failed

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.000
to point out, if you take a look at
the energies associated with the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.500
outermost electrons,
in this case, lithium,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.000
you see it's 0.5 megajoules per mole,
and then what's the 6.26?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:56.710
That's associated with one,
n equals one, inner shell. There is

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.420
a huge difference between the
energies in the outermost shell and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.140
the inner shells,
which tells you that it's unlikely

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.850
that any electrons except those in
the outermost shell are going to be

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.570
active. The inner electrons are so
tightly bound that they are for all

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.280
intents and purposes,
immobilized when it comes to

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:34.360
reactivity. Again, boron
is a good example.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:22.690
Look, 0.8, 1.36.
This is 2p. This is 2s.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.380
Yeah, they're different but they
are roughly on the order of about 1

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.070
MJ per mole. If you go down to 1s,
it's 20 MJ per mole. So, the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.760
chances of getting any activity from
these inner shell of electrons are

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.460
vanishingly small.
So, let's focus on the outer shell

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.150
electrons. And,
these outer shell electrons are

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.810
termed valence electrons.
So let's construct a model here that

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.450
suggests that chemical reactivity is
somehow related to the electron

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.090
binding energies of the outermost
electrons of the outermost shell.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.720
And, this outermost shell is termed
the valence shell.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.360
So, in a first blush,
you might say, well, why don't we

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:32.186
just take the first
ionization energy?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:28.460
And, that's not a bad first guess.
But, we know for example that

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.930
magnesium, when it reacts,
it reacts with both of its electrons,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.390
not just one of its electrons.
So, taking just the outermost

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.860
electron might give us some false
readings. So,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.330
what if we capture all of the
valence electrons.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.790
Is there some way of handling that?
Because that will take care of all

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.260
of the electrons that are capable of
reacting, none of the inner

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.900
shell electrons.
And we do so by a quantity called

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.720
the average valence electron energy.
In other words, if the average

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.540
energy of all the valence electrons.
So, let's take a look at an example.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.360
An example of that might be,
oh, let's look at something like

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.180
oxygen. If you look at oxygen,
oxygen is 1s2, which is an inner

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:34.760
shell electron.
Just putting it up for completeness.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:29.460
2s2, and 2p4, and so here's the
valence shell.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.920
If I want to take the average
energy of all of those,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.380
what I can do is go over to my data
set. Here's a data set.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.840
There is oxygen. The 2p is 1.
1. The 2s is 3.12. So then, I

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.300
could say that the average valence
electron energy for oxygen would

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.760
then be, I've got two s electrons.
So, it's two times 3.12 plus four

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:19.786
times 1.31, all divided by six.
I'm averaging it over the entire set

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.600
of valence electrons which gives me
1.91 MJ per mole.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.000
Or, in my favorite unit,
19.80 electron volts.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:25.920
This is electron volts per atom.
So, how does average valence

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.840
electron energy very across the
periodic table?

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.760
Let's take a look at that.
So, we see it here. We see that it

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.690
varies monotonically from left to
right as we move along a row.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.610
So, this is a constant n number.
Within a constant shell, it varies

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.530
from left to right,
maximally taking value at the right

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.750
extreme.
And, within a column,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.250
it decreases down a column.
It rises up a row. It decreases

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.750
down the column.
And, the values that it takes can

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.250
be broken into three groups.
Over here in the lower left corner,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.750
we have elements that as a group
have very low values of average

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.250
valence electron energy.
These are elements that are good

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.770
electron donors.
They are good electron donors

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.330
because the electrons aren't tightly
bound. OK, elements with low

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.880
average valence electron energy,
and here I'm saying below 11

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.440
electron volts,
these are good electron donors.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:06:02.813
And, we call these in simple
English, metals.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:56.070
And, it turns out that about 75% of
the periodic table falls into this

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.150
category. So,
the vast majority of elements in the

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.220
periodic table are metals.
And, at the other extreme,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.300
we have elements with very high
value, elements with high average

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.380
valence electron energy.
Well, we just did the calculation

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.460
for oxygen. This is almost 20 eV,
high average valence electron energy,

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.890
greater than 13 electron volts.
So, that means the electrons are

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.690
tightly bound.
So, these are poor electron donors.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.490
And, in fact, if any electron comes
in their midst,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.290
they'll capture it because the
binding energy is so high.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.090
So, these are poor electron donors
but also a good electron acceptors,

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.570
and we call these non-metals.
And you see those.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.710
And then there is this group of
about half a dozen right down the

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.850
diagonal middle.
And, they have intermediate values.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.990
So, when the value of the average
valence electron energy lies between

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.140
11 eV and 13 eV,
we have these elements that are

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.280
neither fish nor fowl,
and you'll see in a little bit their

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.420
unique electrical properties.
And, these are called semi-metals

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.830
or metalloids.
And, in some instances,

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.490
they can be made to behave more
nearly metallic.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.160
And in other cases,
they behave more nearly as

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.830
insulators. So,
now with this framework,

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.490
I said that talking about these
valence electrons might give us some

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.160
insight into chemical reactivity.
What can we say about chemical

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.230
reactivity?
Well, what do we know about extremes

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.690
of chemical reactivity?
See if we can grab onto something.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.150
We know that at one extreme we have
no chemical reactivity.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.610
We have elements that are totally
inert, and we have examples of this,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.070
the noble gases, dominantly inert.
I know it's possible to induce

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.530
chemical reactions,
but these are exceptions.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:34.126
This is not the norm. So,
we have an inertness.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:24.920
And at the other end we have
explosive reaction.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.840
OK, so do we know anything so far
that we can point to that would give

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.760
us a departure?
And the answer is yes,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.690
we know something about the noble
gases. What do we know about the

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.610
noble gases? They are chemically
inert. They have the highest values.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.530
They have the highest average
valence electron energy

00:08:49.530 --> 00:09:07.193
in any shell.
And, the electron configuration is

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
always ns2p6. Whatever the n number
is, with the exception of helium,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
helium is the oddity because there's
only two elements in n equals one

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
shell. But, once you get beyond n
equals one, it's always 2s2,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
2p6, 3s2, 3s6. So, we have an octet
of the electrons that seems to be

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
associated with chemical inertness.
Octet stability is the term applied

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to this feature.
So, all right, let's go with this.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Let's say, suppose we hypothesize
that an octet of the electrons is

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
going to lead to stability.
Is there some place we can go next

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
with this? And I say,
well, let's look at something like

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
sodium. Let's look at sodium.
Sodium has the electronic structure

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s1.
Now, that's not an octet,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but it's not far. This is the
electronic structure of neon.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So it's really sodium you can think
of electronically as neon plus the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
3s1 electron. It's so close.
And, I also know something else

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
about sodium. It's got a very low
average valence electron energy.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Its average valence electron energy
is 5.2 electron volts,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
which is a heck of a lot less than
11.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:28.140
So, this is a good metal.
It's a good electron donor.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.280
So, I've got something that's one
electron away from the electronic

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.420
structure of neon.
It's a good electron donor.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.560
If it could only ditch this
electron, it could have the same

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.710
electronic structure as neon.
But you can't just ditch an

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.850
electron. Charge neutrality won't
allow for it. If you want to lose

00:10:48.850 --> 00:11:08.700
electron, you have to find someplace
for that electron to go.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:57.700
In other words,
for an electron donor to give up its

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.410
electron, the electron donor needs
to have an electron acceptor.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:07.110
So, that's sort of half the story.
Now, let's go over to the other

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.820
side. Let's look at chlorine.
Chlorine is 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.520
3p5. The chlorine, it's not an
octet here. This is five plus two

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.230
is seven. But,
when I went to school,

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.940
seven was only one less than eight.
So, this needs only one more

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.640
electron. If it could gain one more
electron, then chlorine would be

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.850
iso-electronic with argon.
So, it would achieve octet stability.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:41.570
And we know that chlorine is very
aggressive when it comes to

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:47.280
electrons. It's got an average
valence electron energy of about 16

00:11:47.280 --> 00:12:04.426
eV, 16.5 eV, which is a
lot greater than 11.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:57.900
So, what if we were to put the two
of these in the same room?

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.810
You've got an electron donor with a
powerful urge to become neon-like.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:07.720
You've got an electron acceptor
with the powerful urge to become

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.630
argon like. What if we were to take
this electron and send it over to

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.540
here, in other words,
engage in electron transfer.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.900
What will we achieve?
Sodium would become sodium plus.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.720
Chlorine would become chlorine
minus. So, I've got ion pair

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.540
formation, and I've got a huge
decrease in energy because a donor

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:40.360
is able to express that urge,
an acceptor is able to express that

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:46.180
urge. And, I've achieved octet
stability in a new way.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:13:04.093
But there's more because now I've
got pluses and minuses.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:57.090
This is all gas phase.
It's all gas phase. So,

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.180
what happens if I put pluses and
minuses in a gas phase?

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.270
There is a Coulombic force of
attraction. So,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:12.360
the sodium over here and the
chlorine over here,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.450
they will be attracted to one
another. So, let's start.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:22.580
So, sodium, chlorine attaches.
But there's more sodiums.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.740
There's more chlorines. So,
maybe another sodium will attach.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.910
And, this will go on and on and on
without limit.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:38.080
So, what's the consequence of
forming these gas ions?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.240
These gas ions, if you take gas
ions, these gas ions,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.410
if you take gas ions, gas ions of
opposite charge will necessarily

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:54.270
agglomerate without limit.
And, what happens if I put a

00:13:54.270 --> 00:14:00.810
gazillion of these things together?
What's the resulting form? The

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:07.360
resulting form is a solid.
A solid will form. So, if you

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.900
start with sodium vapor and chlorine
gas, electron transfer will occur.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:20.450
And you will form a crystal of
sodium chloride as a result of this

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:37.633
need to form crystal expressed
through the Coulomb's Law.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:30.830
So now, I want to take a look at the
energetics of that.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.660
Let's look at the energetics of
Coulomb's Law.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.490
I want to talk a little bit sort of
at a general level about modeling.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:42.330
How would I model this system?
Well, there's levels of models.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.160
And, the bottom line in modeling is
make it only as complex as you need

00:14:46.160 --> 00:15:06.520
to. Don't put in extra bells and
whistles if it's not necessary.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:56.160
So, for example,
if I have a sodium ion over here,

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.330
and I have a chloride ion over here,
where the distance from center to

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:08.490
center I'm denoting as r,
this is nucleus to nucleus

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:14.660
separation. And let's say that
sodium has a radius,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:20.830
r plus, and chlorine has a radius,
r minus, when r is very large in

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:39.393
comparison to the radii of the ions,
I don't need to draw them this way.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I can model this whole thing as
point charges.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I can model it as point charges.
This is a point that's negative,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and this is the point that's
positive. And,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
that's all we need to do.
And, a lot of the derivations you

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
will see in physics rely on this
being able to model as point charges.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But, what happens when these two
start to get really close together?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
When they start getting close
together, there is more complexity.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:16:01.660
More complexity takes on this form.
So now, let's get a sodium here,

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:08.330
and the chloride ion next to it to
the point where they are touching.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:14.990
So now, I'm going to show some fine
structure. Yeah,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:21.660
this is net positive.
The sodium is net positive.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:27.330
And the chloride is net negative.
And so, there is an attractive force

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.990
between the two of them,
the positive and the negative.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.660
But, let's look more carefully.
Sodium is net positive. But, I've

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.330
got a nucleus with 11 protons in it.
And, I've got ten electrons around

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.990
it. And, here,
I've got 17 protons in the nucleus.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.660
And, I've got 18 electrons around
it. So, when we get really close

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.330
together, granted,
there is a net positive negative

00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:13.526
charge with a Coulombic
force of attraction.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:17:05.400
But, can you see that as you get
really close together the negative

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.800
electronic cloud surrounding the two
ions start to sense one another.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:29.666
And, there is a mutual repulsive
force here. There is a repulsive

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:21.600
force, the attractive force between
ions of opposite charge is offset by

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:39.666
a repulsive force due to electron
cloud interactions.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:32.090
This is the clouds or the orbitals,
electron cloud interactions. And,

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:37.180
this is what prevents them from
collapsing into one another.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:42.270
They reach a certain equilibrium.
So, what we're going to do now is

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:47.360
look at the energetics associated
with that. And that's given as

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.450
follows. I want to plot energy in
the system as a function

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:58.330
of interatomic spacing.
So, the x axis is interatomic

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:04.990
spacing, and the y axis is energy.
Positive energy is repulsive, and

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:11.660
negative energy is attractive.
And, I'm going to put the sodium

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:18.330
atom at the center.
So, here's sodium. And,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:35.126
I'm going to ask what happens when
chlorine comes in.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:29.540
So, we'll put chlorine over here.
So, this is the chloride ion. It's

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.080
over here. And,
we're going to look at what happens

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.630
as the chloride ion moves from
infinity in towards the positive ion.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:43.180
So, let's first go with the
attractive because you know this

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.720
already. The attractive energy is
just the potential energy,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.610
Coulombic potential.
That's simply q1,

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.840
q2 over 4 pi epsilon zero R.
And, q1 is equal to the charge on

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.070
sodium. q2 is the charge on
chlorine. So,

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:08.300
this is positive E on the sodium,
negative E on the chlorine over 4 pi

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:13.530
epsilon zero R,
which is going to give us minus E

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:18.760
squared over 4 pi epsilon zero R.
And, this is just a rectangular

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:36.386
hyperbola, and it's going
to look like this.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:28.660
So, this is the E attractive.
At infinity, there's no stored

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.330
potential energy,
and it drops off more and more

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.990
negative as one over R.
Now, how about this repulsion

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:42.660
between electrons?
This is not a Coulombic force.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.330
It's very different. The repulsive
term goes as some constant lower

00:19:47.330 --> 00:20:06.460
case b divided by R to the n.
N is not the quantum number.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:56.900
N is a power law factor in here.
And, it's given by what is called

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.810
the Born exponent.
And, it's a very high number.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:06.720
Why is it a high number? Because
it has to drop off precipitously.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.630
When you get one over R, you get a
gradual fall. If you get one over R

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.540
squared, it'll be a little steeper.
One over R to the sixth will come

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.770
in, and then jump off precipitously.
And that's what you want because the

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.330
electron repulsion is only felt when
you are in really,

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.880
really close. And then,
it's, for all intents and purposes,

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.440
falls to zero. So, the Born
exponent typically takes values of

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.990
between six and 12.
And, B is some constant that we

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.550
have to determine.
So, what's one over R to the 8th

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.100
going to look like on this scale?
It's going to look like this. It's

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.660
going to hug the x axis until it
gets a very, very close.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.220
And then, it's going to take off
like a shot. So,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.180
this is the repulsive energy term.
And so, what's the net energy?

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.560
The net energy is the sum of the
repulsive and the attractive.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.930
And, see, out at very, very high
separations, it's essentially all

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.300
repulsive, excuse me,
all attractive. And at very,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.680
very low separations, it's all
repulsive. And in between,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.050
it goes through a minimum. And,
this minimum here is what gives us

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:19.430
the value of the inter-electrode
separation, the inter-ion separation.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:23.810
And so, I need to cheat a little
bit on the drawing and make sure

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:28.840
that this minimum occurs right here.
OK, so R minimum,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.530
the minimum separation occurs when
the energy is at its minimum.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:40.230
And, that's given by the balance
between the attractive force of the

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:45.920
ions offset by the repulsive force
in the electronic shells.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.610
And, what we will do next day is we
will look at the consequences of

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:57.300
such an energetic set up,
and rationalize that when ions form,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:14.266
by necessity we must form ionic
crystals.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:22:09.800
So, I think with that I'll shift
over to some external matters.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:16.590
We've seen so far that we can have
a neutral plus neutral sodium plus

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:21.840
chlorine goes to cation plus anion.
That's what we've just been looking

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.520
at. And this occurs in order to
achieve octet stability.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.210
Well, it's possible to reverse this.
It's possible to take the cation

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.890
and anion and restore them to their
neutral states.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.570
So, for example,
in an electrochemical cell,

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.260
it would be possible to take the
sodium ion, give back its electron,

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.940
and convert it into a metallic
sodium, take the chloride ion,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.630
remove its electron, and restore
chlorine gas. So,

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.310
this is what goes on in an
electrolysis cell,

00:22:51.310 --> 00:23:12.020
and it works thanks to input energy
from a power supply shown here.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.500
So, that's point number one.
Point number two is that ionic

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:44.000
solids at high temperatures make
ionic liquids.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.500
So, one such ionic liquid is
magnesium chloride.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.000
Magnesium chloride is the raw
material for the production of

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.500
magnesium. This is magnesium.
It's the lightest of the structural

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.000
metals. It's got a density of about
1.76 at room temperature.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:25.660
For comparison,
aluminum is 2.7.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.330
So, aluminum is about 50% denser
than magnesium.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.990
Steel is 7.87. So,
this is about a quarter of the

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.660
density of steel.
So, if you could make automobiles

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.330
with a high magnesium content,
you would reduce the mass, reduce

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.990
the energy required,
and thereby reduce the environmental

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.660
impact. Clearly,
if I did nothing more,

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.330
but I took every car, doubled its
fuel economy, its emissions would go

00:23:51.330 --> 00:24:11.393
to 50% of what they are now,
no other changes being made.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:58.590
So, fuel economy and environmental
conservancy make a lot of sense if

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.190
you care about such things,
of course. So, here's magnesium.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.790
It's very light. It takes energy,
and this is how it's made.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:09.390
Electrolysis of magnesium chloride
in a cell where the one electrode we

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.990
would make magnesium.
The other electrode, we'd make

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.590
chlorine gas. So,
the question becomes,

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.190
well, what are the resources for
magnesium? Do we have

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:39.846
magnesium to do this?
So, I went to the library and I

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
looked up Advances in Molten Salt
Chemistry volume six because there's

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
an article in there about the
chemistry and electrochemistry of

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
magnesium production.
So, I went to go look up the

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
authoritative source on this,
and so I looked this up, and I want

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
to give you a sense of what the
truth is. People tell you that we

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
are resource constrained,
that we are running out of resources.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:52.130
Well, think about this.
Where are the data? A cubic

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.260
kilometer of seawater,
go into the ocean and imagine a box

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.390
1 km x 1 km x 1 km.
That's a cubic kilometer.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:04.530
It contains an million tons of
magnesium, 1,000,

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.660
00 tons, which is more than has ever
been produced in one year by all the

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.790
magnesium plants in the world.
Annual production of magnesium is

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.930
about 600,000 tons per year.
You get that out of 1 cubic

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:21.380
kilometer of seawater.
And, seawater contains only 3.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.150
% of the total magnesium present in
the Earth's crust.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.920
So, clearly magnesium resources are
ubiquitous and virtually

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.690
inexhaustible.
There's lots of magnesium.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:40.460
So, if magnesium is so abundant,
why is it so expensive? Steel is

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.230
about 10 cents a pound.
Aluminum is about 70 cents a pound.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:26:02.993
And magnesium is over a dollar a
pound.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:54.110
Why is it so expensive?
It's not because of scarcity.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.230
It's expensive because the process
by which we produce it is energy

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.350
intensive and resource intensive.
So, if we want to get more

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:06.460
magnesium into the marketplace at an
affordable price,

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.580
not by government edict,
what do we have to do? We have to

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.700
invent a process,
a chemical extraction process that

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.820
will make the production of
magnesium cheaper so that we will

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.940
have the opportunity to avail
ourselves of energy-efficient

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.250
materials.
And so, maybe somebody in this room

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:31.750
working with me will invent such a
process. All right, I'll

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.950
see you on Friday.
