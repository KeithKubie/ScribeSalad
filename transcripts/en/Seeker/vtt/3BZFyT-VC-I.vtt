00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.840
We humans are soft and squishy, and don’t
like electricity.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.229
Robots are hard and pointy, and they love
it.

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.660
So how do we make a robot that’s soft and
squishy like living things, but still gets

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.349
power?

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.349
Hydrogels of course.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.010
Hard, metal robots are so 20th century.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.010
“Soft-robotics” is hip.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.470
Just like me.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.500
Soft-robotics involves making technology that
is similar to biological material, like we

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.650
often find in nature and within ourselves.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.520
We want things kind of like us; soft, durable,
waterproof.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.660
And hydrogels cover all the bases.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.040
But there’s something still holding soft
robots back from taking over the squishy parts

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.660
of the world ... Batteries.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.800
Except, electricity and water don’t mix.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.330
Unless you’re one, very specialized animal…

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.710
The Electrophorus electricus, commonly known
as the electric eel.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.580
If we can copy the technology that evolution
gave the electric eel, then we can unplug

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.190
these organic looking creations, from dry
land with “soft batteries!”

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.750
These strange long fish can generate electricity
with an organ containing cells called electrocytes.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.070
Electrocytes by themselves can’t do much
damage, but jammed up all together they can

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.479
give a shock of up to 600 volts.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.869
By analyzing the eels, scientists realized
the electrocytes are organized in long stacked

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.119
compartments with extra fluid space in between.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.439
They looked at each component in the eel’s
electrocyte and mimicked the same idea into

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.130
alternating patterns of saltwater and freshwater
hydrogels.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.030
Saltwater, has salt in it, meaning it’s
an electrolyte.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.639
Here, the red gels are filled with saltwater,
and the blues are filled with freshwater.

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:34.020
At the points where they touch, the negative
ions from within the saltwater flow towards

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.069
the empty freshwater.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.780
But that’s not enough to mimic the eel biology.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.549
The yellow and green gels on the seperate
sheet are filled with specialized fluid that

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.670
don’t just let the ions flow willy-nilly.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.590
Instead the yellow gels only let negative
ions through, while the green gels only let

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.590
positive.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.399
Together, these colorful gels move the ions
in a specific direction, generating a voltage!

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.399
Voila!

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.999
Electricity from fluids, just like an eel!

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:03.380
By copying this soft squishy battery design,
researchers hope to create soft squishy robots

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.709
that can be used as wearable technology, or
in other natural environments, when traditional

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.390
batteries could get damaged or be too dangerous.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.950
The thing is, you’ll need a lot of these
little cells to generate enough electricity

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.200
to do much with.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.930
Right now researchers can only generate 110
volts from their soft battery, but they’re

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.930
working on more…

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.500
And I’m ‘eel excited about it.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.920

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.820
How close are scientists to the perfect battery?

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.730
Check out Julian's video here.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.200
And one last fun fact, researchers also used
origami folding techniques to minimize the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.370
space needed for their soft battery.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.370
Pretty cool.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.200
Thanks a lot for watching!
