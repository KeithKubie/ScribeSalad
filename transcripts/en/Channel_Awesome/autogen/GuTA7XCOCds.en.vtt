00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
satisfied or you could have taken that
 

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
satisfied or you could have taken that
extra<00:17:06.130><c> time</c><00:17:06.370><c> to</c><00:17:06.730><c> really</c><00:17:07.089><c> kind</c><00:17:07.540><c> of</c><00:17:07.689><c> explore</c>

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:08.170 align:start position:0%
extra time to really kind of explore
 

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.810 align:start position:0%
extra time to really kind of explore
this<00:17:08.380><c> stuff</c><00:17:08.589><c> a</c><00:17:08.650><c> little</c><00:17:08.740><c> bit</c><00:17:08.890><c> more</c><00:17:09.130><c> visually</c>

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:09.820 align:start position:0%
this stuff a little bit more visually
 

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.929 align:start position:0%
this stuff a little bit more visually
and<00:17:10.570><c> maybe</c><00:17:10.839><c> with</c><00:17:11.170><c> music</c><00:17:11.740><c> and</c><00:17:12.100><c> maybe</c><00:17:12.370><c> kind</c><00:17:12.820><c> of</c>

00:17:12.929 --> 00:17:12.939 align:start position:0%
and maybe with music and maybe kind of
 

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:14.730 align:start position:0%
and maybe with music and maybe kind of
with<00:17:13.030><c> different</c><00:17:13.329><c> angles</c><00:17:13.480><c> I</c><00:17:13.930><c> think</c><00:17:14.470><c> you</c><00:17:14.589><c> can</c>

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:14.740 align:start position:0%
with different angles I think you can
 

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.170 align:start position:0%
with different angles I think you can
stretch<00:17:15.070><c> this</c><00:17:15.280><c> out</c><00:17:15.430><c> enough</c><00:17:15.790><c> and</c><00:17:15.939><c> we</c><00:17:16.030><c> would</c>

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:16.180 align:start position:0%
stretch this out enough and we would
 

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
stretch this out enough and we would
have<00:17:16.270><c> been</c><00:17:16.300><c> okay</c><00:17:16.689><c> because</c><00:17:16.839><c> it</c><00:17:17.020><c> does</c><00:17:17.170><c> not</c><00:17:17.320><c> have</c>

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:17.589 align:start position:0%
have been okay because it does not have
 

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
have been okay because it does not have
