00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:29.262
AUDIENCE: Do you think
there's been any developments

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.165
policy-wise that are
helping the situation, that

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.168
are making the situation better
in any way in the recent years?

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.705
Or is it all coming
down, I guess?

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.008
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, I think
it goes in many directions.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:45.678
So actually, I think
the most dramatic fact

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.515
about the last election,
the 2016 election,

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.418
was not the election of Trump.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:55.088
The most striking fact
was the Sanders campaign.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:57.590
I mean, the fact that a
billionaire was elected.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.093
OK, it's not a big break
from American history.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.462
That goes on all the time.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:07.167
But the Sanders
campaign broke sharply

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:11.938
with over a hundred years of
American political history.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:16.543
I mean, if we had media that
were talking about reality,

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.611
that would be the headline.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:21.146
American elections are bought.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:25.952
There's plenty of substantial
mainstream political science

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.620
research on this.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.824
If you look just at
simple variables,

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.393
like, say, campaign funding--

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.527
something as simple as that--

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.865
the predictability
of electability

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:43.570
by campaign funding is literally
almost a straight line.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.573
There's a recent
study by Tom Ferguson

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.309
over at UMass, one
of the main scholars

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:52.846
who works on this, who studied
congressional election--

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:56.249
for presidential elections have
been shown for a long time.

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:57.951
But that was the
first main study

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.019
of congressional elections.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.223
They went from
1980 to the present

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:07.426
all over the country
simply asking,

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:10.330
what's the relation
between campaign spending

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.764
and electability?

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.734
And it is literally
a straight line.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:18.571
You just don't get results like
that in the social sciences.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:22.208
The more campaign spending,
the more you get elected.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:27.147
And that goes back well
into the late 19th century.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:30.016
There's a famous
campaign manager,

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:35.321
Mark Hanna, back 1890s.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:41.861
He was asked once, what's
the secret for running

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:45.732
a successful election campaign?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.368
And he said, you have
to have two things.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.103
The first one is money.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:53.339
And I can't remember
the second one.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.910
That's American
politics, literally.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.348
Just with overwhelming
near-certainty.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:06.152
Well, all of a sudden, you
get a guy who's unknown,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:10.423
has no support from any
of the sources of wealth,

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:14.394
no support from the wealthy,
no corporate support, dismissed

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:18.798
by the medial as ridiculous,
very negative media campaign.

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.667
He was basically unknown.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:23.803
And he even used a
scare word "socialist."

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.339
He would have won the
Democratic Party nomination

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.543
if it hadn't been for the
Clinton-Obama shenanigans

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.146
to keep the party
from reflecting

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.582
its popular constituency.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:39.452
That's an incredible
break from history.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.321
And right now,
incidentally, he is

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.723
by far the most popular
political figure

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:44.857
in the country.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.393
Way above anyone else.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:51.297
Well, those are signs
that other things are--

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:54.133
especially among young
people, he's way up.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.168
That's the future electorate.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.271
So these are things
that are going off

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.106
in the other direction.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:04.577
There's plenty of opportunities,
if they're grasped.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:08.414
And it's kind of easy to sink
into sort of hopelessness.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:09.816
What's the point?

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:13.519
But it's just really
a bad mistake.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.922
First of all, the issues
are extremely important.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.957
There's an awful
lot can be done.

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:21.861
Even in the kind of thing that
Arlie Hochschild was doing,

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:25.431
reaching people who
were deeply embedded

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:33.306
in the ultra-red
constituency, the deeply

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:39.912
religious, conservative,
traditional, anti-government

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:43.916
for the reasons that they
see, which you can understand,

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.119
can be changed.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.755
Incidentally, if you
look back in the past,

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:52.392
the same sectors
of the population

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:57.697
were the most carried
forward, the most extreme

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:01.434
radical democratic programs
in American history.

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:04.537
The term "populism"
is thrown around now,

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:06.539
but it used to mean something.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.642
And the populist movement
in the United States,

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:13.780
which began with
farmers in Texas

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.384
and spread through the Midwest,
to Kansas and place like that,

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:25.058
was a really powerful,
radical democratic movement.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.660
Linked up with the
Knights of Labor,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.065
the main labor movement, whose
slogan was the working people

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.634
ought to own and
run the factories.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:37.003
And it was smashed
by force finally,

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:42.041
but this is by far the most
real democratic movement

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:43.009
in American history.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:46.012
And maybe the world,
that comes out

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.980
of Texas and Kansas farmers.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.282
It's the same people.
