[MUSIC PLAYING]

[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:09.670
ANTONIO CARLUCCIO:
Good morning--

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.920
good afternoon, rather.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.790
Yes, it's lovely to see smiling
faces, young, bright, smiling

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.710
faces.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.280
When I put myself
together with computer,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.810
we have a sort of war.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.030
I wrote 23 books in my life and
all handwritten with pencil.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.640
And I still do it.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.250
And I don't know--
and I wasn't already--

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.770
can you imagine
many, many years ago.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.060
Technically, I
should be acquainted

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.720
with all sort of progress.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.240
But I don't know why I
love to see my writing,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.160
and I like to just to
strike when it's possible,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.140
or when it's necessary, and
writing instead something else.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.480
And with that I'm very happy.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.070
I really sort of
compliment you that you are

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.640
doing a very, very good job.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.930
Because without you, probably
the world would stop,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.520
I suppose.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.940
And saying, god,
I am 80 years old.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.080
That's why I said 60.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.910
Because, you know,
considering I started

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.010
with when I was 20 in cooking.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.810
And I start to cook not
because I feel to be a chef,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.060
but for necessity.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.420
I remember I left
Olivetti and I went

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.020
to Vienna, through a lovely
sort blonde, wonderful, Viennese

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.400
girl.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.800
I had the possibility
to go to Vienna

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.470
and continue studying there.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.610
And they left sort of
[INAUDIBLE] and Olivetti.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.420
And I felt all European.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.970
I wanted to learn languages,
and I learned up to five so far.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.280
And that is very,
very good, because I

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.210
wanted to communicate with
as many people as possible

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.680
in the world and to feel
really part of the world.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.130
Vienna-- and there I felt really
sort of I am in my element.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.270
People, what I like in life
is to observe life like this.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.090
In Italy, sometimes
life is like this.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.290
In certain cases,
it's even like this.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.320
The Italians, they know that.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920
So that's why we go away
from Italy sometimes,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.980
because this sort of
narrow mindedness.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.470
My mother used to say that
when God created Italy,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.010
he looked from above and
said, it's too beautiful.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.750
I have to balance it
and create the Italians.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.090
So as we know there are
20 regions or even more,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.290
and we all have something in
our head that somebody will--

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.720
but we love, commonly,
good style, good things,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.980
beautiful things,
art, food obviously.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.210
Food is very much part of it.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:36.130
And so I decided then what I
could do is to learn cooking.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.500
In fact, it was much
more a necessity,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.580
because I wanted to have
the food for myself.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.820
Viennese food was OK,
but you know your desire

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.170
to have something.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.600
And so I started
to cook Italian.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.540
And I saw that by
cooking Italian,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.770
I could reach quite a
lot of people, friends.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.230
I remember it was the
time in the '60s where

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.360
some Viennese people, good
families like the [INAUDIBLE],

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.260
the [INAUDIBLE], all
very famous family

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.500
with [INAUDIBLE] and so on,
but they didn't have money.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.560
But they were hungry.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.150
And we were sharing these
pastas in a wonderful way.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.030
So that I saw that food can be
a media to reach other people.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.110
And well, I can't talk about the
fact to reach girls obviously.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.840
Instead to say, come
and see my etchings,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.730
I could say, come
and eat my pasta.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.750
That was a completely
different thing.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.555
And don't laugh.

00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:54.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.660
The cooking went
on and on and on.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.280
And then I discovered my
passion for mushrooms.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.910
One is here-- you see this.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.900
It's a porcino.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.720
This is a cep, because that's
what I do as well, some sticks,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.130
walking sticks.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.360
I have a collection
of about 300 of those.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.260
I go into the woods.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.080
I see a lovely, straight stick.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.340
I take away the branches,
and then I whittle.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.690
It's called whittling.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.540
And I have really
used bits and pieces,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.960
that they tell me that
I like to manipulate,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.330
to change scenes with
my hands, form shape.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.510
The food is one of them.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.670
And it is very,
very interesting.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.680
How many people can cook here?

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.990
Heads up, everybody, my
goodness, that's good.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.300
That's very, very good, because
it's very rewarding, very

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.960
therapeutic.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.220
And it's at the
end of the evening,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.960
you can say on the way, you
can say, wonderful, I did it.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.140
And then you cook
and you eat something

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.550
that is special,
prepared with your hands.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.780
And your partner
will say, well done

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.270
and give you a pat on the
shoulder, minimum, if not more.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.680
And then so food
become an entire world.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.335
I wrote all those
books, 23, because I

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:40.360
found it necessary to
put on paper what I know

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.070
and what I feel.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.760
And it's been a struggle
sometimes, because it

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.200
takes one year to write a book.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.540
I still write them as a
crafted book, really sort of do

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:02.050
the researches, do
that trying myself,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.720
cooking recipes,
and all of that.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.330
And taking all the pictures, no.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.140
The pictures are taken
by a photographer,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.690
but I am there cooking the food.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.860
Because I want to be sure
that the food looks like I

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.480
produce it.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.850
Writing a book-- is anybody
writing or did write a book

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.270
or something--

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.180
of you?

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.020
It is very, very interesting
seeing a diary or something.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.010
Because you see then
what you have done,

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:40.720
time to go, number 23
book is this one here.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.360
Number 24 I wasn't
deciding if to write

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.730
a book about for children called
"Signor Porcino and Madame

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.890
Chantarelle."

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.250
So to make sure that British--

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.530
they know a little bit
more about mushrooms--

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.940
because they don't
know very much.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.790
All of the rest of
Europe and the world,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:04.730
as well, they know it.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.200
But in Britain, you have
a fear of mushrooms.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.050
So you'll pick wonderful example
of porcini around, so cep,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.850
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.370
And when was it?

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:26.910
I was doing filming for the BBC,
and we find a few mushrooms.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.890
And that we needed a little bit
more footage of the filming.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.109
And they saw from faraway,
a wonderful mushroom

00:08:34.109 --> 00:08:38.200
like this coming
out of the grass.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.570
And in the moment when they
said, oh, look at that,

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.760
a little boy came
around and kicked it.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.581
I jumped in there, and then
I was screaming like mad,

00:08:47.581 --> 00:08:48.080
you know.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.591
And the parents of the child,
they came [INAUDIBLE] what

00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:52.590
happened, what happened?

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.280
I said, well, you just destroyed
the most wonderful example

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.980
of porcini.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.850
And then they decided to
cooperate, and they went along,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:07.130
and we find some more of the
porcini to take a picture,

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.190
but just to say that
the consideration, when

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.330
you see a mushroom,
something like this, mighty.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.210
And mushroom, they are
really wonderful thing

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.050
if you study a little bit.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.280
How many of you knows
that without mushroom, we

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.120
couldn't exist?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.250
Hands up?

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.490
Nobody-- without mushrooms,
we couldn't exist.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.770
They are at the base of our
life in turning everything

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.140
that is organic in unorganic.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.740
Have the idea?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.825
We would otherwise sit on piles
and piles of unrotted leaf,

00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:51.820
unrotted tomatoes, unrotted
fruit, unrotted everything

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.320
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.370
Can you imagine piling
and piling and piling?

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.640
This is thanks to
fungi of mushrooms.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.400
There are 100,000 of those
known and they are still,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.360
the mycologists, they're
still looking for some more.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.620
So if you really consider all
of that, it's interesting.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.880
And they wanted to
write this book.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.490
And so they key, they
find the keys for children

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.500
and grown up to understand
what a mushroom is about.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.810
So now when you eat a mushroom,
think about, there's no meat,

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.290
it's not vegetables.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.850
It's something in between.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:38.060
It may be that we come
from the mushroom.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.980
Because about billions of years
ago, the first thing that came

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.760
is algae, there they
were spreading--

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.470
some of them remain in the
water, and some of them,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.700
they went on the land.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:58.570
And maybe because we have the
same reproduction as mushroom,

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.090
and many other thing,
they're very similar.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.240
I don't go into details.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.660
But mushroom is really
a fantastic thing.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:14.360
That's why-- is somebody of
you gone to pick mushrooms?

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.130
Italians?

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.060
In Calabria?

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.810
Calabria, wonderful
mushrooms there--

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.190
it is a fantastic thing.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.850
If you have the possibility,
go with somebody

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.200
that knows about it.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.960
Otherwise, it would
be your last--

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.480
[LAUGHTER] --trip.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.340
And so mushroom is one of
the items that I work with.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.380
And this "Vegetable"
book came about

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:49.970
in wanting to portray
the vegetables in another

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.050
of things.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.770
Very often I see vegetables
served in the restaurant,

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.860
they look crucified by the chef.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.990
Really, so they're gray and
sort of flabby and horrible.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.070
Are the vegetables treated
well, they taste fantastic.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.530
They're just like meat.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.630
In fact, we have in
Calabria, in Sicily,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:20.990
and in other places, the very
thing that they cooked here,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.170
the Parmigiano Aubergine.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.240
This is a typical example
of treating an aubergine

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.440
like meat.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.930
In fact, you eat
this Parmigiano,

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.260
it's very satisfactory.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.290
It's very, very nice.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.380
So this is the book.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.900
Now I wanted to
tell you, somebody

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.450
was asking what is the new book.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.490
Because I had "The
Signor Porcini and Madame

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.280
Chantarelle," and
here the "Vegetables,"

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.790
that was a two years operation.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.610
I wrote it, and then they
was very, very, very happy.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.430
And then that came, "The
Signor Porcini and Madame

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.190
Chantarelle."

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.130
And then it was
another book that I

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.590
wanted to write about, the
Neal Street restaurant, which

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.040
I had for many
years, for 26 years,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.230
with all the people, that
they came in, and so on.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.590
But I thought to myself,
who will buy that book?

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.070
You know, the restaurant--
it doesn't exist anymore.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.400
It does something for
officianados, for people

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.380
that they love the entire thing.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.360
But leave it.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.320
The other day I
received an email

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.490
from my editor, which is
in Spain, [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.190
Said, Antonio, what
about a book about fruit?

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.710
Bang, it rang a bell.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:49.180
Fruit it's one of my
favorite things in life.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:56.370
And I said, OK, and I started
not to be able to sleep.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.820
And in not sleeping.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.110
I was already taking
notes but to write.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.860
So in the night, I went
up and did two hours.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:11.610
Because what I do with a new
book, I do the intro first.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.510
Because then I have
to keep on that intro

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.120
when I'm writing what I'm doing.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.890
And it was wonderful.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.560
In the morning, I look
and it's quite nice.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.290
And now I'm putting
everything together

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.806
all the items and all the--

00:14:28.806 --> 00:14:34.080
what happened in my
life regarding fruit.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.760
Imagine war time.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.670
And my father was station
master of the railway.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.650
My mother used to cook
also the same thing.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.660
In sort of autumn,
jams and so on.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.110
Now we had, next to
the station, a place

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.930
where to put a cauldron
like this, a copper.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.250
And we were there living
with farmers around,

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.270
so this small station.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.300
And everybody was
giving us fruit.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.390
And we were putting
all the fruit in there,

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.060
and cooked for 12 hours.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.130
That was funny because--

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.320
well, with fire underneath.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.400
In the night, we had sort
of a recognition airplane

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.870
from the Germans and to
avoid that they see the fire,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.400
we children, we
were five, we hold

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:35.370
a sort of cloth
over the cauldron

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.470
and waiting that the
airplane will go away so

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.330
they wouldn't see the flame.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.400
But can you imagine
the expectation

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.710
of that sort of jam?

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:49.110
It was a brown sticky
stuff that was wonderful.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.670
When we were coming
back from school,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.610
we'd have it on on bread with
a little butter and so on.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:59.550
It was a real tea, high
tea, Italian high tea.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.000
So now that jam,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.840
if somebody comes from
Piedmont, [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.730
They use it also in
putting it on their food,

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:17.760
like bollito misto, boiled
meat, or as a savory thing,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.410
it's very, very good.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:24.190
Anyway, I decided now that
my next book is about fruit.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.600
So probably in one and half, one
year, one and half year time,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.770
you will see the
book floating around.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:36.570
And not because I
threw it in the Thames,

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.870
but because it's ready.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.130
And writing books is
really a wonderful thing,

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.860
because you write something
that you have in your mind,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.480
in your heart.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:57.000
And if you are not commercial,
because there are people,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.940
they are writing also
commercially, and they don't.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.500
But the pleasure to--

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.920
[POSTER FALLS]

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.089
Well, see?

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.977
I am falling apart already.

00:17:09.977 --> 00:17:13.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.480
There comes a point where
I don't know any more,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.680
then I tell a joke.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.150
I have a few jokes.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.660
One of them is so stupid.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.500
In fact, I will--

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.080
writing in the book, because
it is regarding fruit.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.925
This girl has a very wide
mouth, very wide mouth.

00:17:35.925 --> 00:17:39.750
So the mother is very, very
worried, goes to a doctor.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:45.330
And the doctor said, well, tell
your daughter to do an exercise

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.360
and say, fruit, fruit.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.810
So make really all
the time, fruit.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:56.790
So a month or two later, they
meet again and said, sir,

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.850
how was it?

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.430
Oh, it was very well.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.080
So did you repeat this?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.270
Oh, yes, yes.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.860
What do you say?

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.220
He said, banana.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.370
I laughed so much
about so stupid joke.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.150
As you know, to the
[INAUDIBLE] they say banana.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.800
Stupid jokes,
sometimes, they're nice.

00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:26.780
Did you know about
this one, banana.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.070
Then there's that one about
the memory, obviously.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.810
A man says to the woman,
both have Alzheimer's.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.910
He says to her, darling,
can you go into the kitchen.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:42.250
This very appropriate
now to my age.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.140
Can you go into the kitchen
and fetch me an ice cream?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.840
Perhaps you can put a
little bit of pistachio nuts

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.780
on top, also some
fluid chocolate?

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.720
And write it down,
otherwise you'll forget it.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.150
He said, oh, no,
no, today I'm fine.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.430
She comes back about
10, 15 minutes later

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.100
with a couple fried eggs.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.930
And he said, I told
you to write it down.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.670
Where is the fucking bacon?

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:12.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:21.630
Yet you will encounter this
sort of memory lapse thing.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.560
But probably--
Christmas already gone.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.360
For me, one of the sweetest is
that one of the son of a mafia

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.090
boss, 'Ndrangheta, similar
to the mafia, not far away,

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.450
Sicily, because the
gentleman is from Calabria.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.850
And they have another mafia.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.480
Then Neapolitan they
have another one.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.670
[INAUDIBLE], they have another
one they call different,

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.860
but it's the same.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.510
But anyway the son
of the mafia boss

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.880
said, Papa, I would like to
have a bicycle from Father

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.010
Christmas.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.225
And in Italy, it is not
Father Christmas bringing

00:20:00.225 --> 00:20:03.240
the present, but Baby Jesus.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.600
And the father said,
look, bribe to Baby Jesus,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.160
promise to be a good
boy, perhaps you

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.580
will have a bicycle.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:14.580
Dear Baby Jesus, I promise to
be a good boy for one month

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.680
if you send me a bicycle.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.290
He's not happy about that.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.490
Dear Baby Jesus, I promise
to be a good boy for one week

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.960
if you send me a bicycle.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.812
He's not happy
about that, neither.

00:20:27.812 --> 00:20:30.210
He said, why do I have to
promise to be a good boy?

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.490
I'm a good boy, anyway.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.580
So he takes the Madonna
that's naturally,

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:41.010
as an Italian boy, on the table,
put in a drawer, close it.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.530
And he writes a new letter.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.940
And said, Dear
Baby Jesus, if you

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.456
want to see your mother
again, bring me a bicycle.

00:20:47.456 --> 00:20:51.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.136
I find these old
ones very sweet.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:02.200
I said, [INAUDIBLE],
yeah, no, with jokes,

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.610
I could go on and on and on.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:09.340
But savories as
well, but better not.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:16.940
And regarding my food, I saw
in there before in the kitchen,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.750
that they had done
a very good job.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:24.570
And they was really very
sort of impressed by the fact

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:29.780
that Google offer
it to the entire--

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.806
only this house
here, yes, not more.

00:21:33.806 --> 00:21:36.510
Because otherwise the entire
[INAUDIBLE] come here.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:41.360
[APPLAUSE]
