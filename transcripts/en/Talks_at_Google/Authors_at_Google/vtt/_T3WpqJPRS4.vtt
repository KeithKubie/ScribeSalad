00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:07.130
XIAOCHEN ZHANG:
So Lu, maybe tell

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.540
us about your journey in
early career in corporate,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.592
and why you make the
decision to jump.

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:15.800
LU LI: Yeah, so hi, everyone.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.522
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:18.980
Last time I was
here, actually, was

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.040
in my role as a mentor
for Google Launchpad.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.297
So yeah, very
excited to be back.

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:25.880
To give you a little
bit of background

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.930
about my past and professional
life, as Xiaochen, I'm Chinese.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.680
And when you grow up
as a Chinese child,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.490
you have a lot of expectations,
you know, from your family

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.110
that you sort of need to
fulfill to have a good life

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.620
or to be deemed successful.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.080
So my parents always
wanted me to go

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.860
either into business or into
law or into medicine, right?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.870
And so I chose business.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.390
And I did business
school in Germany.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.990
So I was born in China, and
then grew up in Germany,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.460
got all my education in
Germany, went to business school

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.440
in Germany, and
started with McKinsey

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.330
in Munich almost 10 years
ago, nine years ago.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.482
Asian genes.

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:11.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.350
And yeah, I started
working with McKinsey,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.730
then moved on to join P&amp;G
and worked in Switzerland

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.950
in brand management
and marketing.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.250
And I've done that for about
four or five years in total.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.560
And then I sort of
jumped and, you know,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.120
just kind of became
my own person,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.460
if that makes sense, kind of
embarked on this path of being

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.110
an entrepreneur and
trying to find out

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.070
what I want to do on my own.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550
And the reason for that,
to answer the question,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.610
actually, is I don't think you
ever actually leave a company.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.280
I think you leave a manager.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.200
Hmm?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.260
Think about that.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.870
And in my case, you
know, it was kind of--

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.730
you know, I had
difficulties with the boss

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.259
that I was reporting to.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.300
I also saw that he had
difficulties with the boss

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.565
that he was reporting to.

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:04.940
So if you kind of think about
the whole sort of reporting

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.890
chain, it just doesn't
really work out.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.130
And it was like, oh my
god, this is a dead end.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.310
And you know, it was
not possible, basically,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.466
for me to maneuver in any way
in that sort of situation.

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:18.340
And I just basically
had to leave the company

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.930
to kind of find something new.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.720
And as I thought, OK, I
need to remove myself out

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.370
of this situation, do I want
to join another corporate?

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.180
Or do I take the opportunity
to do something on my own?

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.730
And that was five years ago.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.825
And I decided to do
something on my own

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:38.200
because I'm one of these people
who think I can do things

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.630
better than other people.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.315
And yeah, I embarked
on that journey.

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:44.690
XIAOCHEN ZHANG:
Yeah, do you ever

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.740
wish you could maybe
create it earlier on,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.490
or this is exactly good
timing for you to do so?

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.360
LU LI: I think it
was the right time.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.490
I don't think there's ever,
I suppose, the best time

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.870
to leave a job, right?

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.740
You just feel it.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.781
I mean, you know, when
you are frustrated enough,

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.760
and in my case, you
know, you'll do it.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.020
Or if there's a big enough
other opportunity that lures you

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.670
in, then you'll do it, right?

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.590
I think every decision
that people make,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.350
then it's kind of like--
if it comes from the heart,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.830
it's kind of like
you're fully behind it,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.636
then it is the
right time for you.

00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:22.510
And for me, it was
definitely the right time.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.040
I don't think I should have
done it earlier or later.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.516
So I don't regret that I sort
of jumped five years ago.

00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:33.890
I think what I
would say, though,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.771
is because I was
in Switzerland--

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:37.520
no, I was actually in
Germany as an expat,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.290
and then I moved
back to Switzerland.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.430
And I was not really part of
the entrepreneurial ecosystem,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.530
because there was none.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.340
I think, knowing
that, being in London

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.870
and having so many
things around you

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.352
I think is definitely
helpful to immerse yourself

00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:54.310
even while you're employed
in these activities.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.260
I mean, we've run a
lot of things, also,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.500
over the weekends,
events and all of that.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.350
So I think that's one thing
I wished I would have had.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.030
But I didn't have
it at the time.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.160
So there was no choice.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.034
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Cool.

00:04:07.034 --> 00:04:09.670
And after you quit, do
you naturally directly go

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.437
to entrepreneurship, or you
take some time to figure out

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:13.270
what you want to do?

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.298
And how long did it take?

00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:16.839
LU LI: I mean, I
left with the vision

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.430
to do something on my own.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.500
I didn't know what
I wanted to do.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.300
I just, I suppose,
wanted to do something

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.610
that leverages my
strength and do something

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.856
that I'm passionate
about and I love.

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:28.480
And I think that's
what a lot of people

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.741
think about when they
sort of quit a job.

00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:33.115
And then it's
about actually sort

00:04:33.115 --> 00:04:36.970
of finding out whether
the idea that you have

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.629
is a viable business, or
can be a viable business,

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.920
and is also a business that
you want to actually build,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.800
because, you know, if you're
working for a big company,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.460
you have all the infrastructure
that you can dream of, right?

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.707
I mean, buildings and food
and assistance and telephones

00:04:52.707 --> 00:04:55.290
and all of these things that you
have to take care of yourself

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.590
when you work for
yourself, right?

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.520
And people find out that
you like certain things

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.220
or you are better at
certain things than others.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.830
And so before I started
Blooming Founders,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.550
I had two other companies,
which I ran by myself

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.920
almost as a one-woman show.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.860
And I learned through
that process--

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.320
I did that for about three
years, two and 1/2 years--

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.730
that I don't want to build
a company that just has me

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.634
as one person, right?

00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:26.800
Because obviously, you can
trade your time for money

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.030
and then you can just kind
of consult in a capacity.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.530
And you know, you
can pay your rent,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.750
you can pay your expenses,
and that's kind of it.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.260
But I just realized by
doing that, after a while,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.990
that I had the
ambition or just--

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.940
I wasn't satisfied myself.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.180
So I wanted to build something
bigger, more sustainable,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.790
with more impact.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.610
And that I couldn't have
known in the beginning.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.940
It's kind of, I think, if
you are taking the leap

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.940
and then trying to find
out what you want to do,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.910
I think it's very, very
natural that you're

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.070
doing different things,
trying different projects,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.790
and find out what works for you
and what doesn't work for you.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.236
Yeah, so it takes time.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:09.110
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Good.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.820
And how does a book
idea come along.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.310
Before you answer, I just want
to ask our audience a question.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.400
How many of you guys do
write handwriting letters

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.160
to anyone around the world?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.990
Just hands up if
you still do that.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.850
LU LI: Oh, nice.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.060
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: To
families, to friends.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.715
Yeah, nice.

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:31.895
LU LI: How many people
keep a journal, actually?

00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:34.324
How many people
write to themselves?

00:06:34.324 --> 00:06:35.620
Uh-huh, a bit more.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.911
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: I wonder, do
they write to you English,

00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:40.500
or in your mother tongue,
like, native language?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.240
It's quite intimate to
write a letter to someone.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.020
So how does an idea
come around for you?

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.770
LU LI: So the book idea is
one of the first projects

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.550
I released under my new
company, Blooming Founders.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.000
I started completely
from scratch.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.430
The idea was to kind of
build an infrastructure

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.580
for female founders, because
as I was out there doing stuff

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.680
on my own, I realized
that a lot of other women

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.900
are out there doing
stuff on their own.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.850
And then if you're in
the startup ecosystem,

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.050
you see no women.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.880
So you kind of like
trying to square up

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.890
what's happening here, right?

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.260
And it seems to me that
there's a lot of women around.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.030
But you know, there's
no infrastructure

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.760
that they go to, apparently.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.470
And I didn't know why
that was happening.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.890
So I started running events,
bringing women together

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.660
that are entrepreneurial,
inviting female founders

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.850
as speakers and, you
know, sort of doing talks

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.650
and exactly what you are doing,
with 90% women in the audience.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.950
And actually, I'm so glad that
we have a lot of guys in here.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.290
I'm really, really glad,
because obviously, you know,

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.789
the title was "Dear
Female Founder."

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:47.170
So you know, wasn't
expecting this so, yay, guys.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.060
Coming back to the story,
yeah, I started doing events.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.000
And you know, at these
events, you obviously network

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.320
after the event.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.360
And you find out over time
that there are no role models,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.890
or very few role models that
women have in entrepreneurship,

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.610
that the media talks about
the typical sort of people

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.090
such as Elon Musk, such as Mark
Zuckerberg, such as Larry Page.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.730
And all of these people
are all great people,

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.640
but they are not us.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.500
It's just different, basically.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.240
You know, it's not the same.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.640
And this book came
about from my view

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.159
of, I think there's so many
amazing women out there,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.380
because I invite them
to speak at my events,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.150
that we need to
share more content.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.380
And we also need to share
more authentic content.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.210
Not me going out
and interviewing

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.695
people, which I could
have done, but I'm not

00:08:44.695 --> 00:08:45.570
a trained journalist.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.550
I don't even know what
to ask, basically.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.030
I can answer questions.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.380
So that's why I came up with
the idea of writing a letter,

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.200
because I think it's
quite a powerful tool.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.440
And also, it digs out,
you know, tacit insights

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.930
from those entrepreneurs
that they probably

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.376
would have never been prompted
by a journalist, right?

00:09:06.376 --> 00:09:08.250
Because who knows what's
in your head, right?

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.250
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Exactly.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.820
Yeah.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.840
LU LI: So that's the long
story to how this came about.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.590
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: And
when you're collecting

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.180
all the 66 different letters
from the female founders,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.910
is there any particular
one impressed the most,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.760
or something you never expected?

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.180
LU LI: Yeah, I got that
question asked a lot.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.720
There are 66 letters
in that book,

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.080
so there is quite a few amazing
women that got featured.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.670
And I have several favorites
for different reasons, I think.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.170
People that are just super
practical and just kind

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.280
of, you know--

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.400
when you read this, you go,
oh my god, yes, of course.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.140
I should do this, you know?

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.390
And then people that are
a bit more reflective.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.530
And it takes a bit longer
to process, basically.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.900
And sometimes, I mean,
even I had to read--

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.570
I mean, I had to read, because
I edited the whole thing,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.270
but I had to read
letters several times

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.080
to understand what's behind.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.790
And so yes, I mean, I do
have my favorite letters,

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.280
for different reasons, I think.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.590
And I mean, I can probably
say, the first one of each--

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.660
so I have three larger
sections in the book.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.570
Probably the first
one that I put

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.460
was kind of one
of the favorites.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.130
And the last one is quite
powerful as well, actually.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.655
Yeah.

00:10:29.655 --> 00:10:30.530
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Cool.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.190
Can't wait to read
the whole book.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.040
I think you guys are
probably thinking the same.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.660
And when you founded
your business,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.560
do you find this advice gave
you good reason to [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.820
have you ever experienced some
of the failures or hard time?

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.311
And how do you cope with that?

00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:51.810
LU LI: Yeah, I think that is
the business of reality, right?

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.460
I mean, if anybody thinks
that when you start off

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.080
your own business, it's going
to be A to B, like, forget it.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.300
It's not going to happen.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.360
I mean, there's
naturally up and downs.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.640
And then, I mean, I
think sort of reading

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.800
all of these
articles and letters,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.090
I think there's just a lot of
things that are just very real.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.650
I think just one of the things--

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.186
I mean, it just springs to mind,
but don't work with idiots.

00:11:16.186 --> 00:11:16.685
Yeah.

00:11:16.685 --> 00:11:19.260
I mean, nobody tells you that,
but don't work with idiots.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.770
Very simple.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.674
And I say it's simple,
but it's actually not,

00:11:23.674 --> 00:11:25.590
because sometimes you
are in a situation where

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.006
you have to work with people
that you actually don't like,

00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:28.620
for example.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:34.210
And then it can drag a lot of
energy and time out of you.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.156
And sometimes, you
know, the boldest move

00:11:36.156 --> 00:11:37.530
you can actually
make is actually

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.990
stop working with these
people, even if you

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.510
have to say no to money, right?

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.616
And cash flow is obviously
important, always,

00:11:46.616 --> 00:11:48.240
but sometimes it's
just very liberating

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.060
not to work with certain people.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.560
And I know that
from the community--

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.610
and obviously I've produced the
book for the Blooming Founders

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.150
community--

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.730
I know that some people have
it next to their bedside table.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.775
And then when they have a
shitty day, then, you know-- oh,

00:12:02.775 --> 00:12:03.720
can I swear, actually?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.590
I don't know.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.181
Beep.

00:12:06.181 --> 00:12:08.100
When they have a bad
day, they would sort of

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.910
dip into the book.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.105
And then they would sort
of be motivated again,

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:15.150
et cetera, et cetera, because,
you know, life happens.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.740
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: That's true.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.220
So when you were on your
entrepreneur journey

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.640
did you have mentors?

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.420
Do you have good
mentor, bad mentor,

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.509
and how do you know at that
time that's bad advice for you?

00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:29.300
How do you know it?

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.890
LU LI: I believe
if you don't know,

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.550
I think it's good to just listen
to a lot of different opinions.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.920
And then you have
to just make up

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.110
your mind yourself,
basically, of what

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.750
you listen to and just
align with your gut.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.445
Like, who do you
trust most, right?

00:12:44.445 --> 00:12:46.320
You know, because most
of the time, you ask--

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.462
I mean, don't
listen to people who

00:12:48.462 --> 00:12:49.920
tell you something
and you actually

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.110
find out they have never
done it themselves, right?

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.900
I mean, we know too
many of those people.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.730
And there's a lot of
mentors and advisors,

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.929
also, in the startup
world that have never

00:12:58.929 --> 00:12:59.970
done anything themselves.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.120
But then they, you
know, are going around

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.650
and advising people.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:09.440
And so that, be careful about.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.420
And over time, I think the
good mentors and advisors,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.080
they would actually sort
of follow up with you,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.720
because they like you and they
really want to support you.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.450
So with most of my
current mentors,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.090
I wouldn't even call them
mentors, because we almost

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.230
became friends, right?

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.940
I mean, I have
everyone on WhatsApp,

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.820
and if I have any
questions, basically,

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.560
I just ping them a message.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.510
And then, you know,
I see what they say.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.360
And then I think, oh, this makes
sense, this doesn't make sense.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.270
And then I just move on.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.260
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Cool.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.640
I think I read a research or
another interview you did.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.280
In UK, there's around 75%
of the female founders,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.260
they are also solo founders,
so they don't have co-founder,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.110
and own by themselves.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.840
What do you think can be
done to change the reality?

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.810
Or what caused that, and
what things we can do?

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.140
LU LI: So I think the reasons
behind is probably not

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.580
that easy to explain.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.262
I mean, there's
multitudes of things.

00:14:07.262 --> 00:14:08.970
There's research, for
example, that women

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.570
in business, and in
general, have a smaller

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.984
network but a deeper network.

00:14:14.984 --> 00:14:16.650
And men in business
have a wider network

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.191
and more shallow
network, which means

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.090
that they know more people.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.550
And then societally,
also, men tend

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.320
to not shy away from
just picking up the phone

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.110
and call up a mate
to ask him a favor

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.790
or to ask him to do something.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.421
Whereas women tend not to do
that, basically, because they

00:14:32.421 --> 00:14:34.170
are aware it's risky
and they don't really

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.210
want to drag another
friend into the whole thing

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.200
before they are 100% certain
it's perfect and it's totally,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.070
you know, safe to do, which
obviously it never is.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:47.865
And yeah, so I think a lot
of women in the community,

00:14:47.865 --> 00:14:51.030
in Blooming Founders,
you know, are solo

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:55.170
founders because they choose
that path of [? XY, ?]

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.969
that reason.

00:14:55.969 --> 00:14:57.510
Could be because
they were frustrated

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.460
in their previous
job, because they're

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.370
really passionate about
this idea that they have,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.360
but at that time when
they had the idea,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.780
there was nobody else around
that was similarly passionate

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.910
or that they knew
for long enough

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.830
to kind of be a co-founder.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.140
But then people venture
out, and then they

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.550
try to find the
co-founding team.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.966
And that [INAUDIBLE] you know,
becomes really difficult as

00:15:19.966 --> 00:15:22.160
well, because you don't,
obviously, know the people.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.950
And then people might
take advantage of you

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.370
and all of these things.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.870
So I think it's a
multitude of reasons

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:36.570
why women tend to build
businesses on their own.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.220
Said this, though,
I mean, luckily

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.080
we still have women
founding teams,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.022
you know, mixed teams as well,
that build great businesses.

00:15:46.022 --> 00:15:47.730
But I think the overall
sort of landscape

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.710
is unfortunately still that way.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.130
And I hope through you
know, the work that we do--

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.840
so we recently opened
a physical space,

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.800
a physical work and event
space called Bloom's London.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.040
It's a co-working space slash
event space slash members club.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.750
And I think the
members club element

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.540
comes through bringing the
community together, right,

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.120
connecting you with
other women that

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:14.490
do similar things in business,
but have different businesses.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.610
And you can collaborate.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.870
And then you can form
teams that might not

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.080
be sitting under one
company, but at least are

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.810
sort of associated in a way, so
you're not working on your own.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.497
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: So maybe
slightly outside the topic--

00:16:28.497 --> 00:16:30.330
you know, in corporate,
we're always talking

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.860
about work-life balance.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.640
We have yoga.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.800
We have [INAUDIBLE]
here, as you know.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.115
Once you become
entrepreneur, and you

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:40.380
used to be in this environment,
how do you adjust yourself,

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.561
and how do keep the balance?

00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:43.560
LU LI: I think balance--

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.184
it's an interesting
question, actually.

00:16:45.184 --> 00:16:47.620
I think balance is
a personal choice.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:53.220
I think everybody needs to get
to know their own bodies better

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.650
and, you know, understand,
are you a morning person?

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.880
Are you a night person?

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.720
What person are you?

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.404
Are you normal, regular
working hours person?

00:17:01.404 --> 00:17:03.570
And what do you need in
your life, basically, right?

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.540
So when I left
corporate, what I've done

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.520
is actually I've
wiped out my schedule,

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.310
like 9:00 to 5:00 or whatever,
and also Monday through Friday,

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.619
because I had seven
days in the week.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.925
And I'm not sure if--
you probably know this--

00:17:17.925 --> 00:17:19.180
I'm not sure what it was.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.849
But you know, there's a
story about this professor

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:23.640
in a university.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.942
And he comes up with these
two vases and stones and sand.

00:17:26.942 --> 00:17:28.650
And then he talks to
his students about--

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.930
I think it's about time
management or something.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.700
And he puts in the stones
in the vase, and then--

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.210
sorry, the sand into the vase,
and then the stones and it

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.220
doesn't fit, basically.
and it overflows.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.720
And then he puts
the stones first,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.630
and then the sand around it.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.090
And then everything
fits perfectly.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.215
And I think there was the
analogy around, you know,

00:17:46.215 --> 00:17:51.870
making sure you have
the priorities in check

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.670
and, you know, your
ducks in a row.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.770
But I think that's what
I have pretty much done

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.940
with my schedule, with my time.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.790
So I wiped everything out.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.280
And I said, OK, I need to
sleep, like, seven hours a day.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.850
So where do I plug that in?

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.830
I actually tend to sleep between
1:00 and 8:00, for example.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.810
And I work the best, actually,
between 10:00 and 1:00,

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.630
because that's
like my quiet time.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.010
I plotted that in.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.380
Then, you know, friends.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.780
I see them for brunch
or drinks or whatever.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.280
I need to call my mom.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.230
You know, all of these
things, basically.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.006
But somehow,
actually, I realized

00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:26.130
I had a really simple life.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.730
So I don't have that
many stones to put in.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.800
As a result, the rest,
basically, was sand for me.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.840
And my business is
sand, basically, right?

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.020
It's kind of everything else
that I create in my life.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.810
And that's my definition
of work-life balance,

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.100
because if there's another
stone coming, I mean,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.150
I would basically sort of
make that stone work somehow

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.480
and just remove the
sand a little bit.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.420
Yeah.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.586
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: That's good.

00:18:56.586 --> 00:18:57.630
LU LI: Maybe that helps.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.050
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Yeah.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.460
I'll ask one more question.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.440
And I'll open up to the floor.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.565
The Googlers are really
good with questions.

00:19:03.565 --> 00:19:05.550
Just be prepared.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.690
So what advice would you
give to founders out there?

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.160
It doesn't matter male, female.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.545
What would you say to them?

00:19:12.545 --> 00:19:14.170
LU LI: I would actually
say, the advice

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.250
that you find in this book is
applicable to everybody, right?

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.740
I mean, it just comes
from a female perspective

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.040
because that person
happens to be a woman.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.770
But I think my general
advice is to do it,

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.310
to explore whether
entrepreneurship is for you.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.050
There's literally
nothing to lose.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:34.620
I mean, if you think--

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.030
I mean, maybe you
lose a bit of money.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.600
Fine.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.660
I mean, you can
join another company

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.360
and earn money again, right?

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.030
But you know, the
time is not lost,

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.690
because you learn so much.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.577
And it's so different, actually,
to how corporate life works.

00:19:50.577 --> 00:19:52.410
And you also get to
know yourself, actually,

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:52.980
a lot better.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.330
So I think entrepreneurship
is a really good way

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.510
for personal development.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.360
And, you know, some
people succeed.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.180
Great.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.240
Some people don't.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.005
But then they realize,
actually, you know,

00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:07.380
I don't have to
build a business.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.910
I'm actually much more happier--

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.010
because sometimes you
don't know what you have

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.670
until you actually get rid of it
and lose it, basically, right?

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.660
And some people, actually,
are very happy back in the job

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.960
and still do what they did
on the side, as a hobby,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.460
basically.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.585
But then at least you know.

00:20:23.585 --> 00:20:26.295
You feel a lot more comfortable
and at ease that, you know,

00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:29.000
this is how I want to
design my life now, right?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.620
I mean, it's not a constant
state, I would say.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.280
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.450
Yeah, great.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.670
So now I'll open
up to the floor.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.550
If you have questions,
just raise your hand

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.010
and we'll give you a microphone.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.590
So we'll start from there.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.048
AUDIENCE: Tell me
about the process

00:20:45.048 --> 00:20:53.040
of writing the book, in terms of
selecting the founders, how you

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.680
pitch it, how you convince them
to separate a time to write

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.314
this really intimate letter.

00:20:57.314 --> 00:20:58.480
Do you give them a deadline?

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.880
Did you have to do much chasing?

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.130
Tell us a bit more about that.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.130
LU LI: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.580
So it took me about nine
months from having the idea

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.560
to actually holding
the book in my hand.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.200
So it's self-published
through Amazon.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.120
Everybody can
self-publish a book.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.570
And it took me, in
total, nine months.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.850
And I started with
the women that I

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.380
knew, that I have invited
to speak at my events.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.706
And I think the criteria was
that they had to be-- you know,

00:21:26.706 --> 00:21:28.990
they must have achieved
something interesting,

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.120
basically, and significant.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.411
So I had, like, they had to
be in business for at least

00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:37.020
three years, and ideally,
this many employees

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.660
or raised that much
funding or have

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.340
generated this much revenue.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.440
So all of the 66,
all together, they've

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.106
generated a billion
dollars in revenue,

00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:49.700
and some obviously more
than others, but, you know.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.090
And yeah, I leveraged
my own personal network.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.960
Then I have asked
them, basically,

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.620
to kind of refer
me to other women,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.260
because it's a sort of small
group of [INAUDIBLE] so then

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.420
people tend to
know other people.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.490
I have also reached out
through the Google network,

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.097
like the accelerator
networks, Startup Weekend.

00:22:14.097 --> 00:22:15.430
I volunteer for Startup Weekend.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.650
I organize Startup Weekends.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.380
And Startup Weekend
is around the globe.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.100
And that I utilized after
I have pretty much gotten,

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.010
like, 20 people in
and around London

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.470
and the US, which are pretty
much the first people you get

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.289
because the density is there.

00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:32.330
But I really wanted to
have a global perspective.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:38.120
So you have people from New
Zealand, China, and Colombia

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.340
and Mexico, and things.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.220
So for that I had to sort
of talk to other networks.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.370
And Startup Weekend
is an amazing network.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.270
You know, everybody's so helpful
and helping you to connect.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.550
And also, my business
school friends,

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.930
because they are everywhere
in the world now, from

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.770
Dubai to Indonesia to everyone.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.040
So I'd be like, hi, you know.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.460
And so that's how
I've reached out.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.720
I also tried LinkedIn.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.150
I did LinkedIn
connections and messages.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.820
That was the least effective.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.980
But I got a couple through that.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.690
Yeah.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:16.640
And how I approached
them was actually--

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.870
I actually just wrote a letter
myself as an example, right?

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:26.267
And I gave them quite specific,
I suppose, directions.

00:23:26.267 --> 00:23:28.600
So it started with "Dear
Female Founder," because that's

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.460
the title of the book.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.543
And everything started
with "Dear Female Founder."

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:37.730
It has to be between
800 and 1,500 words.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.940
So it also communicates,
it's not too long.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.990
You know, you're
not asking to write

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.050
a book, but just a letter.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.860
And basically, just
think about, if you

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.440
were to sit down and write
a letter, what would you

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.740
advise to your younger self
or your best friend who

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.860
is starting a business,
or the future generation

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.450
of female founders, right?

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.790
And I think that idea
just resonated a lot

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.640
with the people
that contributed,

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.770
that everybody was
just so happy to do it.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.410
And they were like, oh my god,
I always wanted to do that.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.340
It's good that you're
giving me the chance.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.480
And I got, actually,
a lot of gratitude

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.440
back from people, because
people were like, actually,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.270
you know, thank
you for helping me

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.060
to find my voice and my
story and to tell my story,

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.920
because I've never
done that before,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.794
because I was never
asked, because that comes

00:24:26.794 --> 00:24:31.400
to the original problem, because
they were never asked, right?

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.330
So yes, I think somehow
the idea just resonated.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.512
Pretty much everybody
had a positive response.

00:24:38.512 --> 00:24:40.220
Probably half the
people I've contacted--

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.140
I've contacted
around 150 people--

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.380
said it's lovely, I
would love to contribute,

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.410
but I'm so super busy that
I just don't have time.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.870
But let me know when it's out,
and I would love to support

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.590
and spreading the
word or something.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.232
Yeah.

00:24:56.232 --> 00:24:57.120
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Cool.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.150
So just go around.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.700
Did they also post it to you,
like write it and stamp it?

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.450
LU LI: No, no, no.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.280
Oh, yeah, Google Docs, guys.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.710
So yeah, no, to be honest,
the actual-- my work

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.187
was really just
project management,

00:25:10.187 --> 00:25:12.520
because it was just, you know,
you create your hit list,

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.810
you contact them, you
see what they say.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.230
There's everything in
Excel or Google Sheets.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.730
And then literally,
I would just ask

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.830
people to send me a Google Doc.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.700
And then I would edit it in
the Google Doc with them.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.420
And every letter probably
had, you know, between three

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.640
to five rounds of feedback.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.420
And that's it, right?

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.250
You sign off.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.250
That's the text.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.840
You copy it further.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.644
And that's that.

00:25:38.644 --> 00:25:39.810
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: That's good.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.062
Good to know.

00:25:41.062 --> 00:25:41.770
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.840
Thanks for sharing your story.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.970
So you mentioned
that the letters

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.930
are from sort of a global base.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.560
You spoke to people
and had contributions

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.810
from all over the world.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.360
What proportion of
the letters were

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.600
from the US versus Europe
versus Asia, in general?

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.500
And did you notice any
trends, like themes

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.290
of different types of
challenges that people faced

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.810
in North America versus
what perhaps they faced here

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.970
or in APAC?

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.262
LU LI: So I think around--

00:26:11.262 --> 00:26:12.720
I forgot the numbers,
to be honest,

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.670
but around 20 people are
actually from the UK.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:22.460
Another 15 or so
are from the US.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.680
So probably half of the
book is kind of UK, US.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.710
And then the rest is kind of
like across the globe, right?

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.600
And at some point,
I was just literally

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.528
keen on having somebody in
Africa, for example, right?

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.201
Yeah, and I think in terms
of the advice that people--

00:26:40.201 --> 00:26:42.700
I mean, I also had entrepreneurs
that also, for example, did

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.460
stuff in Sierra Leone but
were actually Americans,

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.420
for example.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.670
So it's a bit-- you know.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.260
But I think in
terms of advice, I

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.630
think it really depends
more on the type of business

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.950
and the industry that they were
in than the actual country.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.490
I do see, in the
Asian sort of sphere,

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:05.102
there is more cultural
expectations around the topic

00:27:05.102 --> 00:27:07.060
of entrepreneurship,
because it's not something

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.400
that women do, to be honest.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:16.330
And it's funny, because I think
the girl from Latin America--

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.620
well, the lady, actually.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.370
She's a scientist.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.970
She does heavy,
heavy science stuff.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.470
She kind of was
interesting, because she's

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.850
doing this super serious
thing, and then her letter

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.237
was kind of really bubbly.

00:27:31.237 --> 00:27:33.070
So that's where I felt,
you know, in the way

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.710
that she was writing that the
Latin American sort of flavor

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.900
came out a little bit.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.140
But that's just kind of
from an editing perspective.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.870
From a content
perspective, I would

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.280
say I was surprised to see
that probably only like 5%

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.720
to maximum 10% of what
people talk about is actually

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.910
genderized, is
actually sort of about,

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.060
oh, as a female
founder, da da da da.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.180
Like, most of the things are
really just super applicable

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.150
across everything.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.780
And I found that
quite interesting,

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:09.340
because I didn't give them
a more specific brief than I

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.440
shared with you just now.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.800
And people were not,
you know, oh my god, I'm

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.140
a female founder, I'm so
discriminated, and, you know,

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.120
the world is so
horrible, et cetera.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.537
I mean, you obviously have
that, but in the grand scheme

00:28:22.537 --> 00:28:24.370
of things, I think
probably also people just

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.953
don't want to share that back
to the future generation, right?

00:28:26.953 --> 00:28:30.290
I think we want to
be more positive

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.850
about entrepreneurship.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.510
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Yeah.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.110
AUDIENCE: As you've
mentioned, that as women, we

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.380
don't have as many role
models in terms of CEOs

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.210
that are females out there.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.610
I was just wondering if
there were any common topics

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.520
in the book and the
letters about women

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.790
feeling a bit like
the imposter syndrome.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.050
In Google, sometimes
I talk about, oh, I'm

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.690
not sure if I should be here
or if I deserve to be here.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.970
So I was just wondering,
with women being CEOs,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.370
if they talked about
anything about,

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.500
I cannot believe I'm a
CEO, or things like that.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.630
LU LI: Yeah, they did.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:05.320
They do.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.570
And I think what did come out--

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.940
I think what makes a
difference that women

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.370
wrote those letters is
a little bit of that,

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.260
but a lot about taking care
of yourself kind of thing

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.480
and being true to
yourself and not

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.420
trying to do something just
because the rest of the world

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.990
wants you to do it, right?

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.640
So for example, I mean, a
typical startup acceleration

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.310
phase is you start a startup,
you go through an accelerator,

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.670
you get your seed funding,
you get your series A and B

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.730
and so forth, right?

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:41.680
And it requires a
certain type of business

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.340
to do that and actually perform
against all of these metrics.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.830
But it might not be
the best business.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.810
And it might not be the
best business for you,

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.010
as well, right?

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.120
So people pivot.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.078
And then sometimes it's
kind of like, you know,

00:29:54.078 --> 00:29:56.460
am I doing the wrong
thing, of having graduated

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.690
from a [? Texas ?] accelerator,
for example, and now pivoting

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.466
into an agency,
for example, that

00:30:02.466 --> 00:30:04.090
might be super
profitable because we're

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:07.870
really good at what we're doing,
but isn't the high-growth tech

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.430
business that people
thought that we

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.110
were doing in the beginning.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:16.720
And I think letting go and sort
of that type of attachment,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.980
you can read a little
bit through the book.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.360
And also, then,
attached to that--

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:29.470
it's very stressful, obviously,
to just be OK with yourself,

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.460
to say OK, you know,
I am in that game,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.350
or I am in a different
game, and I'm

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.080
totally fine with being
in a different game.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.430
And to the imposter
syndrome thing,

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.740
so that's actually in the
first letter, written by a lady

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.170
called Alex, Alexandra
Depledge from Hassle.com.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.841
She exited Hassle
a couple years ago,

00:30:49.841 --> 00:30:51.590
and now she's building
her second startup,

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.930
called Buildpath.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:58.007
And one of her tips
for that is when

00:30:58.007 --> 00:30:59.590
you sort of have an
important meeting,

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:03.200
an important presentation,
you go to the bathroom,

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.080
you look into the
mirror, and you say,

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.650
I am the shit, to yourself.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:11.290
And then you go back out.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.480
And then it's all good.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.820
So things like that, you know?

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.930
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Cool.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:18.530
Over there.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.480
AUDIENCE: So what is the
next step for you from here?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.480
LU LI: So you know what?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.340
The book was
literally something--

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.530
I mean, I didn't have any
motives behind the book,

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.460
to be honest, right?

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.810
I mean, I published it because
I felt the content was needed.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.107
And then I was engaging with
the community at the time.

00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:35.440
So for me, I'm obviously super
happy to promote the book

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.070
all the time, because I think
it's valuable content to share.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.620
But you know, I'm not
[INAUDIBLE],, basically.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.890
There's no gigantic
other thing that is

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.460
kind of coming behind the book.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.500
It's literally just kind of
for the universe, really.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.620
And so my businesses is around
building this infrastructure

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.760
for female founders, right?

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.343
And the book is
obviously one element.

00:31:56.343 --> 00:32:00.240
It's one product
that you can get.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.760
And the other product, the
thing that I want to scale,

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.720
is this online-to-offline
sort of infrastructure

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.880
that includes the
online community, where

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.120
you can make connections
and share knowledge

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.480
and experiences, plus then
sort of seeing everybody

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:22.030
in real life in those co-working
spaces that I'm creating.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.650
So that's kind of the business
that I'm looking to build.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.300
And at the moment, we have
the first one in Old Street.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.590
And we're looking
to kind of then

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:37.510
grow that and open more
spaces in West London.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:41.560
I'm actually thinking about
Bali, because why not?

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.390
Who doesn't want to
work in Bali, right?

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.970
And other locations, yeah.

00:32:47.685 --> 00:32:49.060
XIAOCHEN ZHANG:
We're going to do

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.690
one more question, and then--

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:52.190
yeah.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.830
AUDIENCE: Hi, Lu.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.350
Thank you for joining.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.720
This is truly amazing, something
that I would dream to publish,

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.910
but I'm glad you beat me to it.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.590
The question I have
for you is, were

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:07.020
there anyone, or any
founders, that you reached out

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.209
to where you thought
they might never respond,

00:33:10.209 --> 00:33:12.000
and when they did, you
were kind of nervous

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.560
or, like, oh my god,
they actually responded?

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.900
Like a Sheryl Sandberg, or--

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.570
LU LI: Yeah, I tried to
reach out to Sheryl Sandberg,

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.846
but didn't get far
enough, I suppose.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.790
I don't know.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:35.610
It's a difficult question to
answer, because I personally,

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.550
honestly think that every woman
who has achieved something

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.560
almost has a moral
obligation to do that.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.770
So therefore, you
know, I think that when

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.970
people responded positively,
it was like, yes, you get it.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:48.140
Awesome.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.100
Let's do this.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:49.710
Right?

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:51.480
Like, I wasn't being
like, oh my gosh,

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.220
she accepted, and
this is so amazing.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.900
You know, it's fine.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.530
Yeah, because in
that way, I mean,

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.710
I felt a bit entitled,
if that makes sense.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.276
In a non sort of
like, oh, you know,

00:34:06.276 --> 00:34:07.900
I think you must do
this kind of thing.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.525
But I actually genuinely
think that, you know,

00:34:11.525 --> 00:34:13.710
successful people have
a moral obligation

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.760
to share their knowledge
with the future generation.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.880
So I was generally
happy that they

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:26.659
got it and they were
supporting me on that journey.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:28.344
And I think I was also kind of--

00:34:28.344 --> 00:34:30.260
I think what I was
surprised about is actually

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.429
the surrounding support, right?

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.179
One thing I forgot to
mention is actually,

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:39.388
I also had a nomination process
to find interesting women.

00:34:39.388 --> 00:34:41.429
And a lot of people actually
used that, actually,

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.400
because sometimes you don't
know the women yourself,

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.719
but their previous PA or
their marketing manager

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.520
is now a female founder herself.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.350
And then she knows me,
so she would sort of

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.929
suggest her previous
boss, and stuff like that.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.250
So that, I actually
felt, was really nice.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.840
That got me and was like,
oh, this is really exciting.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.470
I didn't know you were doing--

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.015
so yeah.

00:35:06.015 --> 00:35:06.890
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: Cool.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:07.390
Great.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.732
So thank you, Lu Li for
sharing the experience--

00:35:09.732 --> 00:35:10.440
LU LI: Thank you.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.020
XIAOCHEN ZHANG: --and book.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.590
And thank you,
everyone, for coming

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.714
and all the good questions.

00:35:13.714 --> 00:35:15.150
I hope you guys enjoy the book.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:18.870

afterwards for a few questions,

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.380
So yeah, see you guys next time.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.270
Thank you so much.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.760
