copy the DNA well that is when a cell is
 

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.640
copy the DNA well that is when a cell is
going to divide you need to take the

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:18.650
going to divide you need to take the
 

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.470
going to divide you need to take the
netting information in the first cell

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480

and you need to make two copies that can

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:23.270
and you need to make two copies that can
 

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.930
and you need to make two copies that can
go to the two daughter cells and in

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:25.940
go to the two daughter cells and in
 

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.030
go to the two daughter cells and in
order to do this you need to replicate

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040
order to do this you need to replicate
 

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.090
order to do this you need to replicate
or copy DNA and what happens then is

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:31.100
or copy DNA and what happens then is
 

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.850
or copy DNA and what happens then is
that the double-stranded DNA is split

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:34.400
proteins can do is that they can
 

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.699
proteins can do is that they can
recognize a mismatch you see this red

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:36.709
recognize a mismatch you see this red
 

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:38.140
recognize a mismatch you see this red
blue thing here is supposed to be a

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.150
blue thing here is supposed to be a
 

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.100
blue thing here is supposed to be a
mismatch it can recognize a mismatch and

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.110
mismatch it can recognize a mismatch and
 

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.460
mismatch it can recognize a mismatch and
then it

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:42.470
then it
 

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.400
then it
also recognize which of the two strands

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:45.410
also recognize which of the two strands
 

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.040
also recognize which of the two strands
that are newly synthesized because you

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.050
that are newly synthesized because you
 

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.750
that are newly synthesized because you
were able to correct the strand that's

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760
were able to correct the strand that's
 

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.550
were able to correct the strand that's
newly synthesized you don't want to

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560
newly synthesized you don't want to
 

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.430
newly synthesized you don't want to
change the old strand and then you

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440
change the old strand and then you
 

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.590
change the old strand and then you
cleaved a newly synthesized strand and

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600
cleaved a newly synthesized strand and
 

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.930
cleaved a newly synthesized strand and
you take away the piece of DNA

00:10:58.930 --> 00:10:58.940
you take away the piece of DNA
 

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.520
you take away the piece of DNA
containing the mismatch and then the DNA

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:03.530
containing the mismatch and then the DNA
 

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.890
containing the mismatch and then the DNA
is simply synthesized again and we get

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:05.900
is simply synthesized again and we get
 

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.500
is simply synthesized again and we get
the correct strand this is a very

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:08.510
the correct strand this is a very
 

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.780
the correct strand this is a very

medicine yes as I mentioned it's very

00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:58.950
medicine yes as I mentioned it's very
 

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.350
medicine yes as I mentioned it's very
important that we have DNA repair in

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360
important that we have DNA repair in
 

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.850
important that we have DNA repair in
unfortunate individuals that have

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860
unfortunate individuals that have
 

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.340
unfortunate individuals that have
defective DNA repair they died early or

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:09.350
defective DNA repair they died early or
 

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.890
defective DNA repair they died early or
have serious medical problems so we have

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900
have serious medical problems so we have
 

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.410
have serious medical problems so we have
to have the energy apart on the other

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:15.420
to have the energy apart on the other
 

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.350

hand if we treat the cancer cell with an

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360
hand if we treat the cancer cell with an
 

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.010
hand if we treat the cancer cell with an
anti-cancer drug that often acts by

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020
anti-cancer drug that often acts by
 

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.160
anti-cancer drug that often acts by
damaging the DNA of the cancer cell so

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.170
damaging the DNA of the cancer cell so
 

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.380
damaging the DNA of the cancer cell so
we try to kill the cancer cell and the

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:27.390
we try to kill the cancer cell and the
 

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.130
we try to kill the cancer cell and the
cancer cell fights back by DNA repair so

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140
cancer cell fights back by DNA repair so
 

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.280
cancer cell fights back by DNA repair so
we have to address to the sword we need

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:34.290
we have to address to the sword we need
 

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.130
we have to address to the sword we need
a DNA repair but we don't like it that

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140
a DNA repair but we don't like it that
 

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:42.080
a DNA repair but we don't like it that
the cancer cells can repair the DNA so

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.090
the cancer cells can repair the DNA so
 

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.850
the cancer cells can repair the DNA so
we have to understand the mechanism so

cells and as I said there or there are
 

00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:21.570
cells and as I said there or there are
definitely other forms repair which are

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:21.580
definitely other forms repair which are
 

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.379
definitely other forms repair which are
also very important so this is what this

00:28:25.379 --> 00:28:25.389
also very important so this is what this
 

00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:28.080
also very important so this is what this
or these are very early discoveries and

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.090
or these are very early discoveries and
 

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.690
or these are very early discoveries and
they opened up the field I understand

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:30.700
they opened up the field I understand
 

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.700
they opened up the field I understand
that make means that this could exist

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:32.710
that make means that this could exist
 

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:37.200
that make means that this could exist
well when were they made so in the the

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.210
well when were they made so in the the
 

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.389
well when were they made so in the the
first discoveries were made by tomas

00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399
first discoveries were made by tomas
 

00:28:39.399 --> 00:28:42.240
first discoveries were made by tomas
lindahl and that was in in the early 70s

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.250
lindahl and that was in in the early 70s
 

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.090
lindahl and that was in in the early 70s
that he made his discoveries then the

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:45.100
that he made his discoveries then the
 

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.590
that he made his discoveries then the
transformation in understanding how it

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600
transformation in understanding how it
 

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.299
transformation in understanding how it
works holes in human cells that took

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:48.309
works holes in human cells that took
 

00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:51.960
works holes in human cells that took
another 10 20 years before sort of that

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:51.970
another 10 20 years before sort of that
 

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.580
another 10 20 years before sort of that
come to I wouldn't say completion

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:53.590
come to I wouldn't say completion
 

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.000
come to I wouldn't say completion
because it still studied the others or

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:57.010
because it still studied the others or
 

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.090
because it still studied the others or
did their breakthroughs in in in the 80s

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:00.100
did their breakthroughs in in in the 80s
 

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.990
did their breakthroughs in in in the 80s
and middle of date is late late 80s

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000
and middle of date is late late 80s
 

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.580
and middle of date is late late 80s
that's what wounded at the breakthroughs

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:05.590
that's what wounded at the breakthroughs
 

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.970
that's what wounded at the breakthroughs
and but also them was also son ER and

knowledge from the e.coli bacteria into
the mammalian system and then we are in

00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399
the mammalian system and then we are in
 

00:29:15.399 --> 00:29:20.460
the mammalian system and then we are in
late 90s and in early 2000 even so thank

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:20.470
late 90s and in early 2000 even so thank
 

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:25.680

you yes please over there you're getting

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:25.690
you yes please over there you're getting
 

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:30.430
you yes please over there you're getting
a microphone

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440
 

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.790
and just a short question why did it

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:34.800
and just a short question why did it
 

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.060
and just a short question why did it
take so long for you to give them this

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:38.070
take so long for you to give them this
 

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:42.860
take so long for you to give them this
price yeah that's a question that's of

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:42.870
price yeah that's a question that's of
 

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:44.960
price yeah that's a question that's of
course it's difficult to answer but each

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:44.970
course it's difficult to answer but each
 

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.720
course it's difficult to answer but each
year we have a number we have close to

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:47.730
year we have a number we have close to
 

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:52.250
year we have a number we have close to
400 nominations so it's if we price

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260
400 nominations so it's if we price
 

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.680
400 nominations so it's if we price
cannot win every year I guess that's the

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:54.690
cannot win every year I guess that's the
 

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:58.670
cannot win every year I guess that's the
simplest answer it is also fair to say

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:58.680
simplest answer it is also fair to say
 

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.520
simplest answer it is also fair to say
that this story has unraveled step by

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:01.530
that this story has unraveled step by
 

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.970
that this story has unraveled step by
step and and the enormous importance has

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:04.980
step and and the enormous importance has
 

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.280
step and and the enormous importance has
become clear more and more during more

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:07.290
become clear more and more during more
 

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:15.710
become clear more and more during more
recent years as tomas lindahl is a

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720
recent years as tomas lindahl is a
 

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.630
recent years as tomas lindahl is a
member of the academy could he have been

common is it that you give a prize to a

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:22.680
common is it that you give a prize to a
 

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.330
common is it that you give a prize to a
member of the Academy oh that's very

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.340
member of the Academy oh that's very
 

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.890

rare indeed has it happened before I

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:29.900
rare indeed has it happened before I
 

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:34.850
rare indeed has it happened before I
think so I the last prize in chemistry

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860
think so I the last prize in chemistry
 

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:40.400
think so I the last prize in chemistry
was in 1948 to Ornette azaleas and I

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:40.410
was in 1948 to Ornette azaleas and I
 

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.850
was in 1948 to Ornette azaleas and I
wasn't even a member then he was

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860
wasn't even a member then he was
 

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.380
wasn't even a member then he was
probably a member but I don't know how

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:45.390
probably a member but I don't know how
 

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.790
probably a member but I don't know how
it was hell tomas lindahl has not

might also be mutated and that can be

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:05.910
might also be mutated and that can be
 

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.460
might also be mutated and that can be
caused by both by external agents like

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:09.470
caused by both by external agents like
 

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.280

which happens at the quite high

00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:25.349
which happens at the quite high
 

00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:29.780

frequency actually we also get mutations

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:29.790
frequency actually we also get mutations
 

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.300
frequency actually we also get mutations
in the DNA when we replicate the DNA so

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:32.310
in the DNA when we replicate the DNA so
 

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:34.280
in the DNA when we replicate the DNA so
every time a cell is divided we need to

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:34.290
every time a cell is divided we need to
 

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:37.640
every time a cell is divided we need to
create two new copies of the DNA and

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:37.650
create two new copies of the DNA and
 

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.609
create two new copies of the DNA and
together these different sort of sources

00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619
together these different sort of sources
 

00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:43.550
together these different sort of sources
or mutations and damage can create a

higher human cells and that we have very

00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619
higher human cells and that we have very
 

00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:34.280
higher human cells and that we have very
similar systems that take care of damage

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:34.290
similar systems that take care of damage
 

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.970

to to our DNA

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:36.980
to to our DNA
 

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.190
to to our DNA
but the repair system is not enough we

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200
but the repair system is not enough we
 

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.170
but the repair system is not enough we
still have diseases cost but by the

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:43.180
still have diseases cost but by the
 

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.720
still have diseases cost but by the
damage of DNA how big part of the

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:46.730
damage of DNA how big part of the
 

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:51.520

imitations how to put this I mean if you

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400
imitations how to put this I mean if you
 

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.609
imitations how to put this I mean if you
think about cancer I would say that all

00:41:03.609 --> 00:41:03.619
think about cancer I would say that all
 

00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:07.480
think about cancer I would say that all
forms of cancers start with a mutation

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:07.490
forms of cancers start with a mutation
 

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:14.500
forms of cancers start with a mutation
or a DNA damage that's how they start we

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:14.510
or a DNA damage that's how they start we
 

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.730
or a DNA damage that's how they start we
know so I mean that's how important is

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:18.740
know so I mean that's how important is
 

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.180
know so I mean that's how important is
this and if you don't have repair system

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.190
this and if you don't have repair system
 

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.390
this and if you don't have repair system
that take care of the damages as they as

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400
that take care of the damages as they as
 

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.089
that take care of the damages as they as
they occur the frequency of cancer for

they occur the frequency of cancer for
 

00:41:28.099 --> 00:41:30.060
they occur the frequency of cancer for
example becomes much much higher and

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:30.070
example becomes much much higher and
 

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:34.599
example becomes much much higher and
there are diseases where you have where

00:41:34.599 --> 00:41:34.609
there are diseases where you have where
 

00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:36.640
there are diseases where you have where
you have disturbed

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:36.650
you have disturbed
 

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.560
you have disturbed
repair mechanisms they don't work as

themself mutated and that then you get

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:42.980
themself mutated and that then you get
 

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.069

develop different types of tumors and
 

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.440
develop different types of tumors and
they often die from m'ling melanoma or

limitations is also something that's
 

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:49.220
limitations is also something that's
probably needed so even if the cells try

thing one important retort radiation
 

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:41.360
thing one important retort radiation
does is that it induces breaks in DNA so

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:41.370
does is that it induces breaks in DNA so
 

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:45.680
does is that it induces breaks in DNA so
it breaks down the DNA in cancer cells

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:45.690
it breaks down the DNA in cancer cells
 

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:48.500
it breaks down the DNA in cancer cells
and breaking down the DNA means that we

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:48.510
and breaking down the DNA means that we
 

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.780
and breaking down the DNA means that we

different pharmaceutical industries that
are looking into this and I think there

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:38.910
are looking into this and I think there
 

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:40.940
