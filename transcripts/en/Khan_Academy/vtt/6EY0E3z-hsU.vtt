00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.550
We're on problem 51.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.970
And they say, a diagram from
a proof of the Pythagorean

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.890
theorem is pictured below.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.150
And they they say, which
statement would not be used in

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.310
the proof of the Pythagorean
theorem?

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.620
So since they have drawn this
diagram out, I think we might

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.320
as well just kind of do the
proof and then we can look at

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.290
their choices and see which
ones kind of match

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.890
up to what we did.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.380
Hopefully, they do
it the same way.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.140
And this is a pretty
neat proof of

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.530
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.360
I don't think I've
done it yet.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.610
So I might as well do it now.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.130
Well, let's figure out
what the area of this

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.040
large square is right.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.580
Well there's two ways to think
about it you could just say,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.760
OK, this is a square.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.250
That's a, that's b.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.300
Well this is going
to be b as well.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.320
This is going to be a as well.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.480
So the area of the square is
going to be the length of one

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.450
of its sides squared.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.230
So we could say the
whole square's

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470
area is a plus b squared.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.960
And that's equal to a squared
plus 2ab plus b squared.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.780
Fair enough.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.892
Now we can also say that the
area of this larger square,

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:15.090
and it's a bit of an optical
illusion, it looks like it's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.910
tilted to the left because
of the way it's drawn.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.800
But anyway, that the area of
this larger square is also the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.920
area of these four triangles
plus the area of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560
this smaller square.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.580
So this, the area of the
larger square, which we

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.720
figured out just by taking one
side of it and squaring it,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.700
that should be equal
to the area of the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.190
four smaller triangles.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.200
So there's four of them.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.670
And what's the area
of each of them.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.130
Let's see, let's just
pick this one.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.640
1/2 base times height.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.410
So it's 1/2 times a times b.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.710
So 1/2 ab is one of these and
I multiply by 4 to get all

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.980
four of these triangles.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.970
And then we want to add the area
of this inside square.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.820
And that's just going
to be c squared.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.090
So plus c squared.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.150
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:19.400
So you get a squared plus 2ab
plus b squared is equal to 4

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.440
times 1/2 is 2ab
plus c squared.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.390
Well, we could subtract
2ab from both

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.820
sides of this equation.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.360
The top and the bottom of
this equation the way

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.460
I've written it.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.750
But if we do that, subtract 2ab
from there, subtract 2ab

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.380
from there, and you're left with
a squared plus b squared

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.680
is equal to c squared, which
is the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.170
And we've proved it.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.100
So let's see which of their
choices matches what we did.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.170
OK, which statement would not
be used in the proof of the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.550
Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.460
The area of a triangle
equals 1/2 ab.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.720
We used that.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.060
The four right triangles
are congruent.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.650
No, we used that.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.850
The area of the inner square is
equal to half of the area

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.220
of the larger square.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.260
We didn't use that.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.560
I think this is the
one that would not

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.330
be used in the proof.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.500
Choice D, the area of the larger
square is equal to the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.790
sum of the squares of the
smaller square and the four

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.260
congruent triangles.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.380
No, that that was the
crux of the proof.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.280
So we definitely used that.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.180
So C is our answer.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.980
That's the statement
that would not

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.230
be used in the proof.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.910
I'm learning to copy and
paste ahead of time.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.640
So I don't waste your time.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.410
All right, a right triangle's
hypotenuse has length 5.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.570
If one leg has length 2,
what is the length

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.820
of the other leg?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.390
Pythagorean theorem, x squared
plus 2 squared is equal to 5

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.490
squared, because 5 is
the hypotenuse.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.810
x squared plus 4
is equal to 25.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.660
Subtract 4 from both sides.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.610
x squared is equal to 21.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.080
So x is equal to the
square root of 21.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.560
So choice B.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.959
Next question.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.089
A new pipeline is being
constructed to reroute oil

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:26.430
flow around the exterior of a
national wildlife preserve.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.860
I guess that's the national
wildlife preserve.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.210
The plan showing the old
pipeline and the new route is

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.820
shown below.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.000
OK, how many extra miles will
the oil flow once the new

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.270
route is establised.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.570
So the new route is going to
be 60 miles plus 32 miles.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.060
So the new route is 92 miles.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.080
So what was the old route?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.360
Well the old route was the
hypotenuse of this triangle.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.250
So we could say, let's
call that x.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:10.590
60 squared plus 32 squared
is equal to x squared.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.150
Because that's the hypotenuse.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.450
And these numbers, that's a bit
of a pain to deal with.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.180
Maybe if I can factor out
something here I can make it

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.980
more interesting.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.510
So I don't have to multiply out
60 squared and 32 squared

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.260
and all of the rest.
Well, let me see.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.175
Both of those are
divisible by 4.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.260
So then I would have 15 and 8.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.290
Yeah, that still doesn't
make it that useful.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.270
So I'll just multiply
them out.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.090
So this is 3600.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.700
At 32 squared, let's
see, 32 times 32.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.750
2 times 32 is 64.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.200
3 times 2 is 6.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.730
3 times 3 is 9.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.770
So it's 1024.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.360
Plus 1024 is equal
to x squared.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.120
So let me just switch
both sides.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:23.040
x squared is equal to 3600
plus 1024 is 4624.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.413
Let me see if I can get
an approximate.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.260
So x is going to be the square
root of this thing right here.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.840
So let's see if I can get
a handle at least on the

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.940
magnitude of where
this would be.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.370
So 20 times 20 is 400.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.050
So this is way too small.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.740
60 times 60 is 3600.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.290
So 68 times 68, this
looks right.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.020
Especially because 8 times
8 should end in a 4.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.190
Let me try that out.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.250
68 times 68.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.130
8 times 8 is 64.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:07.370
8 times 6 is 48 plus 6 is 54.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.740
6 times 8, 48.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:16.680
6 times 6, 36 plus 4 is 40.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.300
4624.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.090
So x is 68.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.285
Oh, I used 68, I shouldn't have.
Because they don't want

00:07:28.285 --> 00:07:30.820
to know how long was
the old pipeline.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.760
That's 68.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.570
It just happened to be
one of the choices.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.770
That's just to make
sure that you read

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:36.540
the question properly.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.740
But they want to know how
much longer is going

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.680
to be the new pipeline.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.870
So the new one was 92.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.800
And the old one is 68.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.150
Good thing they had that
number there so I

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.260
could try it out.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.690
That was the square
root of 4624.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.690
So how much longer
is the new one?

00:07:52.690 --> 00:08:05.200
Well 92 minus 68 that's
24 miles.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.990
So choice A.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.660
Not choice B.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.980
B is how long the old
pipeline was.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.500
We want to know how much longer
the new route is.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.500
That was tricky.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.200
Well not tricky, but I kind of
fell for it by forgetting what

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.280
the question was about.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.040
Anyway, next question.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.000
Marcia is using a straightedge
and compass to do the

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.790
construction below.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.230
Interesting.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.330
Which best describes the
construction Marcia is doing.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
So, I assume when they
say construction

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.690
she's drawing something.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.500
Let's see what it looks like.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.230
It looks she's taking her
compass, she's probably

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.220
putting one of the points
here, she put one of the

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.220
points there and then she
kind of drew this arc.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.420
And then it looks like she put
the point there and then she

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.110
drew that arc.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.370
And then she put the point
here and drew that arc.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:58.110
And then put the point there
and drew that arc.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.050
And the end result, it seems
like the reason why she picked

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.580
this point here is it goes
through this line L.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.950
So she's probably trying to find
another point here, so

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.290
that she can draw
another line.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.600
Because they say she
has a straightedge.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.060
A straightedge is to
draw these lines.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.850
A compass is to draw
these curves.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:20.800
So if she were to draw another
line between these two points,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.970
it looks something like
that, then she would

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.320
have parallel lines.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.960
The reason why she would have
parallel lines is because

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.640
these would be corresponding
angles and

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.900
they would be congruent.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.020
And so if you have a transversal
the corresponding

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.700
angles are congruent, you're
dealing with parallel lines.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.930
So my read of this question is
that she's probably trying to

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.630
draw a line that is
parallel to L.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.230
A line through P parallel
to line L.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.960
Yeah, that's what I think
she's trying to do.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.710
All right, choice A.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.820
55.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.525
Given angle A.

00:09:59.525 --> 00:10:01.700
So given this angle.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.870
What is the first step in
constructing the angle

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.130
bisector of angle A?

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.060
OK, well actually I've
never done this.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.000
But I can assume that
if I have a compass.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.900
You know what a compass is,
it has those two points.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.230
One of them is like
a pivot point.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.580
It looks something like this.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.330
It looks like it has a little
pivot point, and then on the

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.400
other side you can stick
your pencil.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.040
And you can adjust it up here.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.870
And the bottom line, you pivot
around this and then you can

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.130
draw circles of arbitrary
radiuses.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.260
It seems like that's
what they did here.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.140
So if I want to draw the angle
bisector of a, just thinking

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.920
about it, it seems I could put
the pivot point here, and then

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.930
I can put the pencil and
I can draw this circle.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.110
And really, as long as I just
find the two points that it

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.160
intersects those two lines
or those two rays,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:04.810
then I'll be fine.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:05.950
And I could have done
it anywhere.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.830
I could have done it here.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.780
I could have done it out here.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.480
They just picked
points B and C.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.270
And then from each of those
points, you can

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.090
put your pivot here.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.670
If you put your pivot here, and
then you were to draw a

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.830
circle around that, you
would have gotten

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.250
this one right here.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.560
And then if you were to put your
pivot point right here,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.080
draw a circle, you would
be able to draw that.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.000
And then where they interect,
that would that would give you

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.620
an indication of where the
angle bisector is.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.240
And you could then draw that
line to where they intersect.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.530
So let's see, they say what is
the first step in constructing

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.730
the angle bisector of angle a.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.030
So they say draw ray AD.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.640
Well that seems like that
would be the last step.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.280
Then you're done.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.330
Draw AD, that is the
angle biector.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:55.590
Draw a line segment connecting
points B and C.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.020
No, that's useless.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.320
You don't need a line segment.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.710
I mean even what they have
drawn, that's an arc.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.490
It's not a line.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.960
From points B and C, draw
equal arcs that

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.280
intersect at D.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.750
That was the second step.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.960
You have to have points B and
C before you can draw those

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.070
equal arcs.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.590
From point A, draw an arc that
intersects the side of the

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.100
angle at points B and C.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:19.920
Yeah, that's what we said.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.780
That was the first step.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.090
Put your pivot here, and use
your pencil to draw the arc.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.720
You say OK, this point
and this point.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.710
So that would be
the first step.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.990
D.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.990
And I'm all out of problems
and I'm out of time.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.810
See you in the next video.
