00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
She's reviewing Godard's movie and she says :

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.380
"It's as if a couple of movie-crazy young Frenchmen

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.660
were in a coffee- coffee house

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.400
and they've taken a banal American crime novel

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.339
and they're making a movie out of it based not on the novel,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.233
but on the poetry that they read between the lines."

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:30.599
And when I read that, I was like : "that's my aesthetic"

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.939
"That's what I want to do."

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.370
"That is what I want to achieve."

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.910
Well, he was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1963 to a woman who was half Cherokee and half southern white.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.689
She named him after Burt Reynolds' character, "Quint", in Gunsmoke.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.440
They moved to Los Angeles when he was two and she took him to the movies regularly.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.760
When I was a really really little boy like, you know, four or something like that.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.460
I'd watch TV, movies with my stepfather.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.780
We're watching some movie and he's : "Oh, could you see that guy right there? That's Thomas Mitchell."

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.280
"He was the father in the original "Swiss Family Robinson" from the 30's."  -"Oh, really? Huh."

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.100
And then we see some other : "See, that's Roddy McDowall. He's a really good actor, I like him."

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.740
"And he was a star even when he was a little boy !"

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.660
I actually thought : "Oh, I guess that's what happens. When you get to be an adult you become a movie genius !"

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.840
So I'd better start, like, get all prepared !"

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.120
And Quentin would go on to tell you who the supporting cast was, who the DP was...

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.040
At the store, putting films in people's hands and arguing my points

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.100
to why this movie was good or why that movie was bad.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.452
There was a whole aspect of me getting in touch with an audience beyond just myself.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.080
Of what actually worked with audiences and what they liked.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.160
You want to see three movies that, if I were gonna be, like, trapped on a desert island

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.380
and I could go to video archives before I was gonna get trapped on a desert island,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.680
what three movie I would take with me.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.800
One of the movies would be Brian De Palma's "Blow Out".

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.080
John Travolta, by the way, gives one of the best performances of all time in this film.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.740
And he just went into this : "Do you know what Francois Truffaut thought about you?"

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.200
"Do you know what Pauline Kael thought about you?"

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.619
"Do you know how brilliant you were in the blahblah..." and I'm almost in tears now, thinking "well, yeah"

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.520
"But I didn't know what someone cared that much about all that", you know, and clearly he did.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.720
Well, I was like look, uh, I think he's a terrific actor

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.539
I think what you should do is you should watch him in Brian DePalma's "Blow Out" and if you don't think he's a terrific actor,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.220
then maybe we should talk about "should we do this movie together?".

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.720
He decided that there's only one person that can play that role.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.180
And that's you.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.689
He has to fight with the studio because they don't want me in it, but he only wanted me.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.470
I wanna dance.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.820
That morning, I got her and John together in a trailer,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.540
and I showed them the dance sequence from this movie, "Bande Ã  part".

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.790
You know, that little, like, with the three of them :

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.180
And I go : "That's right. They're not dancers."

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.940
"They're not executing a dance perfectly, but (??) the greatest dancers in the world. They're having fun.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.700
They're not dancing well, but they're actually dancing great !

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.640
Because they're having fun and I'm enjoying watching them enjoying doing the dance.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.480
That's what I want you to do." And they've both got it. They've just, once they saw that, they just "Okay.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.389
I know exactly what you want. Let's do it."

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.739
For Vince's twist, I wanted him to :

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.810
But when Mia twists,

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.658
the image that I had in my mind was

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:44.789
the zsa zsa gabor cat from the Aristocats. And there's that one little scene where the Aristocats dance and she's like :

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.120
He's talked about how he loves certain scenes, classic scenes from other movies and what he's done is just rolled one after another.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:29.309
Godard is the one who taught me the fun and the freedom and the joy of breaking rules, you know.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.552
Just setting up a close-up on the back of somebody's head as opposed to, you know.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.880
And just fucking around with an entire medium.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.720
It's what it is, it's American vernacular, and Tarantino is able to listen to it very carefully,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.680
because the dialogue is getting to be more carefully written,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.060
more character-oriented and more interesting,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.840
instead of simply being easily subtitled for the foreign release.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.820
When a movie really, really does it to me,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.300
it's because it's made me feel many different emotions during the course of it

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.080
and especially if I can pull off contradictory emotions.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.199
I want to play you as an audience.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.380
I want to be the conductor and

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.140
you're my orchestra.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.480
And the sounds that I make you to make and the feelings I get you to feel,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.980
and then I stop you from feeling those feelings and I give you something else to feel.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.220
and then I stop you from feeling that and make you feel something else yet again.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.241
Well, if a director can do that, if a director can pull it off,

00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.560
well, that's a real lucky audience member

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.040
because you've really had an experience that night. You went to the movies.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.870
That was fuckin trippy.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.679
There's a French director named Jean-Pierre Melville

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.180
who came out in the 50s. He did a whole series of a crime films,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.160
always set in Paris or Marseille or something.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.630
They were basically the Warner Brothers Bogart Cagney films

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.320
Alright, but completely set to this French Parisian rhythm.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.818
But they do it with a whole different style and a whole different perspective,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.700
and here they basically reinvented the genre.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.160
I'm delivering the goods, but I'm also trying to, you know, reinvent it in a way.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.220
Quentin takes these genre elements and shifts them and in my perception

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.317
raises them on to a different level.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.300
Yes, he does utilize the genre

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.820
but that's not really what it is about.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.800
And in the Western section we find :

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.630
Howard Hawks' "Rio Bravo".

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.739
This is, as far as I'm concerned, another one of the greatest movies ever made.

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.760
Ricky Nelson is so cool in this movie.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.340
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at, Mr Wheeler.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.280
That's minding my own business.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.580
If you're really going to make the western genre really work its magic

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.220
then you've got to do your version of it.

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:04.623
I came up with a cool bit because actually Franco Nero's in the movie

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:08.280
and it's a sequence where we actually had the two Django's in the same frame,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.060
both Jamie Foxx and Franco Nero.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.940
I have a Franco look at him. Look him up and down. Ask him his name.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.789
Jamie says Django. "Can you spell it?"

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.650
And then he spells the whole thing

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.440
and then after he gets through spelling I had him say:

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.520
"The D is silent" and then Nero looks at him and says "I know".

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800
A real meta movie moment.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.359
I'm not only a big fan of the art film Western.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.009
You gotta still make a Western first. So I'm actually proud that my films,

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.150
as offbeat as they may be, and my take on the given genre,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.460
they still deliver the goods.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.040
If you like a Western, you might like mine.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.180
Since Quentin knows everything about every movie that's ever been made, just about,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.640
there's references in the script to a lot of great shots.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.760
"Taras Bulba", when Yul Brynner walks up to a guy that gives him a smart aleck response,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.160
and Yul Brynner pulls the guy on the horse.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.480
From "Wild Bill", there was a shot of a guy falling face-first in the mud and not saving himself.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.420
It would be silly for me to try to do a John Ford type movie now.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.220
You can appreciate them, but as far as actually being a piece that goes out and entertains the world,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.260
they were made for a different audience.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.009
They were made for a different America.

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:24.740
They were made- and particularly made for white people in the America of that time.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.640
You know, most of the Western directors that are really terrific all have their own version of the West.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.860
Corbucci had the most brutal,

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.630
violent,

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.167
bleakest West, and surreal.

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:38.080
And then using that fascist-led,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:44.300
bleak, barren, brutal, violent, surreal West as a jumping-off point.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.040
Well, what is the true American equivalent of that ?

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.040
And that would be being a slave in the (??)

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:57.380
So I wanted to do it like an exciting Western adventure and a genre movie first,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.760
that uses slavery and the antebellum South as a backdrop

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.423
in order to tell this adventure.

00:09:02.423 --> 00:09:05.120
And the adventure that he was down with and I was down with,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.900
is of a black male rising up,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.600
becoming a cowboy, becoming a spaghetti western hero,

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.479
becoming a folkloric hero and goes out and saves his woman.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.119
She's in the pit of hell and he's going to go and extract her from that.

00:09:20.119 --> 00:09:21.130
"Hey, little troublemaker."

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.140
I wanted to give black males and in particularly young black males,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.517
a black cowboy hero.

00:09:25.517 --> 00:09:26.760
And not just a fancified one,

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.860
he actually was a slave, and he was even doing it during slave times.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.480
And this is sort of like, you know,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.220
this is a Western for you. This is a hero.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.200
I watched for my father "The Searchers".

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.260
Yeah, to me, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" was my Western that was kind of the "dad and son" film.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.540
I think the conceit of the film, which I think is fantastic,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.840
is Uma Thurman is Clint Eastwood in "the Man with No Name".

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.140
I mean, she's holding this masculine pose

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.840
and she takes this whole rule of the samurai all the way through this film.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.000
It empowers girls by the fact that Uma Thurman is a female warrior.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.940
She's a female avenger.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.640
Right, revenge is like one of the classic staples in drama.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.780
Because what he does is take the other side of the feminine, the dark side,

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.180
and puts it in foreground constantly.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.460
She's not a victim. She's never a victim in this movie.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:01.544
I don't think "Roots" actually aged that well if you look at it 34 years later.

00:11:01.544 --> 00:11:02.839
The thing that really

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.680
gets me about "Roots", is you watch this whole thing,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.940
that's on for 16 hours or something,

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.500
and you're actually living the lives of these people

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.380
and putting yourself in that place.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.160
And if you remember the last episode of it,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.209
Lloyd Bridges is one of the most hateful of all the racist guys in the movie

00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:22.480
and there's Chicken George played by Ben Vereen,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.340
who's one of the guys that you've been following the most.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.220
At the end, they have Lloyd Bridges and they tie him to a tree

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.600
and Chicken George is going to whip him,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.060
he's gonna give him a peeling to end all peelings.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.480
And you've been waiting 16 hours for this

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.120
and naturally, he does the thing that they normally do in these movies,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.720
he's like "No, no, no,"

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.660
"I can't do that. That would make me as bad as you."

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.640
And when he said that,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.960
all over America, a hundred million people said:

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.900
"NO ! Whip his-"

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.740
He had it coming! He had it coming, it's about time for some payback!

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.703
Well, you don't have that problem with my movie.

00:12:08.703 --> 00:12:10.360
You get payback.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.620
It's really interesting that Quentin,

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:17.080
being the product of the culture that made Western possible at all,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.340
where, do you know, because it's the American West of course,

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.960
that Quentin would take the genre, once removed into the Italian

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.980
and bring it back to America.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.060
He takes like, a double turn.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.360
In the laser disc section, we find

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.680
the Criterion version of Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver".

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.660
With Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Martin Scorsese in the little bit,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.400
Cybill Shepherd, but no Harvey Keitel !

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.780
Which is very odd because he's one of the finest performances in this movie

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.340
as, we all know, "Sport".

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.740
"Taxi Driver", by Martin Scorsese,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.780
Howard Hawks' "Rio Bravo" and Brian De Palma's "Blow Out".

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.020
If they share one thing, what is it?

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.340
I don't know what they share...

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.820
You know what, other than-

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.820
major directorial vision.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.520
I started casting actors in Germany

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.540
and I wasn't finding anybody who quite had everything that I needed a hundred percent.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.279
They could do the poetry in this language, but they couldn't do the poetry in that language.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:24.479
I literally had a moment where I didn't think I was going to find it.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.280
I can just tell you the day that Christoph came,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.829
walked in the room, sat down, and read two scenes

00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:35.039
I remember thinking, and Laurence was sitting right next to me, go:

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.080
"We're making a movie."

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.760
I think, you know, Quentin, being a poet,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.620
uses language to create.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.900
So this character does the same thing.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.820
We leave out of the other war movies because in "Where Eagles Dare",

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.800
German is English, and apparently Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.220
speak German so magnificently great,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.320
all they have to do is put on a costume and they can hang out like at the general's club.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.200
Forget about the fact I don't buy it.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.180
It's also the fact that you've got, possibly one of the most suspenseful sequences here,

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.140
but you've pissing it away by English being German.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.340
Right now, one of the things that's nice about this process right now

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.380
is that it allows me to be analytical and I actually start seeing what it is I've done.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.820
So I took the scene where Mr. White brings in Mr. Orange to the warehouse

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.580
and Mr. Orange wants them to take him to a hospital.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.100
It seems like a very obvious scene.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.300
The very basic things,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.960
especially from where Mr. Orange is coming from,

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.480
"I'm dying and I want to go to the hospital".

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.640
But just in writing those words, just all this stuff just started pouring out.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.300
"Please hold me"

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.040
That was when I realized it was a father/son story going on

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.960
and all these weird connections that happen later,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.620
I mean just little things in the case of "Reservoir Dogs", Mr. White keeps saying

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.760
"When Joe gets here,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.500
which should be in time now,

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.540
he's gonna help you out,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.620
he's gonna take care of you."

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.740
What happens when Joe gets here, he goes to kill him.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.500
And Joe is Mr. White's version of a father, and all this kind of stuff.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.940
So I finished it off, the writing, this subtexting about that one scene

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.620
and I go "Wow, there's a lot there,

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.680
that was a very interesting exercise.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.800
Now I never need to do that ever again. I don't want to know these things.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.510
I don't want to know it's a father-son story. I want to keep it up top.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.000
I want to keep it about the scenario, because now I know it's there."

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.340
When you go to a movie and you see a certain sequence,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.660
and if there is real cinematic power,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.100
and there are certain filmmakers out there that you feel were touched by God to make movies.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.700
There would be a combination of editing, and sound,

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.480
and usually it's like visual images connected with music or something.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.920
But when those things work

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.820
and they really connect

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.280
and you know, an example could be the final gunfight sequence in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.504
It's just like you forget to breathe.

00:15:40.504 --> 00:15:43.820
You are really transported to a different place

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.220
and music doesn't quite do that in on its own,

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.700
and novels don't quite do it, and the painting doesn't quite do it...

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.420
If you're in a theater and you're sharing the experience with a bunch of other people,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.660
ah, it's just, it's just truly, truly thrilling.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.100
I saw Quentin direct

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.800
and it was the most exciting, exhilarating thing I've ever seen.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.640
He loves his actors.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.820
There's already three of us in the close-up and he's focusing with delight on his face.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.480
I'm very lucky to have work with some monumental directors.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.180
I mean George Stevens, John Ford,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.900
Hitchcock.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.960
Though, I noticed about Quentin immediately:

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.260
I had never met such a passionate young director.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.340
I think Quentin, by his sheer outrageous,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.320
going against the rules and making something exciting,

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.080
will stand out more than any of the people I've told you I admire.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.662
Now the violent intensity of "Pulp Fiction" calls to mind other violent watershed films

00:16:45.662 --> 00:16:48.660
that were considered classics in their time and still are.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.460
Hitchcock's "Psycho".

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.700
Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" and Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange".

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.300
Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.600
and used the world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.860
That, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for "Pulp Fiction":

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.840
As all great films, it criticizes other movies.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.200
If you just truly love cinema with enough passion

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.860
and you really love it

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.760
then you can't help but make a good movie.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.520
When you're pleased to think, "you know, that take really worked. That was great."

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.820
He'd say : "Fantastic ! Let's go again."

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.500
We'd say "What ? Why we go again?"

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:34.400
"BECAUSE WE LOVE MAKING MOVIES !!!"

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.220
An extensive understanding of Final Cut Pro X was absolutely crucial to this video.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.980
All the advanced editing softwares have a lot of tricks and shortcuts that take time to learn on your own.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.060
High quality tutorials are the perfect way to get started with new software

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.560
or to really understand the more complicated parts of video editing.
