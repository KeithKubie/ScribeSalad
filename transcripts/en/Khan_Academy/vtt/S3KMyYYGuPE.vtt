00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.255
In the last video, we started
on this problem right here,

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:06.950
where we said let omega be a
complex cube root of unity,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.810
and omega cannot be equal to 1.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.960
And so we figured out what
all of the complex cube

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.500
roots of unity were.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.920
We figured out-- well, we
knew that 1 was one of them,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.484
and we used that to factor
out this third degree equation

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:20.150
right over here.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.510
And we figured out the other
roots, cube roots, of unity

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.660
were negative 1 plus or minus
the square root of 3i over 2.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.600
And we said, look, the problem
said let omega be one of the,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.700
or be a complex
cube root of unity.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.230
So I just picked it to
be the negative version.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.700
So I said let omega be
this thing right over here.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.850
Now, just to kind of explore
the space a little bit,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.380
we said, OK, what's
omega squared?

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.963
And we figured out that it was
actually the conjugate of this.

00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:49.250
It's the plus version of this.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.810
So we got omega squared
right over here.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.649
And then I kind of
wasted your time

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.690
a little bit because we
know what omega cubed is.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.580
We know that omega is
a cube root of unity,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.460
so omega cubed must be unity.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.852
But it wasn't harmful, I guess,
to go through the process.

00:01:03.852 --> 00:01:05.810
It shows you sometimes
my brain gets into a rut

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.570
and just does stuff that
it doesn't have to do.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.990
But we figured out-- we
multiplied this times omega

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.240
to show that, hey, it is
definitely equal to 1.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.730
So what we were able to
do is set up a situation,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.850
and we will use this to
think about the next part

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.900
of the problem.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.840
So omega is equal
to negative 1/2.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.030
Or maybe I should say
omega to the first power

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.590
is equal to negative 1/2 minus
the square root of 3 over 2i.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.480
Omega to the second
power-- let me

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.840
write it over here--
omega to the second power

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.950
is equal to negative 1 plus
the square root of 3 over 2i.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.310
And then omega to
the third power,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.814
and that was pretty
straightforward, is equal to 1.

00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:51.480
And I touched on this
in the last video.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.304
What is omega to
the fourth power?

00:01:53.304 --> 00:01:54.720
Omega to the fourth
power is going

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.710
to be omega to the
third times omega.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.230
So it's going to be omega again.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.391
So this is also
going to be-- let

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.890
me scroll to the
left a little bit--

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.070
this is also going to be
omega to the fourth power.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.950
Omega to the fourth
power is the same thing

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.520
as a omega to the first
power, which is this.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.100
Now, what's to the fifth power?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.450
Well, it's going to be omega
times the fourth power,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.170
so it's omega times this.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.560
Well, omega times this is
the same thing as omega

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.990
squared, so it's
going to be that.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.420
So this is omega
to the fifth power.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.180
And what's omega
to the sixth power?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.980
Well, that's just the same
thing as taking omega cubed

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.400
and squaring it, so this
is also going to be 1.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.860
So this is omega to the sixth.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.036
Or you could just use,
it's this times omega

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:35.660
because it's to the
fifth power, and we

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.622
saw that that's also equal to 1.

00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:40.580
And the reason why I went
up to the sixth power

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.030
is because, if you'll
remember the old problem,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.640
we're rolling a die.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.211
And on that die--
I'm assuming it's

00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:47.710
a normal six-sided
die-- we're going

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.780
to get values between 1 and 6.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.630
And we're going to take omega
to the different powers,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.552
and we're going to
see if it equals to 0.

00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:56.010
And we want to find
the probability

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.640
of this being equal to 0.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.400
So let me write this down.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.400
We want to find the probability
that omega-- and we're just

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400
using the omega that we
picked because they said

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.595
it's one of the complex
roots that isn't 1--

00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:11.470
so we want to find the
probability that omega

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.430
to the first die of the roll
plus omega to the second

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.230
die of the roll plus omega
to the third die of the roll,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.560
that when you take their
sum, that that is equal to 0.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.740
This is what we
need to figure out.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.550
So to figure this
out, let's just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.040
figure out what combinations
of powers of omega

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.540
will even add up to 0.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.900
How can we even
add them up to 0?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.826
I mean, they all have
to cancel out some way.

00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:42.200
And if you look
at them, it looks

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.900
pretty interesting of how
they might cancel out.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.229
If I take one version
of this, the only way

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:48.645
that they really
can cancel out is

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:52.650
if I take one version of
this, and add it to this,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.480
and then add it to this.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.210
Let me show you.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.800
If I take negative 1/2 minus
the square root of 3 over 2i,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.780
and I add it to this, and I
add it to this, negative 1/2

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.090
plus the square root of 3 over
2i, and then I add it to 1,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.380
and then I add it to this,
and then I add it to this,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.790
what do I get?

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.350
Well, you're going
to have this guy

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.380
and this guy are
going to cancel out.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.040
Negative 1/2 plus
negative 1/2 are

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.560
going to be equal to negative 1.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.710
You add negative 1 to 1,
it's going to be equal to 0.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.160
So essentially, what
it was asking us,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.200
what's the probability that I
get, for each of these terms,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.870
that I get one each of each
of these powers of omega?

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.730
Or another way of thinking
about this, what's

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.320
the probability-- so if
we think of it this way.

00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:56.300
Let's think of it this way.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.340
r1 could be equal to-- we're
going to get omega here,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.690
which is the same thing
as omega the fourth power.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.055
So r1 could be 1 or 4.

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:11.860
And this is in the situation
where the first one gives us

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.360
omega.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.680
The second one is omega
squared, or the second one

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.990
gives us this value.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.210
And then the third
one gives us 1.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.930
So r2 would be 5 or 2.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:31.895
And then r3 would
be equal to 3 or 6.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.852
Now, I want to be very clear.

00:05:36.852 --> 00:05:38.600
We could swap these around.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.775
There's actually six ways
that you could-- instead

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.764
of this being the first roll,
this roll could be 1 or 4,

00:05:45.764 --> 00:05:47.180
and then this one
could be 5 or 2,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.800
and then this one
could be 3 or 6.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.770
So there's actually
six ways of doing this,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.686
I guess you could say.

00:05:51.686 --> 00:05:55.300
You could permute these six
different ways, or 3 times

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.865
2 times 1.

00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:57.490
But we'll think about
that in a second.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.930
But assuming that we want this
way, where this first one is

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.110
going to evaluate to
this, and the second one

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.180
is going to evaluate to
this, and the third one

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.880
is going to evaluate
to this, what's

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.504
the probability
of that happening?

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:12.920
And then we're going to multiply
that 6 by 6 because there

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.470
are six ways to arrange
these terms right over here.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.270
So let's do that.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.120
So what's the probability
of that happening?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.120
Well, the probability
that r1 is a 1 or a 4,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.890
well, that's two
values out of six,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.920
so the probability is 1/3 there.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.330
The probability
that r2 is a 5 or 2,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.100
well, that's also
going to be 1/3.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.570
There's two values out
of a possible of six.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.165
The probability that
r3 is a 3 or a 6,

00:06:37.165 --> 00:06:38.860
only two possibilities there.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.950
So two out of six possible
faces of the die, so times 1/3.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.880
So the probability
that this first one is

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.780
going to evaluate to this
value right over here,

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.950
the second one is going
to evaluate to this value,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.140
and the third one is
going to evaluate to 1,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.000
is going to be 1/3 times 1/3
times 1/3, which is 1/27.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.665
And I touched on this
already, there's six ways.

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:11.980
You could rearrange
this six ways.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.580
You have three terms, and you're
putting them in three places.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.360
So in the first place, you
could put three of the terms.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.330
In the second place,
you have two terms

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.620
left that you could put.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.930
And in the last place, you
only have one term left.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.040
So there's 3 times 2 times 1
ways to arrange these things.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.030
We can arrange this 3 times
2 times 1 different ways,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.400
so there's six
different arrangements.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.850
The probability of each is 1/27.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.510
So the probability under
question, this thing over here,

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.380
there's six arrangements.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.530
There's six arrangements of
getting these things to be

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.320
added up in this way, and the
probability of each of them

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.200
is 1/27.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.580
So it's equal to
6/27, and if you

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.760
divide the numerator and
the denominator by 3,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.560
it's equal to 2/9.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.840
And we're done.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.930
It wasn't too bad, I think.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.250
The probability of getting
omega to the r1 plus

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.060
omega to the r2 plus omega to
the r3, where r1 and r2 and r3

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.230
are numbers obtained
from rolling

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.280
a fair die, the probability--
when you add all of these,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.526
it's going to be
equal to 0-- is 2/9.

00:08:20.526 --> 00:08:23.820
And I thought that was
a pretty neat problem.
