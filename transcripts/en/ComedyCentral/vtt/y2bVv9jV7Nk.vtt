00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.967 line:0%
- I'm Chris Cotton

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:02.969 line:0%
and I'm here at the
roast to Bruce Willis

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.337 line:0%
with the one and
only Flula Borg.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:05.238
- What did you say? Who?

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.339
- Flula Borg.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:07.173
- No, no.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.674
My name's Gruber.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:09.642
- (Chris) Some might say
your arch nemisis is here.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.743
What is your plans at the roast?

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.179
- I plan to look
John in the face

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.982
and say, "John, I'm
not dead big boy,

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:16.816
I'm here.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.750
"I'm ready.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.985
"Let's blow some **** up."

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.519 align:start size:81% position:19%
- At the end of
the movie, you die

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.921
because you fell off the roof,

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.155
but you're here tonight,

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.757 align:start size:84% position:16%
so how exactly did you
make it after that?

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.192
- Did you not see
the swimming pool?

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.027 align:start size:84% position:16%
- There was a
swimming pool, but-

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:29.195
- I'm an Olympian swimmer.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.529
Have you met Mark Spitz,

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.031
seven time gold medal winner?

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.367 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well, according to ...
- I am Mark Spitz.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:36.335
- I don't know if you can tell,

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:37.537
but you're making me very hot.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.539 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I noticed you're
perspiring very deeply.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.108 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Do you think it will be
better to rob an art museum,

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.542
or a jewelry store?

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.945 align:start position:0%
- It depends on how much
jewelry is in the jewelry store.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.848
If it's under 50 thousand
Euros, I won't touch it.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.049
- What about in pounds?

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.551
What if the money was in pounds?

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.385
- Oh I'll do pounds.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.353
I'll do pounds.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.186
- Okay, you'll do pounds.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:55.454
- Yeah, I'm into crypto.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:56.488
I'm getting very
deep into crypto,

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:58.357
- So did you invest in Bitcoin?

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:00.526 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I've created my
own coin, Grube coin.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.228
- So, I would like some Grubes.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.163 align:start size:94% position:6%
Can we talk about
investing in Grubes later.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.565
- Yes.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.533 align:start size:94% position:6%
I will give you my
exchange rate off the air.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.533
- Thank you sir.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.701
Would you change anything

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.169 align:start size:84% position:16%
about how you
executed your plan?

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.138
- Yes, I would have held
onto Holly Gennero's wrist,

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.807
not her wrist watch.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:15.908
- We all thought the same th-

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.812
- Gravity is, as
they say, a *****.
