Let's first briefly
review how the web works.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.370
The web browser and

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.200
the web server communicate using
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.860
The browser requests
documents through a URL.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.160
The server responds with document in
hypertext markup language, or HTML.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.782
Roots can include, not just the text,
but also graphics,

00:00:27.782 --> 00:00:31.585
video, audio, Postscript,
JavaScript, etc.

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:36.940
The browser displays HTML documents and
embedded graphics.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.030
It can run JavaScript and
other helper applications.
