ELIE BOU-ZEID: When I was
doing my undergraduate

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.770
education in mechanical
engineering, I was very

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.960
fascinated by fluid mechanics.


00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.120
Air and water are fluids and
they flow with a very complex

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.150
pattern in the environment.


00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.900
And I was drawn to apply this
knowledge of fluid mechanics

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:33.610
to environmental problems. The
aim of this project is to

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.940
study three aspects: energy,
water and carbon in the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.980
environment of Princeton.


00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.620
Locally, we would like our
sensing technologies in our

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.290
models to be combined to make
our buildings smarter and more

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.040
energy efficient.


00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.870
The idea of these meteorological
stations is

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.890
that you want to build
them as cheaply

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.000
and simply as possible.


00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.670
Currently, we have about 12
stations around the Princeton

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.190
campus, and we are looking
to increase

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.900
this to 20 or 30 stations.


00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.640
These are computer model
outputs of the surface

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.740
temperature over Princeton.


00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.960
What we see is first, Lake
Carnegie, which is hotter than

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.550
the Earth's surface during
the night, and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.140
cooler during the day.


00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.120
And if you look at the Earth's
surface, you will see that the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.690
vegetative parts always
cooler than the built

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.140
terrain or the buildings.


00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.200
If we keep zooming down, we can
get to the level of one

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.470
individual building.


00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.660
We can then simulate the air
flow around this building and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.420
observe how the presence of this
building will create a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.810
lot of turbulence around it,
which means a lot of mixing of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.040
pollutants and heat and other
things in built terrain.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.770
Global climate models will tell
you what's happening at

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.010
the very large scale.


00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.170
What we try to do is downscale
these climate predictions to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.360
the local level.


00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.990
So we want to see how a small
city will respond to a climate

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.440
change given by these global
climate models.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.260
The wonderful thing about
academia is that you wake up

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.840
in the morning, and you go to
work knowing that today, you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.990
will learn something new, or
you might even discover

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.940
something completely fascinating
every day.
