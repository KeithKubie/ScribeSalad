[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.170
<v 1>joining me today as a student and activist and the director of high school</v>

3
00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:11.230
outreach for turning point USA.
Kyle,
because you have,

4
00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:13.060
welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me on.

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.000
I am excited to have you here.
We've met a couple times,

6
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.860
we've done some events together.

7
00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:22.330
You are seemingly wise beyond your years.
Nice.

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.980
That's true.
All right,
let's get to it.
Well actually,
I mean in a weird way,

9
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:27.880
I guess you've been,

10
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.300
you've been sort of thrust into being wise beyond your years.

11
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:34.900
You are obviously a,
a survivor of the parkland shooting.
Uh,
as you know,

12
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.290
I had your classmate,
camera and Cassidy,

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm a couple of weeks ago and he kind of laid out,
uh,

14
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.580
what happened to him that day and subsequently everything that's happened.

15
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:45.910
So let's just start there because that's kind of what put you on the map.

16
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.250
<v 2>Okay.
I'll sort of preface it.
Um,
I don't like try to,</v>

17
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.660
I don't like to refer myself as a survivor because I wasn't in the building that

18
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:54.390
will shut into.
And I think that,
you know,

19
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.840
cheapens the of pain and tragedy that people who were in the building.
Uh,

20
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.470
so what happened with me that day,
it was fourth period.
Uh,
I was in,

21
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.060
I was in my fourth period class,
uh,
and all of a sudden the alarms a ring.

22
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.010
So we go into the hallway and we're walking out and we hear two,
like two little,

23
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.880
uh,
pops.
I don't know if two textbooks fell,
no fire,
fire works.

24
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.050
I really had no idea.
So we run back,
uh,
and I go and reach for,

25
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:22.080
for the,
uh,

26
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:26.140
the door to my classroom and the,
uh,
the teacher locked it.

27
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:27.310
So you go into a nearby room,

28
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:29.920
we get in there and we just hide a for two hours straight.

29
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:34.270
We just hear pops in ambulances.
I ended up,
so that was the freshman building.

30
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.540
And the entire time we had no idea what was going on.
Uh,

31
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.920
and then all throughout the entire time people,
uh,

32
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.300
immediately or just villainizing guns.
You know,

33
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:47.170
the second we got a second I got out of the,
uh,
the closet that I was in.

34
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.510
Kids are like,
we have to ban any our fifteens

35
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.310
<v 1>yeah,</v>

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.090
let's not jump into the political party cause it's interesting just listening to

37
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:54.871
you hear about that.

38
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:57.840
It's almost like the way you were describing it almost sounds like you weren't

39
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:01.100
even there.
Like it's just like a story that you were telling,
you know,

40
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.430
in a bizarre way.
So once,
okay,
so all of this happens,
you find out now they're,

41
00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:08.100
they're dead students.
I mean,
did you have friends who were killed?
And

42
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.630
<v 2>so we get it,
we get out of the closet.
Swat takes us out.
They put their,
you know,</v>

43
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.940
air fifteens and our faces take us out.

44
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:18.930
We have to put our hands on the person in front of us walking outside and all

45
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:19.501
throughout this,

46
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:23.560
the most disgusting thing was every single corner of the entire block

47
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:27.750
surrounding us was just filled with media cars.
It was just like jam packed.

48
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.820
And what I saw there was that whenever there was like someone crying or like a

49
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:37.100
moment of pain,
the media would just surround them in a capsulate them.
Uh,
and I,

50
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.430
I got home and I was really hoping that this wouldn't be like a politicized

51
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.590
spectacle with like mass,
uh,
you know,
media jumping the gun to everything.

52
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.850
Uh,
and sadly that was the case.
So when I was like sitting there in shock,

53
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:53.610
seeing the numbers rise on the screens for the death count,

54
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.390
it was like so insane to internalize like what it just occurred.
Because like,

55
00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:59.950
everyone's always,
you know,
this will never to my school.

56
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.180
How could this happen to my school?
Uh,

57
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.270
and the sad reality is it can happen with any school.
Like,
I mean,

58
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:08.320
Stoneman Douglas was in the most affluent,
low crime,
you know,

59
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.100
city I think in like southern Florida.
And this happened at our school.

60
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.880
<v 1>Did you know some of the kids that were killed?</v>

61
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.800
<v 2>Yeah,
I knew one girl.
Hold on.
Uh,
uh,
she was in a class of mine year back.</v>

62
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.520
<v 1>Yeah.
So what kind of time did you guys have to grieve?
Because that you're,</v>

63
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:27.870
you're already alluding to this,
but it was like,
it was as if the event happened,

64
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:30.330
the shooting happened and then it seemingly,

65
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.900
there was no grieving and then you guys were all over the television.

66
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.310
You were all over Twitter,

67
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:39.240
you at all political people using you guys and all sorts of different ways.

68
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.150
Just tell me a little bit about just kind of the grieving and trying to be able

69
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:42.780
to be,

70
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.780
how old do you know you're 17 trying to be 1615 1617 year old kids trying to

71
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:51.690
just survive something unimaginably horrible.

72
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.880
<v 2>Yeah.
I don't know how freshmen and sophomores have managed to go through this.</v>

73
00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:58.070
Like I'm at least a junior.
I was a junior at the time,

74
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.520
so I knew the school had a better in like somewhat of my self esteem was a

75
00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:04.460
little more build up more and a little bit more mature.
Uh,

76
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.280
but there was absolutely no time to grieve whatsoever.

77
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.430
Like a few days after the shooting,
they already bust this up to Tallahassee to,

78
00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:10.671
you know,

79
00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:14.660
kind of like push to like tug on the emotional heartstrings of Republicans to

80
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:17.070
pass legislation that they otherwise wouldn't have passed.
Who,

81
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:20.990
who is they in that equation?
So there are some,
uh,
members,
uh,

82
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.090
in the Florida Senate,
uh,
that like personally like coordinated buses,

83
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.490
um,
from Parkland to Tallahassee.

84
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.660
<v 1>Yeah.
And what were your parents saying or the friends,
you know,
friends,
parents,</v>

85
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:35.330
like it just seemed like the parents were almost gone now.

86
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.450
Now there are some of the parents that are a little more high profile that I,

87
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.360
that I see.
But it was as if you guys were just like taken,

88
00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:42.171
that's what it felt like.

89
00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:45.140
Suddenly we're seeing you on CNN and town halls and I want to talk a little bit

90
00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:45.950
about that.

91
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.370
But just like that you were just used all over the place with not even having a

92
00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:51.070
moment to just digest

93
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.600
<v 2>what happened.
So,
so here's how I don't think that necessarily.</v>

94
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.220
So,
so here's what I think what happened.
I think that the kids saw what happened.

95
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.700
They were shocked as they should be.
And I decided attack,
like we said,

96
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:07.170
this can't happen to anyone else ever again.
Let's do something,
you know,

97
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.420
what really occurred is that the mainstream media jumped,

98
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.740
jumped on this immediately,
uh,
and just like put it to like a national scale and,

99
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.580
and really used it to push a gun control agenda.

100
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.490
And that's why I started speaking out because I want it to represent the other

101
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:23.790
side of stone Douglas who doesn't believe in gun control.
Yeah.

102
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.510
So just tell me a little bit about you in high school before this.
Yeah.

103
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:28.660
Like we've jumped the line.

104
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.000
<v 1>What was Kyle,
cause you have like,
before this,</v>

105
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:35.860
cause I know you sort of as a political beast now in like a wickedly incisive

106
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.530
Twitter and like,
you know,
you've put on events that I've been part of and I,

107
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:42.890
and you're incredibly organized and connecting with great people and all that

108
00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:45.610
stuff,
which is,
tell me about the kid before that.

109
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.440
<v 2>I'll give you all the recap.
We'll give me the story of my life story.
Let's go.</v>

110
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.510
Yeah.
So,
uh,
so my parents,
uh,
came from Israel.

111
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.150
They immigrated here.
My Dad,
my mom served the IDF.
Uh,
they came here,

112
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.350
there's nothing worked their way up.
Uh,
and then when I was,
when I was at home,

113
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:06.620
they taught me Hebrew and English.
So we only spoke Hebrew at home.

114
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:10.100
So I'm fluent in Hebrew and they put me through school and I was always the

115
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:12.440
shortest kid in the grade.
So I was like always like,

116
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.660
I was just like even shorter than the shortest girl in my grade.

117
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:17.840
I was like super short and like,
what was it like in like eighth grade?

118
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.870
I was four foot eight.
I was like legally images in eighth grade.

119
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.810
So I'll,
I got bullied a lot.

120
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.270
Like I try not to have a victimhood mentality cause I don't think it's

121
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.050
successful and I think you agree with me on that.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Um,
so always,

122
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.410
always bullied and I was always,
I was always smart,

123
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.020
so that kind of went back on me a little bit,

124
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.640
but I was always put a lot and it built up my self esteem.
Uh,

125
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.810
in addition,
I was always like taking the hardest classes.

126
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:48.350
My parents would always push me to take the hardest classes possible.
Um,

127
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.160
so at Douglas,
before all this,
uh,
you know,
I somewhat of,

128
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:56.090
I had a good social life.
Uh,
so I would basically,
I would go to school,

129
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.820
do my AP classes,
go home,
play video games.
So like 10,

130
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.360
10:00 PM start homework to like start homework,
you know,

131
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:05.470
and then finish it at 2:00 AM and then have like five hours of sleep because

132
00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:06.740
that was,
my cycle was terrible.

133
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.080
But I was like super addicted to video games and then the shooting happens and

134
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.950
just turned my entire life upside down.
So just completely changed me.

135
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:19.670
So at that moment,
you know,
I had to become much more mature.
I had,

136
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.400
I was living in the adult world,
you know,
I had responsibilities.

137
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:26.450
There are things I had to do,
you know,
I had to act a proper certain way.

138
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.940
And,
you know,
uh,

139
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.760
<v 1>did you have any particular political beliefs before all this?</v>

140
00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:36.660
Because you're definitely in terms of at least the kids or the young people that

141
00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:39.510
are public about all of this now that have come out of Stoneman Douglas.

142
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.810
I mean you definitely are the one that seems,
at least that I know of is,

143
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.860
is the furthest right that is sort of embraced conservatism and all that did,

144
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.300
is that where you were politically

145
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.920
<v 2>you think about anything about me?
Um,</v>

146
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.950
my parents aren't political at all whatsoever,

147
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.820
so all my political beliefs I've developed myself,
uh,

148
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.440
and how I develop every single political belief is just,

149
00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:01.240
I look at it straight from a rational,

150
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:03.160
logical point of view with no emotions whatsoever.

151
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:07.100
I think you can guess I'm not an emotional person.
So like I think with,

152
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:10.720
with legislative decisions,
you have to put emotion as far out of it as possible.

153
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.870
You have to do policies that,
that actually solve the problem,

154
00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:16.580
not just make you feel good.
So I'm,
I'm really not,
uh,

155
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.160
not for like feel good policies.

156
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.480
<v 1>We care about politics at all before any of this or is this new?</v>

157
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.750
<v 2>Yeah,
I did care.
The 2016 election I was,</v>

158
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.790
I was somewhat into it after the election.
I kind of didn't care as much,

159
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.660
but I was always like somewhat of a second amendment supporter.
Um,

160
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.860
yeah.
But when I,
when I started speaking out,
so what's really interesting,

161
00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:36.900
when I started speaking out,
uh,

162
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.490
it was like a tidal wave of opposition.
You know,
I had,

163
00:08:41.491 --> 00:08:44.310
my school was against me somewhat seem like that,
you know,

164
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.550
all my peers were against me and I try not to do a victim from the Taliban.

165
00:08:47.551 --> 00:08:49.680
I just want to paint the picture of how it actually was.

166
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.710
And it seemed like the community,
the mainstream media and my friends,
you know,

167
00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:55.740
it seemed like I was going against every single opposition.
You know,

168
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.430
I was scared like this could,
this could have ruined my life,
but,
you know,

169
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.640
I believed in what I was doing and I just power through it

170
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.771
and just really,

171
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:08.400
I just stuck to my beliefs and didn't let anyone tell me otherwise.

172
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.910
Cause you know,
when I was,
so when I was in Tallahassee,
uh,

173
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.510
when they were pushing Republican legislators to enact gun control legislation,

174
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.280
I said,
look,
gun control isn't going to solve the problem.

175
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.920
I want to solve the problem.
Okay,

176
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:25.680
I want to make sure that school school shootings never happened.

177
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.680
What can I do to actually make that happen?

178
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.680
And what can I do while protecting the second amendment?

179
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:34.500
Because I actually believe it's one of the most fundamental rights of Americans.

180
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.210
So while I was there,
I started speaking out and nobody cared.
Like APP.

181
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.500
I would go to reporters and nobody cared.
So I had to forcefully,
you know,

182
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.440
like talk to reporters,
say,
hey look,
I'm a conservative.
Can I reach out?

183
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:49.040
And then I managed to get a Lillian Vitor,

184
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.270
it's a contact with lumens that are at Fox.

185
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.200
And I went on Fox and I did an interview and then Ben Shapiro site and it blew

186
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:56.120
off.
But all the while,

187
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.420
<v 1>that's the first time I remember seeing</v>

188
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.320
<v 2>yeah.
And all the while there was this extreme opposition.
Um,</v>

189
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.450
and the entire thing that I've,
I've always had,

190
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.660
<v 1>sorry,
were you going,
well I just wanted to,
what do you,
cause I know you,</v>

191
00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:08.150
you kind of mock the media the way I do now on,

192
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.230
on Twitter and just sort of what mainstream media has become and that they are

193
00:10:11.231 --> 00:10:14.650
really activists and not journalists and that whole thing.
Um,

194
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.070
but were you shocked when you were going up to them and going,
you know,

195
00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:20.640
I'm a conservative or I want to defend the second amendment,
but I'm a,

196
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:24.880
I'm a student from this school and they're just blatantly ignoring you or even,

197
00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:25.840
I know this is minor,

198
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.380
but like I remember when a bunch of you guys were all verified on Twitter at

199
00:10:29.381 --> 00:10:33.330
once,
but you weren't,
and it was with Instagram as well.

200
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.940
Took me like three months after everyone else.
Yeah.
And I'm not saying that that,

201
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.350
it doesn't really mean it doesn't matter and of itself,
but it is,

202
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.320
it is a symptom of sort of the broader situation going on here with tech

203
00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:47.380
companies and media and all that.
Like were they flat out ignoring you?

204
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.880
You saw them interviewing people.
And then,
so here's here,
here's what occurred.

205
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.220
<v 2>Uh,
the main organizers of that,</v>

206
00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:58.020
that you sealer crew with a solid group of like the march for a live kids.

207
00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.011
At this point,

208
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:03.210
they had solidified a click and they wouldn't let anyone new or with a different

209
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:06.060
opposing view into it.
So I said,
I have to take matters into my own hand.

210
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.860
In addition,
we were in Tallahassee.

211
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:10.890
I realized that the mainstream media is just doing this for clicks cause can we

212
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:15.600
think about it when mashing occurs and the mainstream media loves it,

213
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:20.320
they get great coverage,
they get great amount of views.
They do.
Um,
I'll,

214
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.950
I'll switch,
I'll talk to it like no to writing addition after this.

215
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:24.300
But I saw that when someone,

216
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:28.920
there was a girl crying and Tallahassee and the second she cried,

217
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.650
just she got sworn by reporters and I saw that they were just looking for,

218
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:35.190
for clicks and for headlines and,
um,

219
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.920
and I realized that they're really,

220
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.190
they're not reading it for the right reasons and they're not gonna listen to a

221
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:46.050
rational,
irrational young kid like me.
Okay.
So in addition,

222
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:48.780
I also realized that there was an extreme amount of just,

223
00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:51.720
people were just benefiting off of this so much.
Um,

224
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.920
so after the shooting we realized that a lot of this occurred because the

225
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:57.390
shooter who,

226
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.690
I try not to say his name ever cause I think that gives him to notarize me.
They,

227
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.470
they,
they would,
they would post.
So here's what time did.

228
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.650
So the video of the shooter were basically says,
you know,

229
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:12.010
I'm going to be the next school shooter of 2018 I want 20 people.

230
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.120
And he basically says,
you're all going to see me on the news.
So,

231
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.810
and then tie magazine puts this video up on Youtube.

232
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.940
It gets 3.6 million views.
The same thing with all the other videos,
you know,

233
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.010
seen and talked about this exact clip and basically just still showed it on air.

234
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.270
So the entire thing with the mainstream media is doing is that they're
basically,

235
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.020
they're just benefiting off the situation and what they don't realize that

236
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:36.550
they're perpetuating the issue and making it worse.

237
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:39.520
That's why I think daily wire of Venice doing your great decision with not

238
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.370
showing their names and faces because it's an ethical decision.
No,

239
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:46.370
I don't think government should impose on,
on,
you know,

240
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.550
on the mainstream media to not allow the show their faces.

241
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:51.360
But I think it's an ethical and moral decision that people should be taking up.

242
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.010
<v 1>Yeah.
So just to be totally clear,
so after this shooting,</v>

243
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:57.100
that was when Ben announced he's the editor daily wire.

244
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.270
They are no longer going to,

245
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.960
<v 2>yeah,
two days after.</v>

246
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.280
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
okay.
So you started to see this,</v>

247
00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.940
this issue with the media that they're ignoring people like you and they're sort

248
00:13:07.941 --> 00:13:11.180
of making other people stars and they're going for the clicks and all of that.

249
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.980
What about,
you know,
I don't want to make this about people per se,
but so that,

250
00:13:15.981 --> 00:13:20.060
that little click of of kids that then was all over the media and was getting

251
00:13:20.061 --> 00:13:22.400
retweeted by every celebrity and all of that,

252
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.600
were you trying to reach out to them at all and just have that discussion or was

253
00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:27.460
it just very clear?
Yeah,

254
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.080
<v 2>no,
no,
that was totally,
and I still try to have that discussion.
You know,</v>

255
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.330
when they first started speaking on it,
I said,
oh my God,
that's great.

256
00:13:33.331 --> 00:13:37.430
Someone's speaking out.
And originally when the movement started speaking,

257
00:13:37.431 --> 00:13:38.264
when it started,
you know,

258
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:43.340
remember Cameron Caskey was on the car shouting the movement wasn't an anti gun

259
00:13:43.441 --> 00:13:46.800
movement.
It was an anti school shooting movement.
And I said,
hey guys,

260
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.860
this is quickly,
I just,
I was like,
I gave him the morning guys,

261
00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:52.380
it looks like you're moving through the direction of an anti gun movement.

262
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.120
And I don't think that's beneficial at all.
So here's my point of view.

263
00:13:57.121 --> 00:13:58.290
I tried communicating and I,

264
00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:01.860
and I tried speaking on and they really didn't care in allowing me.
So I said,

265
00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:05.070
okay,
I have to go solo.
And that's what I've been doing.
But I,
I've,

266
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.340
I've always been open to discussion and open debate.

267
00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:10.590
I think it was one of the great things of our country where you can have,

268
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.370
you know,
open discussion,
uh,
and just free expression of ideas.

269
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.640
That's why I think the Kanye thing is somewhat great cause regardless of what

270
00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:20.540
you think of the person or celebrity,
um,
I'm,
I'm not,

271
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.690
I'm not in favor of propping up celebrities and their political opinions simply

272
00:14:24.691 --> 00:14:25.590
because they're famous.

273
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.040
But you don't need a lot of political expertise to say that I believe in free

274
00:14:29.041 --> 00:14:30.000
expression,
free thoughts.

275
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.790
<v 1>Right.
That's,
that shouldn't be a really controversial position to be,</v>

276
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:36.100
to be staking out.
All right,
so you mentioned Cameron and you know,

277
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:37.630
I had him on the show a couple weeks ago.

278
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.830
He's going through a very interesting evolution right now.

279
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.890
I suspect I can figure out where this is going to end up,

280
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:49.360
which actually be much closer to your position than the position that he's sort

281
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:53.300
of at right now because I just continually see that as the evolution of things.

282
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:55.850
The more that he understands rights and all of those things.

283
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:58.850
But I was happy to hear his thoughts and all that and look,
he sat down with me,

284
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:02.570
he sat down with Shapiro and I think he'll continue to do that.
Um,

285
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.950
have you guys been able to make any piece with some of this stuff or you must at

286
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:09.470
least be enjoying the fact that somebody kind of coming around?
Yeah,

287
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.330
<v 2>no,
I think,
I think Cam's a good guy.</v>

288
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.630
I think that we're seeing right now is that he's matured.
I mean,

289
00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:19.380
we've all made so mean camp have gone through like the same political slash

290
00:15:19.381 --> 00:15:22.740
media experience so we can understand each other.
Uh,

291
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.080
what happened with Kim as like,
look,
we've all made mistakes.

292
00:15:25.081 --> 00:15:28.610
We've also had stuff we don't want to,
but he's matured and I've also matured.
Uh,

293
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.750
and what I see,
what I think is happening with Cam,
it's,

294
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.670
it's a natural progression of just having logical thought instead of emotions.

295
00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.510
And I think logic and facts moves you towards the political beliefs of being a

296
00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:40.344
conservative.

297
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.060
<v 1>Okay.
So all of this happens.
I think the,</v>

298
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.890
the sort of rock bottom of this was that CNN town hall,

299
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.800
that was terrible.
Um,
yeah,
just share your thoughts on that.

300
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.460
<v 2>So here's what happened with the CNN town hall.</v>

301
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.350
So a lot of the kids that you saw there were actually flown in on a private jet

302
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.950
from Tallahassee.
So already at the time of the town hall,

303
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.760
there was a solidified group click of,
of the kids that you see now,

304
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.940
and they won't let anything until they actually flew these kids on a private jet

305
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.950
from Tallahassee,
uh,
to the town hall.
And right there it was,
it was just simply,

306
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.503
they were just,

307
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.770
it was an anti gun debate and they were just villainizing Rubio and Dana Lash

308
00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:26.130
for things that had nothing into their control whatsoever.
It wasn't their fault.

309
00:16:26.131 --> 00:16:29.460
And Marco Rubio was villainized to such an extreme extent,

310
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.980
and he's one of the best senators.
Uh,
so you've now connected with Rubio?
Yeah.

311
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.473
Yeah.
I mean,

312
00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.370
I hate it because when people say that politicians just don't care,

313
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.920
it's just so wrong.
I mean,
politicians,
they do care.
Um,
and you know,

314
00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:49.470
he was one of the greatest supporters of the Stop School Violence Act that we

315
00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:50.304
got past.

316
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.750
And you just help push it and look at these senators don't want this to occur.

317
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.310
Tiny won't.
And just saying that politicians want this to happen is just wrong.

318
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.620
Do you have any thoughts on a,

319
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.050
<v 1>what actually happened that day in terms of security or what should have</v>

320
00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:07.580
happened or should have or shouldn't have happened?

321
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.950
Because even now when you go back and listen,

322
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:12.350
depending on where you're getting your news from this,
it sounds,
you know,

323
00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:16.610
they either step down or they didn't go in or this or that or the other thing.

324
00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:18.770
And it's like,
well,
what,

325
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:22.940
what should have happened in the ideal world that you want to create in the

326
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:24.740
system that you want to create to protect this,

327
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:28.640
these schools from not having this happen again?
Um,
what,

328
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.690
what should happen that day?

329
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.780
<v 2>What we saw at my school was simply an utterly just massive incompetence and</v>

330
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:38.720
failure of law enforcement.
You know,
the sh the,

331
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.800
so the shooter was flagged multiple times by the school,

332
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.320
by the school administration.
They knew he had mental issues.

333
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:49.040
He was put into the promise program.
Um,
and they,

334
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.500
that this kid was a threat.
There were 76 times the police,

335
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.560
there were 76 times the police came to his house,
the two FBI reports,

336
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.970
they knew that this kid was a threat and the law enforcement was completely

337
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:03.870
incompetent at that level and they didn't do absolutely anything.

338
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.790
Everyone knew this kid was an issue.

339
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.940
What happened at school was was just utter incompetence in addition.

340
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.250
So when he gets on campus,
okay,

341
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.610
you just makes a straight beeline for the freshman building and at the exact

342
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:22.760
same time we had a school resource officer who,
who,

343
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.310
who heard the gunfire and came and you just hit an a corner while kids were

344
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:31.311
dying and then three unarmed individuals rushed to save three on three on when

345
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:36.090
to the building and died trying to save kids.
What we should have had,

346
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.590
and this is why I push for it,

347
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:43.250
the only way to stop a shooter who is active on campus is to have other people

348
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.900
who are armed.
The only way to stop,

349
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.430
it's not a cliche that you only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy

350
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:52.470
with a gun.
And in addition to that,

351
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.160
there's the entire idea of a gun free gun free zone.

352
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.150
It is utterly stupid.
Yeah,
it is just completely stupid.

353
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.960
All it's doing is enticing a target saying,
look,
you go here.
So here's,

354
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:04.794
here's what's the school?

355
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.810
The average response time from police station to a school nationally is 15

356
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:12.810
minutes.
The average time of school shooting happens is five minutes.

357
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.540
That means the shooter has 15 minutes to do whatever he wants.

358
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.880
If the school was a gun free zone.
So here's what I'm saying,

359
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.860
at least allow teachers who have gone through the proper training,
you know,

360
00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:26.190
ex military ex law enforcement to be armed.

361
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.000
Because what that does is it sends not only a message as a deterrent to a

362
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:33.230
shooter that says,
look,
this school is armed.
If you get in here,

363
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.770
your brains are going to be blown out.
It also says that,

364
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.970
that the school wasn't a gun free.
The school is no longer a gun free zone.

365
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.990
So I'm with you partly on that.
So what I would,
maybe,

366
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.930
maybe you can explain this a little bit further so I don't know that I want guns

367
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.330
in those classrooms.
Even if it's,
Oh,
here's the license.

368
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.600
Here's the interesting thing.
There are 25 states where teachers can be armed in,

369
00:19:57.601 --> 00:20:01.890
are armed in schools and all the hypotheticals that are pronounced.
It's like,

370
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:06.210
you know what,
if a teacher shoots a student,
when there's another like,

371
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.330
like what if there's a school shooter and a teacher gets shot and there was a

372
00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:12.270
gun on the floor?
What does the student do?
It's these hypotheticals don't happen.

373
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.140
25 states where teachers already armed and it works.

374
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.130
So why not just have them have security guards at specific?
Oh,
a mansion.

375
00:20:21.131 --> 00:20:23.460
So here's the thing,
I'm all for having security guards.

376
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:28.050
This entire issue is how do we best manage our funds and secure our schools.

377
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.110
The thing with law enforcement officers is that they cost a lot of money and

378
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.070
impoverished schools are ready need that funding for materials.

379
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.600
And in addition,

380
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.950
it does not take a lot of training and a lot of money to have a teacher to be

381
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:43.770
armed.
And this has already been proven to work.
And in addition,

382
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:47.330
when you have teachers who are armed,
the shooter doesn't know who it is.
If you,

383
00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:49.730
if it's a law enforcement officer,
you can clearly see who it is.

384
00:20:49.731 --> 00:20:52.540
So if you've one resource officer,
school resource officer who's armed,

385
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.300
the shooter comes and takes out the school resource officer and then they're

386
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:58.720
free to do whatever.
Yeah.
But it's simply,
so here's the thing.

387
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.800
Simply giving teachers to have the opportunity has a massive effect because it's

388
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:07.120
up to their own will to do.
So they have to go through training and they have to,

389
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.060
it's a concealed carry.
So nobody knows they have them.

390
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.340
So as you said before,
you like facts and logic.
Okay.
Yeah.

391
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.190
I'm strictly facts.
Facts don't care about your feelings.
All right,

392
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:20.540
I got you that,
that,
that works.
When,

393
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.360
when you've engaged some of your friends and other students about these ideas,

394
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.470
I mean everyone watching this at this point knows that so much of what's coming

395
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:32.140
out of the modern left is about feelings and all of these things.

396
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.520
Do you have a sense that they understand that young people,

397
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:40.410
at least the ones you're talking about,
understanding like what rights are,
what,

398
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.650
why,
why we should care about these things,
why free speech matters,

399
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:47.380
why the second amendment matters and things of that nature.
So,

400
00:21:47.381 --> 00:21:50.530
or does it all just sound good to them?
And there's a,
that's pretty much,

401
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:51.940
it makes them feel good.

402
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.760
You know what they push and makes them feel good by their emotions.

403
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:55.900
That makes sense.
So here's the thing,

404
00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.200
I am very scared of lowering the age for people to vote to be 15.

405
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.910
Like that scares me because the kids that I know who are 15 know absolutely

406
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:08.260
nothing about politics.

407
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.190
I think I know like the kids from the march for our lives better than I think I

408
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:15.160
know their own arguments better than they know their own arguments.

409
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:20.080
Like I can argue for them better than they can do.
So I strictly use facts only.

410
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.030
Um,
so when I make an argument with them,

411
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.190
I cannot really know what they're going to do next.

412
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:26.810
So here's how I'll give you like a 10 minute or five minute recap.

413
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.640
Basically how I premise the second amendment argument in America,

414
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.240
we have the right to bear arms and DC versus Heller.

415
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:37.420
That right rule that an individual's right to arms,
it doesn't mean the militia,

416
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:39.970
the militia clause is different from the individual,
right to bear arms.

417
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:44.440
That means that you personally have the right to arm yourself.
Okay?

418
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:48.370
There are about 270 million guns in the United States.
15 million.

419
00:22:48.371 --> 00:22:49.900
Those are air fifteens.

420
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.560
So we look at the gun stats are 33,000 annual gun deaths,

421
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.530
66% so two thirds are suicides.

422
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.370
So leaves us with 11,000 gun deaths a.
So we have to,

423
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.330
so in addition to put in parentheses,

424
00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:03.160
there's a difference in a homicide and a murder.

425
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.180
So homicide is just a killing a murderer is an unlawful killing and gun stats,

426
00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:11.230
a lot of them like to perverse this into skew statistics.

427
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.700
So 3% of all gun deaths are with rifles.
Okay?

428
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:20.140
And in that 3%,
68% of those are suicides.
So 1% of all gun,
that's their actual,

429
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.240
uh,
murders,
or actually,
sorry.
Yeah,
we're actually murders with rifles.

430
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.340
Uh,
80% of all gun crime related activity is with illegal firearms.

431
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.600
Uh,
most schools,
most shootings or with pistols.
So,

432
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.850
so march for life has five bullet points.
Uh,
one of them is like,

433
00:23:38.851 --> 00:23:39.460
I don't talk about,

434
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.610
they like to talk about the CDC and we should allow the CDC to do research.

435
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.640
The issue with that as the CDC has already proven to skew statistics and to not

436
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.540
actually provide good research.
What research is it that they want?
The CDC,

437
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:55.370
the CDC used to be able to do research on gun violence prevention and just

438
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:56.450
figure out what's going on.

439
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.170
But it's been proven time and time again that they screw their statistics with

440
00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:02.940
Fargo and was like,
no,
we're not allowing you to patch,
wait a false myth.
Uh,

441
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.690
so a myth,
uh,
so basically they stopped funding.

442
00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.320
The next thing is that they want high capacity magazines.
Uh,

443
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.080
there is no distinction there.
There was no difference.

444
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.350
That shows that high capacity magazines,

445
00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:20.030
whatever that means he can do more damage as simply having more like clips.
Um,

446
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.060
just having smaller,
having larger clips,
but less of them.

447
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.040
There's no distinction that actually does more damage.

448
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.880
The next thing that they want to do is ban semiauto rifles.
As I've said before,

449
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:31.910
only 3% of all gun deaths are with rifles.

450
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:36.460
So banning them does absolutely nothing addressing the issue in lowering,
uh,

451
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.550
gun violence is making sure that we have,
uh,

452
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.440
making sure that we have more people who are armed because there's a direct

453
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.120
correlation,
not causation,

454
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:48.440
but correlation that when we increase firearm ownership and concealed carry

455
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:51.410
permits,
in addition,
um,
violent crime goes down.

456
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.740
So the next thing they like to propose is what about Great Britain and
Australia.

457
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.200
So in Great Britain,
there was a,
there's a ban on guns.

458
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.400
It immediately after violent crime spiked,
uh,
and in addition,

459
00:25:01.401 --> 00:25:04.250
you have armed robberies,
um,
increased.

460
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:08.770
So violent crime increased immediately after,
and burglaries in Great Britain,
uh,

461
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.780
60% of them occur when the individuals at home versus 13% of the u s so burglars

462
00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:17.540
have admitted that they do this because they know that the person will have like

463
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:21.770
the purse or whatever and they won't.
There'll be on arm.
So violent crime spike.

464
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.890
The next thing is I say,
hey Kyle,
what about the Australian gun by program?

465
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.670
So already in Australia when the program was initiated,

466
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.050
there was already statistical zero,
uh,
for,
uh,
you know,

467
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.890
gun death and public mass public school shootings.
Um,

468
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.670
so in addition,
when the buyback gets implemented there already,

469
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.790
we're like their millions,
millions less guns in Australia than there were now.

470
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.210
So the gun buyback grows in,
only one third of guns get taken.

471
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.590
And when we saw immediately after the buyback was that violent crime spiked.

472
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.160
So here's just the basic argument,

473
00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.300
there is not been one single occurrence where gun control gets passed and,

474
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.150
and,
and gun deaths,
no,
sorry.

475
00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.980
Gun homicides actually decreases at a faster rate.
In Australia,
the gun,

476
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.490
the homicide rate was already decreasing in a really good rate.

477
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.740
It gets passed gun control and the rate stalls.

478
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.670
So it actually hurt in addition to immediately after it was passed to violent

479
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:22.490
crime rates go up and the national trend was going down.

480
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.560
So the gun buyback program was completely ineffective,
did absolutely nothing.

481
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:32.390
And then it failed on such a huge level in Australia that implementing it in the

482
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.510
u s with 270 million guns simply won't work.
