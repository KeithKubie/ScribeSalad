00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right, it's time for the most important quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We've learned the two postulates with special relativity--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the first was Galilean relativity, which said that all inertial frames of reference are equally valid.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The laws of physics are the same in all of them.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the second was that the speed of light is constant in all frames of reference.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, time for the most important quiz of this unit.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you do not get this one correct, you may not move on

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
until you know and believe the correct answer.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And the question is--do you believe these two postulates. Yes or no.
