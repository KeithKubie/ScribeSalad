00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.590
We're on problem 53.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.000
Which table below correctly
describes the points of the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.950
exponential function f of
x is equal to 3 to the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.620
minus x minus 2?

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.330
They all input the same x-values
as far as I can tell.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.270
Yeah, they all input
the same x-values.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's just figure out
which choice works.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.280
So if we take f of minus
2, that's the first

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.680
one they give us.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.280
f of minus 2, that is equal
to 3 to the minus x.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.920
Well, x is now minus 2, so
minus minus 2 minus 2.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.960
So what's minus minus 2?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.790
Well, that's the same thing as
3 squared minus 2, so that is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.995
equal to 9 minus 2
is equal to 7.

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:46.740
Did I get that right?

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.150
Do you see any of
these choices?

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.250
Well, only one of them
has that. f of minus

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.020
2 is equal to 7.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.380
That's not right.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.450
That's not right.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.940
That's not right.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.080
Well, here when x is minus
2, f of x is equal

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.030
to 7, choice D.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.170
We could have just evaluated the
other ones and we probably

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.440
would have agreed with all
of these numbers as well.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.760
Well, that was a lot of copying
and pasting for a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.890
fairly straightforward
problem.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.980
Next problem.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.510
I already had it there
waiting for us.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.350
log base 6 of 40.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.130
So, in general, and just
inspecting it, I think they

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.180
just want you to figure out
how do you figure out a

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.320
logarithm of any arbitrary base
of some number if you

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.040
only have a log base 10
function, which tends to be

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.570
the case in your calculator.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.870
I proved this in a Khan Academy
video, but the general

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.750
idea is if I have log base a
of b, that this is equal to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.460
log base 10 of b divided
by log base 10 of a.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940
Actually, these both don't
have to be 10.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.730
They just have to be
the same base.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.920
10 tends to be convenient.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.330
The other base that tends
to be convenient is e.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.680
But anyway, let's use
that property

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.660
to solve this problem.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:11.610
So log base 6 of 40 is equal to
log base 10 of 40 divided

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.460
by log base 10 of 6,
which is choice D.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.550
All right, next problem.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.510
Copy and paste it.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.000
Just so you know, I don't like
talking while I'm copying and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.780
pasting, because I think it
slows my computer down and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.560
then I start sounding
like Optimus Prime.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.620
All right, Jonathan wrote the
equation log base 6 of x minus

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.960
4 is equal to 0 on the board.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.390
He needs one clue for
problem solving.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.430
Which fact provides the correct
information that he

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.340
needs to solve the equation?

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.200
Well, I don't know if he
needs any information.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.180
This statement is essentially
saying that 6 to the 0th power

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.230
is equal to x minus 4.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.670
Then you could add 4 to both
sides, and you would get 6 to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.080
the 0th power plus
4 is equal to x.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.560
I guess if he didn't know the
definition already of 6 to the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.990
0th power, he would have to
know that to know that it

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.650
equals 1, so 1 plus 4 is
equal to x, which is 5.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.190
So I guess he has to know that
6 to the 0th power is a piece

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.440
of information.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.470
Well this one wouldn't
have been useful.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.270
6 to the first power, that's
not even useful even if you

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.150
didn't know it.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.430
4 minus 4 isn't useful even
if you didn't know if.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.080
But 6 minus 4, even
that's not useful.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.380
Yes, choice A, he had
to know 6 to the 0th

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.860
power is equal to 1.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.840
All right.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.890
Let's see, they have
a couple more.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.640
I'm going to copy and paste all
of them at the same time.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.890
I'm getting bold.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.540
All right, like that.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.420
Let me clear all of this: clear
image, image, invert

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.410
colors, and I'm back
in business.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.110
There you go.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.780
All right, I never know
whether I should use a

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.420
dark-colored or light-colored
marker, because over here, the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.250
light-colored ones look good,
but on the white, the darks.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.170
So who knows?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.460
Magenta tends to be good,
maybe purple.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.860
What is the value of
log base 3 of 27?

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.640
So that's just asking 3 to what
power is equal to 27?

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.650
3 to the first is 3.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.060
3 squared is 9.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.910
3 to the third power
is equal to 27.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.890
So log base 3 of 27
is equal to 3.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.170
They, I guess, just want you to
know what the definition of

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.290
a logarithm is in
that question.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.320
I'm noticing that there isn't
necessarily a progression of

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.340
difficulty in the problem.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.620
They kind of flip between an
easy one and a hard one.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.090
Who knows?

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.150
They're just a grab
bag of questions.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.980
If log base 2-- no,
not log base 2.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.060
They're saying log of 2 is
approximately equal to 0.301.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.710
When people just write a log
without a base, you usually

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.840
assume it's base 10.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.350
It's kind of like what you'd
get in your calculator.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.890
If you just press log on your
calculator, it's log base 10.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.730
So 10 to the 0.3 power
is equal to 2.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.670
If log base 10 of 2 is
approximately equal to 0.301,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.500
and log base 10 of 3 is
approximately equal to 0.477,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.390
what is the approximate
value of log of 72?

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.610
So let's see, I think we just
have to do some prime

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.390
factorization here.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.710
So 72, that's equal to the log--
let's think about it.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.810
That's the log of-- let
me think about it.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.800
This is 36 times 2.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.330
Well, I don't know if
that even helps us.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.380
3 to the third, that's 27.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.500
This is 9 times 8.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.440
So this is log of 3 to
the third times 2

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.800
squared; is that right?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.380
So this is log of 9.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.070
I made a mistake.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.500
Ignore that.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.320
So this is the same thing as
the logarithm of 9 times 8.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.570
Fair enough.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:41.640
So that's the same thing
as the log of 9

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.300
plus the log of 8.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.500
Fair enough.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.770
Well, that's the same thing as
the log of 3 squared plus the

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.360
log of 2 to the third.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.050
2 to the third is equal to 8.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.700
Let's keep going.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.910
I think you see where
it's going.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.540
3 squared is 9.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.210
OK, so log of 3 squared, that's
the same thing as 2

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.090
times the log of 3.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.080
The log of 2 to the third power,
that's the same thing

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.530
as 3 times the log of 2.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.830
We know what the log of 3 is and
we know the log of 2 is.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:24.770
The log of 3 is 0.477, so we
have 2 times 0.477 plus 3

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:31.450
times the log of 2, plus
3 times 0.301.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.670
So 2 times 0.477-- let
me do it here.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.590
So 0.477 times 2.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:47.200
2 times 7 is 14 plus 1 is 15.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.530
2 times 4 is 8 plus 1 is 9,
three numbers behind the

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.040
decimal point, 0.954.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.210
Then 3 times point 0.301,
that's easier.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.950
That's 0.903.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.060
If you add them together, I
can already tell you, it's

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.450
going to be that right there.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.305
It's going to be 1.857.

00:08:07.305 --> 00:08:09.720
It's choice D.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.670
Problem 58.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.950
If x is a real number, for
what values of x is the

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:24.200
equation 3x minus 9 over 3 is
equal to x minus 3 true?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.700
All right.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.120
Well, if x is a real
number, let's just

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.780
play around with it.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.830
Maybe it's just a truism.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.890
Well, I know it is a truism.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.390
Look at it.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.309
Let me write it.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:39.250
3x minus 9 over 3 is
equal to x minus 3.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.429
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 3.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:49.350
You'll get 3x minus 9 is
equal to 3x minus 9.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.990
So we can stop there.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.190
So if I take 3 times a number
and subtract 9 from it and if

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.680
I said that's the same thing as
taking 3 times a number and

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.030
subtracting 9 from it, well,
then x could be any number.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.780
So it works for all
values of x.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.550
You can keep solving.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.740
Let's just add 9
to both sides.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.760
You get 3x equal to 3x.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.315
Divide both sides by 3, you
get x is equal to x.

00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:12.880
Well, that's true for
any real number x.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.420
It's equal to itself.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.090
So that works for
all numbers x.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.850
Let's see what else they
have to throw at us.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.560
All right, let's do one more.

00:09:32.692 --> 00:09:37.580
I've copied, and now
I have pasted.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.320
On a recent test, Jeremy wrote
the equation x squared minus

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.450
16 divided by x minus 4
is equal to x plus 4.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.165
Which of the following
statements is correct about

00:09:46.165 --> 00:09:47.860
the equation he wrote?

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.180
So let's play with it a little
bit. x squared minus 16 over x

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.050
minus 4 is equal to x plus 4.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.960
So immediately when you see
something like this, in order

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.925
to do this, what he had to say
is that x squared minus 16 is

00:10:04.925 --> 00:10:08.800
x plus 4 times x minus 4.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.200
That's over x minus 4.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.880
Then to simplify from this to
that, he essentially canceled

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.660
out both of these things.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.960
That's fine.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.960
That's fine, assuming
that this number

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.210
down here is non-zero.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.280
0 over 0 is undefined.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.500
Anything over a 0
is undefined.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.610
His simplification is true as
long as x does not equal 4.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.330
Because if x equaled 4, then you
would have an 8 times a 0

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.590
divided by a 0, and 8 times
a 0 divided by a 0 is not

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.530
defined, so this doesn't work
when x is equal to 4.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.970
If you think about it, if I were
to graph this equation or

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.630
his original equation, it
would look just like the

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.190
equation of x plus 4, except
it would have a hole at 4

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.380
because it's not defined
at x is equal to 4.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.880
So they're not exactly
the same.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.145
The graphs would be exactly the
same except at the point x

00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:06.390
is equal 4.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.340
So the point is b.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.660
All right.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.620
I'm out of time.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.080
See you in the next video.
