time and just always fascinates me and
 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.119
time and just always fascinates me and
one of things that I noticed is that

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:21.129
one of things that I noticed is that
 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.550
one of things that I noticed is that
very few people equate time and money

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560
very few people equate time and money
 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.700
very few people equate time and money
and they're very very equatable so the

and they're very very equatable so the
 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.869
and they're very very equatable so the
first thing I started doing when I was a

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:27.879
first thing I started doing when I was a
 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:29.610
first thing I started doing when I was a
teacher was asking my graduate students

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620
teacher was asking my graduate students
 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.680
teacher was asking my graduate students
well how much is your time worth an hour

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690
well how much is your time worth an hour
 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.869
well how much is your time worth an hour
or if you work at a company how much is

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:33.879
or if you work at a company how much is
 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:35.999
or if you work at a company how much is
your time worth to the company what most

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009
your time worth to the company what most
 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:37.589
your time worth to the company what most
people don't realize is that if you have

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599
people don't realize is that if you have
 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.629
people don't realize is that if you have
a salary let's say you make $50,000 a

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639
a salary let's say you make $50,000 a
 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.790
a salary let's say you make $50,000 a
year it probably costs that company

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800
year it probably costs that company
 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.070
year it probably costs that company
twice that in order to have you as an

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080
twice that in order to have you as an
 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.269
twice that in order to have you as an
employee because there's heating and

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279
employee because there's heating and
 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.279
employee because there's heating and
lighting and other staff members on so

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289
lighting and other staff members on so
 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.619
lighting and other staff members on so
forth so if you get paid $50,000 a year

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:49.629
forth so if you get paid $50,000 a year
 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:52.740
forth so if you get paid $50,000 a year
you are costing that company they may

you are costing that company they may
 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.830
you are costing that company they may
have to raise $100,000 in revenue and if

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840
have to raise $100,000 in revenue and if
 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.930
have to raise $100,000 in revenue and if
you divide that by your hourly rate you

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940
you divide that by your hourly rate you
 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.760
you divide that by your hourly rate you
begin to get some sense of what you are

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770
begin to get some sense of what you are
 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.170
begin to get some sense of what you are
worth an hour and when you have to make

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180
worth an hour and when you have to make
 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.059
worth an hour and when you have to make
trade-offs of should I do something like

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:03.069
trade-offs of should I do something like

every week and what you have to do is

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160
every week and what you have to do is
 

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.620
every week and what you have to do is
you have to look at those and identify

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:32.630
you have to look at those and identify
 

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.839
you have to look at those and identify
the the open blocks where you're going

00:50:34.839 --> 00:50:34.849
the the open blocks where you're going
 

00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:36.430

case you've got a class where you've got
 

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.700
case you've got a class where you've got
a class at a certain point and then

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:42.710
a class at a certain point and then
 

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.260
a class at a certain point and then
you've got a gap until the next class so

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:44.270
you've got a gap until the next class so
 

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:47.049
you've got a gap until the next class so
I've identified those here and the gaps

00:50:47.049 --> 00:50:47.059
I've identified those here and the gaps
 

00:50:47.059 --> 00:50:48.910
I've identified those here and the gaps
between classes that in this case lasts

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920
between classes that in this case lasts
 

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.770
between classes that in this case lasts
an hour or an hour and a half this is

an hour or an hour and a half this is
 

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.990
an hour or an hour and a half this is
just prime time to be wasted so what I

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000
just prime time to be wasted so what I
 

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.089
