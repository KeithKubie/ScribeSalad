radio so for the 21st century you can
 

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.380
radio so for the 21st century you can
think of the NetCast the mp3 file the

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:17.390
think of the NetCast the mp3 file the
 

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.360
think of the NetCast the mp3 file the
ability to kind of share large scales

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:19.370
ability to kind of share large scales
 

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.820
