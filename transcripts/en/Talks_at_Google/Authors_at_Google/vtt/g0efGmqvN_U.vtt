00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:05.450
&gt;&gt;male presenter: First off, I'd like to thank
everybody for coming.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.210
I think it's a cool topic that will be of
interest to a lot of us.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.460
My name is Mark Rivera.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.220
I'm with the People and Innovation Lab at
Google.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.070
We spend a lot of time thinking about what
makes people at Google--all of us--happy and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.070
productive.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.779
And so, we are very pleased to have Dr. Sheena
Iyengar here, who is one of the foremost experts

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.400
on a really broad topic.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.359
That is, choice--how people make choices and
what happens to us when we're faced with an

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.630
overload of choices, which, I think, it's
safe to say all of us usually are.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.239
To demonstrate this, we just took her to lunch
at Charlie's.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.239
[laughter]

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.160
One of the difficult choices we face on a
day-to-day basis.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.699
Sheena wrote a book called "The Art of Choosing,"
which has been an extraordinary hit.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.350
Amazon, in 2010, it was one of the best books
of Amazon.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.070
It was the finalist for the Financial Times
Book of the Year.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.900
Her work has been covered in the New York
Times, the Wall Street Journal, books like

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.789
Malcolm Gladwell's "Blink."

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.380
She's been a guest on CNN, CNBC, CBS, and
now at Tech Talk at Google.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.160
So, please join me in welcoming Sheena.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.890
[applause and cheer]

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.890
[pause]

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.909
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: Well, thank you for having
me here today.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.750
This is my first time ever coming to Google.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.310
And the place really is quite cool, particularly
when you see those, the volleyball pit.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.920
It was really quite cool.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.800
And when I went to Charlie's, I actually commented
to my assistant that there really are some

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.729
benefits to being blind given that I couldn't
see all the choices.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:41.729
So, I didn't actually--.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.729
[laughter]

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.600
So, as you know, I have been studying choice
now for about 20 years.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.070
And I essentially look at three big questions--and
those are all covered in the book--which is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.810
why do we want choice?

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.259
What are some of the things that affect how
and what we choose?

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.979
And what are some things that we can do to
improve our choosing experiences and choice

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.259
outcomes?

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.810
Now today, I'm going to talk about a particular
modern day dilemma that has to do with choice.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.720
And this dilemma is, perhaps, the biggest
dilemma that we all face today.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.190
And it relates to all three of these questions.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.480
Now, as I talk about this modern day dilemma,
I'm going to need your help.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.240
So, there's going to be times when I'm gonna
have some questions for you and I'm gonna

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.360
wanna know your answers.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.970
So, since I'm blind, when I ask you a quick
question, only raise your hands if you wanna

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.480
burn off some calories.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.570
[laughter]

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.100
Otherwise, when I ask you a question, I'd
appreciate it if you'd, if your answer is

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.160
"yes" just clap your hands.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.520
So, are you ready to hear about the modern
day dilemma of choice?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.800
[clapping]

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800
Thank you.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.500
So, this dilemma that I'm referring to has
been referred to by many, many different names

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.900
now over the years.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.900
It's been studied now for over ten years.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.540
The first time I got wind of the fact that
it was actually being referred to by many

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.620
different names was when I met the head of
Fidelity Research.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.690
And he described to me this problem.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.180
In fact, he was describing to me my own study--not
that he knew that--and then he even gave me

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.760
some slides that described this problem very
well.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.510
They were actually better than my slides,
so I just took them.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.510
[chuckles]

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.760
And he called it the "narrow it down" problem.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.930
Then there was the time when I met with senior
management in McKinsey and they described

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.180
the same problem, the same study, the same
results.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.860
And they had an internal memo, which they
titled, "The Three by Three Rule."

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.590
Now, my favorite description of this particular
problem was the one offered by Rush Limbaugh.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.300
He said it was the stuff of pointy headed
intellectuals that didn't know the first thing

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.590
about the marketplace.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.290
Now, I figured I was in good company if I
was being skewered by Rush Limbaugh.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.080
You have probably heard about this problem.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.510
It's most often referred to in the media as
the "jam" problem.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.989
It was first identified and discovered right
here in the Bay Area, in the South Bay.

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.080
So, I wanna now tell you the real story behind
the jam problem.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.020
When I was a PhD student at Stanford University,
I used to go to this upscale grocery store.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.860
And it was called Draeger's.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.539
In those days, it was a rather unusual store.

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.979
I mean, nowadays, you have stores like it
all over the country.

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.419
In those days, it was truly unique.

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.770
You went there.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.099
There were 250 different kinds of mustards
and vinegars and mayonnaise.

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.090
Over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.439
They even had 12 different kinds of bottled
water.

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:01.849
Of course, I noticed you guys had three different
kinds here at Charlie's cafe.

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.639
I mean, who even thought of--.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.080
I mean, distinguishing between water.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.729
Here is their olive oil aisle.

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.650
They had 75 different kinds of extra virgin
olive oil, including those that were in a

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.159
locked case that came from a thousand year
old olive trees.

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:19.560
[laughter]

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.520
Now, I used to go to this store.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.570
I liked going to this store.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.330
And one day, I asked myself a rather strange
question.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.610
How come you never buy anything?

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.610
Now, true.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.410
I was a poor graduate student, but I could
afford some things in that store.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.039
So, I decided to pay a visit to the manager.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.939
And I asked him whether this model of offering
people all these choices was really working.

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:49.449
And he pointed at the bus-loads of tourists,
usually with cameras in hand, and said, "Yeah.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.870
It's working."

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.759
We decided to do a little experiment.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.500
We chose Wilken and Sons, itâ€™s a jam.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.500
Oh.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.500
Here's the jam aisle.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.120
And they had 348 different kinds of jam.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.419
We chose Wilken and Sons, the Queen of England's
brand, to do our little experiment with.

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.590
So, we set up a tasting booth right near the
entrance of the store.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.850
We either put out six different flavors jam,
or 24 different flavors of jam.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.620
And now we measured two things.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.770
First, in which case were people, entering
in the store passing by, more likely to stop

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.529
and sample some jam?

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:37.710
Second, in which case were people more likely
to take the opportunity and use the coupon

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.370
that we just gave them for free--giving them
one dollar off of a bottle of jam--in which

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.280
case are they more likely to buy a jar of
jam?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:53.470
Now, more people stopped when there were 24--60
percent--as compared to when there were six--40

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.779
percent.

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:59.770
Well, when it came down to buying behavior,
we saw the opposite effect.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:06.129
Of the people who stopped when there were
24, only three percent of them actually bought

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:07.870
a jar of jam.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:15.939
Now, by contrast, of the people who stopped
when there were six, 30 percent of them actually

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:17.610
bought a jar of jam.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.840
Now, if you do the math, people were at least
six times more likely to buy a jar of jam

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.710
if they encountered six than if they encountered
24.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:34.099
So, although people were more attracted to
the larger display, when it came down to actually

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:38.741
making a choice, they were more likely to
choose when they saw fewer than when they

00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:40.150
saw more.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.110
Now, that study was published in 2000.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.400
And since then, there's been over a decade
of research that has looked at this jam problem,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.229
which I'm gonna call the "choice overload"
problem, across many, many domains.

00:07:54.229 --> 00:08:02.029
Jams to chocolates to speed dating to any
kind of dating type choices, political choices,

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:07.460
investment choices, health care choices, job
search choices, in lots of different domains

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.439
of choice, ranging from the trivial to the
consequential.

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:18.279
And essentially, we observed three negative
consequences of offering people too much choice.

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:22.199
I'm gonna summarize these results.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:26.779
And keep in mind that while I'm biased towards
describing you results from my studies, many

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:30.409
of my colleagues in the field have also looked
at this phenomenon.

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.529
First, consequence.

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:38.970
The more choices people have the more likely
they are to delay or procrastinate.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.470
Now, this is a good thing when the choice
is whether or not to buy jam.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.690
That's probably really good for my waistline.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:52.250
The problem is that we delay and procrastinate
even when it goes against our best self-interest.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:09:01.120
So, I'm gonna give you one case of a situation
where clearly, we should not be delaying or

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120
procrastinating.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.930
At least most of us would agree with that.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.120
Let's take the specific case of retirement
savings decisions.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.750
I had an opportunity to do a project with
Vanguard.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:23.740
We looked at 800 thousand Americans from 657
institutions, drawn from 64 different industries.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:29.890
And we looked at whether the number of funds
offered in a retirement savings program--the

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.640
401K plan--was correlated with participation
rates.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.890
And we found that it was.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.420
So, here's a snapshot of the graph.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.890
So, for plans that offered you about a handful
of choices, participation rates, some were

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.510
in the 70th percentile.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.510
Still not great.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:54.900
But by the time you got to plans that offered
you 60 options, participation rates had dropped

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.750
to about 60 percent.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:02.060
Notice how the big trend in retirement savings
industry now is to reduce, reduce, reduce.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.410
Bring it down to about three options.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.080
So, first consequence.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.450
The more choices people have, more likely
they are to delay and procrastinate even when

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.780
it goes against their best self-interest.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.780
Second consequence.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:23.080
The more choices people have, the more likely
they are to make inferior choices, worse choices.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.030
So, let's just stick to the 401K decision.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:32.210
The more choices people have, even when you
look at the people that actually chose to

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.150
participate, the more choices they had, the
more likely they were to put all their money

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.580
in money market accounts.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.730
We all know that's a dumb decision.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.300
That doesn't even grow at the rate of inflation.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.880
The more choices they had, the more likely
they were to entirely avoid equities.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.790
We all know that when you're talking about
long-term financial growth, that doesn't make

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.790
sense.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:57.560
Sure, in a one-off bad year, but not from
a long-term future financial perspective.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.240
We also know that the more choices people
have, the more likely they are to exhibit

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.920
inconsistent preferences.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:11.270
And that happens even on important domains
like romantic choices, job search choices.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.810
Third consequence.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.530
The more choices people have, the more likely
they are to be less satisfied with that which

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.810
they have chosen.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.810
Why?

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.190
Because you're constantly saying, "What if?"

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.190
[laughter]

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:29.940
So, here's one of my favorite examples--just
because food's on the mind right now.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:37.180
So, imagine either being shown six different
kinds of Godiva chocolate or 30 different

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.880
kinds of Godiva chocolate.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.060
And the only thing you have to do is pick
a chocolate, eat it, tell me how delicious

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.300
it is.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:53.490
Turns out, the same chocolate selected from
six is regarded as less, as more delicious

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.630
than when it was chosen from 30.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.992
Now, how anybody could consider any chocolate
less delicious is beyond me, but--.

00:11:58.992 --> 00:11:59.992
[laughter]

00:11:59.992 --> 00:12:02.520
As they're walking out the door, now here
they had this wonderful experience.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.620
They got to eat a free chocolate.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.770
As they're walking out the door, they now
have a choice.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:16.530
They can either get paid for this highly entertaining
activity or they could get a free box of chocolate.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:22.050
The people who saw six were four times more
likely to go for a free box of chocolate,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.310
more satisfied with the choice.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.950
So, why do we experience choice overload?

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.950
Right?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.040
After all, the more choices we have, the more
opportunities we have to find the best choice,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.620
the perfect match.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:44.150
Well, let's now think about the causes of
choice overload.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.490
We've always known that our eyes are too big
for our stomachs, but it turns out that our

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.480
eyes are too big for our minds as well.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.500
We have cognitive limitations.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:01.620
In 1956, the famous psychologist George Miller,
came out with a very simple idea.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.330
And that idea still holds true today.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.510
He came out with this paper called "The Magical
Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two."

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.970
Very simple idea.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.030
We keep wanting to attack this idea and say,
"No, it's too simplistic."

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.710
But it keeps coming up.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:21.300
And here's how the idea goes: We have some
basic limitations of our brains.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:28.190
If I ask you to rank order from best to worst
for a whole bunch of things--taste, smells,

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.600
looks of things--no matter what it is, beyond
about seven, I just get confused.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.510
Things I thought I liked better, I like less
well and vice versa.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:42.130
If I ask you to keep track of some things
in your minds--words, numbers, pictures--and

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:47.390
I don't give you the opportunity to rehearse
or memorize that information, beyond about

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.890
seven, the information just starts to crumble
away.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:54.770
Now, if you think about it, what is a choice?

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:55.790
It's a bundle of information.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.250
What are you doing when you make a choice?

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.800
You're comparing bundles upon bundles upon
bundles upon bundles of information.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.540
This can be quite taxing on the mind.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.760
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.760
"OK.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.760
OK.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.760
Yeah.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.500
I've seen some context in which I get pretty
overwhelmed with a lot of choice, but you

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.500
know what?

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.820
I really like having a lot of choice.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.140
What about that time when I loved that rare
song on that rare CD?"

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.430
So, when do we benefit from having more choices?

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:29.910
And the answer to that lies in our level of
expertise.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:35.050
So, let's take a cognitively challenging activity,
like playing chess.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.050
Right?

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:40.990
So, let's look at the youngest chess master
in the world, Judit Polgar.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:47.550
Now, can you imagine Judit Polgar when she's
deciding that next move?

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.370
She's not looking at just the next move, of
course.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:55.370
She's gotta look at least eight moves ahead
of where she is right now.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:01.490
If she were to contemplate every single move
and every single combination of moves that

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:08.780
she has available to her at that moment, it's
more than the number of stars in the galaxy.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:13.550
And yet, she makes that decision, in the words
of Malcolm Gladwell, "in a blink of an eye."

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.260
And how does she do that?

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:22.310
Does she have this supercomputer in her brain
that just deals with all these choices?

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.140
No.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:30.620
She sees that chess board, not as made up
of individual pieces, but made up of lines

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.990
of attack as patterns.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:39.400
Her expertise allows her to organize, prioritize
the pieces on that board such that she can

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.390
quickly dump out the irrelevant options and
zero in on that handful of most relevant options.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.300
It's not that she has a better memory bank.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:54.260
If I were to take that chess board and rearrange
it in a way that doesn't make sense, it wouldn't

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:59.460
naturally occur in an ordinarily occurring
chess game, she won't do any better than any

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:05.010
of us at rearranging and re-memorize and re-putting
together that chess board.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.960
[pause]

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.870
So, if we have expertise in the domain, which
means that we've learned about our options,

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.430
we've learned all the patterns that are available
to us, we do better.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.840
We can handle more choices.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.840
[pause]

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:27.650
So, if you think about the modern day choosing
environment, who is it best suited for?

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:33.850
Well, it's ideally suited for the quote experts
on the choice domain.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.990
So, let's say you wanna buy a car.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:43.470
If you know that you wanna buy a car that's
30 thousand dollars, or under 30 thousand

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:48.470
dollars, it has a sun roof, has some extra
cargo room space in the back, even though

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.490
you don't know exactly what car you want,
simply having that information about what

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.900
your preferences are will make it a lot easier
for you to dump out all the, a whole bunch

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.200
of irrelevant options and figure out what's
your smaller choice set.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.650
So, for those kinds of things, it's great
to have a lot of choice.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:08.600
The problem is that expertise is not that
scalable.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.029
Just because you're an expert in classical
music, doesn't mean that you become an expert

00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:13.240
in rock music.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.600
And so therefore, it takes time to develop
expertise.

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:24.029
And we're limited in our capacity to develop
expertise on domain after domain after domain.

00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:32.059
But as customers, we constantly ask of our
choice providers for more and more and more

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:37.179
choice, regardless of whether it's a domain
in which we have expertise or not.

00:17:37.179 --> 00:17:43.259
Now, this problem can become quite acute for
businesses on whom the pressure to provide

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:45.860
a lot of choice is acute.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:51.220
I wanna share with you a rather mundane example,
which I think is pretty powerful, precisely

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.220
because it's so mundane.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:59.530
So, as a girl, I sometimes like to go to a
manicure salon and get my nails done.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:05.960
As you can imagine, as a blind person, getting
your nails done, picking out a color is kind

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960
of an interesting dilemma.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960
[laughter]

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960
Right?

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960
I can't see the colors.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960
I can't see what other people are choosing.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.980
So, I gotta figure out what color I'm gonna
pick.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.309
And so, I rely on other people's opinions.

00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:26.220
Now, one time, I was in the beauty salon and
I was choosing between two very light shades

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.220
of pink.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.249
Of course, everybody here knows you would
never walk into a manicure salon that offers

00:18:30.249 --> 00:18:34.879
you anything less than a hundred different
bottles of nail polish color, right?

00:18:34.879 --> 00:18:35.980
That's just not enough.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.300
That's just not a worthy beauty salon to get
your nails done in.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.420
All right.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:46.309
So, here I am choosing between very light
shades of pink.

00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:49.850
One is called "Ballet Slippers" and the other
one is called "Adore-A-Ball."

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:50.850
[laughter]

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:57.350
Now, how many of you here would say that I
should definitely go for Ballet Slippers?

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.350
[clapping]

00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:59.350
OK.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.289
How many of you here would say I should go
for Adore-A-Ball?

00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:04.289
[clapping]

00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:06.539
That's pretty much even.

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:08.129
Maybe a little less on the second round.

00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:09.129
I don't know, but about even.

00:19:09.129 --> 00:19:12.059
Anyway, I don't think that would help me make
the choice any easier.

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:16.690
So, here I am trying to decide between these
two.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.340
So, I ask these two ladies.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.809
The one lady says, "Oh, you definitely have
to go for Ballet Slippers."

00:19:21.809 --> 00:19:22.809
"All right.

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:24.330
Well, tell me about this color.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.419
Why should I choose it?"

00:19:26.419 --> 00:19:28.929
"Well, it's a sheer pink.

00:19:28.929 --> 00:19:31.929
It'll look really elegant on you."

00:19:31.929 --> 00:19:33.830
Hey, that sounded nice to me.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.830
Sure.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.830
Elegant sounds good.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.679
And the other lady chimes in and says, "No,
no, no.

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:39.299
You really need to choose Adore-A-Ball."

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:40.299
"Why?

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:42.420
What does it look like?

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.620
How is it different?"

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.620
"Hmm.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.519
It's a light shade of pink.

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.080
It'll look really glamorous on you."

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080
[laughter]

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080
OK.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.549
They both sounded pretty light to me.

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:55.990
I don't know the difference between sheer
and light.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.290
And then there's glamorous and elegant.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:02.090
So, I tried to get these two ladies to explain
to me the difference between elegant and glamorous.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.830
And about the only thing I could get them
to agree on was that if I could see them,

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.830
I would know the difference.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.830
[laughter]

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:14.080
So, I wondered about that.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.570
I decided to bring these two bottles into
the laboratory.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:21.129
I took the labels off and I invited a whole
bunch of undergraduate women.

00:20:21.129 --> 00:20:25.500
And I asked them to tell me which one they
would pick.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:31.769
Fifty percent of the women that came in accused
me of playing a trick on them--

00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:32.769
[laughter]

00:20:32.769 --> 00:20:37.590
that it was the same color in these two bottles.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.350
We do have suspicious undergrads, but please.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:45.580
Of the other 50 percent, more of them chose
Adore-A-Ball.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.710
Now, when I put the labels back on and invited
a whole bunch of other women and asked them

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:50.740
which one would they pick.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.620
Now, more of them chose Ballet Slippers.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:58.220
Who says that a rose by any other name would
have actually not smell differently?

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.799
So, why is this happening?

00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:09.039
Well, this brings me to the second cause of
choice overload, which is that so often, the

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:11.820
differences between the choices are so small.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:17.669
And yet, we feel compelled to deliberate on
those differences and figure out which one

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:20.629
is the one I should choose?

00:21:20.629 --> 00:21:28.530
And that we are reluctant to simply roll the
die and say, "Eenie, meenie, miney, moe."

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.840
We wouldn't want to be caught alive doing
something like that.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:36.929
That is because when we're making a choice
today, whatever it is, what we're eating,

00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:43.850
what we're wearing, what car we drive, what
music we listen to, whatever it is, it's no

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:49.130
longer just about function and value.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.350
What we buy says something about who we are.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:58.580
So, when we make a choice, we're not just
asking ourselves, "What do I want?"

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.259
What I'm asking myself are some questions
that are much more complex than that.

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:06.009
What I'm really asking myself is, "Who am
I?

00:22:06.009 --> 00:22:08.470
And given who I am, what do I want?

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:14.110
And given what I want, well, what should I
choose?"

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:19.840
Expressing yourself in this way allows you
to assert your individuality, to distinguish

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.379
yourself from other people.

00:22:21.379 --> 00:22:25.629
It even allows you to custom make yourself,
at least your physical self these days.

00:22:25.629 --> 00:22:33.110
And yet, this kind of expression can become
rather overwhelming and frustrating as the

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.440
number of options are proliferating beyond
our capacity.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:44.220
You see, though we think of choice as an active
individuation, we rarely choose alone.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:51.499
By this, what I mean is that every act of
choice is an act of communication.

00:22:51.499 --> 00:22:58.950
Like body language, it's generated by you--sometimes
consciously, sometimes subconsciously.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.910
And each time I make a choice, I'm sending
a message to you.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:07.179
Most often, the message that I want to send
to you is that, "Oh, look.

00:23:07.179 --> 00:23:08.179
I'm unique.

00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:09.779
But you can still relate to me.

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:11.480
I'm an individual, not an outcast."

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.799
Well, how unique are we really?

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:19.110
My colleague and I started to find out.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:24.440
We asked people to tell us how much they liked
a whole range of things, like what names would

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:30.100
you like to call your child to sunglasses
to ties, shoes, etc.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.509
We asked them how unique are these things,
how much do you like these things, how much

00:23:34.509 --> 00:23:38.950
do you think other people would like these
things.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:45.830
To give you a sense of what the choices were,
names ranged from Mike to Addison to Nehemiah.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.799
Ties went from the standard black or red to
stripes and paisleys, all the way on up to

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:53.440
neon orange leopard prints.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.100
[pause]

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.460
Well, everyone believed that they were more
unique than everybody else.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.740
Everyone believed they liked more unique things
than everybody else.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.740
Fact.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.899
Everybody liked the same things.

00:24:06.899 --> 00:24:08.539
Nothing too bland.

00:24:08.539 --> 00:24:10.220
Nothing too bizarre.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.139
Just right was slightly unique.

00:24:13.139 --> 00:24:20.460
One participant really put it well.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:26.110
When you're wearing a suit, the tie is the
one thing you have to show off your taste

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.929
and personality.

00:24:28.929 --> 00:24:33.080
Some of these ties have way too much personality
and not enough taste.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.950
It's just not right to wear an avant garde
tie.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:42.389
So, although we aspire to be unique, we still
wanna be understood.

00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:46.980
Yes, we want to stand out from the majority,
but usually not in a way that makes us a member

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.950
of a glaring and lonely minority.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:58.539
Which brings me to the third cause of choice
overload, which is that today, choosing has

00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:02.590
become a high-stakes exercise.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:09.809
We have so much pressure put upon us to know
what we want, to express what we want, and

00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:15.179
to make choices that are in line with what
we say we want.

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:23.269
As Nicholas Rose wrote in his book, "The Powers
of Freedom," "Modern individuals are not merely

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:30.529
free to choose, but obliged to be free, to
understand and enact their lives in terms

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.629
of choice.

00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:37.619
They must interpret their past and dream their
futures as outcomes of choices made and choices

00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.139
still to be made.

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:46.769
Their choices are in their turn, realizations
of the attributes of the choosing person,

00:25:46.769 --> 00:25:52.820
expressions of personality that reflect back
on those who have made them."

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:59.779
So, when we're making a choice, it's actually
even more complicated than I described a few

00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:01.659
minutes ago.

00:26:01.659 --> 00:26:07.250
It's not just that you're asking yourself,
"Who am I, and given who I am, what do I want?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.529
And given what I want, what should I choose?"

00:26:10.529 --> 00:26:17.519
In addition to all of that, I'm also asking
myself, "If I pick that, what does that say

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:20.090
about who I am and what I want?

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:27.249
And is that sending the right message about
who I am and what I stand for?"

00:26:27.249 --> 00:26:30.720
That's a huge burden.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.559
Now, think about it from the perspective of
you, the choice provider.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:38.269
You've got quite the dilemma here, right?

00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:43.679
You've gotta give people lots of choices because
people need to feel that they found the exact

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:48.480
fit for their unique selves, even though they're
really not that unique.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:56.869
And yet at the same time, if you give them
too many choices, then they might procrastinate

00:26:56.869 --> 00:27:00.450
or get less satisfied or make bad choices
for themselves.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:05.270
So, how do help them out?

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:12.169
What I wanna do now is show you just a few
techniques drawn from my research groups.

00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:13.770
We actually test out quite a few techniques.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:19.309
I wanna share with you three techniques today--three
low-cost techniques that seemed adaptable

00:27:19.309 --> 00:27:25.999
to the Google environment and give you some
examples of how to think about these.

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:32.639
Now, I should preface all of these techniques
by saying the following.

00:27:32.639 --> 00:27:37.279
I don't think people want a lot of choice.

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:41.450
People will say they want a lot of choice,
but I don't think that's what they really

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.870
want.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.919
What they really want is a better choosing
experience.

00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:52.609
They want to feel competent during the choosing
process.

00:27:52.609 --> 00:28:00.720
And they want to feel confident that what
they have chosen is a quote "good choice."

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.840
That's what they want.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.100
And once you frame it that way, it gives us
a little more flexibility.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.200
So, the first technique.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.860
Cut.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.860
I know, I know.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.909
This doesn't seem to be very popular around
here.

00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:18.500
We don't like to hear the word cut, but you
know what?

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.159
Less really is more.

00:28:21.159 --> 00:28:28.100
When Proctor and Gamble went from 26 varieties
of Head and Shoulder down to 15, they actually

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.559
saw a rise in sales of ten percent.

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:38.669
When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of
their ten worst selling cat litter products,

00:28:38.669 --> 00:28:46.350
they actually saw an increase of revenues
of 87 percent that came from a drop in costs

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.889
and an increase in sales.

00:28:47.889 --> 00:28:50.590
Think about grocery store shopping.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.840
I told you about Draeder's, right?

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.500
Well, do you know the eighth largest retailer
today is ALDI.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.239
It's a grocery store.

00:28:58.239 --> 00:29:03.809
Last year, it grew by five times the rate
of all the other grocery store chains.

00:29:03.809 --> 00:29:09.639
Now, the average grocery store today offers
you 45 thousand products.

00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:13.989
The average Walmart today offers you a hundred
thousand products.

00:29:13.989 --> 00:29:14.989
ALDI?

00:29:14.989 --> 00:29:16.960
Fourteen hundred.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.779
Only one kind of canned tomato sauce.

00:29:19.779 --> 00:29:24.450
But people trust that it's a good value tomato
sauce.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.379
And I know you guys are on the online world,
so here's an online study.

00:29:29.379 --> 00:29:36.080
This is an online grocer, doesn't wish to
be named, done by my fellow colleague at Harvard.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:43.890
Now, what they did, this online grocer decided
to reduce the number of choices that they

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.090
offered.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.929
Fifty-four percent of the choices were removed.

00:29:49.929 --> 00:29:54.000
Seventy-five percent of the households ended
up buying more.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.580
And these were of households that were buying
before as well.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.499
They saw an overall sales increase of 11 percent.

00:30:02.499 --> 00:30:08.330
Now, let me give you some specifics.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:15.789
If they cut brands, there was a modest positive
increase in sales.

00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:22.039
If they cut flavors per brand, that's when
it actually hurt sales.

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:27.200
Now, look at brand times size.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.200
Brand times size.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.889
What I mean by that, that's like a six-pack
of Coke, two-Liter bottle.

00:30:31.889 --> 00:30:34.179
I add 12-pack.

00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:40.789
Removing the 12-pack dramatically increases
sales.

00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:45.010
That size times brand choice additions just
don't help us.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.240
We just get confused.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.279
We stop buying.

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:52.200
That's what's going on here with these kinds
of choices.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:31:00.909
Now, a lot of times we also believe that,
you know luck, choices are really useful because

00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:05.169
it also, it doesn't just help you in terms
of sales, but it also helps you become more

00:31:05.169 --> 00:31:07.169
creative, particularly in the performance
arena.

00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:08.909
Now, let's test that.

00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:11.279
I wanna show you one of my favorite studies.

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:15.210
It wasn't done by me, but I love the picture
so I use it.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.869
So, imagine a bunch of expert knitters.

00:31:19.869 --> 00:31:22.340
They've been asked to make a scarf, to knit
a scarf.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.950
This is what they do for their profession.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:29.710
They're either given twelve pieces of yarn
or six pieces of yarn, and given one week

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.519
to make a scarf.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:35.090
They know they're gonna be judged by other
knitters on how creative these are.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:40.320
And they know they're gonna be judged by potential
buyers on how creative they are.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:46.149
Here's what the scarves look like when they
have 12 pieces of yarn.

00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:49.359
Here's what the scarves look like when they
had six pieces of yarn.

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:51.629
Hey, what do you guys think?

00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:53.059
You like twelve better?

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:55.480
Is twelve more creative?

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.519
What about six?

00:31:58.519 --> 00:31:59.539
[clapping]

00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:03.100
I'm hearing more enthusiasm for the six.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:10.299
And we see this across many different domains
now that if you give people a lot of choices,

00:32:10.299 --> 00:32:14.649
even when they're experts in the domain of
creativity, it doesn't seem to be helping.

00:32:14.649 --> 00:32:19.559
Now, you guys, though, also give people choice.

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:24.559
You give people choice in a rather interesting
way, which is that you allow your employees

00:32:24.559 --> 00:32:28.519
to take 20 percent of their time to do something
creative.

00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:32.649
And you might say, "Well, is it that bad?"

00:32:32.649 --> 00:32:33.649
Well, it's not bad.

00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:35.679
Because we've put a bandwidth around it.

00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:39.879
Notice how 50 percent--actually you guys can
give me the real numbers on this--but notice

00:32:39.879 --> 00:32:43.759
how a lot of different ideas that come out
of new product inventions that come out of

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:46.799
Google came out of that 20 percent time.

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:51.440
Things like Gmail that we can't actually imagine
a world without at this point.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:33:00.679
Why does that work and why does the 12 pieces
of yarn not work?

00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:09.090
The great French polymath, Henri Poincare,
once said, "Invention consists of avoiding

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:18.479
the constructing of useless combinations and
consists of the constructing of useful combinations,

00:33:18.479 --> 00:33:21.539
which are an infinite minority.

00:33:21.539 --> 00:33:25.360
To invent is to discern is to choose."

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:34.960
Now, let me propose the corollary, which is
that to choose is to invent, so that as we

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:42.960
learn about, as we develop expertise in a
given area, we are able to be in a better

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:53.210
position to best construct those most useful
combinations, rather than being distracted

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.590
by these external stimuli.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.899
We can construct what's most useful.

00:33:57.899 --> 00:34:01.450
So those are some thoughts on "cut."

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:06.350
Now, there are times when you're gonna say
to me, "Look.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.030
I've cut as much as I can.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:10.210
I just can't cut anymore.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:14.590
I need to offer people all these choices because
they really are different."

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:19.149
So, my first rule of thumb, by the way, get
rid of all redundant, irrelevant options.

00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:22.190
So now, these choices really are different.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:23.190
What do you do?

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.079
Brings you to the second technique: categorization.

00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:31.639
Now, categorization works in some pretty interesting
ways.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.560
Take a magazine aisle.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:39.450
I picked this just because it's a cognitively
fairly intensive task.

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:44.099
You have magazine aisles up and down the Wegman's
grocery stores.

00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:49.970
They offer anywhere from 331 to 664 magazines
in their aisle.

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:52.010
Their aisle is identical.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:58.500
So, all they're doing is double, triple, quadruple
slotting the same magazine when they have

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.850
less.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:05.079
And what we were interested in was in looking
at to what extent does the number of magazines

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:07.990
affect people's perceptions, their satisfaction,
in sales.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.369
And what we found was quite interesting.

00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:15.329
If I ask you how many choices you have in
front of you, you don't know the right answer

00:35:15.329 --> 00:35:16.550
to that.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:20.800
The correlation between people's estimates
of how many choices they thought they had

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:26.210
in front of them and how many actual choices
there were, was less than 0.05.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.210
It was actually really low.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.160
That's because we don't actually sit around,
like stand around there, and count, like oh,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.160
one, two, three.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.250
We just don't do that when you're talking
about that many choices.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:42.770
What drove people's perception of how many
choices they had, whether they were satisfied

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:48.780
with the choices present, whether they were
likely to buy, was not number, but how it

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.780
was arranged.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:56.460
So, if you take 400 magazines and you divide
it up into 25 categories, and you take 600

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.910
magazines and you divide it up into 10 categories,
people see the 400 as offering them more than

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.040
the 600.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.109
Why?

00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:09.500
Because categories become the cue for variety.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:14.369
And we can handle more categories than we
can handle choices.

00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:20.240
I can handle up to 20, 25 categories because
categories are cues.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.089
Like, not like.

00:36:22.089 --> 00:36:23.500
Like, not like.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.069
Dump out categories fast.

00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:27.299
I'm not so quick to dump out choices, but
I'll dump out categories.

00:36:27.299 --> 00:36:28.299
And I'll say, "Yeah, OK.

00:36:28.299 --> 00:36:31.630
That category is relevant to me."

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:35.789
Now, per category, you wanna make the number
of choices small.

00:36:35.789 --> 00:36:38.859
And I can't give you a scientific number on
that.

00:36:38.859 --> 00:36:43.880
But what we're seeing is that depending on
how complex the choice is, somewhere between

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.589
about three to about ten seems to be a good
range per category.

00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:56.530
Now, I want you to look at this picture of
jewelry displays.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.270
One is called "Jazz."

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.190
The other one is called "Swing."

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:06.059
If you think the collection on the left should
be called Jazz and the collection on the right

00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:09.450
should be called Swing, clap your hands.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.760
[clapping]

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.070
OK.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.070
Some people.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.890
Collection on the left, Swing.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:16.859
Collection on the right, Jazz.

00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:17.859
[clapping]

00:37:17.859 --> 00:37:20.250
Well, more people said that.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.849
And by the way, you guys are right.

00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:22.849
That's how they call it.

00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:24.340
That's how Tiffany labels them.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.690
But you know what?

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.839
This is a horrible way to categorize.

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:29.869
I mean, gimme a break.

00:37:29.869 --> 00:37:33.109
Does it really look like this is Jazz versus
Swing?

00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:40.829
Does that really tell you anything about what
you wanna buy and put on your ears or body?

00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:45.110
The category names should not be informative
to the choice-makers.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:47.890
They should be informative to the choosers.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:48.890
[pause]

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:57.109
So, one of my favorite examples of really
good categorization is this store called Best

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:58.109
Sellers.

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:02.400
Maybe some of you went to this store before
it got bought out by A and P. It was rated

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:09.349
as the number one wine shop by the Wine Enthusiast
magazine in '09.

00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:13.940
It only offers you a hundred different bottles
of wine, divided up into eight categories.

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.960
The category names really make sense to me.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.280
They're like, fizzy, juicy.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.280
OK.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.280
I get that.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.799
Per category, they only give me about ten
options, a little over ten options.

00:38:23.799 --> 00:38:24.799
And now look.

00:38:24.799 --> 00:38:29.880
If I can zero in on one category, well, now
I'm willing to engage.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.630
I'm gonna engage and maybe learn about the
various wines.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:38.609
Maybe even read all the information that the
sommeliers want me to read so I can look smart

00:38:38.609 --> 00:38:45.920
and feel smart when I pick up that bottle
of wine and I'll take it to my boss' place.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:51.840
Because when we make a choice, it's not just
an expression of our preferences.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.220
It's not like we know our preferences and
then we go in and make a choice in line with

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.220
that.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:03.289
So often, the choosing process itself teaches
us what our preferences really are.

00:39:03.289 --> 00:39:07.170
So now, let's look at a third technique.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:10.170
It's what I call "conditioned for complexity."

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:17.410
So, this is a technique that, I think, works
well for really complicated choices, like

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.780
the customization problem.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.260
And I wanna show you a really complicated
study that was done with a bunch of colleagues

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.059
of mine.

00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:28.510
One of them will be actually here tomorrow,
Jonathan Levav.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:32.470
And here's what we did.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.119
This was done with a German car manufacturer.

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:40.630
And this German car manufacturer wishes to
be unknown.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:48.730
So, this particular car company allows people,
residing in Europe, when they buy this car,

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.730
to completely custom-make their car.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:55.110
So, they make an average of about 60 different
decisions.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.520
So, they're gonna decide.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.839
So, once you decide on a particular model
of car, now you have to make a whole bunch

00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:02.150
of decisions about this car.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:06.010
So, you onto the computer and you even have
to click on different decisions.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:11.079
And these decisions vary in the number of
options that they offer you, like gear shift,

00:40:11.079 --> 00:40:13.200
you've got four options.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.420
Interior decor, 13 options.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.750
Exterior car color, 56 car colors.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.859
So, here's what they agreed to do.

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:29.589
They varied the order in which the decisions
were presented.

00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:38.539
So, half the customers went from high choice
decisions--56 car colors--to low choice decisions--four

00:40:38.539 --> 00:40:39.960
gear shifts.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:46.559
The other half went from low choice decisions--four
gear shifts--to high choice decisions--56

00:40:46.559 --> 00:40:48.830
car colors.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:50.940
[pause]

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:56.690
Notice that they're all seeing the same amount
of choice.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.000
The experience ought to be identical.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.640
The amount of information that I'm asking
them to shove into their brains is ultimately

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.850
the same, but it will not be experienced in
the same way.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:10.710
Now, how are we gonna test that?

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:16.510
Well, per decision, you can hit the default
key, which means you'll automatically get

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.160
whatever happens to be the default.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:26.369
So, we reasoned, "If I see you hitting that
default key a lot, that means you're getting

00:41:26.369 --> 00:41:27.369
disengaged.

00:41:27.369 --> 00:41:28.369
You're getting tired."

00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:29.430
You know, look.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:35.809
If you're talking about spending over 30 thousand
Euros of your hard-earned money and now you're

00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:38.299
just gonna hit the default key?

00:41:38.299 --> 00:41:39.299
[laughter]

00:41:39.299 --> 00:41:40.789
So, here's what you get.

00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:43.290
High to low.

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:46.640
They start off engaged.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.869
Then they start hitting the default.

00:41:51.869 --> 00:41:53.990
Low to high.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.809
There's hanging in there.

00:41:56.809 --> 00:41:57.809
[pause]

00:41:57.809 --> 00:42:04.000
Now, we also asked them after they paid down
over 30 thousand in Euros, how satisfied were

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.890
they with their car that they just purchased?

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.020
And from the perspective of the vendor, they
want you to be happy and contemplating your

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.119
next car.

00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:14.530
High to low.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.950
Not so happy.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:19.369
Low to high.

00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:20.369
Much happier.

00:42:20.369 --> 00:42:21.369
Now, I've shown you this one.

00:42:21.369 --> 00:42:25.950
We actually did this with quite a number of
other different decisions, but I picked this

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:30.000
one 'cause it's probably the most complicated
of the decisions that we've looked at.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.150
So, what's happening here, like, why should
it make a difference?

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:36.960
Well, think about it this way.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:42.799
You start off with a simple decision because
it only has a few choices.

00:42:42.799 --> 00:42:44.210
You're learning how to choose.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.140
You're learning how to form preferences.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:52.010
Even though the decision of which gear shift
doesn't actually teach you anything about

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:57.920
your preferences of interior decor, by the
time you get to 13 choices, you're getting

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.980
better at ruling out alternatives and figuring
out how to choose and how to form preferences.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:07.369
By the time you get to 56 car colors, you're
excited.

00:43:07.369 --> 00:43:10.220
You wanna see what this end product looks
like.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.260
You are engaged.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.580
You are willing to invest.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:21.740
So, starting off in the shallows helps prepare
you for the complexity.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.890
Teaches you how to choose.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.710
Teaches you how to deal with complexity.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.650
Teaches you how to form preferences.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.819
And it keeps you motivated.

00:43:29.819 --> 00:43:33.710
Remember I referred to the three-by-three
rule earlier on that McKinsey has.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.910
It's another form of this.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:40.849
They are dealing with complicated products,
with high-end clients.

00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:43.809
They understand that they're clients don't
know their preferences.

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:45.180
So, what do they do?

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:51.109
They structured the choice in three tiers
of three choices.

00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:52.109
That's how they--.

00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:57.160
That way, people understand how they made
their choices and how they went from one set

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:02.349
of choices to the next set of choices to the
next set of choices.

00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:08.589
When you look at investment brokers and you
look at what are the, what is the commonly

00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:14.039
reported technique of the top ten percent
of investment brokers as to what do they do?

00:44:14.039 --> 00:44:18.410
They will also tell you a version of the three-by-three
rule.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.460
Right?

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:24.800
How do you get people to understand what their
risk preferences really are and what their

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.840
investment style is going to be, is using
some version of three-by-three because some

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.450
people don't actually know upfront who they
really are and what kind of an investor they

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.920
wanna be.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.890
Back to the Bay Area.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.599
Let's compare Apple versus the Dell choosing
experience.

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:47.170
Notice how Apple has very much this flavor
of being a kind of company that offers products

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:51.339
that's about you, that's supposed to speak
to you, that's about your identity.

00:44:51.339 --> 00:44:53.260
Well, guess what.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:57.210
Look at how many choices they offer.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:06.260
Two laptops, two desktops, and then within
those, a series of two choices that are in

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.500
two buckets.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.370
Look at Dell.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:12.380
Nine versus eleven.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.720
So, choice can be linked.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:23.170
Giving people less choice can be linked still
to a sense of identity, a sense of uniqueness.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:26.900
So, let me wrap up here.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.430
I have talked about this phenomenon known
as choice overload.

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:36.329
I've described three consequences of that.

00:45:36.329 --> 00:45:44.849
Three consequences being more likely to disengage,
lower quality, less satisfied.

00:45:44.849 --> 00:45:48.359
Three causes of choice overload.

00:45:48.359 --> 00:45:53.299
And then, I finally described you three techniques
for trying to mitigate the problem of choice

00:45:53.299 --> 00:45:59.079
overload--cut, get rid of the irrelevant,
redundant, extraneous alternatives.

00:45:59.079 --> 00:46:02.700
Second, categorize.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.220
Categorize it in a way that makes the differences
between the choices meaningful.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.260
Third, condition for complexity.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.609
Start people off easy.

00:46:12.609 --> 00:46:19.069
Think of that choosing exercise as one in
which people need to learn what their preferences

00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:20.480
are and how to choose.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:27.820
Now, I know I've focused so far on the domain
of how do you deal with, how do you offer

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.150
choosers, from the perspective of choice providers,
choices?

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:33.970
I mean, present that.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:34.970
But look.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:39.420
Choice and the management of choice affects
all of us no matter what we do, whether we're

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:44.580
a choice provider or whether we're something
else, we're all constantly trying to manage

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.580
choices.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:52.650
So, what I wanna now do is have you contemplate,
or have you actually do an exercise that helps

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:57.130
you think about how to better manage your
choices in your everyday work lives.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:01.210
We make a lot of choices in our every day
work lives.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:06.349
People report making hundreds upon hundreds
of choices per week in their life.

00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:11.809
When CEO's were recently followed, they found
that CEO's in an average week engaged in about

00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:16.990
139 tasks that were made up of many, many,
many sub-choices--an average of about five

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.990
times as many choices as there were tasks
that they engaged in.

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:24.130
That's not what's so surprising.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:29.400
Fifty percent of their decisions were made
in nine minutes or less.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:35.049
Only about ten percent of the decisions that
CEO's made did they give an hour or more of

00:47:35.049 --> 00:47:36.049
their time.

00:47:36.049 --> 00:47:38.089
Now, think about your time.

00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:43.650
Do you know what makes it into the nine minute
category versus the one hour category?

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:44.779
Are they the right choices?

00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:50.880
So, what I'd like you to do now is do a little
exercise with me.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.970
It's on your chairs.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:58.079
This is an exercise that I do with a lot of
executive programs.

00:47:58.079 --> 00:48:02.319
If you remember nothing else today, I just
want you to take this exercise with you and

00:48:02.319 --> 00:48:04.289
do it twice a year.

00:48:04.289 --> 00:48:07.740
People say it's the best thing they've done
for themselves.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:13.250
And in a matter of weeks, I'm gonna have an
app posted 'cause I know you guys like apps,

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:14.250
right?

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:18.060
There's going to be an app posted on my website
and I will send you guys the link to it so

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.740
you can do it next time as an app.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.920
Now, in reality, you should take about 45
minutes to do this task.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.200
I only have what, ten minutes?

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.720
How many minutes are you gonna give me?

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.720
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Ten minutes.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.720
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: OK.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.130
I got ten minutes to do this task.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:34.750
What I'm going to do is really just walk you
through it just to make sure you've got the

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.610
understanding of how to do it, give you a
flavor of it.

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:41.019
And then I want you to later do this right.

00:48:41.019 --> 00:48:42.510
All right.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:49:02.930
So, first, jot down tasks that you do in a
given week at work.

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:17.540
[long pause]

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:32.150
[bell dings]

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:46.760
All right.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:54.630
Now, look at that list.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.150
Think about what you can cut.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:59.089
You should delegate it out.

00:49:59.089 --> 00:50:00.089
It's extraneous.

00:50:00.089 --> 00:50:01.290
It's a waste of time.

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:02.290
It's irrelevant.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:05.160
You shouldn't be doing it.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:11.710
Try to cut at least 50 percent.

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:17.380
[long pause]

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:26.450
You know, when I noticed that cafe that only
offers you one choice with what to eat for

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:31.500
lunch, I knew instantly that that would absolutely
be one of the choices I would cut from my

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.849
life working here.

00:50:32.849 --> 00:50:34.869
Not gonna go to the cafe that offers me choices.

00:50:34.869 --> 00:50:40.220
Just gonna go to that cafe that gives me no
choice.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.220
[laughter]

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.150
[long pause]

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:45.109
[bell dings]

00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:47.890
Now, take the choices that you have remaining.

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:51.140
People are always giving me sass about not
wanting to cut.

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.890
They're convinced they can't cut.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:53.890
OK?

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:57.349
You'll see what I mean as we go further down
and you'll go back up and wanna cut.

00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:58.380
OK?

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:05.530
So now, take what you've got and ask yourself,
"On which of these tasks is the frustration

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:09.180
after completing it higher than the reward?

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:14.309
Which of these tasks is the reward higher
than the frustration?"

00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:15.980
Frustration is higher than reward?

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.619
Nine minute category.

00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:21.720
Your goal there is "I just wanna prevent disaster."

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:27.369
Let's find some quick formulas, simple solutions
to prevent a disaster.

00:51:27.369 --> 00:51:29.619
Reward higher than frustration?

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:34.910
One hour category possibility.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:43.730
[long pause]

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:48.130
[slam]

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:56.950
[bell dings]

00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:11.450
Now what you do, is you take all the ones
that are in your one hour category potential

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.000
and now you categorize them.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.140
Try and make it not more than five categories.

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.950
But see how many you've got.

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:27.599
[long pause]

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:34.570
[audience member coughs]

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:39.220
[bell dings]

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:55.500
How many categories are we seeing here?

00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:04.800
Just call them out.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:11.770
&gt;&gt;male #1: Five.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:18.750
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: Five.

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:21.079
Two.

00:53:21.079 --> 00:53:22.660
Any others?

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.089
Three.

00:53:24.089 --> 00:53:25.730
Anything higher than five?

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:26.940
OK.

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.650
So, I guess I'm hearing somewhere from two
to five.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:37.069
Now you wanna ask yourself is where is your
value added to yourself and to the organization

00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:38.240
highest?

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.730
On which category is your value added the
highest?

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:54.430
That goes to the top and you rank order it
from highest to lowest in terms of value added.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:54:00.559
And that's how you know where to spend more
of your time.

00:54:00.559 --> 00:54:03.279
[pause]

00:54:03.279 --> 00:54:06.000
OK?

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.670
So, I would encourage you to really do this,
take some more time doing this so that you

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:14.500
can really do it seriously.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:20.839
The two main observations that people have
when they do this is first, they realize some

00:54:20.839 --> 00:54:23.079
things that they really should be cutting.

00:54:23.079 --> 00:54:28.530
And it's helpful to do it every few months
because it just becomes a good reality check.

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:32.920
The second observation that people have is
they'll realize that, "You know what?

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:38.420
I'm just not spending the time on the stuff
that matters more, that's more valuable.

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.089
I'm spending way too much time on the crap."

00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:46.519
So it helps them re-balance their time and
re-balance their time more in favor of the

00:54:46.519 --> 00:54:47.519
priorities.

00:54:47.519 --> 00:54:49.829
Now we all know the Pareto rule, right?

00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:53.910
The idea that look, 80 percent of the rewards
I'm gonna get in life--.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:55.700
I'm sorry.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.700
Twenty percent--.

00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.700
No, sorry.

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:02.210
Eighty percent of the rewards I'm gonna get
in life come from 20 percent of my efforts.

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:06.630
Which means, by the way, that 80 percent of
the time you spend doing your stuff is wasted.

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:11.230
But of that 20 percent that's gonna lead to
your 80 percent reward, you wanna make that

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:13.230
really, really, really powerful, really, really
meaningful.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:17.809
It's gotta be the stuff that really matters,
where your value added is the greatest.

00:55:17.809 --> 00:55:23.830
Remember the Pareto rule when you are trying
to allocate your time and your energies, where

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:28.759
your thought processes should be, where all
your efforts should be going.

00:55:28.759 --> 00:55:31.359
So, I want you to do this exercise.

00:55:31.359 --> 00:55:35.859
By the way, can I get a commitment from you
guys that you'll do it in the next 48 hours?

00:55:35.859 --> 00:55:36.890
Is that possible?

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:38.480
How many people are willing?

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.480
[clapping]

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.480
All right.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.480
That's pretty good.

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:42.480
All right.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.039
I'm gonna hold you to it, by the way.

00:55:44.039 --> 00:55:45.039
[laughter]

00:55:45.039 --> 00:55:50.190
As I said, there's gonna be an app posted
and I'll send you the link so that next time

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:53.980
around, you don't have to do it by hand 'cause
I'm sure you guys don't do anything by hand.

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.990
[laughter]

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:59.079
Now, if there's one message that I wanna leave
you with today--.

00:55:59.079 --> 00:56:01.161
There's two things that I don't want you to
forget.

00:56:01.161 --> 00:56:02.839
I don't want you to forget this exercise.

00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:07.039
And I don't want you to forget the one message
of today.

00:56:07.039 --> 00:56:13.740
And that is that if we are to get the most
from choice in our lives, I think it is necessary

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:18.000
that we should be choosy about choosing.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.809
And that is one of the essential keys to the
art of choosing.

00:56:22.809 --> 00:56:26.019
Thank you very much.

00:56:26.019 --> 00:56:28.509
[applause]

00:56:28.509 --> 00:56:38.630
Do I have time to take questions?

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:41.150
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Yes.

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:45.349
Does anyone have any questions?

00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:48.897
&gt;&gt;female #1: So, I had a question, if, when
you, the list, is it work related tasks or

00:56:48.897 --> 00:56:49.897
life tasks?

00:56:49.897 --> 00:56:50.897
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: I would do them separately.

00:56:50.897 --> 00:56:51.897
I told you to do it work-related.

00:56:51.897 --> 00:56:52.910
But I would do work and life separately.

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.690
If you try to do both at the same time, you'll
be overwhelmed.

00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:55.690
[laughs]

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.690
&gt;&gt;female #2: Do you have any techniques for
like, breaking addiction to choice?

00:56:56.690 --> 00:57:01.950
Like, if you're just like, "I must pick the
absolute best restaurant to get into tonight"

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:12.490
or like you're really, you just can't stop
trying to backslide?

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:16.319
Any tips on that?

00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:22.079
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: I'll tell you what I do.

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:24.559
I ask myself, "Is this choice worth making?"

00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:26.910
I always ask myself that.

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:30.569
If it's not, I'm not dedicating any energy.

00:57:30.569 --> 00:57:32.849
So, look.

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:34.059
I love wine.

00:57:34.059 --> 00:57:36.430
I really love to have a glass of wine with
dinner.

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.849
But do you know that I never choose my wine?

00:57:38.849 --> 00:57:41.630
I joined the New York Times Wine Club.

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:46.480
And every month, eight bottles are sent to
my house and I have no idea what's coming.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.480
[laughter]

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:50.470
And it's on average great.

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.460
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible].

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:56.450
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: Oh, by the way.

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.609
I never choose my restaurant.

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:01.680
[laughter]

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:16.751
&gt;&gt;female #3: You mentioned that when you [inaudible].

00:58:16.751 --> 00:58:17.751
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: Yeah.

00:58:17.751 --> 00:58:18.751
Yeah.

00:58:18.751 --> 00:58:19.751
&gt;&gt;female #3: [inaudible].

00:58:19.751 --> 00:58:20.751
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: Usually, you are better
off not giving people--.

00:58:20.751 --> 00:58:25.730
So, people do perform better in a decision-making
task, if they're not choosing whether or not,

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:33.950
but they're choosing between A or B. And A
and B is fine and A, B, C is fine.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:38.160
Those are your two ways in which we can really
do a pretty good job.

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.170
But whether or not to do something?

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.769
We have a much harder time doing the trade-offs
on that.

00:58:42.769 --> 00:58:52.819
&gt;&gt;female #4: Are there differences as far
as personality types and things like that?

00:58:52.819 --> 00:58:53.819
[inaudible]

00:58:53.819 --> 00:58:58.329
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: I don't know of anything
that relates choice to Myers-Briggs.

00:58:58.329 --> 00:58:59.529
I mean, there is this--.

00:58:59.529 --> 00:59:02.869
I mean, Barry Schwartz is gonna be here tomorrow
and he talks about maximizers.

00:59:02.869 --> 00:59:07.200
And I've done some studies with Barry on the
maximizers versus satisfiers.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:12.259
And maximizers do, other people that say they
want lots and lots and lots of choice and

00:59:12.259 --> 00:59:14.740
shoot themselves in the foot that way.

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:17.250
But I always feel--.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.029
So, OK.

00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:21.800
Barry Schwartz and I often have this debate.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:27.470
He always says satisfies on everything, even
the choices that are most important to you

00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.550
on life.

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:35.069
And I always say, on the decisions that are
really important to you, maximize.

00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:37.940
Everything else, find a simple heuristic.

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.860
Just make it really easy.

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.991
And a lot of times, easy means don't choose.

00:59:42.991 --> 00:59:43.991
[pause]

00:59:43.991 --> 00:59:57.430
&gt;&gt;male #2: Is there a residual effect to being
exposed to lots of choice?

00:59:57.430 --> 01:00:16.609
So when someone goes into a store that's curated
a set of choices for them, they forget that

01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:17.609
the rest of the world exists and that choices
outside of that store are possible?

01:00:17.609 --> 01:00:18.609
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: Huh.

01:00:18.609 --> 01:00:19.609
That's an interesting question.

01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:20.609
I don't know.

01:00:20.609 --> 01:00:21.609
It seems plausible.

01:00:21.609 --> 01:00:22.609
I mean, it certainly is the case that--.

01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:23.609
What was I reading recently?

01:00:23.609 --> 01:00:27.720
Fifty percent of ice cream sales in the United
States are accounted for by vanilla, chocolate,

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.900
and strawberry.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:29.900
Right?

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.940
But I can't imagine any of us would go into
an ice cream parlor that only offered you

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.650
those three flavors.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:40.460
We would have to have at least 31 flavors
these days, right?

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.460
So, yeah.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.930
I don't know.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:48.340
That's a good question.

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.710
[pause]

01:00:50.710 --> 01:01:00.190
&gt;&gt;male presenter: All right.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.685
Thank you very much for your time.

01:01:02.685 --> 01:01:03.685
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: Thank you.

01:01:03.685 --> 01:01:04.685
[applause]

01:01:04.685 --> 01:01:05.685
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Thank you all for attending.

01:01:05.685 --> 01:01:06.685
&gt;&gt;Sheena Iyengar: You guys can follow me on
Twitter, by the way.

01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:07.685
I also have a Twitter site.

01:01:07.685 --> 01:01:08.685
[laughter]

01:01:08.685 --> 01:01:09.119
Thank you.
