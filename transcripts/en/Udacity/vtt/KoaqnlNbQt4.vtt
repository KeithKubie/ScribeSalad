00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.672
So, in summary what we have done is we have taken a mechanism, that is

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:08.543
typically used in distributed systems, namely RPC, and

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:10.992
we ask the question suppose we want to

00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:13.520
use RPC as a structuring mechanism in a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.667
multiprocessor. How to make that efficient so that

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.062
the designers of services will in fact use

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:25.770
RPC as a vehicle. For building these services.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.620
And the reason why you want to promote that, is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.170
because when you put every service in its own protection

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.150
domain you are building safety into the system. And that

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.160
is very important for the integrity of an operating system.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.430
As an operating system designer, we worry about the integrity

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.590
of services and we can provide the integrity by putting

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.860
every service in its own protection domain. And we're making

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.000
RPC cheap enough that you would use as a structuring

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.360
mechanism we are promiting a, a software engineering practice

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.670
of building services in sep, in sepearate protection domains.
