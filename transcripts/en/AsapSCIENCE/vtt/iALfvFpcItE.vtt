00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Many of us have faced the dark symptoms of anxiety,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.500
Whether writing an exam or applying for a new job.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.595
But for some, this feeling is difficult to stop even in seemingly

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.825
normal situations leaving a lasting effect on

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.705
quality of life, so what's going on and

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:17.785
why are you so anxious ? close to 7 million people are

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:20.425
affected by generalized anxiety disorder,  meaning

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:25.000
they experience excessive anxiety that occurs more days than not for at least six month.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This can include sleep disturbance, irritability, and muscle tension.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.240
Panic attacks are also possible but slightly different,  in that they are sudden

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.860
and short episodes of intense fear that trigger

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.200
a severe physical
reaction like accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, and dizziness.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.120
In fact, anyone can experience a panic attack, whether
or not they have an anxiety disorder,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.940
and it's not always triggered by something known or specific.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.520
While not fully understood, anxiety is partially triggerred by the amygdala and hypothalamus controlling the circulation of cortisol
and adrenaline in your body.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.720
Genetically, 40% of those with generalized anxiety disorder also have a relative with it,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.100
meaning
these hormone levels are likely linked to your genes.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.960
Your environment can also be a factor,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.100
as certain anxiety disorders are 
related to traumatic childhood experiences.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.800
Varying levels of neutron transmitters like GABA, serotonin, and dopamine

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.880
may also be to blame. Serotonin which

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:17.535
contributes to
feeling of well-being and happiness,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.900
works by moving from neuron to neuron in your brain through a gap called the synapse.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.140
Any 
unused serotonin returns to the original neuron through a special transporter.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.940
But for those with something like OCD, a type
of anxiety disorder,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.780
it has been suggested that a mutation in these transporters creates a higher volume of returned serotonin

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.680
before it's had a chance to move to the receiving neuron

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.680
resulting in a decreased amount in the synapse, ultimately affecting
your emotions.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.140
This is why medications like Selective Serotonin Reuptaken Inhibitors

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.160
are often used in these anxiety cases to
prevent the seretonin from returning to its original neuron.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.860
Many anxiety disorders also show an overactive amygdala and periaqueductal gray area

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.075
which can have negative repercussions not
just on the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080
brain but on our bodies. In a study of nearly 300 people over five years,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.480
those who had overactrive amygdalas had
a higher incidents of heart disease too

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.160
as it triggers an increased production of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.980
white blood cell in the bone marrow,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.515
leading
to an inflammatory response which

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:17.885
contributes to increased build-up of fatty deposits in the artery.

00:02:17.885 --> 00:02:20.355
If you have a phobia, that's considered an anxiety

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.340
disorder too. But since many fears can help use survive

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.245
like the fear of
spiders or heights,it'be been suggested that

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.235
they may be imprinted on our DNA and passed on.

00:02:29.235 --> 00:02:32.065
When mice are shocked with 
electricity after been exposed to

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:35.225
the smell of fruits, they quickly learn to fear that smell.

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:37.575
But more amazing is that the future
generations

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:40.445
of mice also fear the fruits' smells,

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:43.665
even though they've never been exposed to the shock. It turns out

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:47.100
that a 
electrical shock that led to over expression in certain odor receptors,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.605
making the next generation more sensitive to certain

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:52.620
smells.
, almost as though they were switched on.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.980
and the switches maybe related to some phobias.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.300
When it comes to treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy

00:02:57.305 --> 00:02:59.820
helps to identify certain thoughts that leads to the

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.435
feelings influencing
your behavior and aims

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:05.525
to change those initial thoughts to combat anxiety disorders.

00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:09.380
On the other hand, medications such as
SSRIs and SNRIS,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.940
re often used to prevent reuptake of serotonin or norepinephrine,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.475
but can result in many side effects

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:17.415
and often
increase tolerance with prolonged use.

00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:20.405
Benzodiazepines are also used to help induce sleep and

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:25.140
promote muscle relaxation, but are
also linked to dementia in older populations.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.200
Needless to say the neuro-chemical basis of anxiety is extremely complicated

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.600
and it's not useful to tell somebody to just calm
down or get over it.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.355
So we decided to make a second video breaking down what we do

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:39.355
to combat anxiety with some tips and tricks
that

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.000
we find work, which you can checkout here, and subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday.
