00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.780
Now before I write the action for

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.470
this button, in this new ViewController, let's do a quick review of MVC.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.060
So we currently have two scenes in our app.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.290
In the first scene, we have a view with several buttons.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.630
This view is controlled by a class called ViewController.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.840
And this class inherits from UIViewController.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.230
The second scene has a view which currently has just a simple button.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.620
This view is controlled by another view controller that we made.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.200
I want you to think about the name of this view controller, and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.980
enter it in this box.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.215
By the way, this view controller also inherits from UIViewController.
