IF YOU GET RID OF PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, YOU'LL BE STRANDING

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:08.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
MILLIONS OF WOMEN WITHOUT
HEALTHCARE. 

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:10.943 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHERE WILL THESE MILLIONS OF
WOMEN GO.

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:13.846 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WE WILL BE FINE, LARRY.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.851 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, IT'S HOLLY. HOLLY

&gt;&gt; YEP.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:30.963 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THIS IS WHERE I AM
GETTING MY PAP NOW.

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:35.168 line:91%
A NICE HOMELESS MAN SAID HE
WOULD DO IT FOR A HANDY AND A

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.969 align:start position:0% line:85%
A HALF A BANANA.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.672 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT A SCORE!

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:40.873 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHOA, WHOA, HOLLY,
NO, NO.

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:41.607 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT SAFE!. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.943 line:85%
YOU NEED TO SEE A REAL DOCTOR.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.813 align:start position:0%
WELL, TOO LATE, CAPTAIN AFTER
THE PROCEDURE.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.181 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SORRY.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.850 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DIDN'T KNOW.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.086 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; LARRY IS RIGHT, HOLLY.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.588 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN YOURS
DONE HERE.

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:59.826 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, MY GOD, IT'S ROBIN
THEDE, EVERYONE.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.228 align:start position:0%
ARE YOU IN THE SUBWAY?

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:05.865 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEP. THE 4 TRAIN, LARRY.

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:09.302 align:start position:0% line:91%
OR THE CLEAN GREEN, I LIKE TO
CALL IT.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:13.072 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THERE IS NOTHING
CLEAN ABOUT THAT.

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:14.874 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T THINK YOU THOUGHT THIS
THROUGH.

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:18.111 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THINKING HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS, LARRY.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:20.713 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONCE YOU DEFUND PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, YOU TAKE WHAT YOU

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:21.914 align:start position:0%
CAN GET.

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:24.150 line:91%
PLUS  I AM GETTING A PAP SMEAR
PRACTICALLY EVERY TIME I TAKE

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:26.686 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE RUSH HOUR TRAIN.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.126 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: AND, ROBIN, WHO
WOULD EVEN PERSONAL THIS ON THE

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.193 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUBWAY.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:37.230 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THOSE GUYS WHO DANCE ON THE
SUBWAY.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.265 align:start position:0%
IT IS SHOW TIME!

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.734 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ROBIN. 

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.737 align:start position:0% line:91%
THOSE GUYS ARE TALENTED, BUT I
DON'T THINK THEY ARE THAT

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.872 align:start position:0%
TALENTED.

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.340 size:75% position:38% line:85%
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.841 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HOLLY, ROBIN YOU HAVE IT ALL
WRONG.

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.643 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: MIKE, WAIT, IS THAT
MIKE? 

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:51.611 size:78% position:39%
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MIKE?

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:55.248 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M SMEARING WITH
SOLIDARITY.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.650 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, MY GOD.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:02:00.686 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M SORRY, MIKE BUT THAT IS
NOT RIGHT AT ALL.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.421 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD
IS NOT RIGHT.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:03.289 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S TRUE. 

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY ARE YOU AT RAND PAUL
HEADQUARTERS?

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.292 size:88% position:44% line:85%
IS HE GIVING OUT PAP SMEARS?

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.227 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF HE'S TAKING AWAY WOMEN'S
HEALTH SERVICES, HE BETTER BE. 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.393 line:85%
&gt;&gt; TELL HIM, MIKE! THAT'S RIGHT!
