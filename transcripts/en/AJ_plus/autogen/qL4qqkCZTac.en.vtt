la salida de la ciudad I converted my

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900
la salida de la ciudad I converted my
 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.980
la salida de la ciudad I converted my

una gran gran doctora
 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.060
una gran gran doctora
solo area prefer our regresar my eyes

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070
solo area prefer our regresar my eyes
 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.010
solo area prefer our regresar my eyes
and I you shall be rocky angry Pais

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
and I you shall be rocky angry Pais
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:16.809
and I you shall be rocky angry Pais
