background as a mechanical and an

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
background as a mechanical and an
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.070
background as a mechanical and an
aerospace engineer and then you turned

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
aerospace engineer and then you turned
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.220
aerospace engineer and then you turned
toward proteins that's an interesting

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

problems and I think that that mindset

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
problems and I think that that mindset
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.150
problems and I think that that mindset
really set the way that I approached

engineering the biological world it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
engineering the biological world it's
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.700
engineering the biological world it's
very hard to do that and do better than

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
very hard to do that and do better than
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040
very hard to do that and do better than
evolution but as an engineer I could

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
evolution but as an engineer I could
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.260
evolution but as an engineer I could
come in and say here are the features we

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
come in and say here are the features we
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.270
come in and say here are the features we
want to have what's the best process

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
want to have what's the best process
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.299

called evolution you brought some

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
called evolution you brought some
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.880
called evolution you brought some
different ideas how you think we're

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
different ideas how you think we're
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.490
different ideas how you think we're
different backgrounds as well well I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
different backgrounds as well well I
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.820
different backgrounds as well well I
brought in the desire to use this to do

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
brought in the desire to use this to do
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.679

criticism people who didn't think of

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
criticism people who didn't think of
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.039
criticism people who didn't think of
your science your work as science what

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
your science your work as science what
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.390
your science your work as science what
kept you going then

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
kept you going then
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.690
kept you going then
oh well scientists get criticism all the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
oh well scientists get criticism all the
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.170
oh well scientists get criticism all the
time it's part of the scientific method

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180
time it's part of the scientific method
 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.270
time it's part of the scientific method
but we have to learn how to take the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
but we have to learn how to take the
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.149
but we have to learn how to take the
criticism the parts that are useful and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
criticism the parts that are useful and
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.789
criticism the parts that are useful and
use those to improve and just set aside

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
use those to improve and just set aside
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.160
use those to improve and just set aside
all the parts that are not so useful so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
all the parts that are not so useful so
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310
all the parts that are not so useful so
what keeps me going is that ability to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
what keeps me going is that ability to
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.730
what keeps me going is that ability to
recognize what I can take from that and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
recognize what I can take from that and
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.450
recognize what I can take from that and
to completely ignore the rest

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460
to completely ignore the rest
 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.800
