00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer to this question is yes,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or at least that team structure can matter.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
A very interesting study at Microsoft looked how teams that were responsible

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for individual features were compose.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
More specifically, the study would look for how distant

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the common manager of a team was.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If there would be one direct common manager for all members of the team,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that distance would be 1, and if their common manager would be, say,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
two levels removed, then the distance would be 2.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If the lowest common manager of a team would be say, Steve Ballmer,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the manager of Microsoft, then the distance would be 7 or 8 or whatever

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the number of management levels at Microsoft is.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now, it turned out that the higher this distance was the more defect prone

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the modules produced by that team were.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The assumption is that if there is no joint management in a team

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
where every decision first has to go up to the highest level and then back again,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
then this makes teamwork particularly hard.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It also makes it hard to make decisions,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and it makes it hard to create some common responsibility

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for the module you're working on.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This study was made on Windows Vista.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
As a result of that study, Microsoft reorganized the teams

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
for later versions of Windows such that situations like these would no longer occur.
