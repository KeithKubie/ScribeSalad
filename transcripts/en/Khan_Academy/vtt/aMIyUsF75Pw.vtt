00:00:00.981 --> 00:00:02.200
- So, let's say we've been given all

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.272
this information about the function g

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:07.036
and it's derivative
evaluated at x equals two.

00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:08.733
We know g of two is equal to three.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.807
G prime of two is equal to one.

00:00:10.807 --> 00:00:13.911
The second derivative of g
evaluated two is negative one.

00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:18.202
The third derivative of g
evaluated at two is two.

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:21.811
Given that, what we're
being tasked with is

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:26.600
we want to use the second
degree Taylor polynomial

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.600
centered at x equals two to
approximate g prime of one.

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:38.707
Not g of one, g prime of
one and so I encourage you

00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:43.707
to pause this video and try
to think about it on your own.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.408
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:50.275
Let's just remind ourselves what a second

00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:52.980
degree Taylor polynomial
centered at x equals two

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.911
would look like for a
general function f of x.

00:00:57.137 --> 00:01:02.137
F of x would approximately be equal to,

00:01:03.592 --> 00:01:08.592
it would be f of two plus f prime of two

00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:16.568
times x minus two plus
f prime prime of two

00:01:19.177 --> 00:01:24.177
times x minus two squared, all
of that over two factorial.

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:28.309
That would get us to a second degree place

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:29.730
because it's x minus two squared.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.602
This is gonna give us a
second degree polynomial.

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:34.730
This is the general case.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.811
If we want to find the
approximation for f centered

00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:42.705
at x equals but we're
gonna do it for g prime.

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.412
Let me write this down.

00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:47.943
Alright, so I'll do it in blue.

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:52.302
So, we have g prime of
x is what we're going

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:53.913
to try and approximate and then we're

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.772
going to evaluate it at x equals 1.

00:01:56.772 --> 00:02:00.642
G prime of x is going to
be approximately equal

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:03.674
to, well same thing, it's
going to be the function

00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:05.244
that I'm going to try to approximate

00:02:05.244 --> 00:02:08.976
evaluated at two so g prime of two.

00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:11.079
Notice, so I'm approximate f of x,

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.501
it's that function evaluated at two.

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:14.306
If I'm approximating g prime of x,

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:16.974
it's that function evaluated at two.

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:20.171
Then, plus the first
derivative of this thing

00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:22.280
which is the second derivative of g.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.009
G prime prime of two times x minus two

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.542
and then plus the second
derivative of the function

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:32.242
that I'm trying to approximate
but the second derivative

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:36.173
of g prime is going to be
the third derivative of g.

00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:41.173
It's going to be g prime prime
prime of two times x minus

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:47.308
two squared, all of
that over two factorial.

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:50.374
Now, they tell us what these things are.

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:54.974
Let me use some new colors here.

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:57.780
They tell us g of two is equal to three.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.577
This right here, oh, actually no,

00:02:59.577 --> 00:03:01.400
that's not what we're gonna wanna use.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.005
They tell us we're using g of two.

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:07.642
They're telling us g prime
of two is equal to one.

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:11.177
G prime of two, so this right
over here is equal to one.

00:03:11.177 --> 00:03:14.047
G prime prime of two is
equal to negative one.

00:03:14.047 --> 00:03:17.538
This is negative one right over here

00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:19.972
and then finally the third derivative

00:03:19.972 --> 00:03:23.642
of g evaluated at two is two.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.442
Two over two factorial, two factorials is

00:03:26.442 --> 00:03:28.611
two times one or it's just two.

00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:30.980
So that and that cancel out.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.478
What are we left with
for our approximation

00:03:33.478 --> 00:03:35.846
our second degree approximation of g

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:38.311
prime of x centered at x equals two?

00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:43.311
We are left with g prime
of x is approximately

00:03:44.082 --> 00:03:49.082
equal to one minus x minus two.

00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:55.907
One minus x minus two,
I guess I could write

00:03:55.907 --> 00:04:00.907
that as plus two minus
x so plus two minus x.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:07.027
The negative of x minus
two is two minus x.

00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:12.169
Plus x minus two squared and obviously I

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.467
could simplify this even more.

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:18.467
This is three minus x plus x minus

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:23.080
two squared and now I can evaluate it.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.280
If I wanna approximate g prime of one,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.505
I could say g prime of one
is going to be approximately

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:32.244
equal to, wherever I see the x is here

00:04:32.244 --> 00:04:34.097
I put in a one there, so it's going

00:04:34.097 --> 00:04:39.097
to be three minus one plus
one minus two squared.

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:44.911
Well, this is going to be two and then one

00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:47.546
minus two is negative one but then

00:04:47.546 --> 00:04:50.175
if I square it I get a positive one.

00:04:50.175 --> 00:04:51.742
So this whole thing is one.

00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:55.280
Two plus one is equal to three.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.734
Once again, this is an
approximation for g prime of one.

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.138
What did we do here?

00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:02.566
We found the Taylor series.

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:05.139
The second degree Taylor
series approximation

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.713
for g prime of x centered
around x equals two

00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:11.242
and then we evaluated that approximation

00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:16.242
at x equals one to
approximate g prime of one.

00:05:17.668 --> 00:05:21.240
Anyway, hopefully, you found that fun.
