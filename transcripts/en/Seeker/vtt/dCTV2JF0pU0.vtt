00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.310
I get asked all the time what my type is.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.959
A negative. What? It’s way more important,
what if I need a blood transfusion?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.070
Hey blood brothers and sisters, Julian here

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.099
for DNews. Even if you don’t know your blood
type you’ve probably heard the terms thrown

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.380
around before. AB positive. O negative. What
do they mean?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.609
It turns out there are actually 33 different
systems for categorizing a person’s blood,

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.289
but the nomenclature you’re most familiar
with is a combination of two of them; the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.629
ABO system and the Rh system.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.309
The reason these two are so much more well
known is because they are by and large the

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.750
most important factors in blood transfusions.
In most cases these alone should be enough

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.969
for a doctor to know what kind of blood to
pump back into you if you’ve sprung a leak.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.609
It’s why some racing drivers in the ‘70s
and ‘80s had their blood type sewn on their

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.289
race suit or painted on their car. Nowadays
they don’t bother; the tests to determine

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.710
blood types and compatibility with donor blood
are quick and much more foolproof than relying

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.570
on embroidery or a sticker.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.660
So what do the letters and plus/minus symbols
actually denote? They’re describing little

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.060
surface markers on the blood cells called
antibody generators, or antigens for short.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.450
Antigens come in a lot of different varieties
and your body’s immune system attacks cells

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.479
with antigens that don’t match your own.
Having the right antigens is like knowing

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.020
the password to get into the super secret,
boys-only treehouse.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.759
Antigens can be either sugars or proteins.
The antigens described by the ABO blood group

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.259
system are sugars and they come in 4 different
combinations or “types”. Type O means

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.409
the blood cells have no A or B antigens, so
it might be easier to think of it as type

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.560
Zero. People with this blood type can only
receive type O because their immune systems

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.290
will attack anything with an A or B antigen.
But any other blood type can accept type O

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.810
blood because the red blood cells will be
ignored by the immune system.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.619
Type A means cells have the A antigen so they
can’t receive type B blood, and type B means

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.090
cells have the B antigen and won’t be compatible
with type A blood. I think you see where this

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.939
is going: type AB means the red blood cells
have both A and B antigens, and so none of

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.930
the white blood cells will attack anything
with A or B antigens. People with this blood

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.090
type can accept any ‘ol human blood. Well,
so long as the Rh antigens are correct too.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.629
The Rh blood group system is so named because
75 years ago it was discovered the antigens

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.349
behaved similarly to those in Rhesus macaques.
But they are different, so don’t go around

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.209
injecting monkey blood all willy-nilly. Rh
antigens are proteins, there are 49 varieties

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.409
but one in particular, RhD, is highly immunogenic,
meaning immune systems that don’t have it

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.209
freak out when they encounter it. So if you
have RhD, your blood type has a plus symbol

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.599
next to it and you can only donate to other
positive blood types, but you can accept positive

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.310
and negative blood types. Put the two systems
together and it means O- is the universal

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.810
donor, while AB+ will be the universal receiver.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.659
Blood types are passed down through your genes.
You can change blood type, but it’s extremely

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.280
rare. It either happens from some sort of
illness, or if you get a bone marrow transplant

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.959
your blood will eventually convert to your
donor’s type.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.720
So now you know! Unless you have some rare
blood type that needs one of the other 31

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.720
blood group systems to describe it, you now
understand what the letters and symbols of

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.170
your blood type mean.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.970
In some places like Japan it’s believed
that blood types also correspond to personality

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.470
traits, but really it only affects your immune
system. Thinking Type O blood makes a person

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.150
confident and controlled is kind of like thinking
Jupiter is going to affect your luck today.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.250
Speaking of, here’s Laci talking about why
Astrology is silly. Check the description

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.250
for a link if you’re on your mobile.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.370
Are there any other things like blood types
you take for granted because you just never

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.519
thought about it? If you want us to to explain
them, go ahead and ask us in the comments,

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.729
it’s what we’re here for. I’ll see you
next time on DNews.
