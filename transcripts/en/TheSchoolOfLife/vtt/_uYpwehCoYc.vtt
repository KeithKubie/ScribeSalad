00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
Nowadays, anyone putting forward a valued judgment -

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.900
that is, anything other than a rock solid scientific fact,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.580
is likely to come across the following complaint pretty soon after:

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.080
"Who are you to say that?"

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.180
You might hear it if, for example,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.420
you try to argue that Shakespeare is probably a lot more interesting

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.960
as a writer than the guy who wrote prose on the back of the cereal packet.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.720
Or if you say that Louis Kahn Salk Institute

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.540
is for sure better looking than an average Holiday Inn.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.760
Or that Bach's Mass in B Minor

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.880
is more technically accomplished than Abba's Super Trouper.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.140
Or that The Economist is a better news source than the Daily Mirror.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.200
Quite early on in the discussion,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.260
anyone who doesn't agree

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.080
is simply likely to shut things down

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.100
by saying that no progress on these questions can ever be made,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.540
that no one knows how to settle such disputes,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.460
and that, therefore, anything goes and any further attempt to pursuade

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.840
is just bullying

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.260
or those electrifying and awkward words

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420
"elitist" and "snobbish."

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.480
And if you're not careful,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.640
there might also quite quickly be a Twitter deluge coming your way.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.120
To understand why such responses are so common,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.680
we have to look back at history

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.640
and some pretty unfortunate developments which have led to a collective trauma

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.140
from which we're still suffering.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.280
For most of the history of humanity,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.940
we're intimidated by some pretty dodgy purveyors of half-baked valued judgments.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.860
Religions used to sell us all sorts of nonsense

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.720
under the notion that God told us it was so.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.960
Kings and dictators would justify their abuses

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.580
by spurious notions of their inherent right to authority.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.440
And members of elite groups,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.360
like doctors and academics or just wealthy people,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.140
would justify all manner of odd practices

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800
on the basis of their authority and fancy uniforms.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.140
As societies have gradually become more democratic,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.180
and people have learned to stand tall in the face of authority,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.160
So too that patience for valued judgments has collapsed.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.040
So much so that now anyone who lays forth an idea

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.580
with any kind of confidence

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.240
or simply says anything about this or that being good or bad,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.060
can swiftly re-evoke the worst of the traumatic old days

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.100
and will therefore stand to be shut down at once.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.800
The only exception to this is science.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.040
Here, respect remains paramount.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.200
We'll accept an idea if it's a scientific truth.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.140
If it's come from a lab result,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.540
we'll take it on trust.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.900
But anything else when we're in the area of relativity

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.900
and, who are you to say that is?

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.940
Now, unfortunately, this is really problematic,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.540
as there are some very important questions out there

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.880
that lie utterly outside the realm of science

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.240
and can't ever be settled with a formula or experiment.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.580
For example, you're always going to struggle to mount a scientific argument

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.280
when trying to make progress with these sorts of questions:

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.580
What should children learn at school?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.100
What's a good relationship?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.760
How should we build nice cities?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.380
What's an attractive building?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.460
What should businesses concentrate on?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.780
How should bosses behave towards workers?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.200
Unfortunately,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.460
these are essential questions to try to reach intelligent conclusions on.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.620
And yet, because by their very nature, these questions admit to doubt and disagreement,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.420
it can seem as if nothing solid can ever be said around them.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.980
But here's our line:

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.840
That a question can't be answered definitively, with 100% accuracy,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.220
shouldn't be a reason not to try and address it.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.360
There IS such a thing as a good and a bad argument outside of science.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.940
One can speak better and worse answers to big questions.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.880
No one's talking about trying to impose conclusions on anyone else

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.440
in the way that the Pope or the emperor used to do.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.940
It's all about trying to make sound arguments,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.120
proceed logically,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.200
and attempt to persuade others of your cause

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.220
through reason and a bit of charm.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.580
Rational, democratic discourse

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.200
depends on people engaging with one another,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.980
trying to figure out ideas

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.060
and not running away from complex issues by dogmatically shutting everything down

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.420
with the insidious and slipperty retort,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.480
"who are you

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.520
to say that?"
