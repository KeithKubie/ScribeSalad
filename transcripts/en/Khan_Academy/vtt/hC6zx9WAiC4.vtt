00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.140
Let's think a little bit
about the volume of a cone.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.580
So a cone would have
a circular base,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.040
or I guess depends on
how you want to draw it.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.530
If you think of like a
conical hat of some kind,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.580
it would have a
circle as a base.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.820
And it would come to some point.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.850
So it looks something like that.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.561
You could consider this to
be a cone, just like that.

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:23.310
Or you could make it
upside down if you're

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.050
thinking of an ice cream cone.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.880
So it might look
something like that.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.490
That's the top of it.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.260
And then it comes
down like this.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.310
This also is those
disposable cups of water

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.559
you might see at
some water coolers.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.100
And the important
things that we need

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.940
to think about when we want to
know what the volume of a cone

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.410
is we definitely want to
know the radius of the base.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.990
So that's the
radius of the base.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.580
Or here is the radius
of the top part.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.190
You definitely want
to know that radius.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.980
And you want to know
the height of the cone.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.060
So let's call that h.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.950
I'll write over here.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.940
You could call this
distance right over here h.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.350
And the formula for the
volume of a cone-- and it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.310
interesting, because it's close
to the formula for the volume

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.830
of a cylinder in a
very clean way, which

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.874
is somewhat surprising.

00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:20.290
And that's what's
neat about a lot

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.706
of this three-dimensional
geometry

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:24.450
is that it's not as messy as
you would think it would be.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.130
It is the area of the base.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.950
Well, what's the
area of the base?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.340
The area of the base is
going to be pi r squared.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.580
It's going to be pi r
squared times the height.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.460
And if you just multiplied
the height times pi r squared,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.460
that would give you the volume
of an entire cylinder that

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.340
looks something like that.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.132
So this would give
you this entire volume

00:01:54.132 --> 00:01:55.840
of the figure that
looks like this, where

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.290
its center of the top is
the tip right over here.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.210
So if I just left
it as pi r squared

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.460
h or h times pi r
squared, it's the volume

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.990
of this entire can,
this entire cylinder.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.260
But if you just want the
cone, it's 1/3 of that.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.595
It is 1/3 of that.

00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:13.970
And that's what
I mean when I say

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.000
it's surprisingly clean that
this cone right over here

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.610
is 1/3 the volume of this
cylinder that is essentially--

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.656
you could think of this
cylinder as bounding around it.

00:02:24.656 --> 00:02:26.030
Or if you wanted
to rewrite this,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.930
you could write this as 1/3
times pi or pi/3 times hr

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.450
squared.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.310
However you want to view it.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.080
The easy way I remember it?

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.470
For me, the volume of a
cylinder is very intuitive.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.080
You take the area of the base.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.210
And then you multiply
that times the height.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.960
And so the volume of a
cone is just 1/3 of that.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.585
It's just 1/3 the volume
of the bounding cylinder

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:53.914
is one way to think about it.

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:55.580
But let's just apply
these numbers, just

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.920
to make sure that it
makes sense to us.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.029
So let's say that this is
some type of a conical glass,

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:03.070
the types that you might
see at the water cooler.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.500
And let's say that
we're told that it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.500
holds 131 cubic
centimeters of water.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.620
And let's say that we're
told that its height right

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.640
over here-- I want to do
that in a different color.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.350
We're told that the height of
this cone is 5 centimeters.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.640
And so given that,
what is roughly

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.280
the radius of the
top of this glass?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.290
Let's just say to the
nearest 10th of a centimeter.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.660
Well, we just once again
have to apply the formula.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.880
The volume, which is
131 cubic centimeters,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.010
is going to be equal
to 1/3 times pi

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.340
times the height, which is 5
centimeters, times the radius

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.326
squared.

00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:58.200
If we wanted to solve
for the radius squared,

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.090
we could just divide both
sides by all of this business.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.820
And we would get
radius squared is

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.400
equal to 131 centimeters
to the third--

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.030
or 131 cubic centimeters,
I should say.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.500
You divide by 1/3.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.649
That's the same thing
as multiplying by 3.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.410
And then, of course, you're
going to divide by pi.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.920
And you're going to
divide by 5 centimeters.

00:04:27.537 --> 00:04:29.120
Now let's see if we
can clean this up.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.620
Centimeters will cancel out
with one of these centimeters.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.910
So you'll just be left
with square centimeters

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.860
only in the numerator.

00:04:37.405 --> 00:04:38.780
And then to solve
for r, we could

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.840
take the square
root of both sides.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.690
So we could say that
r is going to be

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:57.230
equal to the square root of--
3 times 131 is 393 over 5 pi.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.340
So that's this part
right over here.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.330
Once again, remember
we can treat units just

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.610
like algebraic quantities.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.020
The square root of
centimeters squared-- well,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.370
that's just going to be
centimeters, which is nice,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.180
because we want our
units in centimeters.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.710
So let's get our calculator
out to actually calculate

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.290
this messy expression.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.410
Turn it on.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.910
Let's see.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:30.870
Square root of 393 divided by 5
times pi is equal to 5-- well,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.630
it's pretty close.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.130
So to the nearest, it's
pretty much 5 centimeters.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.770
So our radius is approximately
equal to 5 centimeters,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.131
at least in this example.
