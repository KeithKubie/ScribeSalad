00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:04.857
[How did you find the job
that you currently have?]

00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:09.188
This is, actually, I think the way
things are going to be:

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:11.123
"I didn't find it, I created it."

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.453
I created the job that I currently have.

00:00:14.477 --> 00:00:17.314
And I think that's going to happen
a lot in the future, too.

00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:20.573
As a matter of fact, I think people
are going to have multiple jobs.

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:22.847
They'll have jobs
that they're passionate about,

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:24.571
others that pay the bills, I think.

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:26.460
I think that's a really good way to go,

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:28.640
because you'll always have
something going on,

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:30.486
you're always excited about something,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.783
there's a lot more change in your life;
it makes it more interesting.

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:35.589
So that would be my answer to that.
