00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.050
Solve and eliminate any
extraneous solutions.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.390
And what they mean by
extraneous solutions are,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.210
in the course of solving this
rational equation right here,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.510
we might get some solutions
that if we actually put it

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.830
into the original problem would
give us undefined expressions.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.830
And so those solutions
are extraneous solutions.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.170
They actually don't apply.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.830
You actually want
to throw them out.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.288
And so let's look
at this equation.

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:27.910
We have x squared over x plus
2 is equal to 4 over x plus 2.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.950
So right from the
get-go, we don't

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.450
know if this is
going to necessarily

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.380
be a solution to this equation.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.810
But we know, just
looking at this,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.670
that if x is equal
to negative 2,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.489
then this denominator and this
denominator are going to be 0.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.530
And you're dividing by 0.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.886
It would be undefined.

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:43.260
So we can, right
from the get-go,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440
exclude x is equal
to negative 2.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.430
So x cannot be
equal to negative 2.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.730
That would make either
of these expressions

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.410
undefined, on either
side of the equation.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.920
So with that out of the
way, let's try to solve it.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.270
So as a first step, we
want to get the x plus 2

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.570
out of the denominator.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.520
So let's multiply both
sides by x plus 2.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.300
X plus 2 divided by
x plus 2 is just 1.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.180
And we can assume
that x plus 2 isn't 0.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580
So it's going to be defined.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.790
x plus 2 divided by
x plus 2 is just 1.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.830
And so our equation has
simplified to x squared

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.387
is equal to 4.

00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:23.220
And you could probably
do this in your head,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.810
but I want to do it properly.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.850
So you can write this.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.790
You could subtract
4 from both sides.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.830
Do it in kind of the proper
quadratic equation form.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.040
So x squared minus
4 is equal to 0.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.152
I just subtracted 4 from
both sides over here.

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:38.360
And so you could factor this.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.760
This is a difference of squares.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.970
You get x plus 2 times
x minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.970
And then if this is equal to
0, if the product of two things

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.390
are equal to 0, that means
either one or both of them

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.190
are equal to 0.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.340
So this tells us that x plus
2 is equal to 0 or x minus 2

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.770
is equal to 0.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.190
If you subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation right

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.910
here, you get x is
equal to negative 2.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.509
If you add 2 to both sides of
this equation right over here,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.310
you get x is equal to 2.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.310
And we're saying
that either of these

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.500
would make this
last expression 0.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.080
Now, we know that we need
to exclude one of them.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.230
We know that x cannot
be equal to negative 2.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.490
So x equals negative 2 is
an extraneous solution.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.670
It's not really a solution
for-- it is a solution for this,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.110
once we got rid of the
rational expressions.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.320
But it's not a solution
for this original problem

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.020
up here, because it would make
the expressions undefined.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.290
It would cause you
to divide by 0.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.810
So the only solution
here is x is equal to 2.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.400
And you can check it yourself.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.760
If you do 2 squared, you
get 4, over 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.310
And that should be
equal to 4 over 2

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.000
plus 2, over 4, which
it definitely does.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.263
1 is equal to 1.
