00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.090
There's another piece to URLs I'd like to show you. And this is

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.650
the, this is the final piece I'll talk about right now, and that's

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.990
called the port. When you make a web request to a server, this

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.730
is the host, this is the, the name of the machine or, or

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.990
the location of the machine you're requesting. In order to make an internet

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.890
connection you need two things. You need one, the address of the machine,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.780
which is represented by the host And two, you also need a port.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.040
And by default the port equals 80. If you want to use a different port

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.710
you can include it in the URL between the

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.150
host and the path separated by a colon. And in

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.545
this case we'll be making our request on port

00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:39.440
8,000. Get used to this URL because this will be

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.580
your local development URL for a lot of this

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.790
course, and actually for a lot of your career as

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.280
a web developer. You're constantly accessing your local machine and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.460
you're probably doing it on something other than port 80.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.660
There are even more parts to a URL, but they're not particularly relevant to

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.250
us right now, they'll come up, you know, as we go. Let's do one

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.390
final quiz about URL's before we move on. What I'd like you to do

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.810
is take this URL and identify its

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.100
main parts host, protocol, fragment, query, and port.
