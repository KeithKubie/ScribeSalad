1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.170
Ego is the enemy.
Can you take that too far?

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.490
I can joke about myself all day and be okay.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.630
But also I don't want coworkers not to take me seriously.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.960
So that's actually kind of two questions.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.500
It's talking about ego and the soccer about joking around.
Right.
Those are,

6
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.910
those are two different things.
A little bit like self deprecating.
Yeah.

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.870
And so can you,

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.630
can you be too humble and put your ego in so much?
Check that it hurts you.

9
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:34.950
Yes.
Actually you can,
you know,
hey echo,
how's it going?
I'm in charge.
Um,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.980
I'm really horrible at this.
I just don't know what I'm doing right.

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.700
That's not good.
You know,
it's like I said to the Marine lieutenant,
right.

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.740
Am I tell them to go and into check in and say,
hey guys,
I,
you know,

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.530
I just don't,
I just got here,
just got out of the basic school.

14
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.020
I don't know anything really.
Do you want to call that guy?
No,

15
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.120
that's the one I'm talking about suits or can you be overly humble?
Yes.

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.090
Like I said,
it's okay to admit that you don't know everything,

17
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.220
but that doesn't mean don't be well prepared.

18
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.240
That doesn't mean don't be confident that you can figure things out.

19
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:09.450
That doesn't mean you can't ask good questions.
Right?

20
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.540
It doesn't mean that you don't report in without knowing the nomenclature and

21
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:19.800
the fundamentals.
Right.
That's gonna.
You know,
hey Jocko just checked in.

22
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:23.190
But he knows what our mission's been.
He knows what our mission statement is.

23
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.730
He knows how our basic processes,
he already looked at all that.

24
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:30.780
He knows everyone's name.
Yeah,
I'm prepared.
I'm prepared.

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.710
So that's what you want to be.
That's not saying,

26
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.450
I have no idea what I'm doing right now.
I just got here.
No,
no,

27
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.770
that's not what we're talking about.
So don't be overly humble.

28
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.320
Most people,
the reason I talk about the other one of be humble all the time,

29
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:53.100
it's because most people tend towards letting their ego be inflated.

30
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.300
That's what most people tend towards.
So I tend to talk more about,
hey,

31
00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:59.370
keep your ego in check when you're checking.

32
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.890
Cause most people that are so scared of looking bad they'd say,

33
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.340
well I know how to do this.
I've never seen it before.
I know how to do that.

34
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.310
You've never seen it before and you're going to look stupid.
Hey guys,

35
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.070
a [inaudible] been put in charge of this.

36
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.690
I know you guys been doing it for awhile.

37
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.180
Looking forward to learning from you on how you execute it and,

38
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.790
and driving forward and keeping kicking ass in this mission.

39
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.370
Does anyone get mad at that?
No.
It,
that's a lot different than,
hey guys,

40
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:26.640
I have no idea what's happening.
That's too much.
Yeah.

41
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.260
So don't go there and be humble,
but not,

42
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.480
not passive.
Put your ego in check,
but don't turn into a baby.
Work the desk.

43
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.060
Uh,

44
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.810
the second part of this as a question about joking around too much and that's,

45
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.321
you know,

46
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:47.520
that's different from too much ego and absolutely you can joke around too much.

47
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.400
Now,
of course.
And we've talked about this,

48
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.630
a good team and a good leader.
They're having fun,

49
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.360
they're having fun with everything that you're doing.
And I always had fun.

50
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.510
I always had fun.
I still fun all the time.
I'm having fun.

51
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.230
But if all you do is joke around all the time,

52
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:07.180
but then when it comes time for the joke to be over,

53
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:10.420
people won't take you seriously,
so that will be problematic.
You know,

54
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:15.010
I had a rule that was no joking on the radios.
Right.

55
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.550
So if you were on a radio,
you weren't allowed to take make jokes.

56
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.440
No joking on the radio.
And what's cool about,
because you know,

57
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.980
in tasking to bruiser when I was a platoon commander,

58
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.730
when I was assistant platoon commander,
we had fun all the time.
We laughed,

59
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:31.510
we joked,
we had a blast with everything we did.
No joking on the radio.

60
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.590
You see what I'm saying?
That was a law.
No joking on the radio.

61
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.820
And what was good about it was as I think back to that,

62
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:44.440
what that translated to was we're not joking around in the field and that

63
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.540
expanded,
look,
when we're briefing,
we're not joking around.

64
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.920
It was a very clear distinction,
of course.
Did people have,

65
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.770
did things happen out in the field?
Sometimes we're like,
oh my God,

66
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.220
this is hilarious.
Of course that happened,
but the general,

67
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.960
99% of the time,
95% of the time was,
hey,
we're in the field,

68
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:06.370
we're working.
We are serious.
That's the priority.
Did we have fun in the field?

69
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.020
Yes.
Did I laugh in the field?
Yes,

70
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.760
but the priority and this norm was we are going,

71
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:14.710
we are serious and we are.
That's the priority.

72
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.600
So don't joke so much that you

73
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.330
don't get taken seriously.
One time I was with a senior ranking officer,

74
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.610
a flag officer,
meaning an officer with stars,

75
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.380
and we went to go brief.
I wasn't attached to this unit,

76
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:36.850
but then they went to go brief this unit or we went to go receive a brief from a

77
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.810
unit and in the brief,
in a PowerPoint side,

78
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.390
these guys hadn't put a slide in.

79
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.810
That was an inappropriate slide and it was a crude joke and it was really funny.

80
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.120
I thought it was really funny,
you know?
I was like,
oh,

81
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.790
that's pretty funny that these guys did that yogurt.
I saw the slide.

82
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:59.410
They had it up there and it was completely inappropriate and andF and vulgar.

83
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.090
Right.
That's what it was.
They didn't know this general at all.

84
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.180
And he was a very straight laced guy and didn't appreciate that kind of humor

85
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.610
and they,
they,
they,
they had like the welcome slide.

86
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.820
The next slide that came up was this inappropriate vulgar slide.

87
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.010
It was,
it was,
it was,
it was,

88
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.390
it was inappropriate.
I'll leave it at that.
And,

89
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.010
and you know,

90
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.600
it was like there was a chuckle in the room and at the same time there was

91
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.820
nothing but silence in the room.
You could feel the discomfort.
And,

92
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.240
and since like I said,

93
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.050
I thought it was funny and I knew it wasn't going to go over well as soon as I

94
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:43.570
sought out,
Ooh,
that's not good.

95
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.140
And the reason I'm telling this big long story is because I have another rule.

96
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.270
Don't put jokes into your slides in PowerPoint.

97
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.740
No jokes.
Because you can,

98
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.940
you can articulate the joke cause you can feel the out and see what's going on.

99
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.320
You can get it.
Get a taste.
You can get a feel for them if you,
if you walk in,

100
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.980
if they would have had a chance,
if I could have said freeze the first slides up,

101
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.400
you've met the general here for for five minutes,

102
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.980
do you want to remove that side?
They'd be like,
oh,
absolutely.

103
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:15.220
Let's get it out of there.
Because they could see that he was a serious guy and,

104
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.710
and not,
you know,
one to be that that wants to be seen.
That kind of thing.

105
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.590
It didn't take,
wasn't hard.
It was pretty easy book to read,

106
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.390
but you don't have that opportunity.
There was no,
hold on.

107
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.350
We're going to delete this slide.
Nope.
There it was.
Boom.
Welcome.
It was the,

108
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.700
it was after the slide of,
you know,
this is where we are was the welcome slide.

109
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.410
And I said,
oh,
so no joking on the radio.

110
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.790
No joking in your slides,
keep your slides clean and,
and the,

111
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.740
the risk benefit.
You tell a good joke,
hey,
that's great.

112
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:53.670
You get,
you know,
two credits.
If you're joke is bad and considered inappropriate,

113
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.670
it's negative 39 and not worth it.
Yeah.
It's not worth it.
Yeah.

114
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.150
And again,
I'm all about,
you know,
you,
you want to have fun when you're briefing.

115
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:03.950
You want people to be entertained and have fun,

116
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.860
but you don't want to have inappropriate stuff.
No.
Yeah.

117
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.420
So that's that for both these,
for both these things.

118
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:14.150
Am I joking too much or am I being too serious?
Am I,
you know,

119
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:18.210
as my ego too big or am I being too humble?
You,

120
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.340
it's a balance.

121
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.920
It's a dichotomy of leadership and you've got to find the right spot in the

122
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:24.860
middle and you've got to check yourself and you've got to,
you know,

123
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.560
any of your team is joking when they shouldn't be joking.
Guess what?

124
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:28.910
You're leading them the wrong direction.

125
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.920
If your team is somber and doesn't have any spirit,

126
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.010
you're not having good enough time.
So you gotta find the balance there.

127
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:38.120
Same thing with ego.
You know,

128
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:42.380
are people talking with you and communicating with you and being open with you

129
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.340
and telling you when they disagree with things or is no one talking to you?

130
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.720
Because if that's the case,

131
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.270
your ego's so big that they don't want to talk to you.
So find the dichotomy,

132
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.340
leadership,
find the balance between those two.
Dang,
that's a good one.
If,

133
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.900
if they're,
um,
if they're not talking to you.
Yeah,
yeah.
Cause you know,

134
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:04.160
Holland at work,
you're talking with your friends,
you know,

135
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.710
then somebody comes,
that person comes who you're like,
oh yeah,

136
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.870
for whatever reason you're not necessarily talking about them or nothing,

137
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.080
but they come in your car,
you've got to stop your conversation,
you know?
Yeah.

138
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.390
That's like a little indicator,
you know,
if you roll up to,

139
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.230
you see people across the room talking and you're like,
hey,

140
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:25.720
that looks like a cool conversation or whatever.
I'm going to go say hi to Paul,

141
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.110
whatever.
And you go and they stopped talking and they stopped laughing.

142
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.020
They just stopped talking and they give you like small talk or whatever.
That's,

143
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.210
that's the indicator.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's an indicator.

144
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.900
It could be actually either one of those too.

145
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.790
If people are having a good time and you walk in and they stop laughing.
Oh.

146
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:40.700
So you say,
okay,

147
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.540
and if you walk in and they're having a conversation that they don't,

148
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.210
they just don't want to talk to you,
they're probably,

149
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.270
they probably don't like your big ego that's slapping him in the face.
Okay.

150
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.730
Put your ego in check.
