00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
Whether it's Pixar's Dory with
short-term memory loss or the saying "He

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.820
has the brain of a goldfish" or
constantly told that fish are simple and

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.380
have poor memories, but are they more
complex than we think?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.969
This is the rotating snake illusion. 
As you move your eyes

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.829
the snakes appear to be moving in
circles, but the image is actually stationary.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.369
It turns out that fish see this illusion
in the similar way to you and I. Even

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.019
though fish diverged from land
vertebrates 450 million years ago,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.890
both have developed similar vision to
hunt, escape predators, and avoid

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.700
collisions.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.360
Researchers have hypothesized that we
see the same motion illusions as a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.140
result of convergent evolution, where
organisms not closely related

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.220
independently evolved similar traits as
a result of having to adapt to similar environments.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.120
Which one of these red
circles is larger?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.840
Your eyes are likely telling you the one
on the right, and the fish would think so

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.489
too. But it turns out that they're the
same size. In the study on red tail split

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.820
fins the fish were trained to
discriminate between discs of different

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.780
sizes and to prefer larger discs and
then when presented with a similar

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.869
illusion that they chose the deceptively
larger one.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.650
What about attention span? One particular
report found that the human attention

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.530
span is down from 12 seconds in the year
2000 to 8 seconds today. Our use of the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.580
internet and devices is theorized to
play a role, but either way

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
goldfish have a nine-second attention
span, trumping that of a human. When it

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.970
comes to forgetfulness, a study using
African cichlids gave fish food reward in

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.990
a particular zone of an aquarium for
three days in a row. Then the fish were

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.520
given a 12-day rest period before being
reintroduced into the aquarium.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.540
Using motion tracking software, the cichlids
showed a distinct preference to the area

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.810
of the aquarium where they had
previously received a reward.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.380
Studies have even shown goldfish can
remember things for at least three

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.189
months,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.659
distinguishing between shapes, colors,
sounds,

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.520
and even navigating mazes. On top of this,
goldfish can recognize their owners.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.609
Ultimately, fish have been shown to have
quite good memories.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.270
After all, they need to remember prey
types, avoid predators and even avoid our

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.719
hooks after being caught in the past.
When it comes to pain, we're actually

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.509
quite different than fish. When you injure
yourself

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.360
receptors in your body called
nociceptors send signals to the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.549
neocortex where the sensation of pain is
processed. But many fish lack nociceptors

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.830
and all fish lack a neocortex, so pain
isn't experienced in the same way.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.549
When "Finding Nemo" was first released, hundreds
of fish were flushed to set them free,

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.140
when in reality these fish often die
from trauma or exposure to fresh water.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.489
Additionally, researchers worried that
"Finding Dory"'s release could increase

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.540
the decline in ornamental fish
populations, as more people will want the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.340
royal blue tang as a pet.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.629
So we decided to make a video on eight
other amazing aquatic animals on

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.019
ASAPThought where we visited an aquarium to
check them out in person.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.769
Our lakes and oceans are full of some
wild and beautiful creatures so be sure
