00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.560
The last couple of exercises, we've been looking at one

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.860
particular region of the ABO gene and the various alleles

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.540
that we can find there in the human population. But

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.820
here's a different region of the gene. So we're much earlier

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.670
in the genetic code here. We're still in the coding

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.749
region. But here we're looking from position 250 to position

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.345
270. And what I've done is I've underlined the genetic

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:25.153
code where in-frame here reading our codons in the DNA sequence.

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:29.054
And you see we've got one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:31.969
six, seven codons to read from. So now I want

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.506
us to do the same thing that we did in

00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:37.294
one of the previous exercises. Imagine you're a ribosome, and you're

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:40.740
not reading the DNA. Remember, you've got to be transcribed

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.134
from DNA to RNA, and then RNA is translated by

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:46.908
ribosomes into protein. But these are the representative coding region

00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:50.266
sequences. These are the DNA sequences that will eventually become the

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.939
codons, which are underlined here. And let's say that

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.045
we have two variations. And these times the variations

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:00.628
aren't a change in the letter, it's actually a

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:03.610
deletion of a letter or multiple letters. In this first

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.520
variant, we actually move along and then we delete

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.140
three letters in a row. In the second variation,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.290
we actually delete only one letter. Tell me, which

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.950
one do you think will have a more significant effect?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.990
The deletion of three letters or the deletion of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.580
only one? Select one of these answers. And when you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.290
do, I want you to think about why that

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.480
is and enter it into this text box here. Really

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.720
think about this one. Don't just answer it. Don't

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.700
just pick one. I want you to think about it.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.710
Have a reason reason for it. Then select an

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.900
answer and tell me why in this text box here.
