You know what,

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:03.703
it has been a tough week.

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.773
There's a lot of anger
and shouting recently,

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.942
some of it within the-the last
30 seconds, to be honest.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:12.945
So I felt that this would be
a great time for a segment

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:15.148
that highlights
some feel-good stories

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.683
about the real people out
in real America.

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.952
It's a brilliant idea
that I just had

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:22.955
and small-town stations have
been stealing from me for years.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.358
It's time to take a look at some
of the week's best videos

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.427
in our segment called
Hey, Watch This.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.295
We get to meet some more
of Eric's Heroes.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.464
REPORTER: It's time for
Cool People Doing Cool Things.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:32.999

For goodness' sake,
I'm Jordan Klepper.

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:41.074
And unlike local news,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:44.410
I<i> can</i> afford lamp shades.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.346
You know what,
let's take the focus off of me

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.283
and put it on the everyman
doing good

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.684
in my long-running,

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:54.187
first-time segment,

That night, I decided

to mow free lawns

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.292
Wow, inspiring story,

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:35.561
mowing lawns for the needy
in all 50 states.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:37.063
Your neighbors must love you.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.599
Heck, the whole country
is gonna be your neighbor soon.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.868
Everyone's friend,
that's you, Rodney.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.303
Everybody loves Rodney.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:47.874
Rodney, must feel pretty good
about yourself.

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:51.711
Pretty... good.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.913
Hey, Rodney...

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.948
You think you're better than me?

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.950
Is that what you think, Rodney?

00:01:57.983 --> 00:01:59.852
I can mow lawns
in all 50 states.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.621
I'm handy, I'm good with tools.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.055
I built a birdhouse
in fifth grade,

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:05.491
a good one,
the bird is still in it.

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:07.360
I can buy a lawn mower.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.195
I can definitely buy one,
and find one,

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:10.796
and identify one
in a hardware store,

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.632
then I can buy it
in a heartbeat.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.700
How much could it be?
I don't know.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:17.937
$30,000, probably, could be.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.339
Plus, I can go to any state
I want,

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:23.042
as long as it's not both Dakotas
or one of the Virginias.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:24.377
They know what they did.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.611
Screw you, Rodney.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.580
You're not better than me.

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:31.217
This next story is sure
to make you smile.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.252
And maybe also a bit hungry.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:34.921
A fast food worker in
Chesterfield County

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:38.925
is receiving a lot of praise
after this video went viral.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.661
You can see him--
Run, Forrest, run--

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:44.230
chasing down a customer who
forgot part of her order.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:45.898
The dedicated worker
successfully got

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:47.900
the customer's second bag
of food to her

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:51.504
before jogging back and looking
just a little bit tired.

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:53.005
Oh, well,
you can't argue with that.

00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:54.707
That's just a nice thing to do.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.143
Glad a nice guy like that
in the middle of the country

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.078
is getting that kind
of attention.

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:00.980
He's probably feeling pretty
good about--

00:03:01.013 --> 00:03:03.115
You think you're better than me?

00:03:03.148 --> 00:03:05.585
That's not a run,
that's a shuffle at best.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.186
I've sprinted out
of Chick-fil-As

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.689
twice as fast as that,
carrying way more bags

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.924
of morally-dubious
fried chicken.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.626
And how dare you abandon
your post?

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.195
It's chaos back at that
Chick-fil-A with you gone.

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.364
They're serving burritos
and grilling pad Thai,

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:20.366
and not weighing in on what
constitutes love anymore.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:21.734
You're a monster.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.203
How on Earth can you think
you're better than me?

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:26.272
Up next...

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.374
Have you got a heart ticking in
your chest?

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:30.743
Careful, this story
is sure to melt it.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.712
Superdaddy saved the big show.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:33.946
Take a look.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.381
Little Bella, hysterical,

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:38.117
crying on stage during her
annual ballet recital.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.986
Dad appears from the wings
to try to calm her down.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.454
MALE TV REPORTER:
Ah, with the baby.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.022
FEMALE TV REPORTER:
While holding a baby,

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.657
-Yeah.
-he joined the ballet line.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.559
Look at the plié.

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.728
He's like,
"I got this. I'm Superdad."

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.696
(bleep) you, Superdad!

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.331
You think you're better than me?

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:54.267
You think you're such
a great dad

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.236
because your amazing moment
of superdad-ness went viral

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.605
and your kids will love you
forever and ever?

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.374
You think I can't go viral?

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.209
You think I can't dance
with a baby?

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.745
Someone give me a baby.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:09.081
Yes. There we go.

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:11.584
(cheering and applause)

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.452
And give me some music.

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:16.088
Some real Super Ballet-Dad shit.

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:18.691
-(sweet music plays)
-Ah, yeah. See?

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:20.593
You are not better than me.

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.662
Shove this up
your Facebook feed.

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:25.131
You know what? Puppy me.
(bleep) it.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.400
Yeah. Oh.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.402
(cheering and applause)

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.704
Did you have a dog? Yeah?

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:34.073
Who's your Superdad now, bitch?

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:36.809
As a matter of fact,
bring on the summer interns.

00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:40.146
Ah, yeah. See, this is easy.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.682
I could do this all day.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:45.418
Dance with me, kids,
dance with me.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.986
Dance with me.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.754
My kids love me, too.

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:50.056
No one's better than me.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.257
I'm the Superdad.
