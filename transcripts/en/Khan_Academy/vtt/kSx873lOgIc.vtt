00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.960
We'd express this really small
number in scientific notation.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.120
Let's just see how
small it is.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.820
It is one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.350
seven, eight, nine zeroes.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.230
And then a 3457.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.610
All of that is behind
the decimal point.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.980
Now this is a bit of review
about scientific notation.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.200
It means expressing a number
in a form-- let me give an

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.390
example, it could be 5 times
10 to the fifth power.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.370
This would be an example
of writing something in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.670
scientific notation.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.790
And when you write something
in scientific notation, the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.460
number that you're multiplying
by a power of ten, that number

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.310
right there has to be greater
than or equal to 1, and it

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.850
should be less than 10.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.740
And of course, this right here
is going to be a power of 10.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.570
So for example, if I were to
write 5 times 9 to the fifth,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.700
not scientific notation.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.030
If I were to write 50 times
10 to the fifth, not quite

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.239
scientific notation.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.060
Sometimes this kind of gets by
for scientific notation while

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.250
you're doing computation.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.440
But if you really wanted to
write this in scientific

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.600
notation, you would write this
as 5 times 10, which is 50

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.470
times 10 to the fifth.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.700
And 10 times 10 to the fifth
is 10 to the sixth.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.860
So you'd write this as 5
times 10 to the sixth.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.250
So your goal is always for this
number right here to be

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.700
greater than or equal
to 1, less than 10.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.810
Likewise, if I wrote 0.9 times
10 squared, once again, not in

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.080
scientific notation.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.150
You would want to write 0.9 as
9 times 10 to the negative 1

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.120
times 10 squared.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.120
And then this becomes
9 times 10.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.740
Which makes sense, because
0.9 times 100 is 90.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.000
9 times 10 is 100.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.050
We could say 9 times 10
to the first power.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.220
So that was a bit of review.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.540
Let's do it for this
problem right here.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.650
I guess a quick way to think
about converting this to

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.550
scientific notation, think about
how many leading zeroes

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.530
there are including the first
non zero number right there.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.610
So there are 10 digits to the
right if you include this 3.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.740
You have nine zeroes and
then you have this 3.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.250
So a very quick way to do it,
and I'll explain in a second

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.710
why it works, is we could
rewrite this right here as

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:34.700
3.457 times 10 to the, we had
nine zeroes, and then I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.320
count the 3, 10.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.540
So times 10 to the negative
10 power.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.830
And the reason why this makes
sense is, when you multiply

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.350
something to a negative
power, you shift the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.780
decimal over to the left.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.690
Let me write it this way.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.500
Start with 3.457.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.460
And when you multiply it times
10 to the negative 10, you're

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.950
going to shift the decimal
to the left 10 spaces.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.610
So if you shift the decimal
to the left 10

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.330
spaces, what do you get?

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.170
So if you shift it once, twice,
three, four, five, six,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.730
seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.240
And of course, you can't just
leave open space here.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.870
There's going to be zeroes
there when you shift it.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.000
So you're going to have one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.720
seven, eight, nine zeroes.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.990
And you can put a zero out here
just to make sure that

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.610
you understand that there is a
zero in front of that decimal.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.830
And you get exactly what
we got up there.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.940
Another way to think about it
is, if you wanted to start

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.320
with this really small number
and you wanted to get to

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.210
3.457, you could multiply
it by 10 to the tenth.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.310
That would shift this decimal
10 spaces to the right.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.560
So you could do this.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.640
And these are all the multiple
ways of looking at the exact

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.160
same thing.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.770
You could write that 3.457 is
equal to this character.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.520
Or I could even copy and
paste this character.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.330
Times 10 to the tenth power.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.370
If you multiply by a positive
exponent, every time you

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.400
multiply by 10 it shifts the
decimal to the right.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.200
It makes the number bigger.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.000
So if you multiply this by 10
to the tenth, this guy is

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.090
going to move one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.850
eight, nine, ten.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.700
It would shift it right there.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.550
And you'd get 3.457.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.380
So that's the whole idea.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.270
3.457 is this number times
10 to the tenth.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.250
So if you wanted to solve for
this number, you would

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.100
multiply both sides of this
equation by 10 to

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.550
the negative 10.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.530
So times 10 to the negative 10,
or that's the equivalent

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.360
of dividing by 10
to the tenth.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.810
These cancel out.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.850
Negative tenth is 10 to
the zero or just 1.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.580
And you get this thing over
here being equal to 3.457

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.300
times 10 to the negative 10.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.390
I just wrote it in a different
order over here.
