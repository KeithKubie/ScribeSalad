00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.010
-- sometimes called the van der
Waal's interactions.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.003
And we saw that we could make a
molecule between two inert gas

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:30.915
atoms, like argon two or 
xenon two,

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:35.042
by virtue of these dispersion
interactions,

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:41.133
where the instantaneous charge
in one atom or molecule produces

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:45.954
a dipole.
That dipole then induces a

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:52.090
dipole in the neighboring
molecule, and the result is a

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.272
stabilization,
an attraction.

00:00:55.272 --> 00:01:01.068
And we saw, last time,
we had a generic form for the

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:08.000
interaction potential for the
dispersion interactions.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.658
This Lennard-Jones interaction
potential.

00:01:11.658 --> 00:01:17.054
We talked about that in detail.
And one of the parameters in

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:21.993
that Lennard-Jones potential was
this quantity epsilon,

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:25.012
which actually was the well
depth.

00:01:25.012 --> 00:01:29.128
And I just wanted to talk a few
moments, here,

00:01:29.128 --> 00:01:33.152
about what determines what the
well depth is,

00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:38.000
what the strength of that
interaction is.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.303
And the bottom line is,
what determines that is the

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:48.818
polarizability of the atoms or
the molecules that are

00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:53.378
interacting.
And we give the symbol alpha to

00:01:53.378 --> 00:01:57.196
the polarizability.
And what that is,

00:01:57.196 --> 00:02:03.560
is a measure of the ease with
which a charge distribution can

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.142
be distorted.
That is the polarizability of

00:02:09.142 --> 00:02:13.911
the molecule.
That is a term you will hear in

00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:18.571
future courses quite a lot.
And, in general,

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:25.399
the polarizability goes up with
the number of electrons present.

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:31.715
As you go from --
And you can see on the side

00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:37.633
slides, here.
As you go from helium to argon

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:43.000
to xenon, and let me fix my
pointer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.108
As we go from helium to argon
to xenon, this polarizability

00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:57.791
goes up because the number of
electrons are going up.

00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:01.900
If the number of electrons are
going up, that means we have

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.866
electrons in outer shells,
they are farther away from the

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:09.660
nucleus.
They are more easily distorted.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.380
As this polarizability goes up,
helium, argon and xenon,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.100
that well depth for the
Lennard-Jones potential is going

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.477
up, 0.085, 0.996 and 1.8.
And here, on this diagram,

00:03:23.477 --> 00:03:28.111
I actually show you what the
shape of the Lennard-Jones

00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:32.730
potential is.
Sometimes when I draw it on the

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.046
board, it is not so accurate.
But you can see this

00:03:37.046 --> 00:03:42.067
Lennard-Jones potentially
actually has this repulsive wall

00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:44.886
that goes up really very
steeply.

00:03:44.886 --> 00:03:47.704
And, likewise,
on the next slide,

00:03:47.704 --> 00:03:52.637
you see some interactions for
at least one molecule here,

00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:55.015
helium, nitrogen,
and argon.

00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:59.155
You can also have these
dispersion interactions,

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:04.000
and you do have them,
between molecules.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.784
So, the polarizability is going
up.

00:04:06.784 --> 00:04:10.634
Helium, nitrogen,
argon, the well depth is going

00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:12.518
up.
Again, these are the

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:17.187
Lennard-Jones potentials for
those inert gases and for the

00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:20.382
interactions between two
nitrogen atoms,

00:04:20.382 --> 00:04:24.559
dispersion interaction.
All atoms and molecules have

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:30.918
these dispersion interactions.
It is just that often times the

00:04:30.918 --> 00:04:36.568
dispersion interactions can be
so weak compared to some other

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:40.522
interactions,
which we are going to look at

00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:44.477
today, that we don't even think
about them.

00:04:44.477 --> 00:04:50.032
But they are actually there.
But what I want to do now is to

00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:55.211
talk about what happens as we
lower the temperature even

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.280
further.
In other words,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.658
last time we were talking about
the deviation from the inert gas

00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:06.475
law as we lowered the
temperature.

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:11.512
And what we said is that it is
these dispersion interactions

00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:16.890
that are the microscopic origin
for the deviation from the inert

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.329
gas law, which is a macroscopic
law, as you lower the

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:24.743
temperature.
But we also know that if you

00:05:24.743 --> 00:05:29.182
lower the temperature enough,
that the gas condenses,

00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:34.536
the gas liquefies.
And it is these dispersion

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:40.195
interactions that are also
responsible for the condensation

00:05:40.195 --> 00:05:44.195
of these gases.
But now, let's talk about,

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:49.560
a little bit more deeply,
what exactly is going on as we

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.829
lower the temperature close to
the liquification point.

00:05:54.829 --> 00:06:00.000
Let me draw a Lennard-Jones
potential again.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.872
And now I am going to do it for
two nitrogen molecules.

00:06:04.872 --> 00:06:07.939
Here is nitrogen,
here is nitrogen,

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.729
two separated nitrogens as a
function of r,

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.887
the distance between the two
nuclei.

00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:17.684
This is our zero of
interaction.

00:06:17.684 --> 00:06:23.007
And, as I said from that slide,
this bond association energy

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:28.240
measured from the bottom of the
well is 0.79 kilojoules per

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.383
mole, the bottom of the well,
where the molecules actually

00:06:33.383 --> 00:06:38.628
can never be.
But that is the well depth.

00:06:38.628 --> 00:06:43.495
Now, let's think about this.
At 300 degrees Kelvin,

00:06:43.495 --> 00:06:47.681
what is the average energy of
the molecules?

00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:52.938
Well, the average energy is
three-halves RT,

00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:56.637
as we saw.
And, if I substitute in this

00:06:56.637 --> 00:07:02.380
temperature, I am going to get
something on the order of 3.7

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.955
kilojoules per mole,
if this has two significant

00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:11.230
figures.
3.7 kilojoules per mole.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.807
Well, let me do the following.
Let me draw 3.7 kilojoules per

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:20.804
mole, here, on this
Lennard-Jones potential.

00:07:20.804 --> 00:07:25.080
When I do that,
and I am going to start here at

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.913
the bottom of the well,
and I draw 3.7 kilojoules per

00:07:29.913 --> 00:07:35.211
mole, well, that is somewhere
way up here, compared to the

00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:40.434
interaction energy.
At 300 degrees Kelvin,

00:07:40.434 --> 00:07:46.632
the bottom line is that those
two nitrogen molecules have

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:53.604
enough kinetic energy to totally
ignore this interaction energy.

00:07:53.604 --> 00:07:59.359
They are way up here.
If they have 3.7 kilojoules per

00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:04.007
mole of energy,
they are not going to stick

00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:08.861
together.
They are not going to condense.

00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:14.584
They are actually really going
to ignore this small interaction

00:08:14.584 --> 00:08:17.630
energy.
They are just going to fly

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.292
apart.
And they do.

00:08:19.292 --> 00:08:22.892
You have a gas.
However, let's lower the

00:08:22.892 --> 00:08:27.230
temperature now.
Say we lower the temperature to

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:33.449
100 degrees Kelvin.
When we do that and calculate

00:08:33.449 --> 00:08:38.208
the average energy at 100
degrees Kelvin,

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:45.345
that is on the order of 1.2 or
so kilojoules per mole average

00:08:45.345 --> 00:08:49.033
energy.
1.2 kilojoules per mole,

00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:55.219
we are somewhere here.
And now, the relative energies

00:08:55.219 --> 00:09:02.000
between these nitrogen molecules
are much lower.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.176
And it is beginning to be
comparable to this well depth.

00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:12.823
And those nitrogen molecules
now are deviating from the inert

00:09:12.823 --> 00:09:16.494
gas law.
They are kind of hanging around

00:09:16.494 --> 00:09:20.070
each other.
They don't hit the walls as

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.494
often, the walls of the vessel
that they are in,

00:09:24.494 --> 00:09:29.482
because they are having an
attractive interaction with

00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:34.000
their neighboring nitrogen
molecule.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.161
And so, we are deviating,
here, from the inert gas law.

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:45.088
The pressure is not as large if
you are doing it under constant

00:09:45.088 --> 00:09:49.294
volume conditions.
And then, say we lower the

00:09:49.294 --> 00:09:54.455
temperature to 77 degrees
Kelvin, which is actually the

00:09:54.455 --> 00:10:00.000
boiling point of nitrogen to
make liquid nitrogen.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.174
Well, at 77 degrees Kelvin,
the kinetic energy is 0.96

00:10:06.174 --> 00:10:11.067
kilojoules per mole.
And now, in this case,

00:10:11.067 --> 00:10:17.359
we are fairly comparable to the
well depth here at 0.96

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:22.368
kilojoules per mole.
What happens is the gas

00:10:22.368 --> 00:10:27.029
condenses.
The interaction energy between

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:33.786
those two nitrogen molecules is
on the order of the kinetic

00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:39.037
energy.
And then these molecules stick

00:10:39.037 --> 00:10:44.101
together, the gas condenses,
and you have a liquid.

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:48.556
That is the origin,
here, of this temperature

00:10:48.556 --> 00:10:54.531
dependence and the relevance to
the microscopic interactions

00:10:54.531 --> 00:11:00.000
between the molecules.
You can understand that.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.576
And then vice versa,
if you start to raise the

00:11:04.576 --> 00:11:09.152
temperature, the molecules start
to fly apart.

00:11:09.152 --> 00:11:14.949
They ignore this interaction.
Their energy is greater than

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:20.847
that attractive interaction.
And so what you can see in the

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:27.050
macroscopic boiling points is
the vestiges of this microscopic

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:32.367
interaction energy.
I think I am going to put the

00:11:32.367 --> 00:11:34.000
center screen down.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:52.000
If you look at --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.137
-- helium, neon,
argon, krypton,

00:12:03.137 --> 00:12:06.680
and xenon.
What we said is that this

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.943
polarizability increases as we
increase the number of

00:12:11.943 --> 00:12:15.587
electrons.
We see that the well depth

00:12:15.587 --> 00:12:19.433
increases.
Therefore, the boiling point

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:25.000
increases as we go down the
inert gas column.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.621
You can see how that
macroscopic boiling point is a

00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:35.445
reflection of what is happening
on the microscopic scale between

00:12:35.445 --> 00:12:40.436
two individual molecules.
You can also see that in this

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:44.596
plot or in this chart.
Here we have molecules,

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:47.369
hydrogen, nitrogen,
and oxygen.

00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:52.638
The polarizability alpha is
also increasing as we go down.

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:58.000
Correspondingly,
the well depth is increasing.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.127
Correspondingly,
that boiling point is also

00:13:02.127 --> 00:13:07.236
getting larger and larger.
That macroscopic quantity,

00:13:07.236 --> 00:13:12.543
then, reflects the change in
the individual interaction

00:13:12.543 --> 00:13:18.046
energies between the molecules,
the microscopic quantity.

00:13:18.046 --> 00:13:23.549
But it also turns out that the
shape of the molecules are

00:13:23.549 --> 00:13:25.710
important.
For example,

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:32.000
let's take this molecule,
C five H twelve.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.563
There are several ways I can
draw a skeletal structure for C

00:13:36.563 --> 00:13:40.740
five H twelve.
One way is to make it pentane,

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.071
making a linear molecule.
And another way is to make this

00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:48.784
two, two dimethylpropane,

00:13:48.784 --> 00:13:52.729
carbon in the center,
some methyl groups around that

00:13:52.729 --> 00:13:56.055
center carbon.
It turns out that the boiling

00:13:56.055 --> 00:14:00.000
point of pentane is 309 degrees
Kelvin.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.891
The boiling point of
2,2-dimethylpropane is 283

00:14:03.891 --> 00:14:07.528
degrees Kelvin.
These are two molecules that

00:14:07.528 --> 00:14:12.096
have the same number of atoms,
i.e., the same number of

00:14:12.096 --> 00:14:15.987
electrons, should have the same
polarizability.

00:14:15.987 --> 00:14:20.555
However, one has a higher
boiling point than the other.

00:14:20.555 --> 00:14:25.377
And the reason for this is
because of the different shapes

00:14:25.377 --> 00:14:29.844
of these molecules.
In the case of propane,

00:14:29.844 --> 00:14:34.015
if we have an instantaneous
fluctuation in our charge

00:14:34.015 --> 00:14:37.383
distribution,
it is going to be essentially

00:14:37.383 --> 00:14:40.832
along a line.
That instantaneous fluctuation

00:14:40.832 --> 00:14:45.724
is essentially kind of rod-like
because of the skeletal nature

00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:48.771
of the pentane.
So, one end is a little

00:14:48.771 --> 00:14:53.583
positive, one end is a little
negative, the other way around.

00:14:53.583 --> 00:14:58.075
That is going to induce a
dipole in a neighboring pentane

00:14:58.075 --> 00:15:02.221
molecule.
And then they are going to

00:15:02.221 --> 00:15:06.835
align, positive-negative here,
positive-negative there.

00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:10.253
But then, in the case of
dimethylpropane,

00:15:10.253 --> 00:15:14.525
you are also going to have this
charge fluctuation.

00:15:14.525 --> 00:15:18.541
But in the case of propane,
here, this is a more

00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:23.411
spherical-looking molecule.
And so, the charge fluctuation

00:15:23.411 --> 00:15:28.398
is not going to be so rod-like.
But, nevertheless,

00:15:28.398 --> 00:15:31.816
this charge fluctuation,
induced dipole here,

00:15:31.816 --> 00:15:35.623
is going to induce another
dipole in a neighboring

00:15:35.623 --> 00:15:40.362
molecule, and you are going to
have an attractive interaction.

00:15:40.362 --> 00:15:43.703
But, in the case of the
2,2-dimethylpropane,

00:15:43.703 --> 00:15:47.743
this is a much more spherical
distribution than this.

00:15:47.743 --> 00:15:50.928
In this case,
these two dipoles are not as

00:15:50.928 --> 00:15:54.735
close together as they are in
the case of pentane,

00:15:54.735 --> 00:15:57.920
meaning that the interaction
energy, here,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.426
between the dimethylpropane,
is going to be less than it is

00:16:02.426 --> 00:16:08.471
in the case of the pentane.
And, again, that is reflected

00:16:08.471 --> 00:16:11.284
in the macroscopic boiling
points.

00:16:11.284 --> 00:16:15.545
The boiling point of pentane is
larger than that of

00:16:15.545 --> 00:16:20.488
dimethylpropane because that
microscopic interaction energy

00:16:20.488 --> 00:16:25.261
is larger for propane because
the induced dipoles can get

00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:29.267
closer together.
So, the shape is also important

00:16:29.267 --> 00:16:33.784
in determining these boiling
points, these energies of

00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:38.752
interactions.
That is going to take care of

00:16:38.752 --> 00:16:44.637
our discussion of molecules or
discussion of the induced dipole

00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:49.857
- induced dipole interaction
energy where we are talking

00:16:49.857 --> 00:16:55.267
about molecules that do not have
permanent dipole moments.

00:16:55.267 --> 00:17:01.152
But now we are going to turn to
molecules with permanent dipole

00:17:01.152 --> 00:17:05.415
moments, such as HCl.
And, of course,

00:17:05.415 --> 00:17:09.943
in these molecules,
the dispersion interaction is

00:17:09.943 --> 00:17:14.377
also taking place.
It is just that that is going

00:17:14.377 --> 00:17:19.000
to be weak compared to the
interaction between two

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.528
permanent dipoles.
Here we have one HCl molecule,

00:17:23.528 --> 00:17:27.018
permanent dipole.
It is going to then,

00:17:27.018 --> 00:17:31.924
in a collection of HCl
molecules, attract another HCl

00:17:31.924 --> 00:17:36.366
molecule.
And that HCl molecule is going

00:17:36.366 --> 00:17:39.047
to align in the opposite
direction.

00:17:39.047 --> 00:17:43.385
The alignment of those two
dipoles is going to lower the

00:17:43.385 --> 00:17:45.673
energy.
That is the attractive

00:17:45.673 --> 00:17:48.433
interaction.
And then you might say,

00:17:48.433 --> 00:17:52.614
you get this attractive
interaction, but you also have

00:17:52.614 --> 00:17:57.267
now this repulsive interaction
between the two chlorines and

00:17:57.267 --> 00:18:02.000
the two hydrogens.
Doesn't this all cancel out?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.679
And the answer is no.
And that is because of this.

00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:11.932
The positive end of one
molecule and the negative end of

00:18:11.932 --> 00:18:17.376
the other, this distance and
this distance on the opposite

00:18:17.376 --> 00:18:22.056
end are actually closer than the
positive charges.

00:18:22.056 --> 00:18:26.353
The yellow distance,
here, is smaller than the

00:18:26.353 --> 00:18:31.511
distance between the two
hydrogens, is smaller than the

00:18:31.511 --> 00:18:36.000
distance between the two
chlorines.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.833
And so, it is this attractive
interaction that wins out,

00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:44.260
actually.
When you put those two dipoles

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.093
together, the repulsion actually
is there, but it is the

00:18:49.093 --> 00:18:54.366
attractive interaction that wins
out, and the whole system is

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:59.639
stabilized because the distance
between the unlike charges is

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:05.000
smaller than the distance
between the like charges.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.944
Now, it also turns out that we
have a functional form for the

00:19:11.944 --> 00:19:16.111
dipole-dipole attractive
interaction.

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:23.402
And that attractive interaction
turns out to be a minus one over

00:19:23.402 --> 00:19:30.000
r cubed dependence.
And this is exact.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.833
You can actually derive this.
You can show that this is the

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:39.333
interaction between two
permanent dipoles is one over r

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:42.833
cubed.
The quantity on the top,

00:19:42.833 --> 00:19:46.250
mu, that is not a reduced mass,
this time.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:50.583
If we go back to when we
started talking about dipole

00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:54.750
moments, this is the dipole
moment of the molecule.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:20:00.000
We have to use our symbols for
multiple quantities.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.166
So, that is the dipole moment.
We are talking about

00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:07.250
dipole-dipole attractive
interactions.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:11.166
And that attractive interaction
looks like this,

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:14.083
minus one over r cubed.

00:20:14.083 --> 00:20:18.166
Now, you might say,
where is the repulsive part of

00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:21.083
this interaction?
In the case of the

00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:25.250
Lennard-Jones potential,
remember we had two parts,

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:30.000
the attractive part and the
repulsive part.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.284
The repulsive part was one over
r to the 12.

00:20:34.284 --> 00:20:38.493
The attractive part was one
over r to the 6.

00:20:38.493 --> 00:20:42.395
But it turns out that for
dipole-dipole interaction,

00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:46.374
we do not have a general form
for the repulsive part,

00:20:46.374 --> 00:20:49.282
unlike induced dipole - induced
dipole.

00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:53.414
So, the best we can do,
in general, is to tell you that

00:20:53.414 --> 00:20:59.000
the dipole-dipole attractive
interaction is one over r cubed.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.391
But I want to compare this one
over r cubed to the attractive

00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:09.153
interaction due to the induced
dipole - induced dipole

00:21:09.153 --> 00:21:12.927
interaction.
You see that the dipole-dipole

00:21:12.927 --> 00:21:17.959
interaction is what we call
longer range than the induced

00:21:17.959 --> 00:21:22.901
dipole - induced dipole.
What I mean by that is that the

00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:26.855
value of r here,
the distance between the two

00:21:26.855 --> 00:21:32.138
dipoles, can be larger.
In the case of a longer range

00:21:32.138 --> 00:21:36.342
interaction, it can be larger
and still have some non-zero

00:21:36.342 --> 00:21:39.145
quantity for the interaction
potential.

00:21:39.145 --> 00:21:41.505
For example,
if you are out here,

00:21:41.505 --> 00:21:44.750
if this value of r,
you can just see with the

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.511
shorter range interaction,
one over r to the 6,

00:21:48.511 --> 00:21:52.125
that the attractive
interaction is only the

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:56.034
difference between the pink
curve and the black curve,

00:21:56.034 --> 00:21:59.132
which is zero.
Whereas, with a longer range

00:21:59.132 --> 00:22:04.000
interaction, we have more
attractive interaction.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.272
This is more negative.
That energy difference is

00:22:08.272 --> 00:22:11.181
larger.
That is what we mean by a

00:22:11.181 --> 00:22:15.909
longer range interaction.
And I want to just compare,

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:20.545
in this diagram here,
the strength of the dispersion

00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:25.000
interaction to that of the
permanent dipole-dipole

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.181
interaction by comparing the
interaction between two argon

00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:35.000
atoms to those between two HCl
molecules.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.783
Argon only has the dispersive
interaction between it because

00:22:39.783 --> 00:22:42.378
it does not have a dipole
moment.

00:22:42.378 --> 00:22:47.162
And you can see that this well
depth, here, is one kilojoule

00:22:47.162 --> 00:22:51.216
per mole, roughly speaking.
But in the case of HCl,

00:22:51.216 --> 00:22:54.864
that well depth,
here, is three kilojoules per

00:22:54.864 --> 00:22:59.000
mole because that has a
permanent dipole.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.180
And, in both cases,
HCl and argon-argon,

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:08.249
we are talking about roughly
the same number of electrons,

00:23:08.249 --> 00:23:10.383
not exactly,
but roughly,

00:23:10.383 --> 00:23:14.475
meaning the polarizability is
roughly the same.

00:23:14.475 --> 00:23:19.455
The dispersion interaction
energy is roughly the same for

00:23:19.455 --> 00:23:24.169
HCl as it is for argon,
but the difference is that HCl

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:27.015
has that permanent dipole
moment.

00:23:27.015 --> 00:23:30.839
Therefore, the deeper well
depth, therefore,

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:35.642
in HCl, the higher boiling
point, 239 degrees Kelvin as

00:23:35.642 --> 00:23:43.448
opposed to 87 Kelvin for argon.
What is on this slide is just

00:23:43.448 --> 00:23:49.870
an example of how that
dipole-dipole interaction energy

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:56.054
varies with the dipole moment.
The larger the dipole,

00:23:56.054 --> 00:24:02.000
of course, the larger the
interaction energy.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.603
Here, I show you several
molecules that all have,

00:24:05.603 --> 00:24:08.530
again, roughly the same number
of atoms.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.284
They have the same mass,
they roughly have the same

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:15.962
number of electrons,
so they roughly have the same

00:24:15.962 --> 00:24:19.190
polarizability.
The induced dipole - induced

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.568
dipole is the same,
but what is changing here,

00:24:22.568 --> 00:24:25.120
as I go down,
is the dipole moment.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.048
For propane,
dipole moment really small,

00:24:28.048 --> 00:24:32.371
0.1 debye.
Dimethyl ethe,r 1.3.

00:24:32.371 --> 00:24:34.387
Acetaldehyde,
2.7.

00:24:34.387 --> 00:24:36.403
Acetonitrile,
3.9.

00:24:36.403 --> 00:24:42.450
Dipole moment increases.
The boiling point increases

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:48.260
because that attractive
interaction is increasing.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:53.715
It scales roughly as the dipole
moment squared.

00:24:53.715 --> 00:25:00.000
The dipole-dipole interaction
is stronger.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.722
Now, I just want to briefly
then remind you about one other

00:25:04.722 --> 00:25:09.200
attractive interaction that we
have talked about before.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.004
And that is between two ions.
There we are talking about the

00:25:14.004 --> 00:25:18.563
Coulomb interaction energy,
where the dependence is minus

00:25:18.563 --> 00:25:22.471
one over r.
That is the longest range

00:25:22.471 --> 00:25:25.972
interaction.
Again, you can see this way out

00:25:25.972 --> 00:25:28.659
here.
If I choose this value of r,

00:25:28.659 --> 00:25:33.544
the one over six interaction
term would give me a

00:25:33.544 --> 00:25:37.371
very small value for the
attractive interaction,

00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:41.000
--
-- because it is one over r to

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.466
the six.
You take a large number for r

00:25:43.466 --> 00:25:47.066
and raise it to the 6 power and
put in the denominator.

00:25:47.066 --> 00:25:50.733
You are going to have a small
value for U of r.

00:25:50.733 --> 00:25:54.266
The one over r to the three
gives you some

00:25:54.266 --> 00:25:57.533
interaction energy,
but one over r gives you a lot

00:25:57.533 --> 00:26:02.057
of attractive interaction.
It is the longest range.

00:26:02.057 --> 00:26:05.314
And you can also see here,
in a moment,

00:26:05.314 --> 00:26:09.428
that it is going to be the
strongest interaction.

00:26:09.428 --> 00:26:13.971
What I am just doing is
comparing several molecules or

00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:17.057
atoms.
Here is argon 2 which has only

00:26:17.057 --> 00:26:20.828
the dispersive interaction.
Here is the plot,

00:26:20.828 --> 00:26:25.371
well depth minus one kilojoule.
Then, there is the HCl

00:26:25.371 --> 00:26:30.514
interaction energy that has the
dispersion interaction in it,

00:26:30.514 --> 00:26:36.000
but also the dipole-dipole
permanent interaction.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.943
It is minus three kilojoules.
And then we are talking about

00:26:40.943 --> 00:26:44.778
chlorine two.
This is a covalent bond.

00:26:44.778 --> 00:26:49.039
This is no longer a
Lennard-Jones potential energy,

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:53.215
but this well depth,
here, is minus 200 kilojoules

00:26:53.215 --> 00:26:55.517
per mole.
And then, finally,

00:26:55.517 --> 00:27:00.034
this ionic interaction between
potassium and chlorine,

00:27:00.034 --> 00:27:06.000
look at how strong that is,
minus 450 kilojoules per mole.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.880
So, these are the relative
strengths here of these

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:18.000
interaction energies.
That is all I that want to say

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.759
about these kinds of
intermolecular interactions,

00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:30.000
where we are dealing with some
kind of dipole.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.727
But before we move on,
I want to talk about one other

00:27:34.727 --> 00:27:39.000
kind of intermolecular
interaction potential.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And that is something called
hydrogen bonding.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
All right.
A final intermolecular

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.853
interaction, hydrogen bonding.
Hydrogen bonding,

00:28:26.853 --> 00:28:33.177
here, occurs between a hydrogen
atom that is attached to an

00:28:33.177 --> 00:28:39.828
electronegative atom and another
molecule in the gas or in the

00:28:39.828 --> 00:28:43.971
solution.
The first requirement is that

00:28:43.971 --> 00:28:50.186
you have hydrogen attached to a
very electronegative atom.

00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:56.292
Hydrogen bonding occurs for
hydrogens attached to oxygen,

00:28:56.292 --> 00:29:02.900
nitrogen, and chlorine.
Those are all electronegative

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.900
atoms.
Water is a good example.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:12.099
In the case of water-- You have
hydrogen bonded to this oxygen.

00:29:12.099 --> 00:29:16.299
This oxygen is really very
electronegative.

00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:22.099
What that oxygen does is it
pulls those electrons away from

00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:25.799
the hydrogen.
This hydrogen is kind of

00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:32.033
partially unshielded.
It is partially deshielded.

00:29:32.033 --> 00:29:38.325
And then, there is a lot of
electron density here on this

00:29:38.325 --> 00:29:42.483
oxygen.
Well, because that hydrogen is

00:29:42.483 --> 00:29:48.213
partially deshielded and because
it is really small,

00:29:48.213 --> 00:29:54.730
this hydrogen actually will
kind of see the oxygen atoms on

00:29:54.730 --> 00:30:01.350
a neighboring water molecule.
And since this is kind of

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:05.675
partially negative,
this hydrogen will interact

00:30:05.675 --> 00:30:10.940
with one of the lone pairs on
this oxygen and will form a

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.230
bond.
This is a little bit partially

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.837
positive, this is a little bit
partially negative,

00:30:18.837 --> 00:30:22.786
and the result,
here, is a bond between the

00:30:22.786 --> 00:30:27.769
hydrogen and the oxygen.
And that bond is on the order

00:30:27.769 --> 00:30:34.221
of 20 to 60 kilojoules per mole.
This bond is not a covalent

00:30:34.221 --> 00:30:36.443
bond.
A covalent bond is 400

00:30:36.443 --> 00:30:39.571
kilojoules per mole.
This is 10% of it,

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:43.685
but it is still a very
important quantity or a very

00:30:43.685 --> 00:30:47.224
important phenomenon,
this hydrogen bonding.

00:30:47.224 --> 00:30:51.503
The hydrogen bonding is
certainly responsible for the

00:30:51.503 --> 00:30:56.441
peculiar properties of water,
as you will learn more about in

00:30:56.441 --> 00:31:00.802
5.60, but it is also responsible
for the unique shape,

00:31:00.802 --> 00:31:05.000
oftentimes, of biological
molecules.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.612
The helix in DNA owes its
structure to hydrogen bonding.

00:31:10.612 --> 00:31:16.122
The hydrogen bonding is what
makes trees stand upright.

00:31:16.122 --> 00:31:21.836
The long cellulose molecules in
trees are actually bonded

00:31:21.836 --> 00:31:27.448
together by hydrogen bonding.
Nylon owes its strength to

00:31:27.448 --> 00:31:33.668
hydrogen bonding.
And hydrogen bonding is also

00:31:33.668 --> 00:31:40.742
responsible for whether or not
you have a bad hair day.

00:31:40.742 --> 00:31:47.685
As an example of that,
I want you to look at the slide

00:31:47.685 --> 00:31:53.842
up there on the walls.
What you see is a protein

00:31:53.842 --> 00:32:00.000
molecule.
This is the structure of hair.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.921
The molecules that make up the
strands of your hair look like

00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:07.993
this.
It is a polymer.

00:32:07.993 --> 00:32:12.927
Well, it is a polypeptide.
This unit right in here,

00:32:12.927 --> 00:32:17.467
carbon-oxygen bound to
carbon-hydrogen bound to

00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:20.625
nitrogen-hydrogen is the
peptide.

00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:24.769
It is repeated.
You see the next unit over?

00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:26.546
CO-CH-NH.
CO-CH-NH.

00:32:26.546 --> 00:32:32.278
That keeps repeating.
That is the repeat unit.

00:32:32.278 --> 00:32:36.172
And, of course,
this carbon-hydrogen right

00:32:36.172 --> 00:32:41.869
there, you can see it has a line
there, indicating that it is

00:32:41.869 --> 00:32:46.617
bonded to something.
And it is bonded to something.

00:32:46.617 --> 00:32:51.554
If that carbon-hydrogen is
bound to another hydrogen,

00:32:51.554 --> 00:32:56.682
then you have a polypeptide
which has been made from an

00:32:56.682 --> 00:33:02.000
amino acid that you might know
of as glycine.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.411
If that carbon is bound to a CH
three group,

00:33:07.411 --> 00:33:13.672
then that peptide was made from
an amino acid that you might

00:33:13.672 --> 00:33:18.871
know of as alanine.
And if it is bound to a CH two

00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:23.964
S H group,
well, that was an amino acid

00:33:23.964 --> 00:33:28.951
known as cysteine.
But what I want you to notice

00:33:28.951 --> 00:33:35.000
here is that these hydrogens on
the nitrogen --

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.874
That nitrogen is an electron
negative atom.

00:33:38.874 --> 00:33:42.380
And that hydrogen,
if your hair is wet,

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.992
it is actually hydrogen bonded
to a water molecule.

00:33:46.992 --> 00:33:51.974
Here is that hydrogen bond.
And then in the next strand

00:33:51.974 --> 00:33:57.509
over, this oxygen is hydrogen
bonded to a water molecule when

00:33:57.509 --> 00:34:02.901
your hair is wet.
And the bottom line is that

00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:08.274
when your hair is wet,
you have the strands of your

00:34:08.274 --> 00:34:12.143
hair that kind of slip by each
other.

00:34:12.143 --> 00:34:16.979
There is no registry of one
strand to another,

00:34:16.979 --> 00:34:21.492
because each strand has this
coating, here,

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:26.005
of water molecules due to
hydrogen bonding.

00:34:26.005 --> 00:34:32.023
Suppose you take your hair and
put it in a very contorted

00:34:32.023 --> 00:34:38.567
configuration like this.
And then you drive off the

00:34:38.567 --> 00:34:41.925
water molecules,
you dry your hair.

00:34:41.925 --> 00:34:47.160
What happens is that these
water molecules then leave,

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:53.185
the hydrogen bonds are broken.
This is not such a strong bond,

00:34:53.185 --> 00:34:58.419
20 to 60 kilojoules per mole,
those hydrogen bonds are

00:34:58.419 --> 00:35:02.569
broken.
And then this hydrogen on this

00:35:02.569 --> 00:35:07.707
nitrogen looks around and sees
the oxygen with its lone pairs

00:35:07.707 --> 00:35:11.646
on this strand,
and so you form a hydrogen bond

00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:14.643
between this strand and this
strand.

00:35:14.643 --> 00:35:19.781
And so now the strands of your
hair are in registry with each

00:35:19.781 --> 00:35:22.607
other.
They are actually stronger.

00:35:22.607 --> 00:35:27.574
And they do tell you not to
brush your hair when it is wet,

00:35:27.574 --> 00:35:33.348
because it isn't so strong.
Well, it is not so strong

00:35:33.348 --> 00:35:39.077
because these water molecules
are insulating each one of these

00:35:39.077 --> 00:35:42.458
strands.
And when it is dry these two

00:35:42.458 --> 00:35:48.187
strands are bond to each other.
They are in registry with each

00:35:48.187 --> 00:35:51.475
other.
And so, if you do this right,

00:35:51.475 --> 00:35:56.171
and you then let go of the
contorted configuration,

00:35:56.171 --> 00:36:01.055
which I am having trouble
doing, those strands are in

00:36:01.055 --> 00:36:08.222
registry with each other now.
And you have a good hair day.

00:36:08.222 --> 00:36:13.333
So, that is the importance of
hydrogen bonding.

00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:19.555
I curled my hair just for this
demo, a little asymmetric,

00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:22.222
here.
[LAUGHTER] But now,

00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:26.555
if you are as fortunate,
or unfortunate,

00:36:26.555 --> 00:36:33.000
depending on your preference,
to have naturally curly hair,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000
then what you have are a lot of
sulfur-sulfur bonds.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:49.957
You have a lot of cysteine
peptide groups.

00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:58.792
What happens there is this.
On the CH groups,

00:36:58.792 --> 00:37:02.376
you have CH two sulfur H.

00:37:02.376 --> 00:37:07.226
And on the next strand over you
have S, CH two,

00:37:07.226 --> 00:37:11.549
and CH bonded to nitrogen,
bonded to a CO.

00:37:11.549 --> 00:37:17.242
And you actually have a
covalent bond between these two

00:37:17.242 --> 00:37:21.038
sulfurs, here.
This is a strong bond.

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:27.680
The strands of your polymers in
your hair are in registry all of

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.148
the time.
And if you want to make your

00:37:32.148 --> 00:37:36.829
natural curly hair straight you
have to do drastic things like

00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:40.973
use drastic chemicals to break
this sulfur-sulfur bond.

00:37:40.973 --> 00:37:43.505
You can do it,
but it is not easy.

00:37:43.505 --> 00:37:48.110
Likewise, if you have naturally
straight hair and you want to

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.333
curl it and make it
semi-permanently curly,

00:37:51.333 --> 00:37:55.093
then you have to build in the
sulfur-sulfur bonds.

00:37:55.093 --> 00:37:58.546
And you have to do,
again, some rather drastic

00:37:58.546 --> 00:38:05.773
chemistry to make that happen.
Hydrogen bonding is important,

00:38:05.773 --> 00:38:12.188
especially if you go to do
anything in biologically-

00:38:12.188 --> 00:38:16.591
related sciences,
you will see that.

00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:22.000
Now, I am going to change
topics here.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.044
I am going to change topics,
and we are going to talk a

00:38:36.044 --> 00:38:42.537
little bit about thermodynamics
in preparation to get up to

00:38:42.537 --> 00:38:48.917
chemical equilibrium so that
Professor Cummins can come in

00:38:48.917 --> 00:38:55.634
next Wednesday and start talking
about acid-base equilibrium.

00:38:55.634 --> 00:39:00.000
He is great.
You will love him.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.149
We are going to review some
thermodynamics today.

00:39:04.149 --> 00:39:08.818
I am going to go kind of
quickly because some of this I

00:39:08.818 --> 00:39:12.103
think you know,
but I want to make sure

00:39:12.103 --> 00:39:15.821
everybody is on the same page.
First of all,

00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:19.538
bond energies.
We talked about bond energies

00:39:19.538 --> 00:39:23.342
as delta E sub D.
And we measured it from the

00:39:23.342 --> 00:39:27.579
bottom of the well.
And I told you a few days ago,

00:39:27.579 --> 00:39:32.048
I lied to you.
The measured energies are

00:39:32.048 --> 00:39:35.242
really from v equals zero,
and they are.

00:39:35.242 --> 00:39:39.093
But what I am going to do is
change my language.

00:39:39.093 --> 00:39:43.353
Instead of talking about
energies, I am going to talk

00:39:43.353 --> 00:39:47.203
about enthalpies.
I am going to talk about delta

00:39:47.203 --> 00:39:51.381
Hs rather than delta Es.
The reason I am going to do

00:39:51.381 --> 00:39:56.378
this is because it is easier for
us to measure a bond enthalpy

00:39:56.378 --> 00:40:00.997
than a bond energy.
And that has to do with the

00:40:00.997 --> 00:40:04.770
fact that we usually make
measurements in bulk under

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:09.061
constant pressure conditions.
And that is the quantity that

00:40:09.061 --> 00:40:12.020
comes out.
The relationship between delta

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:15.645
H and delta E is this.
Delta H is equal to delta E

00:40:15.645 --> 00:40:18.530
plus delta PV.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:22.525
This is a
relationship that you will learn

00:40:22.525 --> 00:40:25.780
about in a lot of detail in
5.60, in Chemical

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.313
Thermodynamics.
At this point,

00:40:29.313 --> 00:40:32.504
we are going to take it as a
given.

00:40:32.504 --> 00:40:38.228
For gases, delta H differs on
the order of 1% to 2% from delta

00:40:38.228 --> 00:40:39.824
E.
It is not much,

00:40:39.824 --> 00:40:44.046
but if you are doing some
precise calculation,

00:40:44.046 --> 00:40:48.926
you need to be aware of that.
For liquids and solids,

00:40:48.926 --> 00:40:54.181
delta H and delta E are really
the same for all intrinsic

00:40:54.181 --> 00:40:57.560
purposes.
The delta PV term is really

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.090
very small.
And, in thermodynamics,

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:06.909
since we are most always
looking at changes in energy,

00:41:06.909 --> 00:41:10.181
we need what we call standard
states.

00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:13.636
And we are going to put a
nought, here,

00:41:13.636 --> 00:41:18.545
on all of our delta Hs to
designate the standard state.

00:41:18.545 --> 00:41:22.363
And our standard state that
your book uses,

00:41:22.363 --> 00:41:26.272
and will use,
refers really to the pressure.

00:41:26.272 --> 00:41:33.100
And the pressure is one bar.
And one bar is equal to 10^5

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.309
Pascal.
That is equal to 10^5 kilograms

00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:43.179
per meter second squared.
The delta Hs we are going to

00:41:43.179 --> 00:41:47.941
talk about are also,
just about all of them,

00:41:47.941 --> 00:41:51.596
measured at 298.15 degrees
Kelvin.

00:41:51.596 --> 00:41:57.576
Delta H does depend on
temperature, but we actually are

00:41:57.576 --> 00:42:04.000
not going to look at that in the
next few days.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.234
You are going to do that in
5.60.

00:42:07.234 --> 00:42:12.693
Our delta Hs are going to be
delta Hs at 298.15 degrees

00:42:12.693 --> 00:42:15.826
Kelvin.
On the first slide here,

00:42:15.826 --> 00:42:20.880
I show you a bunch of bond
enthalpies for CH bonds.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.126
And, of course,
those bond enthalpies are a

00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:30.281
little bit different,
depending on what molecule you

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:33.725
have.
But they are not that

00:42:33.725 --> 00:42:36.764
different.
And so, what is often done,

00:42:36.764 --> 00:42:40.790
and your book does this,
is that somebody goes and

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:45.473
calculates the average of the
bond energies for lots of CH

00:42:45.473 --> 00:42:50.566
bonds and lots of molecules and
they prepare a table that looks

00:42:50.566 --> 00:42:53.934
like this.
This is the mean bond enthalpy.

00:42:53.934 --> 00:42:56.810
And they have CH,
CC, carbon-carbon.

00:42:56.810 --> 00:43:01.000
But these are average bond
enthalpies.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.571
Now, why are bond enthalpies
important to us?

00:43:04.571 --> 00:43:08.628
Well, they are important
because they determine the

00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:13.498
enthalpy of a chemical reaction.
If the bonds are stronger in

00:43:13.498 --> 00:43:18.043
the products than in the
reactants, that is going to give

00:43:18.043 --> 00:43:22.426
us an exothermic reaction.
If the bonds are stronger in

00:43:22.426 --> 00:43:27.295
the reactants than the products,
that gives us an endothermic

00:43:27.295 --> 00:43:31.019
reaction.
And so let's look at this

00:43:31.019 --> 00:43:34.168
reaction.
This is an important reaction.

00:43:34.168 --> 00:43:36.752
This is the oxidation of
glucose.

00:43:36.752 --> 00:43:40.387
This is a reaction very
exothermic, minus 2816

00:43:40.387 --> 00:43:44.425
kilojoules per mole.
It is a reaction that is being

00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:48.463
carried out in every cell of
your body as we speak.

00:43:48.463 --> 00:43:53.147
It is the reaction that is
providing the energy to maintain

00:43:53.147 --> 00:43:56.781
your body temperature,
the energy to move your

00:43:56.781 --> 00:44:03.000
muscles, the energy to repair
tissue, and the energy to think.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.563
Important reaction.
This is the reason why we eat.

00:44:06.563 --> 00:44:10.636
This is the reason why we
breathe, this is the reason why

00:44:10.636 --> 00:44:13.836
we exhale, and this is the
reason why we pee.

00:44:13.836 --> 00:44:15.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.166
What do we need to do to
calculate the enthalpy for this

00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:30.417
reaction?
We have to figure out how much

00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:35.251
energy is required to break all
of the bonds of the reactants

00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:38.554
because that is how much energy
we put in.

00:44:38.554 --> 00:44:43.549
And then we have to figure out
then how much energy we get back

00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:47.255
when we form the product bonds.
Bottom line is,

00:44:47.255 --> 00:44:51.123
the enthalpy necessary to break
all of the bonds,

00:44:51.123 --> 00:44:54.990
you can calculate,
is 12,452 kilojoules per mole.

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:59.582
That number comes from using
these average bond energies I

00:44:59.582 --> 00:45:04.272
told you about.
We can then get back some

00:45:04.272 --> 00:45:07.454
energy, minus 15,000,
approximately,

00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:12.545
when we form some new bonds.
That number comes from those

00:45:12.545 --> 00:45:17.272
average bond enthalpies.
The difference between these

00:45:17.272 --> 00:45:22.181
two energy levels is the
exothermicity of the reaction.

00:45:22.181 --> 00:45:25.727
Now, what did we do to get the
enthalpy?

00:45:25.727 --> 00:45:31.090
Well, what I did is took the
bond enthalpies of each bond of

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:36.478
the reactants and summed them.
Then, I took the bond

00:45:36.478 --> 00:45:40.140
enthalpies for each one of the
products, summed them,

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.225
and subtracted the two to get
the enthalpy of the reaction.

00:45:44.225 --> 00:45:47.464
I want you to notice something
here, important.

00:45:47.464 --> 00:45:49.718
This is reactants minus
products.

00:45:49.718 --> 00:45:52.676
In a moment,
I am going to show you another

00:45:52.676 --> 00:45:55.774
way to calculate the enthalpy
for a reaction.

00:45:55.774 --> 00:46:00.000
And it is going to be products
minus reactants.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.670
You have to know this.
But you also see that the

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.730
calculated enthalpy is not the
experimental enthalpy.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.463
Why?
Because we use the average bond

00:46:10.463 --> 00:46:13.586
enthalpies.
We did not use the exact bond

00:46:13.586 --> 00:46:18.350
enthalpies because if we had to
use the exact bond enthalpies,

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:23.269
can you imagine the size of the
table of data that we would have

00:46:23.269 --> 00:46:26.080
to have?
We would have to have a bond

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:31.000
enthalpy for every bond for
every known molecule.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.454
That is a lot.
What are we going to do,

00:46:34.454 --> 00:46:37.727
then?
Is there a more accurate way to

00:46:37.727 --> 00:46:41.181
do that?
Yes, with knowing the absolute

00:46:41.181 --> 00:46:45.000
bond enthalpies.
But that is too much data.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.909
Is there some other way to do
it?

00:46:47.909 --> 00:46:50.818
Yes.
We are going to use heats of

00:46:50.818 --> 00:46:53.545
formation.
A heat of formation,

00:46:53.545 --> 00:46:57.090
delta H nought with an F as a
subscript.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:02.908
The heat of formation is the

00:47:02.908 --> 00:47:08.620
enthalpy of a reaction that
forms one mole of a compound

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:14.436
from the pure elements in their
most stable form in their

00:47:14.436 --> 00:47:17.240
standard state.
For example,

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.394
here is water.
We are forming one mole of

00:47:21.394 --> 00:47:25.964
water from its elements,
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:47:25.964 --> 00:47:31.676
The enthalpy for this reaction
is defined as the heat of

00:47:31.676 --> 00:47:36.638
formation of water.
Why is this the heat of

00:47:36.638 --> 00:47:39.988
formation of water?
Well, because we are forming

00:47:39.988 --> 00:47:44.406
one mole, and that is important,
from the elements that make up

00:47:44.406 --> 00:47:46.472
water.
What elements are they?

00:47:46.472 --> 00:47:49.821
They are hydrogen.
But notice that this hydrogen

00:47:49.821 --> 00:47:52.672
is H two.
It is not hydrogen atoms

00:47:52.672 --> 00:47:56.662
because H two is the most
stable form of hydrogen.

00:47:56.662 --> 00:48:00.368
Oxygen is O two,
not oxygen atoms because this

00:48:00.368 --> 00:48:05.000
is the most stable form of
oxygen at bar pressure.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.985
Look at this here.
What is the heat of formation

00:48:08.985 --> 00:48:12.291
of oxygen?
Well, the enthalpy change for

00:48:12.291 --> 00:48:16.615
this reaction is zero.
That is the heat of formation

00:48:16.615 --> 00:48:17.802
of oxygen.
Why?

00:48:17.802 --> 00:48:22.975
Because we are forming one mole
of oxygen from the elements in

00:48:22.975 --> 00:48:27.044
their most stable form.
For elements like oxygen,

00:48:27.044 --> 00:48:30.266
hydrogen, nitrogen,
chlorine, two

00:48:30.266 --> 00:48:34.845
in the gas phase,
those all have heats of

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:39.000
formation that are equal to
zero.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.345
And then, finally,
here is the expression or the

00:48:42.345 --> 00:48:45.335
reaction that gives us one mole
of glucose.

00:48:45.335 --> 00:48:49.393
The enthalpy for this reaction
is the heat of formation of

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:51.955
glucose.
We get it from its elements,

00:48:51.955 --> 00:48:55.372
hydrogen, oxygen,
and look at the elemental form,

00:48:55.372 --> 00:49:00.000
the most stable form of the
element carbon is graphite.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.325
Is there an 18.0-something
exam?

00:49:02.325 --> 00:49:03.000
Yes?
Okay.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.200
See you on Monday.
