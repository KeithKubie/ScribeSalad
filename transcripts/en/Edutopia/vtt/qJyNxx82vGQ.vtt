00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.976
&gt;&gt;Boy: A Rube Goldberg machine
is complicated for a simple task.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:21.136
&gt;&gt;Girl: Boss Level is a week
where we work with our home base

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:23.766
to complete a project
by the end of the week.

00:00:24.186 --> 00:00:28.786
And we also don't have homework
or any other of our usual classes.

00:00:29.306 --> 00:00:31.436
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You walk into
a Boss Level classroom,

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:33.496
you're not seeing really a classroom.

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:36.266
All of the desks and
tables are pushed aside.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.346
You're seeing a lot of
materials of all different sorts

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.166
that are kind of strewn around.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.826
You see a lot of sixth
graders either tinkering

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:49.396
or in a group brainstorming,
possibly sketching.

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:54.976
It's a lot of creativity and
innovation going on in the space.

00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:00.976
&gt;&gt;Boy: We could do something
like this, if we had like a hold.

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:02.976
&gt;&gt;Boy: How about this one?

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:04.966
&gt;&gt;Girl: They're tiny.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.416
&gt;&gt;Boy: No, we already have a marble.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:07.976
Yeah, I fixed them here.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.676
&gt;&gt;Boy: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:12.916
To make it look cool.

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:14.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: My favorite part

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:19.926
about Boss Level is the
actual building phase.

00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:26.946
When kids fail during the creation of
Rube Goldberg and then they iterate,

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:31.066
they are really learning
to take risks.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:36.286
&gt;&gt;Girl: Failure is really bad, but
I guess if you have a good attitude,

00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:39.696
then you can always make
it what you wanted it to be

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:41.586
and not to get frustrated.

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:46.076
So failure's not so bad
if you know how to fix it.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:53.146
&gt;&gt;Boy: Failure reframed as iteration
means when you fail, just try again.

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:02.777
&gt;&gt;Kids: Yeeeahhh!!!

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:05.366
&gt;&gt;What?! What, what,

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:05.936
NO, Nooooo!

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:10.206
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Students really
take a lot of ownership

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.706
for the machines that they create.

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:17.716
Their advisor is in the room, but
their advisor really is not helping

00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:21.506
to do any of the building,
or even creating.

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:26.026
They're really just there as an adult
to help facilitate and to make sure

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:28.016
that things are going
smoothly and safely.

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:30.666
So if you walk into a
Boss Level classroom,

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:36.696
you really see the students as
teachers, as learners, as innovators,

00:02:36.696 --> 00:02:39.966
and they are really helping each
other through the iteration process.

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:44.106
They are creating this blueprint
for their machine in the beginning.

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:47.436
They're putting it to the test,
they're watching it, they're seeing

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:50.906
where the kinks are, where they
need to iterate and they are going

00:02:50.906 --> 00:02:52.696
through this process
really on their own.

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:55.846
I think that's also a really
great thing about the process,

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:59.916
to be able to watch students move
through this system on their own

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:00.976
and actually succeed at it.

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:03.956
&gt;&gt;Girl: Home base is...

00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:06.626
I think it might be a
little bit like a homeroom.

00:03:06.716 --> 00:03:09.356
&gt;&gt;Teacher: To be able to see
students really incorporate things

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.026
that they learn in
home base and model

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:14.876
that during the building
is really a great process.

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.656
One of my home base students,
who's in eighth grade now,

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:20.596
talks all the time about how he feels

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:24.466
that Rube Goldberg was what really
brought us together as a home base.

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.326
So it's a really great moment for us.

00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:29.206
&gt;&gt;Boy: Since you have to work
together and you spend a lot

00:03:29.206 --> 00:03:33.436
of time together in a classroom or in
a confined space, that you really get

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:35.806
to know one another and
how one another works.

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:39.386
&gt;&gt;Boy: If you're doing
a Rube Goldberg machine,

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:43.456
you need to have a lot of teamwork
so that one person isn't just working

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:49.226
on the front and like a million
people are working on the middle.

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:51.956
You need to have an even
share of everything.

00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:54.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Having gone through
the Rube Goldberg process

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:57.976
with my own home base,
it really proved

00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:00.616
to be beneficial for many reasons.

00:04:00.616 --> 00:04:03.356
I mean, not only are
they implementing skills

00:04:03.356 --> 00:04:06.686
that they've learned in the
classroom, but as a home base,

00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:09.886
you really see them
bond and really build.

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:13.476
You know, they're really kind of
stuck in a room for days at a time

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:16.836
and they have to really
learn how to get along,

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:20.316
how to share ideas,
how to respect ideas.

00:04:20.726 --> 00:04:24.656
Teamwork is probably
the most important facet

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:26.206
of Rube Goldberg building.

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:28.656
&gt;&gt;Girl: If one person makes
one part of the machine

00:04:28.876 --> 00:04:31.446
and another person makes
another part of the machine,

00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:36.056
if they don't work together, those
parts won't work together either

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:38.776
and it probably will
not complete its goal.
