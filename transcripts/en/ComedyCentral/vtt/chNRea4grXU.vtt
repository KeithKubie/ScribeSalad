00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.801
Oh, the college
is even worse now...

00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:03.069
because it's always...

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:04.404
We have a student here
who's really funny.

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.005
So he goes up there
and he's just murdering.

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.473
He goes, you know,
you ain't going to catch that.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:08.942
Everybody's got them's
my yellow sweatpants on.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.180
I said, "I'm drunk,
I'm not stupid.

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:15.348
I don't live in Turner Hall."

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:17.884
Turner hall.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.854
This guy is fucking murdering!

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.889
I go up there and be like,

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.724
"I'm waking up with back
pain a lot lately.

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.225
The fuck's this dude
talking about.

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:27.527
Back pain!

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.164
There's a professor.
Now that's my shit.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.070
I'm Dan Soder,
that's Big Jay Oakerson,

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.438
Bo Burnham joining us...

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:43.142
His movie Eighth Grade
out now on Blu ray DVD.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.444
On Demand.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.745
On Demand.
I'm not going to lie to you.

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:47.213
I haven't seen it,
but I'm very excited to see it.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.414
It's all good man.

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:50.316
Got a copy of it...
and eighth grade was possibly

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:51.717
one of the worst years
of my life

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.719
and I've heard that if you had
a tough eighth grade year,

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.288
-this is the movie to see.
-Yeah, whatever.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.522
Black Lou just watched it,
loved it,

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:57.857
(crosstalk)
said it legit took him back to-

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.092
Absolutely, loved it.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.326
I appreciate it man, thank you.
Thank you.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.028
...very kind.
We don't have to talk about it.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.296
I talk about it all the time,
you guys know.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.630
No I'm sure, but I have
questioned more

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:07.133
about working with
young people like that.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.836
Did you find that...
because we always talk...

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.706
me, Christine and Dan,
when we watch movies

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.241
and anytime there's a
young person acting...

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:16.476
especially like the law
and order's-

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.677
Yeah,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.878
Oh that's yeah,
like the victim gets...

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:20.413
Yeah it's fucked up.
But you're just like...

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.181
no I mean the kid themselves,
like I bet,

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:24.350
I hate this kid
as a real person.

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:25.852
I bet as soon
as they yell cut.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.587
She's like,
where's my diet Pepsi?

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.092
We, for the most part,
got like actual real kids

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:34.627
from the middle school
that we filmed at.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.796
From the...
there's a pool party scene

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.564
half of the kids swim
at that pool on weekends.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.099
So like they're monsters
in their own way-

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:41.367
Yeah.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.635
Which is that they are
actually normal

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.837
and don't give a fuck
about being in a movie.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.305
Since they film themselves
all the time.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.141
Did they make you
ever feel like...

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.510
the thing that would kill me
from like a 13 year old

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.744
if they were like,

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.513
this fucking guy
takes things too seriously.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:54.881
That would hurt me
where I'd be like,

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.115
"Shut up! No I don't!"

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:59.819
Grab a kid.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.157
We had to tour a bunch
of middle schools

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.992
and high schools to scout
the thing to get locations

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.226
where we go through
the middle schools

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.931
and it'd be like Dennis Rodman
in North Korea or something.

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.232
Yeah.
It felt like

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.767
people like coming up to me

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.269
and just like touching
my clothes and things.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.739
It was like going to
the land of the Ewoks.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.976
And then we stepped
into our first high school.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.512
We stepped into it and I heard,
"Hey Bo Burnham,

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:27.914
I'm funny too,
you little bitch."

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.515
-Oh dude, that is...
-...from down the hallway.

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:30.750
We're like,
we're in high school

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:33.019
It was actually
incredibly thrilling.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.221
And, and working with
middle schoolers was very fun.

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:37.590
Working with the high schoolers
was terrifying.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.226
2018's high schoolers

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.029
looking you feel like
the biggest fucking...

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.498
I'm looking at my Adidas pumps
that I have on.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.767
I'm like, I'm the biggest
fucking tool in the world.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.302
Even what you're describing,
I couldn't do it

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.503
because well...

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:51.938
all you're doing is
you're taking testosterone

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:54.106
with those kids
and just amplifying two notches

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.676
and they're coming in like,
"Fuck you!"

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.045
I tell you what though?
I remember being young

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.914
and always afraid
of the older kids

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.549
and bigger people
when I was little...

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:04.884
I went to the same school.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.386
It was kindergarten
through twelfth grade.

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.721
K through 12, huh?

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.590
I didn't stay the whole time,
but I was in it...

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.859
K through 12.
I didn't stay the whole time.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.929
But I remember when I got to
like eighth or ninth grade.

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:18.764
And you were in
the different halls?

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:21.767
I had to do something in the
halls of the younger grades.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.836
I went over there
and made a concerted effort

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.438
when a kid walked by
I'd be like,

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.739
"Move out of the way jerk off."

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:30.243
(crosstalk)
and he went, "Fuck you bitch!"

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.412
He called my bluff immediately
and I was like,

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.548
"I can't just hit him
in school, he wins."

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.250
Like I got kid three grades
lower than me.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.018
Which is like, fuck you...
what are you telling me?

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:40.419
(inaudible)

00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:42.388
I thought he was gonna just
cower like you're supposed...

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:43.656
like I would have.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.225
So when you went to...how much
in the high schools were you?

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:47.526
We were there only a few days.

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.328
Okay. So you were getting out
and you were like,

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:51.064
"Last day among these monsters."

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.366
But it was beautiful
because it was...

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.735
we felt like the story
we were telling in there,

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.537
which is that high school
is terrifying from an outsider

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.339
from either end.
If you're coming from...

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:01.807
if you're looking back
or looking forward,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.042
it's, horrifying.

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:04.811
And they're so self
possessed now.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.014
They just are cooler
than they've ever been-

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.482
Because of Instagram.
They have hints.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:10.683
Is that what it is?

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:12.351
Yeah, they're just like really,

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:15.755
literate socially in a very
quick way that you're not in on.

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:22.628
Things are so old,
so quick for kids now,

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.097
that the amount of out
of touch you are

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.300
is just exponentially bigger,
than it would have been.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.236
Like eighties kids
relating to nineties kids.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.905
It's like 2012 kids
relating to now are-

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:34.273
uh, uh,

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:36.175
Are out of touch.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:37.910
I'm a 2001 and I'm just gone.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:40.479
My daughter has a...

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:42.248
she used to have
crushes on Vine celebrities.

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:43.482
Yeah.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:47.453
So when her mom will say
something about celebrity

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:50.189
crushes Belle has, I go,
"What is it, a Vine celebrity?"

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:52.692
She goes, there is no Vine.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.493
What's the other one?
Was it the Periscope?

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:56.262
Yeah, Music.ally,
that's another thing.

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:57.930
Those things are huge.

00:04:57.963 --> 00:04:59.198
Yeah, it's wild.
These kids...

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.467
these middle school kids
are born 2003.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.702
Jesus.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.737
Two years after 9/11.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.340
It's in the movie actually,
but it's in the background.

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:10.142
There is a banner
of the Twin Towers.

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:12.511
It's a thing and there is
a school like 90 minutes north

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:15.548
and it's like, "Oh that is
a historical event for them."

00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.551
Yeah, that'd be like the way
they show like a Washington

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:21.821
crossing the Delaware,
on a patch in your life.

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:23.289
Look at that. That happened.
They go.

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:25.991
Those used to be the twin towers
and you're like, "Oh man.

00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:28.594
I remember what my record
was on MAD in that year."

00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:31.331
I did a spot, the Boston comedy
club the night before.

00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:35.301
I woke up. Yeah, I was
a freshman in college.

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:37.269
And it's weird to think
that these kids are just like,

00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:39.004
that wasn't even do two years.
2003!

00:05:39.037 --> 00:05:41.140
My daughter, my daughter
was born in 2002.

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:45.111
Weird. Post 9/11 kids.
I'm a Reagan baby.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:48.481
What's up?
Say no to drugs.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:49.782
Eighth Grade.
I'm trying to remember.

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:52.017
Christine said it was
a fantastic year for her.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.352
You had a good
eighth grade year.

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:54.787
I had a good eighth grade year,
yeah.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.725
It was straight south-ola
after that was great.

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:03.062
I switched schools, so I went
to one school for grammar school

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:07.133
until sixth grade where I got
bullied and it was just shitty.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.734
And then I went to this
awesome school

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:11.337
for seventh and eighth grade
where it was just,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.173
it was like an amazing
school experience.

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:16.308
Small classes.
The teachers gave a shit.

00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.144
It was like
very community driven.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.079
That's right, yeah. That makes
you feel better about yourself.

00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:21.814
Yeah. Got my first gay friends.

00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:25.017
It is incredible too to see
how socially progressive

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.352
the schools are,

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:27.887
which I think actually
like colors,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.390
the misery of the kids in
just a horrible dose of irony.

00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:33.826
The fact that like
you're walking by a poster

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:35.795
that says like support
trans rights

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:36.996
and feel like a piece of shit

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.131
you feel like
for the first time,

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:41.066
like the administration
and the faculty

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.502
and your parents
are constantly looking at you,

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:46.272
hoping you're feeling good.
And you still feel shitty.

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:50.576
It's like they they would love
to get a fucking swirly

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:51.977
or have their head
shoved in a locker,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.180
would actually ground their pain
and something tangible

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:55.381
instead of being like,

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:58.451
"The world as coddling me
and I feel empty inside."

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:00.486
Why the fuck?
They have no structure,

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:01.954
you know,
they have no structure to-

00:07:01.987 --> 00:07:03.489
They don't have anything
to rage, you know,

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:04.723
machine to fight against.

00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:06.625
No and it's like really bad-
I think.

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:10.062
I think bullying, bullying is
part of the fucking terrarium

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:11.330
as part of the-

00:07:11.363 --> 00:07:12.731
I mean I remember the kid being-

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:14.066
It's part of the ecosystem
of growing up.

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.101
I think I was bullied.

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:18.671
I was bullied and I eventually
stood up to a bully

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.739
and not all of them,
but you know, I have done.

00:07:20.772 --> 00:07:23.309
You have that kind of check
off your list.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:27.546
I've bullied and, and been got
fucking hurt by the person.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:29.215
I, you know what I mean?
Like they hit me first

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:30.549
or I lost the fight
or you know what I mean,

00:07:30.582 --> 00:07:32.384
like it was all part of
like learning a thing...

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:34.220
and then I knew I didn't
bully people after that.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:35.421
Yeah. But it's.

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.056
But it's like
the bullying exists.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:38.491
It's just completely abstract.

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:40.626
So instead of like, I got
my head shoved in a locker,

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.361
it's like someone
made a fake

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:45.464
Instagram account of me
and said I'm a neocon.

00:07:45.497 --> 00:07:47.166
It was like, wait,
you're in seventh grade.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:48.467
You shouldn't like...
That's not the way

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.802
you should have to
process things so it's like...

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:51.103
That's a grad school prank.

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:52.304
It really is!

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:53.906
And I was talking
to kids about...

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.174
'Cause like, it's incredible

00:07:55.207 --> 00:07:56.976
how much these kids are thinking
about politics and just have to.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.712
And they like lose friendships
over their political allegiances

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:00.946
in fucking eighth grade.

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:02.314
In eighth grade
was I being like,

00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:03.716
you're Dukakis kid,
like fuck off.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:04.917
Like what are we talking about?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.652
Like I can't believe,
I can't believe that.

00:08:06.685 --> 00:08:08.554
You Bob Dole loving
mother fucker...

00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:11.156
I did like a little round
table the kids

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.292
and talking to them and like,
there's like 12 year old kids

00:08:13.325 --> 00:08:15.494
going to do,
you know what happened in Iran?

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:21.133
And I'm like, no, it's crazy.

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:24.770
Is this kind of a symptom
from all the information

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:26.171
being leaked into the phones

00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:28.073
where you could just
read anything in second

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:30.509
where you used to have to hear
someone from somebody

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:31.877
and then
that they were your source.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.112
I remember one time I-

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:34.580
If you follow enough adults,

00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:36.715
you're bound to just as
you're thumbing up the thing

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:38.150
and see like,
look at this burger

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:41.220
I just ate and about
to crush this steak.

00:08:41.253 --> 00:08:42.988
There's eventually
gonna be like a news story

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:45.824
and you're going to see fire
and troops do you click it

00:08:45.857 --> 00:08:47.326
and you read the thing,
you know?

00:08:47.359 --> 00:08:48.527
But it... Yeah, exactly.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.763
And it's also just like
the whatever,

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:52.998
like democratization
of information, all this shit.

00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:55.501
Which is like we all thought
was super cool that has a voice,

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:57.469
but now we have no way
to discern

00:08:57.502 --> 00:08:58.771
which voice is important,

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.073
where the hierarchy
of true value or meaning is.

00:09:01.106 --> 00:09:04.476
And it literally is like
perfectly demonstrated

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:05.778
in what a feat is.

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:07.246
You Scroll through your feed
as you're a kid,

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.948
you will see
in no particular order.

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.816
Your mother, your friends,

00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:12.318
the president
of the United States,

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.486
Chick-Fil-A;
and it's just like these...

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.388
they're all being presented
with the same amount of space-

00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:17.990
A lotta chicks in yoga pants,

00:09:18.023 --> 00:09:19.725
taking a picture
in front of a mirror.

00:09:19.758 --> 00:09:23.462
And it's a lot to process and
for kids at the end of the night

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:26.065
to have to choose between like
the back of your eyelids

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.033
or everything
in the history of the world.

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:30.669
It's like you go crazy
with that.

00:09:30.702 --> 00:09:33.739
I go crazy with that.
I started pissing sitting down

00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:35.507
so it could be in my phone
like 18 months ago

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.343
and I was like,
something's wrong.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.479
This is... And then I just,
it was just more comfortable.

00:09:40.512 --> 00:09:43.082
Do you think cell phones
are going to be kind of

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.417
like the new cigarettes
where like 20 years from now

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.286
he wouldn't be like you
got to say off cell phones.

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:48.487
You're going to get cancer.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.755
Yeah. And I always said like,

00:09:49.788 --> 00:09:52.224
it's going to be like smoking
and we're gonna...

00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:55.394
The equivalent of my doctor
used to smoke

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:57.162
will be like my shrink
at a twitter.

00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:58.597
Like, it'll be so brave
and you'll go,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.099
"Your shrink had a twitter?"
How you will-

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:01.367
You's a troll.
You was like a Reddit troll.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.601
(crosstalk)

00:10:02.634 --> 00:10:04.169
You were being taught
by someone that's like...

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:06.438
Do you think the information
intake

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:08.073
as effective the curriculum
for kids

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:09.508
and I think is is, is it harder?

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:11.477
Is it a little deeper does it
move faster, you think, school?

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.678
Yeah.
That's interesting.

00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:14.179
Well, the with
the teachers decided

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:15.648
that they can't ban phones.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.149
They just can't because
it's just not tenable.

00:10:17.182 --> 00:10:18.383
Remember that started?

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:21.553
It's like dancing and Kansas.
You hear that, John Lithgow?

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:23.856
If you had a beeper and your mom
had to come get it.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.457
They would take it.
They would isolate it.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.359
And they just can't.

00:10:27.392 --> 00:10:29.294
Yeah. I got a cell phone
when I was 18,

00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:30.963
it was my mom's work phone.

00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:33.332
She's like,
you're driving here you go.

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.401
That's funny, in punishment
to take my daughter's cell

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.736
phone away at 16 years old.

00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:40.039
One of the big thing
you know also with the...

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:41.674
they scare the shit
out of you in the world

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:42.975
that something terrible
can happen

00:10:43.008 --> 00:10:44.243
that you need her
to have her phone.

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:46.912
You know, she has to be
kind of tethered to it

00:10:46.945 --> 00:10:48.180
so we can get a hold of her.

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:49.515
You know what I mean?
I get blown away.

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:51.617
I get nervous,
if I can't get ahold of her.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:57.589
The idea of that if this was,
you know, 25 years ago,

00:10:57.622 --> 00:10:59.024
she'd have to get to a landline-

00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:01.760
Yeah. You'd have
a number to call. I mean-

00:11:01.793 --> 00:11:03.462
That's the way they've sold

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:04.863
the parents
that it's like so funny.

00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:08.233
It's like in case your child
is anywhere they need to get

00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:09.635
in contact
with you in emergency.

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:11.036
And by the way,
they'll have no privacy

00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:12.638
and all of the information
will be for everyone to see

00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:13.906
and they'll performed
their own lives.

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:15.274
Okay. And it's like,
wait, what like the-

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:16.875
What was that second part?

00:11:16.908 --> 00:11:22.214
But the gulf between that and...
we fell down the rabbit hole

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:24.016
so quickly.
It's so insane.

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:25.484
I went from being
in seventh grade

00:11:25.517 --> 00:11:28.353
with my chunky Motorola phone
impressing girls

00:11:28.386 --> 00:11:29.955
by throwing my phone
over my shoulder

00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:31.557
and showing that like
it wouldn't shatter.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.159
That was my move.

00:11:34.192 --> 00:11:35.527
That's a good move by the way.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.029
That's a lot of faith
in T-Mobile.

00:11:37.062 --> 00:11:39.098
"Did you see Bo's got
a strong phone?"

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:41.567
"Oh my God, he Kareem Skyhooks

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.203
it into the ground.
It doesn't break."

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.539
But yeah it's wild.
And like the...

00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:50.776
Yeah. The crazy thing is
that like there are like...

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.845
What fucks me up looking at it,

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:54.313
which is just so weird,
is that there are like...

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.948
and I've been to these places,
you know what I mean...

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:57.449
There are places
in Silicon Valley

00:11:57.482 --> 00:11:59.718
with 300 employees
that they're like...

00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:01.220
the purpose of their company

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:04.723
is to cater to the base
wants of children.

00:12:04.756 --> 00:12:07.993
Like what they actually program
is what kids want.

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:11.396
I dunno, a photo service where
photos disappear after 24 hours.

00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:14.767
What would a kid want that for
and what is maybe like...

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.771
that's sort of legalized child
pornography distribution.

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:20.072
They can't be liable for it

00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:21.840
because it's disappearing
after 24, you know?

00:12:21.873 --> 00:12:23.843
And there's no mechanism
to ask like-

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:25.611
"Is this good?"

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:27.880
What do they maybe want?
Are we making like-

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:31.083
Because it's so in front of...

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:32.918
It's so ahead of us right now
that we're, like you said,

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:34.186
we're falling down
the rabbit hole

00:12:34.219 --> 00:12:36.188
with no fucking direction
so fast.

00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:39.658
And like the decisions about
kids like neurochemistry

00:12:39.691 --> 00:12:42.094
are being made literally
by programmers.

00:12:42.127 --> 00:12:43.829
I'm just saying...
and they're not social geniuses

00:12:43.862 --> 00:12:45.030
like you've met
these fucking people.

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:46.331
Yeah, for sure.

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:47.566
Yeah. They come out
to the Punchline

00:12:47.599 --> 00:12:49.067
sometimes in San Francisco,
they're a rough go.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.369
Years and years ago,

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:52.204
if your kid was like
ahead of you on technology

00:12:52.237 --> 00:12:54.506
to worry about him starting
war games or something.

00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:56.608
Whereas like now
it's just flat out that.

00:12:56.641 --> 00:12:58.710
It's like, are they giving
their privacy away?

00:12:58.743 --> 00:13:02.247
Are they all your kids
sending a child pornography

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.950
basically that to each other
and stuff and that's...

00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:09.087
And they're ahead of it because
where I think I know where I go,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.223
oh, I would have to check
my daughter's thing.

00:13:11.256 --> 00:13:13.759
See, I know there's the secret
apps that are photo apps.

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:15.994
I know how to find those things,
you know, whatever.

00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:18.363
But I don't...
She definitely knows

00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:19.998
12 more things
that I'm unaware.

00:13:20.031 --> 00:13:22.034
-Always a step ahead.
-I don't know if...

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:25.904
how to check if she has more
than one Twitter or Instagram.

00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:27.172
You can't even use it.

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:29.141
You don't even know what
the names of the things are.

00:13:29.174 --> 00:13:30.843
You have to be literate
in this whole thing

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:32.444
to even understand
the dangers though.

00:13:32.477 --> 00:13:34.446
Just so strange.
You know, it's...

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:36.882
Let's go analog dude.
Let's shut it all down.

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:38.750
I know. It's so funny.
Cause that's what people say.

00:13:38.783 --> 00:13:40.419
Like people always say
to me like,

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:42.254
"There's going to be
a generation that unplugged."

00:13:42.287 --> 00:13:44.723
And I'm like, yeah, some things
are cyclical for sure.

00:13:44.756 --> 00:13:46.225
But sometimes
like a car shows up

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:47.893
and there's fucking
no more horses like that.

00:13:47.926 --> 00:13:51.864
That's just what happens.
Things just change and they...

00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:54.566
And especially like, you want
to think this is cyclical

00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:55.868
and like a generational unplug.

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:58.003
Watch a fucking three year old
with an iPad.

00:13:58.036 --> 00:14:00.806
You'll see that these things
are designed to appeal to us

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.074
before we can fucking think.

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:03.342
That's what I said.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:05.177
I had a bit about that,
that I did on Conan

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.079
and about just watching a
little kid with a fucking iPads,

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.513
one of the most
terrifying things in the world

00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:09.748
because they focus in.

00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:10.983
My ex wife-

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.417
And they know how to use it.
it's mind blowing.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.152
My ex wife as new baby.

00:14:14.185 --> 00:14:15.988
So it's my daughter's sister,

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:17.556
and well if we go to dinner
or something together,

00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:22.161
they occupy her by giving her
an iPad or the iPhone

00:14:22.794 --> 00:14:25.130
and how I'll know
if she has the phone,

00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:26.932
if I'm not with them,
if the baby as the phone

00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:29.334
because what she knows
not only used to go to YouTube,

00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:31.637
they basically for three
they set her up with the page

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.172
that has all the videos
of that cartoon

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:35.540
or whatever is she watches.

00:14:35.573 --> 00:14:37.542
But she knows how to pick
a different one,

00:14:37.575 --> 00:14:39.845
go to a different one
and she knows if somebody calls

00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:42.915
and buzzes
in that she has to, you know...

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:44.583
if something comes up,
says there's a text,

00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:46.218
she knows how to swipe it up
to make go away.

00:14:46.251 --> 00:14:49.688
And if someone calls she knows
to hit the red to make it...

00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:51.490
She's three.

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:54.059
That navigating the interface
of YouTube is insane.

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:55.928
This is the image that like...

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.464
and I've had multiple people
have said this to me.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.700
I know other people
with young kids

00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:03.502
who have done
the exact same thing.

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.238
My nephew watches videos.

00:15:06.271 --> 00:15:09.308
There's videos of...
like which is so demented

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:10.909
that these people
make these videos...

00:15:10.942 --> 00:15:13.645
of parents that film their kids
playing with toys.

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:15.514
It's all about
like Jeff's toys wherever-

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:16.815
And unwrapping boxes.

00:15:16.848 --> 00:15:19.084
Yeah. Yeah.
So what happens is like...

00:15:19.117 --> 00:15:22.487
so now my sister
will be with her kid

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.823
and he'll start playing
with toys and be like,

00:15:24.856 --> 00:15:26.625
"Mom, mom,
tell them about the..."

00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:29.328
Thinking there's an audience
there to talking to.

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.630
We're going, "Tell them
about the...

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:33.365
tell them to subscribe
or tell them..."

00:15:33.398 --> 00:15:35.667
And multiple people
I've said have said

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.437
that their kids watch
these videos and then-

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.938
They think they're in
The Truman Show.

00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:41.173
Exactly.

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:45.377
And that is a real sort of
depersonalization or whatever.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.980
Like that's a real thing
that can happen to people.

00:15:51.816 --> 00:15:53.919
It sounds like a goofy thing.

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:59.124
But that's like a weird meta,
strange prison type of living,

00:15:59.157 --> 00:16:00.959
which I think is what kids
suffer from now.

00:16:00.992 --> 00:16:03.061
Which is they don't
just live their life.

00:16:03.094 --> 00:16:04.563
They also hover over themselves

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:05.931
and watch themselves
live their life.

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:08.100
They don't just
approach moments.

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:10.102
Before they even have a moment
they're wondering

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:13.005
what that moment will be,
how it'll be looked back on,

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:15.841
how people react
to how they look back. It's-

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:20.212
(inaudible)...example of
that is every concert is-

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.813
It's a parody of itself
and it's like...

00:16:21.846 --> 00:16:24.783
No we're not supposed to become
shitty New Yorker cartoons.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.119
The problem with the country
becoming the movie

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.554
Idiocracy is Idiocracy
is not a great movie.

00:16:29.587 --> 00:16:30.856
That's what no one's
actually saying

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:33.625
is that it's kind of an
on the nose, shitty satire-

00:16:35.193 --> 00:16:37.696
It's insane how much that movie
comes up

00:16:37.729 --> 00:16:40.732
just in conversation
with people on a daily basis.

00:16:40.765 --> 00:16:42.334
That we thought we'd be
a better movie than this.

00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:43.702
You know what I mean?

00:16:43.735 --> 00:16:44.936
You're right.
It's definitely true.

00:16:44.969 --> 00:16:46.471
What I said that...
was it coming.

00:16:46.504 --> 00:16:49.374
Oh, what the UFC fights now.
When the UFC,

00:16:49.407 --> 00:16:51.710
when Michael Buffer
is announcing you go...

00:16:51.743 --> 00:16:53.578
For the main event, he goes,

00:16:53.611 --> 00:16:58.183
"We are here at the MGM Grand
brought to you by Mojitos.

00:16:58.216 --> 00:16:59.918
When you're having
a rough summer,

00:16:59.951 --> 00:17:02.554
make sure you drink
a Mojito brand.

00:17:02.587 --> 00:17:05.724
Mojitos fighting out
of the red corner.

00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:08.760
It's going to get real dark
through their Metro PCS."

00:17:08.793 --> 00:17:11.396
"Your cancer diagnosis
is in brought to you

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:15.534
by Pepto Bismol.
You got prostate cancer."

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:18.270
I know we have to get Bo
out of here.

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:21.406
Again, the movie Eighth Grade
out now available on Blu Ray

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:24.176
and digital platforms on demand.
Dude, so great to see you.

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.278
I'm so proud of you, man.
For what that's worth, man.

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:27.579
What I will say truthfully, Jay.

00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:30.248
I do remember how kind you
are to me at that time.

00:17:30.281 --> 00:17:31.516
I remember more than anybody.

00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:34.052
I specifically say
when people say,

00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:35.787
"Who was a comedian
that was very nice to you

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.089
when you were young?"
It was you.

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.924
You were so, so kind to me.
I can never forget that.

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:42.594
You've got to make a movie
called 41.

00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:47.399
We'll be right back everybody.
It's The Bonfire.

00:17:47.932 --> 00:17:49.901
-That was so cool to talk Bo.
-It did.

00:17:49.934 --> 00:17:51.636
It was a bumout talk though.

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:53.805
Just like we're old, the young
are the future 

00:17:53.838 --> 00:17:56.775
and they're
crazy.

00:17:56.808 --> 00:18:00.245
The young is into technology.
The robots they don't like you.

00:18:01.112 --> 00:18:03.348
I don't know if I look
at this generation and go,

00:18:03.381 --> 00:18:05.283
"They're gonna fix everything."

00:18:05.316 --> 00:18:07.319
Not at all.
Well, you got to let one go.

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:09.020
Maybe their kids.

00:18:09.053 --> 00:18:10.722
One generation
has to be like on.

00:18:10.755 --> 00:18:12.657
One generation is going to suck
and then the next one's

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.092
going to be like,
we got to fucking clean.

00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:15.727
Isabella's children are going
to turn it all around.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.928
Yes your grandchildren.

00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:19.231
That's why she's just swiping
left and right.
