00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:02.711
DANNY: Now, dude, if
that Chevy right there--

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.087
SHANNON: Two-door.

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:05.797
--if it was a two-door,
I'd be all over it.

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.132
And I know there's this mystique
that Danny hates four-doors.

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:08.675
That's not true.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.885
There are four-doors
that I absolutely love.

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:13.680
But from my personal taste,
if that car was a two-door,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.640
we'd be knocking on the door.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.933
Don't look.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.394
Don't look at the
Volkswagen, Shannon.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:23.606
I know it's difficult for you to
pass up any kind of a bug, man.

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.735
- What's that, like, a '69?
- See?

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.862
We're going to set
up an intervention.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.572
What's that right there?

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.699
We got something.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.409
We got a '67 Camaro.

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.411
Now, that's a full
on convertible.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.412
Let's at least take a look, man.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.292
Yes, it looks very confused.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.127
SHANNON: It's been sitting
like this for a long time.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.545
DANNY: Yeah.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:46.171
SHANNON: Something about
that race seat in there.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:47.422
DANNY: No.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.840
I would go back to
original buckets.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.133
Let's see what the
story is on this.

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.181
I stopped to talk to
you about your Camaro.

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.932
What's your name, brother?

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.392
Stewart, I'm Danny.
It's very nice to meet you.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.561
This is Shannon.
- Nice to meet you, Stewart.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.145
'67?

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.402
Yes, right?

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.279
DANNY: This is awesome, bro.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:15.450
Chevy debuted their 1967 Camaro
to compete with Ford's Mustang.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.495
No easy task, but the Camaro
was up to the challenge.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.705
It had the looks,
handling, and speed

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.540
every gearhead was looking for.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.044
The Camaro would come to beat
the Mustang in sales in 1977,

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.963
and remain a major player in
the performance car market

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:31.049
all the way up until 2002.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.968
With sales numbers tailing off,
Chevy decided to pull the plug

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:35.428
on their iconic Camaro.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:38.264
The mighty Camaro
returned in 2010

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.767
with first-generation
styling and modern features

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.602
like independent
four-wheel suspension.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.646
Chevy hoped to
capture the old school

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:48.107
muscle car crowd and a whole
new generation car enthusiast

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.400
as well.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.860
You've had this
car for how long?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.028
Since '79.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:53.196
SHANNON: How did
you get this baby?

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.240
Well, my high
school girlfriend

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.868
in '67 had a yellow '67 Camaro.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:01.162
So what do you think
I'm looking for?

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:05.124
So I'm looking for a '67 Camaro,
and I found it the junkyard.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.334
What's the engine in it?

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.919
Right now, it's got a 350.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.588
And it's got roller
can, roller lifters.

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:12.131
So that's a rocket sled.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.008
Yeah, I see the
race seats in it.

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.344
Actually, I'm going to
go back to the originals.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.387
You called it.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:18.805
You called it.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.182
Is that the factory seat
sitting on the ground?

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.892
STEWART: Yeah.
DANNY: Nice.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.644
So you've got a
car guy for years?

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:27.939
Well, yeah.
But you guys probably know why.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.399
I can repair these.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.986
I did the water pump, fuel
pump, and an alternator,

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.279
and a couple of hoses.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.489
I spent $150.
- Right.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.366
How long has she
been off the road?

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.868
How long you been
working on her?

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.202
It's been 15 years.

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:43.037
15 years.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.747
How much would
you sell this for?

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:45.874
$50,000.

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.292
OK, so it's your baby.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.543
This car is not for sale.

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:49.627
Yeah, no.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:52.213
You'd have to be insane.
