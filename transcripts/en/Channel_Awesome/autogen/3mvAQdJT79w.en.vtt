looking back so when you see what it

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500
looking back so when you see what it
 

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.200
looking back so when you see what it
builds up to and that's kind of the end

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:00.210
builds up to and that's kind of the end

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.890
that leads to this at the end of this
list this and at this might be this

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900
list this and at this might be this
 

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.570
list this and at this might be this

parts for me was the dead center of the
 

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.850
parts for me was the dead center of the
movie the middle part where it gets kind

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860
movie the middle part where it gets kind
 

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.280
movie the middle part where it gets kind
of back to the future - ish like yeah

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:28.290
of back to the future - ish like yeah
 

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.920
of back to the future - ish like yeah
and again it goes on a while it's not

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:30.930
and again it goes on a while it's not
 

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.800
and again it goes on a while it's not
but it's not bad it's not if I'm

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:33.810
but it's not bad it's not if I'm
 

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.210
but it's not bad it's not if I'm
thinking at the part where I'm just like

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.220
thinking at the part where I'm just like
 

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.830
thinking at the part where I'm just like
yeah I'm a little more disinterested now

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840
yeah I'm a little more disinterested now
 

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.080
yeah I'm a little more disinterested now
and that's the thing there was action

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.090
and that's the thing there was action
 

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.760
and that's the thing there was action
there which is kind of interesting what

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:40.770
there which is kind of interesting what
 

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.200
there which is kind of interesting what
you need it because there's not much

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.210
you need it because there's not much
 

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.180
you need it because there's not much
yeah but I actually preferred probably

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:44.190
yeah but I actually preferred probably
 

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.060
yeah but I actually preferred probably
the scenes without the action yeah until

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:47.070
the scenes without the action yeah until
 

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.830
the scenes without the action yeah until
the third act the third act is totally

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840
the third act the third act is totally
 

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.410
the third act the third act is totally
awesome yeah so it's but but you see

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:51.420
awesome yeah so it's but but you see
 

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.030
awesome yeah so it's but but you see
what we're talking about where it's like

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.040
what we're talking about where it's like
 

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.850
what we're talking about where it's like
ya know it it builds up it gets there

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860
ya know it it builds up it gets there
 

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.790
ya know it it builds up it gets there
it's a payoff but it's it's a long

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:58.800
it's a payoff but it's it's a long
 

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.970
it's a payoff but it's it's a long
build-up so it's a weird mix because it

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980
build-up so it's a weird mix because it
 

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.650
build-up so it's a weird mix because it
both does exactly what you think it's

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660
both does exactly what you think it's
 

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.030
both does exactly what you think it's
gonna do if you think of the big picture

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:05.040
gonna do if you think of the big picture
 

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.640
gonna do if you think of the big picture
like I know what needs to happen and you

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:07.650
like I know what needs to happen and you
 

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.140
like I know what needs to happen and you
know through some lights in there that I

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:09.150
know through some lights in there that I
 

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.090
know through some lights in there that I
don't really see that coming already it

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100
don't really see that coming already it
 

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:16.130
don't really see that coming already it
doesn't know it's kind of surprising and

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140
doesn't know it's kind of surprising and
 

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.740
