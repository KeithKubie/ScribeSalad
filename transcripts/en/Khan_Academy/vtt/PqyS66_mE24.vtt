00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:01.895
- [Instructor] Two baseball teams

00:00:01.895 --> 00:00:03.633
are comparing the number of fans

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:06.555
who attended their most recent games.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:09.759
The attendance at the
Stanleyville Sliders' game

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.764
was 12,896 fans.

00:00:12.764 --> 00:00:15.210
The attendance at the Benson Bats' game

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.376
was 12,901 fans.

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:21.904
Which team had more fans at their game?

00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:24.808
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.880
Alright, let's work
through this together now.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.326
Stanleyville Sliders.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:31.686
They tell us Stanleyville
Sliders' game was 12,000,

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:36.106
12,896

00:00:36.106 --> 00:00:38.441
and there's a reason why
I'm writing it really large

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:39.633
right over there.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:43.800
And then we see at the
Benson Bats' game was 12,901.

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:51.148
12,901.

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:53.059
So, the way I like to compare numbers

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.158
is I go to the largest place value first

00:00:56.158 --> 00:00:57.524
and I compare.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.357
Well, let's see.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:00.348
They both have one 10,000.

00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:02.741
So, they have the same number of 10,000s,

00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:05.636
they have the same number of 1,000s,

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:07.617
but then when we get to 100s,

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:11.342
notice, Benson Bats has more 100s

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:13.354
than Stanleyville Sliders.

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:15.486
It doesn't matter what happens
in the 10s and ones place.

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:18.056
If they have more 100s over here.

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:20.967
So, Benson Bats this is a larger number.

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:23.030
So, which one has more fans at their game?

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.094
Benson's Bats,

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:26.098
and once again, I started
at the largest place value,

00:01:26.098 --> 00:01:27.434
I start at the 10,000's place.

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:28.267
It was the same.

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:29.367
Then I move onto the next place.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:30.200
It's the same.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.266
Then I move onto the next place

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.478
but now in the 100's place
Benson's Bats is larger.

00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:37.540
So, I know that Benson's Bats

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.700
has more fans than Stanleyville Sliders.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.206
I could write this as 12,901

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:45.694
is greater than,

00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:47.289
and I always remember the sign

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.596
by saying hey, it opens
to the larger value,

00:01:49.596 --> 00:01:53.763
so this is gonna be greater than 12,896.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.199
And you can even just think about it.

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:58.032
Just keep counting.

00:01:58.032 --> 00:02:00.689
12,896, 12,897,

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.500
12,898,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.517
12,899,

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:06.225
12,900

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:08.474
and then 12,901.

00:02:08.474 --> 00:02:11.307
Alright, let's do another example.

00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:16.360
The table shows the weights
of several animals at the zoo.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.217
Put the animals in order
from lightest to heaviest.

00:02:19.217 --> 00:02:21.892
The lightest animal should
be on the top of the list.

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.496
And so, you can see it right over here,

00:02:23.496 --> 00:02:26.939
they gave us these three animals,

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.570
and if you're doing this on Khan Academy

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.060
you'd be able to click on
these and move them around

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.076
but I just copy and
pasted the actual image.

00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:35.804
So, let's just think about these wights.

00:02:35.804 --> 00:02:38.370
So, let's do the same thing.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.272
Let's first look and
actually pause the video

00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:42.708
and try to solve it on your own.

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:44.920
Alright, so if we first
look at the 1,000's place.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.125
Remember, we start at
the largest place value,

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.030
so the 1,000's place,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.407
they all have exactly two 1,000s,

00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:52.730
so now we move on to the 100's place.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.498
So, what the polar bear and crocodile

00:02:55.498 --> 00:02:59.331
has two 100s but the
giraffe only has one 100,

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:02.345
so the giraffe is the lightest.

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:04.942
And remember, we're ordering
from lightest to heaviest

00:03:04.942 --> 00:03:06.805
because this has the
least number of hundreds.

00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:08.541
They all have the same
number of thousands,

00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:11.048
and so then we move one space to the right

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:14.647
to the 100s and the giraffe
has the least number of 100s.

00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:18.744
So, the giraffe is going
to be the lightest.

00:03:18.744 --> 00:03:20.757
And so, let's think about
between the polar bear

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:22.677
and the crocodile.

00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:24.525
They both have the same number of 1,000s,

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:26.869
they have the same numbers of 100s,

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.365
they have the same number of 10s

00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:33.629
but notice, the polar has
more ones than the crocodile.

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.597
And so, the polar bear is heavier,

00:03:36.597 --> 00:03:38.070
so the crocodile comes next,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.448
it's the next heaviest
or the next lightest,

00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:42.309
crocodile

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:46.725
and then the heaviest is the polar bear.

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:48.158
The polar bear.

00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:48.991
Now once again,

00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:52.231
you start at the largest
place value, you compare.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.064
They were the same.

00:03:53.064 --> 00:03:53.897
Then you go to the next largest.

00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:54.730
Oh, there's a difference,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.775
so this one must be lighter.

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:57.703
Doesn't matter what
happens in the 10s and ones

00:03:57.703 --> 00:03:59.182
because it has fewer 100s

00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:00.863
than these right over here.

00:04:00.863 --> 00:04:02.820
And so, if you were sorting these around

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.508
you would want to put the giraffe first

00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:09.180
and then you would put the crocodile,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.524
and then the polar bear would stay last,

00:04:11.524 --> 00:04:13.128
so actually you would just swap,

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.580
you would just swap these
two right over here.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.418
Let's do one more.

00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:18.137
This is a lot of fun.

00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:20.051
Alright.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.718
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.005
Pause this video now

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.621
and see if you can solve this.

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:29.109
The table shows the elevations

00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:32.093
for three mountains in North America.

00:04:32.093 --> 00:04:34.197
Abby is trying to guess the elevation

00:04:34.197 --> 00:04:36.149
of University Peak.

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:39.247
She knows that it is
taller than Mount Massive

00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:41.751
but not as tall as Mount Alverstone.

00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:45.084
So, it is between Mount
Alverstone and Mount Massive.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:46.151
So, it is right over here.

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.339
Taller than Mount Massive

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:51.230
but not as tall as Mount Alverstone.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.071
Alright.

00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:53.821
Fill in the blank with an elevation

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:55.693
Abby could guess for the elevation

00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:57.413
of University Peak.

00:04:57.413 --> 00:04:59.811
Enter a whole number solution.

00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:00.693
So, we just have to think of a number

00:05:00.693 --> 00:05:05.198
that is larger than 14,428

00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:08.606
and smaller than 14,400.

00:05:08.606 --> 00:05:12.000
Well, one possibility
is we'll just add one

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.245
to Mount Massive.

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:17.996
So, one possibility is 14,429.

00:05:17.996 --> 00:05:20.378
That would be taller than Mount Massive

00:05:20.378 --> 00:05:23.378
but not as tall as Mount Alverstone.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.122
Even though it has more
ones than Mount Massive,

00:05:27.122 --> 00:05:28.513
everything else is the same,

00:05:28.513 --> 00:05:30.762
it has fewer 100s than Mount Alverstone.

00:05:30.762 --> 00:05:31.595
So, that could be.

00:05:31.595 --> 00:05:34.351
We could write 14,429.

00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:37.592
We could have also written 14,430

00:05:37.592 --> 00:05:39.035
and we could have kept going

00:05:39.035 --> 00:05:43.202
all the way until 14,499.

00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:46.623
They want us to enter a
whole number solution.

00:05:46.623 --> 00:05:50.790
So, any of these would have
been acceptable answers.
