In today's video,

00:00:00.891 --> 00:00:03.200
we're going to see
what happens if we combine

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.000
1,000 silly putty eggs
into one giant blob.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.460
[Music]

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.100
Calli, what are we doing today?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.300
I'm putting a lock
on your Amazon account.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.360
Nah, don't be ridiculous.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.500
We have here a little bit
of silly putty,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.900
and when I say a little bit,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.380
I mean the equivalent
of about 1,000 eggs.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.580
You can see we've got
hundreds and hundreds

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.500
of the single silly putty eggs,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.794
and we've also got some slightly
larger silly putty eggs.

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:41.200
This is worth just
over 10 smaller ones,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.400
and these big ones are worth

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.200
about 40 to 45 smaller
silly putty eggs.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
All told, we have almost

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.400
exactly 1,000 eggs worth
of silly putty here.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.200
Now, we've done a little bit
with silly putty in the past,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.450
and poured molten gallium

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.447
into it to see
if we could make a mold in it,

00:00:58.447 --> 00:00:59.900
and no, unfortunately you can't.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.974
The gallium is too heavy,

00:01:00.974 --> 00:01:02.737
and it just smooches
the silly putty down.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.700
But we got some other
things going to try.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.600
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.900
We have a thousand
silly putty eggs.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.900
We're going to put them
together, and we're going to see

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.300
what we can do with
that much silly putty.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.600
But just clear as all the tables

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.345
so we can put the silly
putty on the table,

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:17.800
and really see it
all really nicely.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.871
Let's get work.

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.300
So that right there.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.618
The giant ones are actually
both glow in the dark.

00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:24.300
So we have a glow
in the dark green,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.700
and glow in the dark yellow.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.200
Yeah.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.300
No, it's already glowing.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.900
Just from the sunlight coming in
through that window.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.700
You see that?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.192
Guys, if anyone can think
of what we can do

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:36.100
with nearly a thousand
silly putty egg containers,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.500
let us know
in the comments below.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.151
Please, we'd love
your suggestions.

00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:40.900
We're going to have
so many of these.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:50.940
[Music]

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.200
The new King of Random
Spy Scope Kit is here.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.500
Guys, this kit is amazing.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
It allows you to actually build

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.900
one of your own little
microscopes at home.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.302
You don't have to worry
about going out

00:02:00.302 --> 00:02:02.000
and getting all the parts,
having extra pieces.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.800
Everything is provided for you.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.404
That's right.

00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:07.100
It even comes with some cool
slides that you can check out,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.856
and also available are
these little mystery

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:11.100
hidden picture slides.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.400
They've got codes in them.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.400
If you find the codes
and rearrange them,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.100
you can let us know
what code you found,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.720
and get some really cool.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.200
Everything you need for,
the kit comes with it,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.100
and you can just assemble it,
cut all the pieces.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.700
It even has a cool
decorative sticker.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.400
You can slap that on wherever
you think it's necessary.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.900
All the instructions
are included.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.560
Plus, of course,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.500
we've got our video showing you
how to build it,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.107
and some fun things
you can do with it.

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:33.038
You can click the link

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.900
in the description below
to go get yours now.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.560
Okay, we've got
all thousand eggs opened up.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.200
Calli's curious what happens
when you bite it?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.100
I know we like to
taste things but...

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.200
It's crunchy.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.960
Crunchy?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.980
Bite it.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.300
Let's see if we can get--

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300
I want to see if it glitter light.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.460
This is quite a work out.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.780
Okay, once you mix it, it's--

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.000
That's a decent gold.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.650
I am disappointed that it's got
these pieces of glitter,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.900
not because of the color,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.532
but because they leave
these like speckles,

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:09.600
so it's not
perfectly smooth gold.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.676
No, it contaminated
our glow-in-the-dark.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.300
Silly putty bonds
to silly putty.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.900
Except however for
this blob of blue.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.100
For some reason,
this one particular blob.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.200
I squished it together
as much as I could,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.800
and it's still just like yeah...

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.222
This color doesn't like
to bond together very much.

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:28.401
So I'm gonna have to work
that for quite a while

00:03:28.401 --> 00:03:29.700
before it's all single blob,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.300
instead of lots of blobs, barely
holding themselves together.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.080
Okay.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.200
I've got a bowl
of pretty warm water.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.700
I'm just going to take
a big old blob of this blue.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.100
Throw it in there.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.600
I'll let that sit and warm up,
and see what changes.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.100
So Nate put his silly
putty in hot water.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.720
Let me try and microwave it.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.080
I think it's burning.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.340
No? Okay.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.540
That I wonder.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.400
Oh, no.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.400
This is giving
me war flashbacks,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.100
because you know
what this feels like?

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.976
Chewing gum.

00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:59.900
This is very soft
and uncomfortably warm,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.520
even if I stop moving like...

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.800
Yeah.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.400
It gets the point
where it's burning.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.358
But it is much
softer, stringier.

00:04:05.358 --> 00:04:07.500
So this one's probably
won't glow as

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.149
much as the other two actual
glow-in-the-dark silly putty's

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.700
because I did mix it with gold.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.000
But let's see.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.314
This one is already
glowing just from daylight,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.700
just kind of cool here.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.800
Sort of see that it's brighter.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.900
So if you mix this
with another color,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.855
will it stll glow?

00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:23.267
Yeah, I would assume so,

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:25.400
but I want to know
if it glows the less,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.700
or about the same.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.300
All right.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.100
That fades so quickly.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.971
So it's bright,

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.635
but only for about
half a second.

00:04:33.635 --> 00:04:35.300
Just from the edge of the light.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.600
This one's still glowing.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.000
It's just fascinating.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.100
All right, obviously hold
it's glow much much better.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.000
So if you mix

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.486
your silly putty with
a glow-in-the-dark silly putty,

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.400
it's not going to be
nearly as effective.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.900
Silly putty from the warm water.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.107
It was just a bowl
of water sitting there.

00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:55.100
So it starts to cool
off a little bit.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.458
But for the most part,

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:59.300
I think it warmed up at
least the outside layer

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.326
of our silly putty.

00:05:00.326 --> 00:05:02.000
This is a big heavy blob of it,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.707
and so I don't think
all the water heated

00:05:03.707 --> 00:05:04.696
up all the way through,

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:05.996
but especially in the spot

00:05:05.996 --> 00:05:08.253
where it's thinner,
I think it did, you know,

00:05:08.253 --> 00:05:09.500
it softened it a little bit.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.200
I think it's a little
bit more malleable.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.400
Pretty minor change.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.800
Oh, it does actually
look a little bit whiter.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.411
I think it almost bleached
out some color maybe.

00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:18.000
All right.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.250
I'm going to go ahead and try
and take a few strands

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.000
of every color,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.694
and just sort of twist
them together just

00:05:22.694 --> 00:05:24.600
'cause want to know
what color we end up with.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:47.580
[Music]

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.200
I'm assuming they
look like a mess.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.800
First, a rainbow,
and then I'm a mess.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.200
My vote is on ugly
brownish grayish.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.400
All right, so...

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.600
[Music]

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.700
This reminds me of one
of those little clicky pens,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.800
where you can like choose
what color you want

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.900
to use in your pen.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.800
Kind of fun.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.980
[Music]

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.780
Okay before I mix
it any further,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.460
I want to cut that in half.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.420
[Music]

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.680
That's pretty.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.438
It's kinda like
when you make beads with clay.

00:06:22.438 --> 00:06:24.100
So my hope is

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.840
that we're going to see glow
in the dark streaks in this.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.200
[Music]

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.680
That's awesome.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.300
I like that.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.100
This is for you.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.292
What is that thing?

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:40.496
What is that thing?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.320
It's a morph.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.640
Morph.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.200
A very badly done Morph.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.360
But you know...

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.300
Silly putty, one of

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.900
the most well-known things
about it is the fact that,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.300
especially if you get it
into a ball shape,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.400
it's quite bouncy.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.800
It's a very rubbery substance.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.700
Sometimes, it just
bounces away from you.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.000
So we want to do a test to see

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.075
how much a large blob
of it bounces in comparison

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:02.100
to a small blob.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.300
So we're going to try dropping
them both from the same height,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.199
just off the table,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.900
see which one comes
back up higher.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.100
It's actually pretty similar.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:25.140
[Music]

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.460
All right, starting
with the small one here.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.900
Just going to chuck
it at the ground.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.800
Let's say that
went 12-15 feet up.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.382
Little hard to control.

00:07:38.382 --> 00:07:39.800
It's not perfectly round.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.700
Let's try the big one though.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.180
Here it goes.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.400
I'm gonna start throwing
it fairly gently.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.480
Wow.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.800
Quite a rebound.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:08:00.860
[Music]

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.000
It's got some good bounce.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.100
[Music]

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.800
Got a little deformation here.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.000
I'm not sure exactly
what caused that.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.460
[Music]

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.480
One of the classic tricks
I was always taught

00:08:18.488 --> 00:08:19.600
with silly putty is

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.909
that you can use it to sort
of make a copy of newspapers.

00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:24.800
The ink comes off fairly easily,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.200
and the silly putty supposed
to be able to pick it up.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.000
So let's try a little
small-scale tests here.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.200
Just a little piece
of the comics here,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.800
and just smoosh this down there.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.560
Look at that.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.100
Picture perfect.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:46.860
[Music]

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.600
Here it goes.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.600
That is perfect.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.700
Photocopy in reverse.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.500
But an entire sheet.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.120
[Music]

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.600
Going to wrap some gold
around that mess.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.460
[Music]

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.400
That was very effective.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.000
Yeah.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.800
Fortunately, its own weight
is sort of driving it down.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.100
Wow, it is.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.700
Oh my gosh.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.900
How much does this weigh?

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.888
So one silly putty egg is
approximately 0.37 ounces,

00:09:25.888 --> 00:09:30.735
and we have approximately 1,000
silly putty eggs worth together.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.100
That should give us a total
of almost 25 pounds.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.629
So Nate got to bounce
the green silly putty.

00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:38.799
I think it's my turn.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.320
3, 2, 1.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.800
It bounces.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.100
That's awesome.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.600
Wait, we're going to slam it.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.100
Work out.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.200
Okay, you roll that one.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.160
Yeah.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.620
What was that?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.160
I just wanted to see
what it would do

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.300
if it was spinning.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.000
Got my nearly 25 pound ball.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.000
I'm gonna see what happens
if I stand on it.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.600
And I'll be here
providing support.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.692
Stabilization.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.500
Both mental and physical.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.920
Oh, very nice.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.960
Watch your head.

00:10:22.963 --> 00:10:24.200
You're very tall.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.100
I'm sinking.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.480
[Music]

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.000
Here, I've probably
just gotten a lot

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.860
of dirt into the silly putty.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.980
And possibly a lot
of silly putty

00:10:36.983 --> 00:10:38.900
into the threads of my shoes.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.700
Oh, no.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.500
Are you--

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.800
Are you stuck?

00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:45.600
No, I can get it out.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.200
It just takes
a determined effort.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.100
That's a very clear shoe print.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.000
And now, this silly putty
will be on the floor forever.

00:10:54.015 --> 00:10:54.400
Okay.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.850
I've got a little
sledgehammer here,

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.300
and I've got all
of our silly putty.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.203
I flipped it over so

00:10:58.203 --> 00:11:00.149
my shoe prints are still
on the other side.

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:01.700
Let's see what the hammer does.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.740
[Music]

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.000
It's doing less damage
than your shoes did.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.600
I think it's just the quick impact.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.700
It's just so bouncy that way.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.440
Boink.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.060
See if I just set it here,

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.600
leave it for a second,
then it leaves an imprint.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.600
But if I hit,
like there's almost nothing.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.800
Oh, there's dust.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.600
Nate, what are you doing?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.020
I'm gonna test
the impact resistance.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.800
I mean, it's bouncing
and it hurts a lot less

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.760
than if I hit my hand directly.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.000
I mean, it doesn't hurt,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.571
but it's not really
anything amazing.

00:11:43.571 --> 00:11:45.000
Like it bounces off,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.718
but I'm definitely still
feeling it on my hand.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.300
All right, if he did it,
I've got to do it.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.600
Nope.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.040
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.560
Yeah.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.233
No, not all.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.440
I'm assuming.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.800
I mean, now,
you're attempting,

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.030
but no, nothing.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.900
He's hitting right
on top of my metatarsals.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.000
So I should be able to feel

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.120
that across the bridge
of my foot.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.100
I don't.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.300
The only part of my foot

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.000
that hurts is
the ball of my foot,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.200
where it's impacting
with the tile itself.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.100
That's it.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.468
Like you can feel the bounce,

00:12:16.468 --> 00:12:19.300
but you wouldn't even know that
you're really being impacted.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.100
That's bizarre.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.300
Guys, we have a ton
of silly putty left.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.011
We obviously didn't really
destroy any of it.

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:25.100
So where would it have gone.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.300
But we would love
to hear your ideas.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.000
What should we do
with 25 pounds of silly putty?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.300
This is a lot.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.811
Let us know down
in the comments,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.600
we want your ideas.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.800
Guys, that's not all,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.224
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:40.369
The box at the top takes you
directly to our last video.

00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:41.500
You should go check that out.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.026
The other box shows you
what YouTube think you

00:12:43.026 --> 00:12:43.835
should be watching next.

00:12:43.835 --> 00:12:45.193
And if you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:12:45.193 --> 00:12:46.718
you'll be subscribed
to the channel, that way,

00:12:46.718 --> 00:12:47.663
you never miss a cool video.

00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:49.682
And especially, you're gonna
want to hit that bell so you get

00:12:49.682 --> 00:12:50.527
the notifications about it.

00:12:50.527 --> 00:12:51.467
We'll see you in the next one.

00:12:51.467 --> 00:12:52.000
Talk to you then.
