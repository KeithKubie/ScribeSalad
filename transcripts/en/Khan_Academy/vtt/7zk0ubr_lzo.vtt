SALMAN KHAN: This is Sal here.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.380
And I have Dr. David
Agus visiting the office.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.280
And I want you to
introduce yourself

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.747
because you have kind
of an interesting life.

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:11.330
DAVID AGUS: Interesting
life is scary.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.400
But I'm a professor of
medicine and engineering

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.610
at the University of
Southern California.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.970
I treat cancer patients.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.930
And I have a lab that looks
at new ways and technologies

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.850
to understand and treat cancer.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.380
SALMAN KHAN: And that's what's
really interesting, the fact

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.290
that you're a professor of
both medicine and engineering.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.310
And I guess that's
kind of what we're

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.620
going to touch on
a little bit here.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.350
DAVID AGUS: Yeah.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.156
SALMAN KHAN: And so this is
clearly a picture of eggs.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.280
Why are we looking at eggs?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.270
DAVID AGUS: Well, if
I gave you those eggs,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.560
and I put them in your
office, and I say come back

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.060
in three weeks,
what would you have?

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:41.980
SALMAN KHAN: They would go bad.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.500
I'm not putting them in
a fridge, I'm assuming.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.850
I'm just--

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.350
DAVID AGUS: You'd
have a rotten egg.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.850
Exactly.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.740
But if I was clever and
I changed the temperature

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.400
in your office to 99.5%
degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.260
and I rotated those
eggs three times,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.730
it has to be an odd number,
then at the end of three weeks,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.947
I'd have a chicken.

00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:01.030
SALMAN KHAN: So that's
what this other picture is.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.270
You'd have this.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.890
So you could either
have a rotten egg,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.000
so this kind of crazy
mess, smelly thing, or you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.324
have this cute,
adorable chicken.

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:12.240
DAVID AGUS: Although
they call babies, chicks.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.150
SALMAN KHAN: Chicks, or chick.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.650
Yes.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.316
DAVID AGUS: Yes.

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:18.830
So a small change in
temperature and gravity

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.154
goes from chaos to order.

00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:21.945
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:22.220
Right.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.803
DAVID AGUS: And so
we're going to talk

00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:26.540
in a minute about cancer
and all the chaos that's

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.710
involved with it.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.740
But realize that
that egg, I changed

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.310
the temperature and the gravity
and I went from chaos to order.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.300
So while will it seem
incomprehensible and unable

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.800
to model cancer,
you're going to start

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.379
to see little changes
can have a major effects.

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:42.170
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.450
And this is what's a
little bit unintuitive.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.265
So when think about
things like cancer,

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:47.390
I mean cancer is
not the only one,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.472
we imagine that we just have
to kind of-- we have to kill it

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:52.430
or we just have to kind
of have to take it out.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.179
But what are saying
is, hey, maybe there's

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.735
these subtle things, analogous
to rotating an egg three times

00:01:57.735 --> 00:01:59.360
and getting the
temperature just right,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.737
that can make it automatically
do different things.

00:02:01.737 --> 00:02:02.570
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.180
To me, cancer is a
verb, not a noun.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.862
So you're "cancering"--

00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:07.820
SALMAN KHAN: Cancering.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.278
DAVID AGUS: --when
you have cancer.

00:02:09.278 --> 00:02:11.920
It's not that you have
cancer, you're cancering.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.880
And so my goal is to change
your state of your body

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.765
from a cancering to a healthing.

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:21.470
And so the first question is
how do you quantity the state?

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.990
How do we say who
and what you are?

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.740
And so technology is
giving us the opportunity

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.939
to do that as we go forward.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:28.730
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.930
I just want to get my head
around that because you never

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.050
hear that word "cancering."

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.258
I think you probably invented
that word, [INAUDIBLE],

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.460
or healthing.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.114
Once again, when
I imagine cancer,

00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:40.030
I think this is the way
most researchers think

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.000
about cancers, is
the set of cells

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.400
that have just gone berserk.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.240
And you have to remove them or
kill them somehow or stop them

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.337
from spreading.

00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:48.920
And what you're
saying is, no, there's

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.670
something going on systemically
in your body that is cancering.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.550
It's allowing the
cancer to thrive.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.466
DAVID AGUS: That's it.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.990
So your first
definition of something

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.929
you have to cut out, a different
organism, that's bacteria.

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:01.720
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.053
DAVID AGUS: That's an infection.

00:03:03.053 --> 00:03:05.410
So if something from the
outside comes inside of you,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.983
I give you the
right antibiotic, it

00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:09.316
doesn't care if you're a man
or a woman, you're six feet

00:03:09.316 --> 00:03:11.560
or you're three feet,
if that antibiotic

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.350
targets the bacteria,
it goes away.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.580
The difference in cancer,
it's your own cells

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.770
that have gone a
little bit crazy.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.690
And so we have to
change the interaction

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.540
of the body and
the cells in order

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.200
to make that patient better.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.820
Very different than something
without, this is within.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.940
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.360
In other words, I'm
just-- it's fascinating

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.510
because there's all sorts
of parallels in, I guess,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.460
everyday life, depending
on what you believe.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.660
But some people, if
there's crime in an area,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.868
there's one point of view
that you need to police it.

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:40.860
You have to arrest
all the criminals.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.320
But then, hey,
maybe the criminals

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.370
keep coming because there's
certain environmental factors.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.990
Maybe there's just
a lot of poverty

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.240
and there's lack of education.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.600
And so you're saying, hey,
let's look at the things

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.220
systemically, as
opposed to just--

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.053
DAVID AGUS: Hunting.

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:54.550
Put some lights in the area,
put some police driving by.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.520
But all of a sudden, the
crime level goes down.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.830
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.329
Right.

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.397
It's not just about
arresting the criminals.

00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:00.230
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.980
SALMAN KHAN: It's about
preventing the crime.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.295
DAVID AGUS: Let me tell you
about a clinical trial that

00:04:02.295 --> 00:04:03.295
was done a couple years.

00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:05.305
It's the coolest clinical trial.

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:07.414
And they took women
after optimal therapy

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.830
for breast cancer,
these they were

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.720
women who were
premenopausal, so really

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.450
aggressive breast cancer.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.230
Half of them, after
treatment, got placebo.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.519
And half of them got a
drug that builds bone.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.200
SALMAN KHAN:
Interesting [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.240
Let me write this down.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.470
So this is breast cancer.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.390
So these are people--

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.330
DAVID AGUS: These are young
women with breast cancer.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.121
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:25.380
Right.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.250
And half got a placebo, which
means just like a sugar pill.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.650
DAVID AGUS: Sugar pill.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.960
SALMAN KHAN: And then
you give that to patients

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.040
just to make them think that
they might-- because sometimes

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.600
the psychological
impact [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.060
DAVID AGUS: And
this was ethical.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.610
And it's very important to talk
about whether it was ethical

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.110
or not.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.568
It was ethical
because they already

00:04:38.568 --> 00:04:40.530
got their treatment
for breast cancer.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.330
And normally in those
women, we just wait.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.538
And hopefully, they're cured.

00:04:43.538 --> 00:04:45.130
And we see if it may recur.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.360
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.734
DAVID AGUS: So in those women,
we divided them into half.

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:48.920
And we gave this pill.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.230
It was a placebo.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.640
And half, we give a drug for
osteoporosis that builds bone.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.057
SALMAN KHAN:
Osteoporosis, osteo--

00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:58.056
DAVID AGUS: You say, why
are you wasting someone

00:04:58.056 --> 00:04:59.810
with breast cancer's
time by giving them

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.259
a drug that targets bone.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.050
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.310
Right.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.809
Right.

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.680
DAVID AGUS: The reason is breast
cancer metastasizes to bone.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.690
SALMAN KHAN: And
it metastasizes, it

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.500
spreads to bone.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.810
DAVID AGUS: It spreads to bone.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.300
SALMAN KHAN: And that's when
cancer just goes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310
DAVID AGUS: Right.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.143
It goes to the bone.

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:12.410
It likes the bone.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.832
So the argument, if I change
the soil, the seed won't grow.

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:17.540
Because remember, when
you have a garden,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.460
you can give your
fertilizer or make that soil

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.110
so those tomato plants love it.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.110
SALMAN KHAN: Right,
right, right.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.350
DAVID AGUS: And so that's
what we're doing here.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.899
We're making the bone different.

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:25.690
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.350
And so once again,
the system thinking

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.600
is that before, if you have
these breast cancer cells that

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.980
are just growing, the view
is, hey, let's irradiate them.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.952
Let's slice them out.

00:05:34.952 --> 00:05:37.160
Let's get chemicals that
will be toxic to these cells

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.940
and kill them.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.330
What you're saying is
cancer really starts

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.755
to become a real
negative once it spreads.

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:44.380
And what you're saying
is let's keep it

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.470
from spreading maybe where
it's the most common to

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.710
spread, which is in the bone.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.930
So before the bone
drug, the cancer spread.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.450
The cancer could kind
of take root in the bone

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.880
and then start spreading
and metastasizing.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.059
This is what metastasis is.

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.850
DAVID AGUS: Um-huh.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.725
SALMAN KHAN: And instead,
you're saying maybe

00:06:01.725 --> 00:06:04.540
if you have this special
drugs, this osteoporosis drug,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.620
it makes the bone that
much stronger and less

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.280
susceptible to
this type of thing.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.597
And then that won't
be able to happen.

00:06:10.597 --> 00:06:11.430
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.770
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.270
Right.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.780
Fascinating.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.640
DAVID AGUS: So at the
end of that trial,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.920
the cancer recurrence
was reduced by 40%.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.782
SALMAN KHAN: Wow.

00:06:18.782 --> 00:06:21.240
DAVID AGUS: At the end of that
trial, new breast cancer, so

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.150
a separate breast
cancer-- because once

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.720
you have one breast cancer,
you can get another breast

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.062
cancer-- that was down by 35%,

00:06:28.062 --> 00:06:28.770
SALMAN KHAN: Wow.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.815
DAVID AGUS: So this notion
of changing the system--

00:06:30.815 --> 00:06:32.856
because remember, this is
a drug that didn't even

00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:35.730
touch the breast cancer--
had a dramatic effect

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.600
in the survival of
these young women.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.940
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.190
Right.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.648
DAVID AGUS: So
again, it just makes

00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:42.179
this a whole new way of
thinking about disease.

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.970
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.110
Right.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.810
So if we were putting
words on things, the way

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.990
that most people think
about disease right now,

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.485
you call it kind of a
reductionist, where they're

00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:54.360
just going to focus on
one narrow part of it.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.090
They're trying to focus on
this thing right over here.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.299
And you're advocating for
kind of a more systemic way

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:00.840
of thinking about
it, where you think

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.540
about everything that
this might involve

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.340
or that might affect it.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.970
DAVID AGUS: It's so wild is that
for the last several decades,

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.630
we're trying to focus on the
individual cell, and then

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.420
the individual gene, and
then the piece of the gene.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.380
And we forgot to
take that step back

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.550
and look at the whole system.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.040
And so remember, the
cancer is your normal cell

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.790
that's gone a little bit crazy.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.270
So we have to model
that whole system

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.462
and figure out a way to control
it so the cancer won't like it.

00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:27.170
SALMAN KHAN: Wow.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.720
Fascinating.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.340
Fascinating.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.540
And then we have pictures
of what some of these things

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.090
look like.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.600
So what is this right over here?

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.750
DAVID AGUS: So this is a liver
that's taken out of a patient.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.150
And the white spots
there are colon cancer

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.019
that's metathesizes,
again spread to the liver.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:42.810
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.840
So it's a cancer that
grew up in the colon.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.000
And at some point, it was able
to spread and kind of liberate

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.850
itself and then attach
on to the liver.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.420
And it's metastasized
to the liver.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.520
And now, it's kind of growing
in this-- it looks, at least

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.380
from this picture, kind of
a cauliflower-like shape.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.461
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:07:57.461 --> 00:07:57.960
Exactly.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.120
And then if I showed this
to a surgeon, or someone who

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.010
normally operates
on livers, they

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.070
would know right away, hey, that
looks like colon cancer gone

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.740
to liver.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.310
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:07.640
Right.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.223
SALMAN KHAN: And if you look at
the next picture on the right,

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:13.390
that's colon cancer inside of a
lymph node under a microscope.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.374
SALMAN KHAN: And
these are the lymph?

00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:17.040
DAVID AGUS: Those are
the normal lymphs.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.530
SALMAN KHAN: Lymphs.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.740
And this right here
is the colon cancer?

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.450
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:19.790
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.490
DAVID AGUS: And so
any pathologist would

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.156
look under a microscope and they
would make a diagnosis and say,

00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:27.500
hey, this looks like colon
cancer gone to the lymph.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.050
And in the bottom
is a different way

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.030
of looking at cancer,
which is a CAT scan.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.679
So this is basically a
three-dimensional X-ray.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.400
I took a slice
right in the middle

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.030
that person's body and those
translucent areas in the middle

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.030
there are colon
cancer metastasis.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.780
SALMAN KHAN: This?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.280
DAVID AGUS: Those
darker areas, yes.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.427
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:47.010
DAVID AGUS: And so
what's amazing is--

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.760
SALMAN KHAN: That's
in their liver.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.370
DAVID AGUS: Colon cancer looks
a certain way, in a lymph node,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.600
in the liver, on a CAT scan.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.650
And it always looks that way.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.060
The body doesn't care what
the underlying genetics are

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.930
because the genetics are
dramatically different patient,

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.400
to patient, to patient.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.729
But it always looks the same.

00:09:02.729 --> 00:09:03.520
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.970
DAVID AGUS: So
somehow, evolution

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.810
is selecting out for phenotype,
which is what things look like,

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.570
not necessarily for genotype.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.250
SALMAN KHAN: Which
is their actual--

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.857
the DNA that makes
up what they are.

00:09:12.857 --> 00:09:13.690
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.405
And so we're
focusing on genotype.

00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:17.840
And genotype is very
important and it's

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.970
going to give us some
understanding over time.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.880
But we have to also
take that step back

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.510
and look at the phenotype, and
look at what it looks like,

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.000
and try to change
those interactions.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.350
Remember, if a patient
has early cancer,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.200
we've learned a lot
in the last 10 years.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.110
So if you have early
cancer, and I cure you

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.960
with surgery, the day
before surgery I can always

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.572
find cancer cells
in the blood,--

00:09:38.572 --> 00:09:39.280
SALMAN KHAN: Wow.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.950
DAVID AGUS: --even
though you were cured.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.320
So the old days,
we thought, well,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.695
you have to wait till it goes
out through our bloodstream

00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:45.860
and gets out there.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.040
That's wrong.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.659
It's can it live outside
that original organ?

00:09:49.659 --> 00:09:50.450
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.940
So there's someone who's
cured or they're not

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.070
cancering right now.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.640
And there is actually
cancer in their blood.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.300
But because they're
healthy now, or healthier,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.800
or they're healhing, or I guess
however you want to call it,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.090
that cancer isn't
able to take hold.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.960
DAVID AGUS: And
those cells, they

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.390
can't live anywhere
but the colon.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:05.990
SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.270
DAVID AGUS: So listen
to this experiment.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.620
This is the wildest experiment.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.780
They took a mouse.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.120
And they took breast
cancer and they put it

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.400
in the left breast
and the right breast.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.330
And they colored them
red and green, the cells.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.590
They waited a day,
they went back,

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.130
and the cells were half
red, half green; half red,

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.210
half green.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.690
Because we always
thought if cancer

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.522
is something in one
local spot, it really

00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:29.730
is a disease that keep going
through the bloodstream.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.010
And it likes those breasts.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.720
That's why it keeps
going back there.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.030
SALMAN KHAN: So interesting.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.613
And when I always
think of metastases,

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:36.370
and I can never say
is the word, I always

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.890
imagine it, OK, that's
the cancer that's

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.360
finally gotten to
the lymph network.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.050
It's finally gotten to the blood
vessels and now it's spreading

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.924
But you're saying that
there's actually often

00:10:42.924 --> 00:10:45.680
cancer that has gotten
to the transportation

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.890
networks of the body.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.575
But it has still
not metastasized

00:10:48.575 --> 00:10:50.200
because it's not able
to take hold yet.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.080
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.470
SALMAN KHAN: That's fascinating.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.880
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.890
And over time, we're going
to get the technology

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.560
to interrogate those cells
to say, hey, this one

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.870
can take hold here.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.412
Therefore, I have to change
where it would take hold.

00:11:00.412 --> 00:11:02.620
We're just at the beginning
of that technology that's

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.790
going to change everything.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.331
SALMAN KHAN: And
the reason why we're

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.450
looking at these, the
fact that colon cancer

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.450
starts in the colon and this
is how it looks when it spreads

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.533
to different parts of the
body, what you're saying

00:11:11.533 --> 00:11:16.430
is that we shouldn't maybe
be so fixated on just

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.066
the DNA of colon
cancer because it

00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:21.190
can be very different from
one patient to the next.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.154
But maybe on kind of
its macrobehavior,

00:11:23.154 --> 00:11:25.070
it's phenotype, how it
looks, and how behaves.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.980
And that way,
it'll give us clues

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.377
maybe on how we can change it.

00:11:29.377 --> 00:11:30.210
DAVID AGUS: Exactly.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:30.910
SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.430
Thanks a bunch.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.471
This is very interesting.

00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:33.960
DAVID AGUS: It's great.
