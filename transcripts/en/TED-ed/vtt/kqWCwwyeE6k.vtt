00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.568
By now, I'm sure you know

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:17.540
that in just about anything you do in life,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.246
you need numbers.

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:20.273
In particular, though,

00:00:20.273 --> 00:00:22.502
some fields don't just need a few numbers,

00:00:22.502 --> 00:00:24.222
they need lots of them.

00:00:24.222 --> 00:00:26.248
How do you keep track of all those numbers?

00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:28.164
Well, mathematicians dating back

00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:30.129
as early as ancient China

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.571
came up with a way to represent

00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:34.148
arrays of many numbers at once.

00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:37.322
Nowadays we call such an array a "matrix,"

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:40.059
and many of them hanging out together, "matrices".

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.620
Matrices are everywhere.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.555
They are all around us,

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:47.891
even now in this very room.

00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:49.784
Sorry, let's get back on track.

00:00:49.784 --> 00:00:51.762
Matrices really are everywhere, though.

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.073
They are used in business,

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:54.198
economics,

00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:54.988
cryptography,

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.198
physics,

00:00:56.198 --> 00:00:57.301
electronics,

00:00:57.301 --> 00:00:59.269
and computer graphics.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.537
One reason matrices are so cool

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:04.314
is that we can pack so much information into them

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.588
and then turn a huge series of different problems

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.551
into one single problem.

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:13.262
So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work.

00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:15.172
It turns out, you can treat matrices

00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:16.682
just like regular numbers.

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:17.309
You can add them,

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:18.038
subtract them,

00:01:18.038 --> 00:01:19.698
even multiply them.

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:20.915
You can't divide them,

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:22.890
but that's a rabbit hole of its own.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.972
Adding matrices is pretty simple.

00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:27.195
All you have to do is add the corresponding entries

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:28.597
in the order they come.

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:30.457
So the first entries get added together,

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.276
the second entries,

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:31.963
the third,

00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:33.494
all the way down.

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.740
Of course, your matrices have to be the same size,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.817
but that's pretty intuitive anyway.

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:39.861
You can also multiply the whole matrix

00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:42.207
by a number, called a scalar.

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:45.183
Just multiply every entry by that number.

00:01:45.183 --> 00:01:47.173
But wait, there's more!

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:51.373
You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix.

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:52.597
It's not like adding them, though,

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:54.186
where you do it entry by entry.

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:55.396
It's more unique

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.466
and pretty cool once you get the hang of it.

00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:58.616
Here's how it works.

00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:01.053
Let's say you have two matrices.

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.841
Let's make them both two by two,

00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:05.385
meaning two rows by two columns.

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:07.590
Write the first matrix to the left

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.475
and the second matrix goes next to it

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:10.785
and translated up a bit,

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:12.576
kind of like we are making a table.

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:15.401
The product we get when we multiply the matrices together

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.897
will go right between them.

00:02:16.897 --> 00:02:20.641
We'll also draw some gridlines to help us along.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.203
Now, look at the first row of the first matrix

00:02:24.203 --> 00:02:26.951
and the first column of the second matrix.

00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:28.962
See how there's two numbers in each?

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:31.419
Multiply the first number in the row

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.750
by the first number in the column:

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.930
1 times 2 is 2.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.547
Now do the next ones:

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:39.469
3 times 3 is 9.

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.040
Now add them up:

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.451
2 plus 9 is 11.

00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.038
Let's put that number in the top-left position

00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:48.053
so that it matches up with the rows and columns

00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:49.308
we used to get it.

00:02:49.308 --> 00:02:50.725
See how that works?

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:53.569
You can do the same thing to get the other entries.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.578
-4 plus 0 is -4.

00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:01.539
4 plus -3 is 1.

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.147
-8 plus 0 is -8.

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:07.383
So, here's your answer.

00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:09.218
Not all that bad, is it?

00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:10.917
There's one catch, though.

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:12.505
Just like with addition,

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:15.265
your matrices have to be the right size.

00:03:15.265 --> 00:03:17.927
Look at these two matrices.

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:20.688
2 times 8 is 16.

00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:23.434
3 times 4 is 12.

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:25.109
3 times

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.807
wait a minute,

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:28.876
there are no more rows in the second matrix.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:30.328
We ran out of room.

00:03:30.328 --> 00:03:33.236
So, these matrices can't be multiplied.

00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:35.957
The number of columns in the first matrix

00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:39.509
has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix.

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:40.522
As long as you're careful

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:42.385
to match up your dimensions right, though,

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:43.687
it's pretty easy.

00:03:43.687 --> 00:03:45.499
Understanding matrix multiplication

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:46.990
is just the beginning, by the way.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.697
There's so much you can do with them.

00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:50.499
For example, let's say you want

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.421
to encrypt a secret message.

00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.588
Let's say it's "Math rules".

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:56.917
Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.283
is beyond me.

00:03:58.283 --> 00:03:59.641
Letting numbers stand for letters,

00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:01.360
you can put the numbers in a matrix

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.904
and then an encryption key in another.

00:04:03.904 --> 00:04:04.785
Multiply them together

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:07.118
and you've got a new encoded matrix.

00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:09.347
The only way to decode the new matrix

00:04:09.347 --> 00:04:10.520
and read the message

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.128
is to have the key,

00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:13.936
that second matrix.

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:15.372
There's even a branch of mathematics

00:04:15.372 --> 00:04:17.230
that uses matrices constantly,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.876
called Linear Algebra.

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:21.130
If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.966
do it, it's pretty awesome.

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:24.352
But just remember,

00:04:24.352 --> 00:04:26.439
once you know how to use matrices,

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.893
you can do pretty much anything.
