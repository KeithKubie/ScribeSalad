00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here's one way to define how many days.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We have our initial definition of days&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;month.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're going to define a procedure, how&lt;u&gt;many&lt;/u&gt;days.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And it takes one number's input.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We'll call that the month.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And what we want to do is return the number of days in that month.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can find that by indexing into the days&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;month list,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we want the element that corresponds to the month that was passed in.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That isn't the element of the month directly because

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
elements in the list start from 0, months start from 1.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We need to subtract 1 from month to get the correct element.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's try that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We'll print the number of days in month 1, which is January.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And we run, and we get 31.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's try month 9, which is September,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we run and get 30.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What happens if we pass in, say,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
a number that's not a valid month?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's say we pass in 13.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now we run this, and what we get is an error,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and you can see what the error is.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's complaining that the list index is out of range.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That means we've tried to find an element in a list that doesn't exist,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and we did it exactly at this point where we're returning days&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;month of month - 1,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and the value of month was 13.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There's no element at position 12 because days&lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;month

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
only has 12 elements.
