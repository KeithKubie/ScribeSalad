so we have to look at number two

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
so we have to look at number two
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990
so we have to look at number two
and number two the situation is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
and number two the situation is
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.789
and number two the situation is
completely different it doesn't matter

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
completely different it doesn't matter
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.620

changing the funding environment so the
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.990
changing the funding environment so the
work will be done more quickly

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
work will be done more quickly
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.390

get this stuff to happen and from a
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850
get this stuff to happen and from a
purely health point of view that's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
purely health point of view that's
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.870
