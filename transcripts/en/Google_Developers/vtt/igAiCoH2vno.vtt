TIM ANDERSON: Hi, and welcome
to Tech Tips from Teachers.

00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:05.400
On this episode, we'll be
looking at creation tool apps.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.370
Our guest today is
Elizabeth Calhoon

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.340
from San Jose, California.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.910
Elizabeth currently
serves as the manager

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.000
of educational technology
for a large Bay Area

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.220
office of education,
and previously

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.370
was a high school
teacher, and also

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.480
served as vice principal
for a middle school

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.960
and a high school.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.210
She also holds a Master's
in Educational Leadership.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.335
So Elizabeth, why is technology
so important in the classroom?

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:31.210
ELIZABETH CALHOON:
Technology opens the doors

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.800
for kids around the world.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.840
It opens the doors
to information.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.890
It opens the doors
to other teachers,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.270
as well as to other
students, so that they can

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.155
learn from and with the world.

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:44.530
TIM ANDERSON: And then with
the creation piece of things,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.259
how does technology
help to enable that?

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:48.550
ELIZABETH CALHOON: Well, the
best part about technology

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.830
now is that it's not
just about consumption.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.260
It's that you can, in fact,
create, and anyone can create.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.159
And so students now can
feel empowered by the fact

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:58.950
that they can learn
all of this information

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.261
from around the world,
take it in, and then create

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.510
so that they can contribute
to the world's information

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.010
as well.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.634
TIM ANDERSON: We've
heard from teachers

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:09.290
that there a few key components
that make creation tool

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.930
apps especially applicable
to the classroom.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.700
It's important that
they're versatile,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.450
that they make sharing
easy, and that they

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.580
have simple, easy to
use user interfaces.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.170
Why is it so important
that apps are

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.337
versatile for classroom use?

00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:23.378
ELIZABETH CALHOON: Because
classroom environments

00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:23.990
are versatile.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.059
And a teacher's
environment, depending on

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:29.850
whether they're working
with a first grader

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.810
or they're working with a
third grader or a sixth grader,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.730
is going to change on a
regular, perhaps daily, basis.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.400
And so they need
to be able to have

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.780
an app that they're presenting
to their students that

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.510
has longevity and
that they as a teacher

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.030
can use across grade
levels, in addition

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.840
to developmental levels.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.020
Finally, I think the
reason versatility

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.360
is really important is
because a lot of teachers

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.232
are making lots of
movement towards being

00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:56.690
collaborative with
their colleagues

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.430
across content areas.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.304
So I may be an English
teacher, but I really

00:02:00.304 --> 00:02:02.220
want to do some work
with the science teacher.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.030
I want an app that's going to
be able to bridge those two

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.445
content areas and we
can work with together.

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:08.320
TIM ANDERSON: Gotcha.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.100
That makes sense.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.650
And then with that
sharing piece,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.429
why is that something
that's so critical?

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:13.970
ELIZABETH CALHOON:
For teachers to be

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.940
able to have an app where a
student creates something in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.320
and then they're able to share
it among any of those programs

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.736
is hugely important.

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:25.110
The teacher
shouldn't be spending

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.080
time trying to figure
out the mechanics

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.859
of how do I export this, and
how do I make this meaningful?

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.150
How do I share it with parents?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.790
How do I share
with the community?

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.780
Those are the really
rich experiences,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.260
being able to share it
with a larger community.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.960
But if the teacher
can't even get it out

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.380
of the device in
the first place,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.400
or put it into a program they
already have in their district,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.177
they're not going to use it.

00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:46.760
TIM ANDERSON: And
then that last point

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.340
about having a really
simple, easy to use UI.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.590
Why is that something that
you would urge developers

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.592
to put at the forefront?

00:02:53.592 --> 00:02:55.800
ELIZABETH CALHOON: Everything
we give to our students

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.540
is vetted through us first.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.280
We look at movies
before we show them.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.280
We try to play with an app
before we give it to a student.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.810
And one of the pieces that I see
teachers do time and time again

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.920
is that if somebody
hasn't walked them

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.181
through a complicated
application, sometimes

00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:16.180
they're not willing to
give it to their student,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.700
because they need to feel
comfortable with it first.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.116
TIM ANDERSON: Elizabeth, tell
us about Explain Everything.

00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:22.117
Why is it so great?

00:03:22.117 --> 00:03:23.950
ELIZABETH CARLTON: It
is so fantastic mostly

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.930
because it is so versatile.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.580
One of the great use
cases that I've seen

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.240
is with elementary students.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.340
The teacher will create
a sample and then

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.420
show that to the students for
them to then recreate or create

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.760
their own version of.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.490
It encourages group work.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.300
It encourages them
to work together

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.070
to pull in from a variety
of different sources.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.260
It also allows for
this cross pollination

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.630
between content areas.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.280
So if I'm an English
teacher, again,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.190
I want to work with
a science teacher,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.690
Explain Everything
is going to cross

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.230
those boundaries no problem.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.813
TIM ANDERSON: What
about Book Creator.

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:02.355
In this sea of creation tools,
what makes that app stand out?

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.312
ELIZABETH CALHOON: So
Book Creator's really fun

00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:06.110
because you're creating a book.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.820
It has this wonderful
sharing capability

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.502
that provides for teachers to
be able to share with students,

00:04:13.502 --> 00:04:15.460
students to share with
other students, and then

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.560
ultimately, for
students to share

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.630
their books with the parents
or the community at large.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.170
And their knowledge
and their learning

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.280
then becomes very
transparent and public.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.363
TIM ANDERSON: And then
what about Comic Strip It!?

00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:29.480
What makes that such a
nice fit for the classroom?

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.980
ELIZABETH CALHOON:
One of the things

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.880
that's great about it is that
you have to actually synthesize

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.390
a bunch of information in
order to create a comic strip.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.890
And that can be a
difficult mental process

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.090
to go through to synthesize
information and make

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.420
it very concise.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.260
And so the cleaner
the user interface

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.160
is when you're creating
something as complicated

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.430
as that process can be,
the better the result is

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.930
going to be.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.180
So with Comic Strip It!, you're
able to take the information,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.990
put it in a nice,
neat little box.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.270
And you have fun doing it.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.690
TIM ANDERSON: Elizabeth, thanks
so much for joining us today.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.710
It was great having you.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.410
ELIZABETH CALHOON:
Sure, thank you.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.440
Thanks for having me.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.130
TIM ANDERSON: And to
recap, with creation tools

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.520
in the classroom, a couple of
key things to keep in mind.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.520
It's important that
these apps are versatile,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.790
that they make sharing easy,
and that they have simple user

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.810
interfaces.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.400
