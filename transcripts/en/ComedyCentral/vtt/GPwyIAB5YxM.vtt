00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.904
I'VE RUN INTO A SURPRISING
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:05.839
I SEEM TO RUB THE WRONG WAY.
- TAKE YOUR PIZZA

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:06.840
AND STICK IT UP YOUR ASS.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.008
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.376
YOU REMIND ME OF THE WIZARD
OF LONELINESS.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.613
[not audible]
[pleasant music playing]

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:15.616
- I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT IS,
BUT I KNOW THAT AS A TV HOST

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:19.653
HAVING A PERSONALITY THAT PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE IS BAD FOR BUSINESS.

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:22.122
AND THAT'S WHY
I NEEDED TO MAKE A CHANGE.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.391 line:0%
 
SO FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF
SHOOTING MY SHOW THIS SEASON,

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.593 line:0%
 
I HIRED A FOCUS GROUP
THAT REPRESENTS

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.896 line:0%
 
A CROSS-SECTION
OF AMERICAN SOCIETY

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:31.665 line:0%
 
TO WATCH MY EVERY MOVE
FROM A NEARBY BOX TRUCK.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.834 line:0%
 
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.904 line:0%
 
- WE HAVE THE DOORS.
WE HAVE MAHOGANY WOOD.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.372 line:0%
 
- USING A HIDDEN EAR PIECE,

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.341 line:0%
 
THEY WERE ABLE TO GIVE ME
REAL-TIME FEEDBACK ON THE FLY.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.543
- WE HAVE OAK.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.278
- EXPRESS YOURSELF
WITH YOUR HANDS,

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:45.712
WITH YOUR SHOULDERS,
WITH ANYTHING.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.881
- SO YOU'VE GOT THE BEST PRICES
IN TOWN.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:50.017
THAT WOULD HELP ME BECOME
A MORE LIKABLE HOST.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.785
WOW.
THAT'S REALLY COOL TO HEAR.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.086
- YEAH.
THERE YOU GO.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.255
- THEY TOLD ME HOW TO ENGAGE
WITH MY AUDIENCE MORE.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:00.093
- LIKE 500 MODELS OF DOORS
YOU COULD CHOOSE FROM.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:04.898
- NOW DO YOU MANUFACTURE
ALL THE DOORS IN THIS BUILDING?

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.734
- WE MANUFACTURE MOST OF THEM
IN THIS BUILDING, YES.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.136
- THERE YOU GO.
GOOD JOB.

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.839
- AND THEY ALSO HAD SOME FASHION
TIPS TO MAKE ME MORE RELATABLE.

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.941
- I THINK A V-NECK
WOULD GO WELL WITH YOU.

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.309
- A V-NECK?
REALLY?

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:16.677
- A BLAZER.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.111
A T-SHIRT WITH A BLAZER
MIGHT WORK.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.080
- YEAH. THAT'S SORT OF
A POPULAR STYLE RIGHT NOW.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.181
- YEAH.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.850
- THE ONLY ISSUE
WE ENCOUNTERED EARLY ON

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.918
WAS THAT IT WAS HARD
FOR THE GROUP TO STAY FOCUSED

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.954
WHILE WE WERE MOBILE.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:28.856
- WHOA!
- OHH...

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.624
- BUT WE QUICKLY
FOUND A SOLUTION TO THAT

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.293
BY BOLTING DOWN THE TABLES
AND STRAPPING THEM IN

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.862
WHILE THE TRUCK WAS MOVING.

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:37.464
[wood creaking]

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.667
AS THE WEEK WENT ON,
I WAS ABLE TO EVOLVE MY STYLE

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.103
TO BECOME MORE IN LINE
WITH THEIR TASTES,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.772
AND A MORE LIKABLE ME
WAS STARTING TO TAKE SHAPE.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.841
GOOD TO MEET YOU, MAN.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU TOO.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.778
- SO TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR FOOT MASSAGE PARLOR.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:52.946
- OH, THERE WE GO.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.348
- BODY MOTIONS ARE GREAT.

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:56.350
- WE ALSO DO FACIAL
AND HEAD, TOO.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.486
- NOW, EVERYONE LOVES
A FOOT MASSAGE, RIGHT?

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.321
- OH, GREAT.
HE LOOKED OUT AT THE CAMERA.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.357
- GREAT LOOKING AT THE CAMERA.
GOOD JOB.

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:05.759
- THE GROUP WAS ABSOLUTELY
LOVING WHO I WAS NOW.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.928
NOW, IS THAT A SOAPY WATER
OR IS IT JUST

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:09.796
PLAIN WATER?
- JUST THE WATER, JUST CLEAN,

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.298
PURE--JUST WATER, YES.
- JUST WATER.

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:12.833
WOW.
THAT'S SO INTERESTING.

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:14.835
- THERE YOU GO.
- GOOD! GOOD.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:17.070
- AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS STILL
GETTING USED TO IT,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.174
IT SEEMED LIKE I HAD BECOME
A BETTER VERSION OF ME.

00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:21.942
BUT BEFORE FULLY COMMITTING
TO THIS,

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.577
I WANTED TO PUT
MY NEW PERSONALITY

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.479
THROUGH THE ULTIMATE TEST.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.380
AND WE'LL SEE THAT IN A BIT.
