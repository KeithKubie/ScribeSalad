00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.470
 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.080
In this last segment
of the lecture, we'll

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.050
examine the copyright implications
of employment relationships broadly

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.950
defined.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.910
The United States is more
likely than most countries

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.850
to confer copyrights
on the people who hire

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.159
or commission artists
and authors instead

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.400
of on the artists and
authors themselves.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.280
The main legal tool that enables
employers and hirers to obtain

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.000
copyrights is known in the United
States as the work for hire doctrine.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.300
This is a very important doctrine.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.900
Roughly half of the registered
copyrights in the United States,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.220
which is a rough proxy for commercially
valuable works, are works for hire.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.600
The designation of a particular
copyrighted work as a work for hire

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.500
has several implications, which
are summarized in the map.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.690
First and foremost, the employer or
other person for whom the work for hire

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.980
was prepared, is consider the
author for copyright purposes.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.120
Not the assignee of the true
author's copyright, but the author

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.450
himself or itself.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.190
Next, the modest set of moral
rights that, in the United States,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.080
are provided by the
Visual Artists Rights Act

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.920
do not apply to works for hire.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.650
We've discussed moral rights in rough
terms a couple of times already.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.700
In the eighth week of this course,
we'll consider the Visual Artists Rights

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.870
Act, which implements some of
those rights in the United States.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.610
For the time being, you need to
know only that works for hire

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.550
are entirely exempt from that
portion of the copyright statute.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.790
So, to repeat, roughly half of the
registered copyrights in the United

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.680
States do not give rise
to any moral rights.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.420
 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.490
The rules that we'll
discuss in detail next week

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.419
concerning the termination
of assignments of copyrights

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.450
are likewise inapplicable
to works for hire.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.580
In addition, works for hire are
governed by different rules pertaining

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.520
to duration.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.600
Regular copyrights,
as you now know, last

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.810
for the life of the
author plus 70 years.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.300
By contrast, works for
hire last for 95 years

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.480
from the date they are first
published, or 120 years

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.240
from the date they are
created, whichever is shorter.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.020
Sometimes this will result
in a longer term, sometimes

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.890
a shorter term than a regular
copyright, but it's certainly different.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.420
So that's enough for now.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.610
The main point is that it makes a
big difference whether a copyrighted

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.780
work falls into this special category.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.880
So how does a copyright end
up in this special zone?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.160
There are two routes which
are summarized in the map.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.550
First, work can become
a work for hire if it's

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.130
prepared by an employee within
the scope of his employment.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.050
In such cases, as we've seen,
the employer-- not the employee--

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.360
owns the copyright from its inception.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.210
Second, a work can
become a work for hire

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.400
if it falls into one of
these nine categories

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.320
and if the creators of
the work and the person

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.960
commissioning it agree in writing that
it shall be considered a work for hire.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.110
Here's a key point-- these
two paths are exclusive.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.230
There's no other way that a
work can become a work for hire.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.870
So if a work is not created by an
employee within the scope of his

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.190
employment and does not fall into
one of these nine categories,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.990
it cannot become a work for hire even
if the parties expressly provide as much

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.800
in a contract.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.350
That exclusivity probably
strikes you as odd.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.350
Why should the law deny access
to this particular legal form

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.957
to some sets of parties?

00:04:10.957 --> 00:04:12.790
We'll come back to that
question after we've

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.200
examined these two paths in more detail.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.555
 

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:20.430
The first of the two
paths likely strikes you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.630
as the more intuitively plausible.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.070
Suppose you run a company, you hire
someone, part of that person's job

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.590
is to create copyrightable works.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.020
It's not shocking, at least to most
US residents, that you the employer

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.340
would own the copyright in those works.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.860
Millions of copyrighted works are
born as works for hire in this way.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.300
Their legal status rarely gives rise
to litigation both because it's clear

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.980
and to most observers it
seems both fair and efficient.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.430
When litigation concerning
this first path does arise,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.240
it's usually because the person
who created the work can plausibly

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.760
claim that he's not really an employee.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.230
If he's a traditional salaried employee,
he has no chance of prevailing.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.680
But if his relationship with the
putative employer is more attenuated,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.960
he might.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.000
Until 1989, the legal standards used to
determine whether a creator was truly

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.060
an employee for these
purposes were murky.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.760
Different courts
adopted different rules.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.660
Finally the Supreme Court
attempted to settle the matter.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.640
The case the Supreme Court
chose to clarify the law

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.020
involved interesting facts.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.940
A nonprofit company called CCNV
commissioned a sculptor, named

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.230
James Earl Reid, to prepare a
sculpture commemorating homelessness.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.690
CCNV wanted to display the sculpture on
the mall in the center of Washington DC

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.670
during the holiday season to sensitize
visitors to the plight of the homeless.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.990
CCNV gave Reid a fair amount of
instruction concerning what it wanted.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.160
For example, the sculpture should be a
modern nativity scene in which the Holy

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.650
Family is replaced by
three homeless people,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.070
they should be African
American, they should

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.620
be depicted lying down, not sitting
up or standing, and so forth.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.170
But CCNV left most of the artistic
decisions in Reid's hands.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.570
CCNV paid Reid $15,000 for
his services, but provided him

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:34.210
no other compensation,
employment benefits, or so forth.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.950
Things went well for awhile.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.820
Reid created the sculpture
shown in your screen.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.220
It was indeed displayed
on the mall and seems

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.500
to have been well received
by critics and the public.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.680
But the relationship
between CCNV and Reid

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.820
frayed when CCNV planned to take the
sculpture on tour in other US cities

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.120
in an effort to raise more
money for the homeless.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.720
Reid objected on the grounds
that to say CCNV money,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.230
he had fabricated the sculpture in
a material that could not hold up

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.640
to such a travel schedule and thus
the sculpture would deteriorate

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.430
which would be offensive to him.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.670
This sentiment should remind you of
the stances of Von Gerkan and Snow

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:25.120
who sought to protect their
creations from desecration.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.270
At the time the dispute
arose, the sculpture

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.750
was back in Reid's workshop
for some minor repairs.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.860
Reid refused to turn it over to CCNV.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.820
In response, CCNV brought a
copyright infringement suit.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.640
Now at the threshold you should
notice that this is an odd lawsuit.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.630
There's no question that CCNV owns the
sculpture itself, the physical object.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.860
CCNV commissioned it and paid for it.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.480
CCNV now owns it just as
the person who commissions

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.290
a portrait owns the portrait
once it's delivered.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:06.150
So why didn't CCNV simply demand that
Reid to CCNV the sculpture itself?

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.670
Why did it seek to establish
that in addition it

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.940
owned the copyright in the sculpture?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.330
It's not entirely clear
but probably because CCNV

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.350
wanted to do things with the sculpture
other than show it to people,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.660
perhaps make additional copies of it.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.760
As you know by now,
only the copyright owner

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.570
is permitted to make copies
of the copyrighted work.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.890
In any event, CCNV initiated
litigation and carried

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.900
it all the way to the Supreme Court.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.130
Because Reid actually
made the sculpture,

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.289
he was in a strong
position in this lawsuit.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:48.020
He would seem to be the author and thus,
as we've seen, the copyright owner.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.700
CCNV might have overcome
Reid's presumptive claim

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.310
to the copyright in any of three ways.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.160
First, CCNV could have argued
that one of its trustees,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.650
a man named Mitch Snyder, supervised
Reid's work sufficiently closely

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.880
that-- like Mr. Lindsey
in the Titanic case--

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.320
Snyder, acting on behalf of CCNV,
should be deemed the author.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.750
But as you now know,
to win on this theory,

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.220
you need to exercise very tight control
over the activities of your assistants,

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.364
and Snyder's level of supervision
of Reid didn't come close.

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:26.280
So this wouldn't work.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.800
 

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.730
Second, CCNV might have admitted that
Reid was an independent contractor

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.650
but asserted that the
sculpture was a work for hire

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.680
because it had been
commissioned by CCNV.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.850
But this strategy wouldn't work
for two independent reasons.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.370
First, you'll notice
that sculpture is not

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.050
among the nine types of works
that can become works for hire

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.992
through this path.

00:09:56.992 --> 00:09:58.700
Second, in any event,
the parties had not

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.190
agreed in writing that the
sculpture would be a work for hire,

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.780
thus CCNV was doubly blocked.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.010
The upshot was that CCNV's
only plausible theory

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:15.550
was that Reid had been an employee,
not an independent contractor.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:21.550
If CCNV could classify Reid as an
employee, it could win under path one

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.880
because the sculpture was surely
within the scope of his employment.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:31.010
The hard part was to show
that he had been an employee.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.010
The trial court agreed with
CCNV on this crucial point,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.530
but the Court of Appeals and
eventually the Supreme Court did not.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.790
In the course of
rejecting CCNV's position,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.470
Justice Marshall writing
for the Supreme Court

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.300
announced a new, or
at least a clarified,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.470
test for determining when a person
should be considered an employee.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.890
It's distilled on this slide.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.250
I'll read the key passage
in the court's opinion.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.830
 

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.820
"In determining whether a
hired party is an employee

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.670
under the general common law of agency,
we consider the hiring party's right

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.530
to control the manner and means by
which the product is accomplished.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.260
Among the other factors
relevant to this inquiry

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.660
are the skill required, the source
of the instrumentalities and tools,

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.020
the location of the work, the
duration of the relationship

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.340
between the parties, whether
the hiring party has the right

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.400
to assign additional projects
to the hired party, the extent

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.310
of the hired party's discretion
over when and how long to work,

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.290
the method of payment, the hired party's
role in hiring and paying assistants,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.940
whether the work is part of the
regular business of the hiring party,

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:49.790
whether the hiring party is in business,
the provision of employee benefits,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.110
and the tax treatment
of the hired party.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.990
No one of these factors
is determinative."

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.560
Closed quote.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.620
 

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.210
The Supreme Court then
applied this multi-factor test

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.570
to the facts of the case.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:09.990
All but one of these variables they
concluded tilted in favor of Reid.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.090
Here again is Justice
Marshall's language.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.560
Quote, "True CCNV members
directed enough of Reid's work

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.070
to ensure that he produced a sculpture
that met their specifications,

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.210
but the extent of control
the hiring party exercises

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.200
over the details of the
product is not dispositive.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.160
Indeed, all the other
circumstances weigh heavily

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.960
against finding an
employment relationship.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.970
Reid is a sculptor,
a skilled occupation.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.930
Reid supplied his own tools.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.270
He worked in his own
studio in Baltimore,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.380
making daily supervision
of his activities

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.884
from Washington practically impossible.

00:12:47.884 --> 00:12:49.675
Reid was retained for
less than two months,

00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:52.450
a relatively short period of time.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.250
During and after this
time, CCNV had no right

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.300
to assign additional projects to Reid.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.780
Apart from the deadline for
completing the sculpture,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.790
Reid had absolute freedom to
decide when and how long to work.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:10.880
CCNV paid Reid $15,000, a sum dependent
upon completion of a specific job,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.290
a method by which independent
contractors are often compensated.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.870
Reid had total discretion in
hiring and paying assistants.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.820
Creating sculpture was hardly
regular business for CCNV.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.520
Indeed, CCNV is not a business at all.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.220
Finally, CCNV did not pay
payroll or Social Security taxes,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.330
provide any employee
benefits, or contribute

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.919
to unemployment insurance or
workers' compensation funds."

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:37.460
Closed quote.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.120
 

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.310
Since 1989, courts confronted
with analogous disputes

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.070
have relied on this list
of factors to determine

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.130
whether an artist in
an ambiguous position

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.030
should be considered an employee.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.120
A few lower courts have
tinkered with the test.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.790
For example, in one case the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:05.130
announced that a subset of the factors--
specifically those highlighted in red

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:10.280
on this chart-- are especially important
and should be given extra weight.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.240
But most courts just apply the CCNV
list as the Supreme Court formulated it.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.490
 

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.230
Disputes of this sort have not
arisen terribly often in the past,

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.300
but they're likely to become
more common in the future.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.130
The reason is that in many modern
economies, certainly including

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.010
that of the US, companies
are decreasing their reliance

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.140
on formal salaried employees and
increasing their reliance on people

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.590
whose relationship to the
company is more attenuated.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.090
People hired for short periods of
time not given traditional employment

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.020
benefits and so forth.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.550
In most respects, this trend
is bad for the workers.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.910
But in one respect it's
potentially good for the workers

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.480
and dangerous for the companies.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.040
Namely it increases the chances
that copyrighted works created

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.450
by these workers will not be
classified as works for hire.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.690
Indeed, copyrights in these
works will belong to the workers.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:14.350
Unless and until tell the workers assign
those copyrights to the companies,

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.040
their legal position will be stronger.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.630
Companies, for their part, should
look out for this legal hazard.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.650
 

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:29.780
The second path to work for hire
status seems more clearly marked.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:35.070
As I've already mentioned, if a work
falls into one of these nine categories

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.380
and if the commissioning party secures
a signed written agreement acknowledging

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:44.480
that it shall be deemed a work for
hire, that's the end of the matter.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.340
One industry that relies
heavily and effectively

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:53.130
on this mechanism in the United
States is the film industry.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.150
You'll recall, I hope, this chart
showing the legal relationships

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.810
among the principal
participants in the making

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.670
and distribution of a typical film.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.440
As I discussed in lecture number
three, the creative contributions

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.210
of many people-- screenwriters,
actors, directors, and so forth--

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.290
are pooled into a
single copyrighted work,

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:19.350
namely the audio visual work
corresponding to the finished film.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.450
Ordinarily that copyright
is held by a producer which

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.220
then enters into a distribution
agreement with a studio, which then

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:33.040
issues licenses to the various players
listed at the bottom of this diagram.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.690
There's a risk lurking in this structure
which is probably apparent to you

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.650
now that we've seen how
the Rent case ended up.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.010
The risk is that some of the
contributors to the film listed

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.920
at the top of the diagram
might argue, plausibly,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.340
that they own the copyrights
in the separate things

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.030
they contributed to the
final product and thus

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.480
that the theaters, TV
stations, and so forth shown

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.730
at the bottom of the
diagram can't publicly

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.550
perform the film, in other words,
the film containing their copyrighted

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:09.079
works, without getting
separate licenses from them.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:12.859
To avoid this outcome,
the producer almost always

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.650
obtains a contract from
each of the contributors

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:20.890
designating his or her
contribution as a work for hire.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.349
The result, the producer owns the
copyrights in those contributions

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.770
from their inception.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:33.150
The legal provision that makes all
this possible and now indeed routine

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.400
is shown on the chart.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.780
Notice that one of the nine categories
of works for which signed work

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.660
for hire agreements
are effective consists

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:47.750
of quote, "a part of a motion
picture or other audiovisual work."

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.990
Another industry that purports to
rely on work for hire agreements

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.780
is the recording industry.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.680
You'll also recall this slide, I hope.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.520
It outlines the legal relationships
among the principal participants

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.640
in the making and marketing of a
musical composition and an associated

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.030
sound recording.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.100
You'll recall from lecture number
three that the composer acquires

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.090
the copyright in the composition,
typically assigns that copyright

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.800
to a music publisher, who then
issues licenses to many licensees

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.250
collecting fees from all of
them, which the publisher then

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.570
shares with the composer.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.860
The place in this complex industry
where work for hire agreements

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.140
become relevant is the
relationship between the performer

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.230
who makes a recording of the
composition and the record company.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.920
This relationship appears in
the bottom right of the diagram.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.920
You'll recall that since 1972
the recording has given rise

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.670
to a second, separate copyright
in the sound recording.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.030
Who does that second
copyright belong to?

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.135
If the performer were an
employee of the record company,

00:19:00.135 --> 00:19:03.040
the copyright would, of course,
belong to the record company

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.800
for the reasons we've just reviewed.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.240
But that's rare.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.890
Nowadays record companies
rarely employ performers.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:16.200
Rather the performers are
independent contractors.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.740
That means that presumptively the
performer acquires the copyright.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.640
The record company though doesn't
want to leave the copyright

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.720
in the hands of the performer.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.000
Typically the record
company wants to control

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.140
all aspects of the
marketing of the recording

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.010
and wants to collect all the fees.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.900
The cleanest way for the
record company to achieve that

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.520
is to hold the copyright.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.130
As a result, as the chart indicates,
virtually all recording contracts

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:50.367
provide that the performer assigns his
or her copyright to the record company.

00:19:50.367 --> 00:19:52.200
From the standpoint of
the record companies,

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.400
that's pretty good, but not ideal.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.420
The reason it's not ideal
is that in the United States

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.210
an assignment of a
copyright is not permanent.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.330
As we'll see in lecture
number six, the assignor

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.990
holds a non-waivable right
to terminate the assignment

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.930
after a prescribed interval of time.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:18.310
How exactly that termination right
works we'll discuss next week.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:24.080
For the time being, the key fact is
that, as I say, it's non-waivable.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.310
The result is that even if
in the recording contract

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:33.080
the performer purports to surrender
his or her right to terminate

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.480
the assignment at a future date,
that surrender is ineffective.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.680
The record companies,
for obvious reasons,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.560
don't want the performers to
hold this power of termination.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.990
The record companies want to hold
the copyrights in the recordings

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.250
permanently.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.060
How could they do so?

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.670
By ensuring that the recordings
are classified as works for hire.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.340
 

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:04.020
The large majority of record
contracts purport to do just that.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.150
In addition to the provisions
assigning the performance copyrights

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.840
to the record companies,
those contracts contain

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.830
provisions indicating that
the recordings generated

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.240
pursuant to the contract
constitute works for hire

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.270
and thus that the copyrights in
them belong to the record company

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.150
from their inception.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:31.600
If effective, these provisions would
trump the performer's termination

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.380
rights.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.330
The problem from the standpoint
of the record companies

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.120
is that it's far from clear
that these provisions,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.300
these contractual provisions,
are indeed effective.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.170
Recall that signed work
for hire agreements entered

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.610
into by independent
contractors are valid

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:55.630
only if the works to which they
pertain fall into this list.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:01.770
Sound recordings, as you'll
notice, don't appear in this list.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:07.270
Now the lawyers for the record companies
contend that the game is not up.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.880
Specifically they argue
that the individual songs

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:15.690
recorded as parts of the albums or
CDs generated under these contracts

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.260
constitute quote, "contributions
to collective works,"

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:26.220
and thus qualify under the
first item in the list.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.290
But even the record company lawyers
realize that that argument is shaky.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.740
Some copyright scholars have
testified on their behalf

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.950
when the issue has been presented
to Congress while others

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.410
equally strongly disagree.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.910
Aware of the precariousness
of their position

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:50.230
on this issue, the record
companies sought to strengthen it.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:56.190
Through shrewd lobbying, they were able
to slip into a seemingly unrelated 1999

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.890
statute what was called a
quote, "technical amendment,"

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:05.250
closed quote, that added sound
recordings to the list on your screen

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.970
prospectively.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.510
Representatives of
the musicians were not

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.800
consulted when this change was made.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.510
When they learned of the change, there
was, as you might expect, an explosion.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.300
The furor resulted in
congressional hearings,

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.910
a report from the Copyright Office,
angry letters from musicians,

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.300
and so forth.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.440
In response, Congress removed the quote,
"technical amendment," closed quote,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:38.170
thus restoring the original list.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:42.340
The record company lobbyists were
able to secure only one concession,

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.540
an agreement that the repeal
should not be construed

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.900
as a rejection of their original shaky
characterization of sound recordings

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.240
as works for hire because they
might be considered contributions

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.480
to a collective work.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.630
The net result of this
elaborate maneuvering

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.495
is the very odd language
shown on your screen.

00:24:04.495 --> 00:24:07.210
 

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.100
As you can see, the
current state of affairs

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:14.800
is as if the technical ammendment--
the 1999 technical amendment--

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.630
never happened.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.360
 

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.860
So are sound recordings
works for hire or not?

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:29.220
We don't know yet and won't until
the first of the termination rights

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.180
start to take hold.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.420
For the reasons I'll discuss
next week, that, as it turns out,

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.990
will begin this year-- 2013.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:45.590
If in the inevitable
litigation sound recordings

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.890
are not deemed works for
hire, then older musicians,

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.630
like Bruce Springsteen and
Eric Clapton, will soon

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.180
begin to reclaim their
copyrights in their early albums

00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.080
and will probably be able
to make more money off them.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.710
Conversely, if sound recordings
are deemed works for hire,

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:10.420
then Springsteen and Clapton will
remain bound by their original recording

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.170
contracts.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:17.290
So a great deal hinges on this highly
technical and still unresolved issue.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.120
 

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.950
Two general lessons can be
distilled from this story.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.740
The first is that
adjustments in copyright law

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:33.110
are often achieved through
lobbying by the representatives

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.720
of the affected interest groups.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:41.720
When two or more powerful groups are
opposed, the usual result is stalemate.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:47.590
Only when the relevant groups
are aligned does the law move.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.090
The technical amendment,
so-called, secured

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:57.780
by the recording industry in 1999 is a
rare exception to that generalization.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.580
But note that it was very short lived.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.280
Once the representatives of
the musicians were alerted,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.510
the amendment was rolled back
restoring the statutory stalemate.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:13.040
As Jessica Litman has
shown, this dynamic

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.020
in which copyright law
changes if and only

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:23.360
if the relevant interest groups want
it to is common in the United States

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.010
and not quite so common but still
frequently seen in other countries.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:34.870
The second of the general lessons
is that in some industries

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.960
artists are vulnerable.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.850
Their bargaining power
is, in most instances,

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:46.120
inferior to that of the intermediaries
with whom they have to deal.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.080
As a result if they're allowed to
sign away their rights, they will.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:56.940
Occasionally the law seeks to mitigate
their vulnerability ironically

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.950
by restricting their
contractual freedom.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:06.060
In other words, by preventing them
from signing away their rights.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:12.130
The limitations on the set of works
that can constitute works for hire when

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:17.850
prepared by independent contractors
is an example of that approach.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.670
We'll see some other examples next week.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:27.550
Whether these efforts to protect artists
or their families from exploitation

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.800
are effective is far from clear.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.318
We'll see.

00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:32.818
