00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.090
<v 0>This is Radiolab. I'm Jad album rod here with Robert Crow,</v>

15
00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:58.030
which this hour we're looking at the science of emergence.

16
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.530
How the world often seems to organize itself into being without an obvious plan

17
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.250
or a leader. Well, think about an ant colony or termites, right? I mean,

18
00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:09.010
they're trying to build a nest. Mathematicians, Steve Strogatz.

19
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.810
And if you look at any individual termite,

20
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.930
it's just moving along and its antennas are wiggling and it's smelling

21
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:15.880
pheromones and it has no idea what it's doing.

22
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.830
It doesn't know it's trying to build an s,

23
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:21.550
it's just responding to whatever little chemical is right in front of its nose.

24
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.560
And yet out of this, you see a coordinated group that looks like it's,

25
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.600
you know, everybody knows what they're doing,

26
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.110
but in fact nobody knows what they're doing. And the same thing with your brain.

27
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.150
No cell in your 100 billion cells in your brain is having a thought.

28
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.520
But together they are together,

29
00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:42.670
they're falling in love or are wanting to write music. So who's in there?

30
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.430
Do we have any idea why this happens or how, I guess that's,

31
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.310
that's the question

32
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.410
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

33
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.770
<v 0>and it's a really fascinating question when you really kind of pause to think</v>

34
00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:59.590
about it. For example, look, I have here, you see this, there's a my,

35
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.210
my cup of coffee I'm looking at and you know it's a cup of coffee,

36
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.990
but how does my brain know that this is a cup of coffee? It's,

37
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.930
it's something that's uh, in a way,

38
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.510
it's hard to even understand what the question is because this comes so

39
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:14.560
naturally to us, right?

40
00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:18.070
We just look at something and we have this integrated perception of a cup of

41
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.870
coffee that like, what's the big mystery? I hear you did use all of her sack.

42
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:23.170
So you had him on the show recently.

43
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:26.770
He would probably be able to talk to you in an interesting way about people for

44
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:28.270
whom this does not come easily.

45
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.330
There is a famous case which was reported in Germany of a, uh,

46
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.200
a woman who had lost motion perception and there's a very nice description,

47
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.360
for example, of her difficulty, Pauling t till that Oliver, now this woman,

48
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.480
she takes the teapot and she starts to pour and suddenly the image just freezes.

49
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.750
She would have stills lasting about 15 seconds.

50
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.840
She would see a glazier.

51
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.110
She used that term at glacio fluid coming from the teapot.

52
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.930
Her brain was seeing something, not moving,

53
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.950
but then her feet were getting and then suddenly there was a puddle.

54
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.080
They were getting wet and indeed crossing a vote.

55
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.470
It was impossible for this woman in Germany.

56
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.580
Dangerous and so it's those people who help us realize the miracle of

57
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.720
perception, right? That the, to see the world as a coherent thing is a miracle.

58
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.823
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

59
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.780
<v 0>should we hit them at the same time? No,</v>

60
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.210
I just think of yourself as fireflies and you're own buzzing separate trees.

61
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.520
Okay, so back to your miracle of the Coffee Cup. So yes,

62
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.910
for those of us who are healthy, we do this all the time.

63
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:39.911
The question however remains how I have trillions and trillions of neurons in my

64
00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.050
head firing randomly.

65
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.740
Every neuron that you're hearing here is going a little electrical thing.

66
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.010
And the other question is how does this,

67
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.940
which seems so rampantly disorganized, how does it resolve

68
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.200
<v 4>[inaudible] Cup of coffee?</v>

69
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.040
<v 0>Yeah, good question.</v>

70
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.670
Now, a few years ago,

71
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.560
a number of neurologists trying to figure out how the idea of coffee comes to be

72
00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:20.360
came upon a kind of musical analogy and a bringing, creating a thought,

73
00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:24.050
creating say a cup of coffee is kind of like a musical event.

74
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.170
Neurons in one side of the brain and another side of the brain.

75
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.120
I recognize them color or shape or something,

76
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.380
and if they vibrate together at about 40 cycles a second, if they create,

77
00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:38.160
say the same note in step, that synchrony is a cup of coffee.

78
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.130
What's happening in the brain is that there's a part of the brain responsible

79
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:45.020
for the sense of smell, smell,

80
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.100
<v 2>eh,</v>

81
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.100
neurons that recognize the coffee aroma or firing vigorously as they smell it.

82
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.850
Meanwhile, they're colored detectors that happen to notice that it's a,

83
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.470
you know, a red mug

84
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.980
<v 5>shape detectors as part of the visual system that are noticing the edge of the</v>

85
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.843
[inaudible]

86
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.620
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

87
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.160
<v 5>At least what neurologists think is that it's the simultaneous firing of all of</v>

88
00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:16.310
those that are looking at red and at sensing the aroma.

89
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.210
It's the coincidence of their firing that's telling them, this is one thing.

90
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.290
This is not separate aromas and colors and shapes. This is,

91
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.060
<v 0>they'd be singing together, Huh?</v>

92
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.120
<v 4>The one nine one one</v>

93
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.680
only [inaudible]

94
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.080
<v 0>so that is a cup of coffee.</v>

95
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.530
And to think we do it every morning before we proceed.

96
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:53.700
We should thank the New York City LaGuardia Composition class are neurons where

97
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.070
my name's Harris middle and I'm taste my is Melanie Charles,

98
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.110
Danielle Devito Lloyd data.

99
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.650
My name is Jonathan Chu and I am smelled Jonathan Chu.

100
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:07.460
Mr Smell did the arrangements Robert Apostle conducted that we say,

101
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.600
wait a second here because this is interesting. Robert Apostle, yes,

102
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.230
their conductor told them what to do. Right.

103
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.200
But in your head when you think of a cup of coffee, who's conducting you

104
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.110
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

105
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.570
<v 0>and this is where we start getting into the, the very mystical or even most,</v>

106
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.490
most mysterious part of this is that who is it that's paying attention? I mean,

107
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:33.140
because I mean, what is attention? How can you control you?

108
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.990
I don't, I don't really even know how to talk about this, but,

109
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.600
but there's something in you that that is uh, that is says at the signal.

110
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.770
Let's do coffee. Yeah. I mean cause it's confusing the,

111
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.090
what is it that brings one thing into attention and not the other. Anyway,

112
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:48.620
I don't know. I'm a little out of my depth here

113
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.470
somehow or other, whether we're looking at ants, cities with the Internet,

114
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.520
wherever we look,

115
00:06:56.521 --> 00:07:01.140
the shape in organization of the world seems to emerge without an obvious plan.

116
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.210
And yet there it is.

117
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.980
And nowhere is this more mysterious and more difficult to really comprehend than

118
00:07:07.981 --> 00:07:12.880
in our own heads. Even for scientists who work on a day after day in the lab.

119
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.770
Like this Guy Chris Stopcock,

120
00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:18.550
I'm a professor of neuroscience and engineering at the California Institute of

121
00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:19.384
Technology.

122
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.870
Christophe Cock is one of the most celebrated neurologists in the world.

123
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.580
And for him and for many others,

124
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.150
they have a hard time getting rid of a model deep down,

125
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:30.700
which has somewhere in there, there's a conductor.

126
00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:34.100
Someone is organizing the action. You made a mema.

127
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.510
There's a movie by Woody Allen called everything you always wanted to know about

128
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:39.010
sex do, but the way of free to ask,

129
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.270
and this has great skits in it where he has um,

130
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.750
a couple of petting in the back of the car.

131
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.160
<v 6>Oh my God. Sydney. Can't you wait?</v>

132
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.220
Do you want to do it right here in the parking lot?

133
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.140
You'd see inside the boy's veins as mission control, mission control,

134
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.960
you have this NASA type control whom you have to speak to east clean

135
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.800
corresponding to the output of the eyes grade-wise come in.

136
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.083
<v 0>I used to Brian</v>

137
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.260
<v 6>and you have sort of all these wide devices now for technicians running around.</v>

138
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.870
All systems go and we're going to get an erection in the scene.

139
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.790
Which one did to do. Yeah, exactly. Then you have these, uh, you know,

140
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.650
all these Siemens that line up, they all have these little parachutes,

141
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.650
little long tails, scared. I don't want to go out there, but I mean,

142
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:23.940
the point is, so there's this control of a metaphor that, that uh,

143
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.500
we can all laugh about, but a lot of people,

144
00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:29.680
including scientists have implicitly the idea is that me,

145
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:32.140
there's a Christoph who sits inside muted. I can tell you,

146
00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:34.720
most people can tell you to, to exactly between my two eyes,

147
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.990
between here and here. And by the way, this Kristof, I assume would be saying,

148
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:42.640
okay, she in this, in the movies, okay, she likes me. Let's make the next move.

149
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.770
That's exactly what happens. Of course in the Woody Allen movie. Exactly.

150
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.840
<v 0>So the point says, Christof Koch is that the Woody Allen model,</v>

151
00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:01.970
this idea that there's an inner command center,

152
00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:05.750
some conductor directing your brain that thinks is wrong.

153
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.610
Now clearly there is no such person inside my head for a lot, you know,

154
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.400
because who sitting inside the head of this little Christoph and then who's

155
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.880
sitting inside the head of the person sitting inside my head.

156
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.743
So you see the problem,

157
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.140
if Christopher's thinking about a cup of coffee and he gets the idea from an

158
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.210
inner Kristoff who's thinking about a cup of coffee,

159
00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:24.920
where did the inner Cristoph get the idea?

160
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.210
Maybe from an inner inner Christophe that wouldn't really solve the pong would

161
00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:30.580
just push it one back. [inaudible]

162
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.593
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

163
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.480
<v 0>these are heavy problems.</v>

164
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:43.430
What happens here is we're tiptoeing up the hill here to the Mount Sinai of of

165
00:09:44.381 --> 00:09:47.560
science. Yeah. Coffee Cups and people sitting in the controls.

166
00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:51.160
Well these are kind of the smaller questions on the foothills to the bigger one,

167
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.860
which is how does a mind reflect?

168
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.850
Why does someone know who an I is?

169
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:04.050
Why can you contemplate death? What is this consciousness?

170
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.240
That's the big question. If we can figure this out,

171
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.980
whatever circuit is responsible for or circuits responsible for human

172
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:12.990
consciousness. Think of what we can do.

173
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.690
One day a doctor could walk into a patient's hospital room with patient is

174
00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:19.070
laying comatose and uh,

175
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.510
put a helmet on them with a conscious oh meter,

176
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.630
let's call it and measure how alive they are.

177
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.200
Very maybe even tickle a part of their brain and wake them back up.

178
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.260
[inaudible] [inaudible] idea, by the way,

179
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.370
came from one of the most famous scientists of the 20th century who worked very,

180
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:40.100
very closely with Christopher Koch. Um,

181
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.830
I'm talking about a man named Francis Crick. I,

182
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:44.720
even if you know nothing about science at all,

183
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.720
you've probably heard about the discovery of the structure of DNA,

184
00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:51.040
the DNA molecule by Watson and crick. This is that crick. Hmm.

185
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.191
He was a British guy.

186
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:56.750
He moved to southern California and at some point he and Christopher Koch met.

187
00:10:56.751 --> 00:11:01.160
Now, coke was much, much younger, decades younger than the older guy,

188
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.320
and yet they formed one of the more magical partnerships,

189
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.330
a kind of Gilbert and Sullivan or who Rogers and Hammerstein of neuroscience.

190
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.440
And one of the ideas that crick had was that there is a way,

191
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.970
there must be a way to figure out what consciousness is all about.

192
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.300
<v 6>They developed this notion,</v>

193
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.490
there's no conscious entity inside my head that serves the whole of conductor.

194
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.610
That's not to say that that may not be places in the brain that act akin to a

195
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:35.060
conductor,

196
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.320
that sort of synchronized and that coronate the various parts of the brain that

197
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:40.280
find a penalty.

198
00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:44.680
Because one of the remarkable phenomena of continence is everything's

199
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:49.160
integrated. When I look at you and you talk, your voice comes out of your mouth.

200
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.860
When you move, the motion I perceive is attached to your head. No in the brain,

201
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:56.290
all the things that analyze in different parts of the brain.

202
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.640
So you need some sort of entity that pulls all these different networks of the

203
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.460
brain together. Is there a place in the brain that does that well?

204
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.940
So Francis Crick and I think so in fact it was a, the,

205
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.920
the subject of his last paper that he worked on,

206
00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:11.320
on literally on the day he died.

207
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:17.350
This is a odd structure in the brain called the cloud storm clouds to means

208
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.230
hidden away. And it's a small area.

209
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:23.830
It's sort of an elongated sheet like structure beneath the cerebral cortex.

210
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:25.570
You have two of them, one on the left and one of the right.

211
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.340
And what's remarkable about it? Indeed,

212
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.640
distraction receives input from almost every cortical area,

213
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.440
the teams to be in an ideal position.

214
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:36.340
If you want to go to the metaphor of synchronizing all the different activities

215
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.250
and making sure they all in some sort of lockstep.

216
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.670
So Francis and you have this idea and he is very sick with cancer and he wants

217
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:49.120
to get this idea down is what's God's calling. Can you describe the scene there?

218
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.000
You first had this idea 10 years ago and he talked about it innocent in his book

219
00:12:54.001 --> 00:12:58.620
that he published in 94 and then we never thought much more about it over the

220
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.610
last year. We came back to this, um, this,

221
00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:04.890
this sort of somewhat obscure structure. So he was very,

222
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:09.600
very interested in it and yeah, he felt his, he felt his, um,

223
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.620
you know, as he felt his illness coming on and getting stronger,

224
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.820
he was very adamant about trying to finish up a manuscript.

225
00:13:17.821 --> 00:13:20.790
So he literally worked days and days and days.

226
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.210
There's this beautiful photograph of his desk covered probably four inches deep,

227
00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:31.050
just with paper pertaining to the cloud storm. And he worked a particular,

228
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.570
the last six weeks, um, the United Tighter Finish, a manuscript to,

229
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:37.140
to get in reasonable shape for us to, to publish.

230
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.320
And so he was on the day he died.

231
00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:44.340
He was still writing the scientists to the bitter end.

232
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.050
Here's a kind of Mozart's requiem quality to this. Yes, yes.

233
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.463
<v 3>Yup.</v>

234
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.240
<v 6>What was the last thing that you and he said to each other?</v>

235
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:57.980
<v 3>Hello?</v>

236
00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.050
<v 6>I'll see you on Thursday or Friday.</v>

237
00:14:00.051 --> 00:14:03.080
I was supposed to visit him in the hospital to work on this manuscript.

238
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.340
And was the manuscript completed? Uh, no, it's,

239
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:12.070
I'm currently working on it.

240
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.150
I'm editing it and then sending out and abouts send it out to friends.

241
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:21.880
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

242
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.990
<v 6>cause I feel a little bit exactly like, um, the student of Mozart,</v>

243
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:28.300
his name's escapes me, who finished his [inaudible].

244
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.050
He had a student in finished spectrum and now musicologist today at deciding

245
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.270
what is actually original Mozart and what was finished in the style of Mozart.

246
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.810
And so I say much aware of this and you're stuffing in Italics or something or

247
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.630
something. Like on the other end we published 22 or 23 manuscript together.

248
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:49.390
And the way we always worked that he wrote the first draft was very insistent

249
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:51.110
upon that. And then I vote, you know,

250
00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:54.620
I edit it and then he edit my edits and so we iterate it. Unfortunately,

251
00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:56.610
I can't do this here anymore. So you know,

252
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.780
I just have to edit his draft without the benefit of his feedback.

253
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.883
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

254
00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.250
<v 0>Christoph cough is a professor of neuroscience and engineering at the California</v>

255
00:15:15.251 --> 00:15:19.480
Institute of Technology. His newest book is the quest for consciousness.

256
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.260
There's more of Radiolab online@radiolab.org communicate with us.

257
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.350
Why are their radio lab at w n y C. Dot.

258
00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:33.930
