00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
Hi, I’m Thomas Frank and I wanna welcome you to
a series that’s a little bit different than anything you’ve
seen here on Crash Course before.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.060
While every other series up to this point has helped
you explore and learn about actual academic subjects,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.940
like World History, Computer Science, and
Literature, here we’ll be learning how to learn.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.251
This is an important ability to have and to
hone;

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.670
as our economy becomes more and more dominated
by information,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.680
the people who can retain that information,
learn new skills quickly,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.940
and combine what they know in new and innovative
ways are gonna be the ones who succeed.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.180
Plus, when you know how to study efficiently
for a test, you’ve got more time for Mario Kart.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.960
So, I should probably introduce myself.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.710
My name is Thomas Frank and I’m the founder
of College Info Geek.com

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.560
I’m also the author of a book called 10
Steps to Earning Awesome Grades,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.780
and I’m the creator of a YouTube channel
that’s all about becoming a more effective
student.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.290
I also have a podcast where I get together
with my best friend Martin and we discuss
many of these topics in even more depth.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.020
For the past 7 years, I’ve spent a huge amount of time writing and researching all about how we as humans can improve our ability to learn and become more productive.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.060
I’ve interviewed college professors, authors,
sleep doctors, neuroscientists, and other experts.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.240
And along the way I’ve picked up a few tips
that go beyond the basics that you might have
already been taught.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.980
So, over the course of the next 10 episodes
I’ll be sharing what I’ve learned.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.240
Among other things, we’ll be digging into how to
effectively take notes, tackle reading assignments,
write papers, and – of course – study for tests.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240
We’ll explore how your memory works, and look at
study strategies that take advantage of its limitations,
rather than working against them.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.060
We’ll also cover productivity skills like
planning, beating procrastination, and improving
your concentration –

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.900
skills that will serve you both in your life
as a student and wherever you decide to go
afterwards.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.700
And that’s really the thing with study skills.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.560
As I’ve discovered since graduating college
with an Information Systems degree a few years
ago, and as you’ll inevitably discover as well,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.400
the skills that enable you to ace your tests and
keep all your assignments organized will transfer to
your career and help you succeed there as well.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.960
Welcome to Crash Course Study Skills.
I’ll see you next week.
