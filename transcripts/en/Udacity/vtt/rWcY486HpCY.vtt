00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.880
So Emily, what did you do this weekend?

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.980
&gt;&gt; Well,
I actually had a nice little Saturday.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.167
I decided to hike up
Meru Peak in the Himalayas.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:11.330
&gt;&gt; Isn't that the hardest
peak to climb in the world?

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.483
Its code name is called Shark Fin.

00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:17.140
And I'm pretty sure only one team
ever successfully climbed it.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.000
And they trained for it for decades.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I don't know anything about that.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.962
I just know it was really tall and
I wanted to climb it.

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:30.600
&gt;&gt; Okay, so did you do any prep before
you went on this expedition of yours?

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.020
&gt;&gt; Well, I watched this cool
documentary on the mountain, but

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.840
that just served as motivation.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.296
What really prepped me for
the trip was the Google Elevation API.

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:39.816
You see,

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:43.848
I didn't really know what I was getting
into when I decided to climb Meru.

00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:45.394
There was this one nagging, yet

00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:48.710
seemingly important question
in the back of my mind.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.342
Exactly how tall is this peak?

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:56.151
So to answer that, I turned to
the Google Maps Elevation API.

00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:59.770
I simply made a web service request
using the elevation service.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.197
I passed in my lat long and my API key.

00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:12.864
And boom, the response told me
that it was over 6500 meters or

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.150
21,400 feet tall.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.768
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really tall.

00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:19.970
That's over four miles of sheer
vertical cliffs to climb.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.770
So, what did you do next?

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.530
&gt;&gt; Well, I decided to stay in bed,
order a pizza and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.030
check out Meru Peak on
Google Earth instead.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.120
How was your weekend?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.180
&gt;&gt; It was good.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.745
I stayed home and
watched the movie Dante's Peak.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:35.880
&gt;&gt; Cool, let's get back to
work on our real estate app.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.430
We had just used geocoding to geolocate
and zoom into an area within the city.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.310
But what if a user doesn't have
a specific area that they care about?

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.780
What if they only care that they're
within a reasonable commute

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.210
of their office?

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.040
Up next, the Distance Matrix API.
