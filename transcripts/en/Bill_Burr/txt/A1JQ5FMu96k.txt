Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and Ah, I'm just checking in on you. What's going on? How are you? How's your week going? Oh, you're having a rough one. We'll, it's okay. It's almost over. It's Thursday. You know, don't you hate your boss? A little less on Thursday. Hey, comes in. Hey, go over there and do what I say. And you're like, oh, chubby cheeks. You know, you love to say that to them. Just grab his muffin top doll. What veto do shop doing?

Speaker 2:          00:00:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       Did you technically get fired for that? He, all you have to do is just when you're going in for the disciplinary meeting, he just, you know, you just stay in the pocket. Just be luck. I have no problem doing what this man says, but I can't fight the fact that, yeah, I think he's adorable. I mean look at him once you want to go up there and give him a little, you know, oh, we'll put on a tie today. Yeah, that's a fucking great way to get your ass fired. I don't know. What if everybody does it though? You know the strength in numbers. Is this like a Sally field movie? Should I be fucking standing up holding a sign? Yeah. Union. Right? Still brave. It was so brave what she did in the mind. Um, is there any word more overused in the entertainment, specifically the movie acting business than brave Jesus fucking Christ. Has any actor ever looked up that fucking word? The way you went out there with that band, Dan? It was such a brave performance. Yeah. Jesus Christ. You know, just go. When did you go over to craft service and get yourself something that has yoga in it? You fucking stupid, you know, courageous, brave, important.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       This was a story that needed to be told.

Speaker 2:          00:02:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Oh my God, those fucking award shows. And it never dawns on him the irony that everything we're wearing colluding, what they shtick, sweat pants and t shirt I have on right now is all made in a sweatshop by some crying child at fucking three in the morning and Che in n whatever, Honduras or some shit. Right. And they're all up there acting like they give a fuck about people. It's like you don't, you want to go with their, you want fucking Ruth buzzy or whatever fucking name is to say what you're wearing. Looks good. You know, and then you want to win the shiny thing and you want to cry and thank your mother and pretend you're down to earth and go back to you fucking infinity pool. That's what you really want to do. Right. Do a little fucking, you know, have Jack Nicholson come over, do some blow off your titties. You know, if you're a guy, a, you know, who knows what you want to do out here.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       I didn't want to talk in about, you know, I'm just having one of those scatterbrain days and I went to bed early last night. You know, as I always do, whenever I go on tour with [inaudible] and Bart, nick, I think all of us, like for the next three days, have to like dry out and try to get about, oh, about 14 hours sleep. Um, so yeah, I'm off the booze. I'm off to cigars, you know, the usual fucking thing. I'm all over the goddamn place. And um, oh fuck. You know what? Somebody told me yesterday, here's a new thing. All right, how fucking in this fucking world that just keeps getting more and more creepy. You know, that whole big brother thing, but blah, blah blah, blah, blah. And then people are saying, oh, big brother turns out it's actually us. Um, and it is, it is because we were just keep going along with this shit.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       Listen, his belt, just tell the fucking story before you go on your stupid little rant here. All right, so buddy, my tells me another day, right? He a that a friend of his came over to do some work on his house because a, if you own a house, you're constantly trying to fix it so it doesn't fall down. That's what they don't tell you. You know, when they show the commercial and the real estate commercials, you know, Oh, white picket fence, golden retriever, you watch had six kids and she's still hot, right? Isn't that the other song goes anyways. And they're all running around there. They're uh, you know, ridiculously green, front yard played Frisbee, you know, the dog's not trying to eat anybody. Your wife's laughing. The kids are all good looking right. Everything's fine, right? Nobody has a list. Nobody has, you know, fucking jealousy issues. You know, guy doesn't have dad bod basically crushing it. They can and you just look at it and you're like, you know what, if I, if I, you know, if I buy a house, you know, I know I'm not going to look like that, but is that the mood I'm going to be in? It's like a drug, right? So anyways, he fucking, um,

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       he fucking has this guy's buddy come over to some work. So he goes to pay him and as all good guys do, well, you don't need to pay him. You don't even pay me. And he's like, no, come on, I want to pay it. Nah, I'll tell you I'm not gonna accept it. Just take the fucking money. Right. They had to do a sketch like that with too polite friends and ends up in a knife fight. One person finally kills the guy and then fucking stuffs the money in his mouth. Should they do a sketch like that? I think they should. Um, anyway, so he goes, so finally the guy goes, you don't have to pay me, just get me a case of beer. So the guy goes, fine. So the closest place that at a little bit Owlette was cvs. So it goes down to cvs.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       He buys the fucking case of beer and the lady behind the lady behind the counter goes, do you have an id? And he's looking at it like, bitch, I'm 50. And he goes, do you really think I, you know, you don't think I'm of age? She goes, I need to swipe your license. And she, he goes for what? She goes, oh, um, basically for health insurance purposes, they record, you know, if you drink or not. And if you drink, your premium goes up because you're a drinker. Now, what the fuck this cds give a shit about rat and everybody out who's a fucking booze face out there. Right? Cause you know what it is the money that they're gonna fucking be able to, to, to knock up, you know on your premium to pump it up. CVS gets, it gets a little kickback. That's how it fucking works. It's like when I drive you to fucking amazon.com right? If you go through my website, they give me a little aid. Thanks for sending some business our way. Break you off a couple of honeys. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:06:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       But I'm not costing you any more money. I'm the hero with this. I don't cost you any more money. Whether you go directly to Amazon, if you go to my website, it doesn't make any difference to me and I'm mostly not ratting out. What I'm trying to say here is I am a way better person than cvs. No, I'm fucking with you. Look we're all trying to make money out here but that's, that's really, it's fucking ridiculous. I actually always try and look at it from the insurance company side of it. Cause you know God damn well everybody goes in there and lies these smoke, you know, you drink. No, I mean maybe I'll have a beer, I don't know, on the 4th of July to support the troops.

Speaker 4:          00:07:29       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       do you engage in any a drug activity? If, I mean food's at drugs self, technically yes, but I mean that other style, no, I would do you have unprotected sex with prostitutes? Listen, I got a phone call. Can I, can I take this? You know, you know, you know that deal. You lie your fucking ass off. You're going to get life insurance. You lie your fucking ass off. Right? So on one side, I actually have empathy from insurance companies because I understand that aspect of it. Provided they ever fucking paid out any goddamn money remotely. Like they said they were gonna you know the deal, you pay for insurance, they say you're covered and you say to them, hey, if this happens, am I going to be covered if I, I got the, uh, the old stuff, the tow insurance. So if I wake up in the morning, I stub my toe.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       Okay, I'm a man, I can take it, but if I break my fucking toe, okay, and you know my job is to skip on stage every night. If I have to take a night off, can you, can you kick me the, you know the fucking $25 feature spot money. Can you kick that to me? They're like, absolutely. I go hide. So if I break my toe, step my toe in my house and Co, absolutely you're covered right now. What happens? You stub your toe, you break it, you fucking call them up. They're like, okay, I've got to send it through the Ya, you're not getting paid quadrant quadrant of the fucking insurance company. Then they come back and what do they do? They'll give you like fucking 13 bucks instead of the 25 they owed you nine or 13 between 25 doesn't seem like a lot money.

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       Right? But you just ratchet that up there. Right? But if they owed LG two 50 they only gave you one 30 what? They owed you 25 grand and they only gave you fucking six. That's what the fuck they do. They are in the business of taking your fucking money and buying themselves a yacht and fucking banging Victoria's secret models in the ass while I'm looking at the next year's model of fucking uh, yeah, that's, that's what they're in the business of. They are not in the business of fucking help it people, they're in the business of taking your money, telling you that you're going to be covered and then when you go, dude, what the fuck? Right? They go, yeah, go fuck yourself cause we got more money taken a leave it. Right. And what should happen is like, you know, when, uh, do you remember the mighty heroes when they would send out that little signal and they'd all fucking tour diaper man and strongman, they'd all turn into some or was it Batman out fucking remember when everybody was insured by that company should go at those cons and be like, dude, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       I thought you said this guy was covered. This is what you're doing to him. You're going to do it to all of us. Right. I'm going back to the Sally field thing. You know what the problem is, is nobody likes their neighbor. You know, you look across that and you look at the car you drive and you look at his wife either don't understand what he bought or you want it. There's never a middle ground like, yeah, you know, I'm pretty much on par with this guy and I get my ego can handle living across from him. You're either going to resent them or not understand them. So then when he gets fucked out of money, he's telling you the story. You're sitting there nodding your head, acting like you don't like it, but you hate to admit it. There's a part of your soul that's getting filled up, isn't it? Admit it. You know like your neighbors, right. It really came down to it. Don't you want a house as big as your house and your neighbors? Wouldn't it be great if they just weren't there anymore? Somehow there was wasn't any like forensics and they could figure it out that you a hastened his demise and took over his house. Just added a fucking hallway between your house and his right.

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       Then the whole other house is yours, right? So when your wife and kids are driving you nuts, you just say, listen, Daddy's going over to his other life. I'll be back when I can deal with you. And everybody just looks at you like those, that family in that real estate commercial just smiling and waving, being like, yeah, it's fine. Don't worry about it. Right? Then you go in there, right and said anything you want, you've got booze, you got cigars, you know you got, I'm a sue slash a fucking whore. They want to have that the timeout room for a married guy. You know, and I know what you ladies to tick. Well, why don't they have a time out room for women? Ain't no what I say. Well, why don't you come up with it? The world doesn't know you're around a drinks. Okay? And goddammit, you got debt, multitask and pray. Once you sit down with a couple other prods, what would be in your room?

Speaker 1:          00:11:39       You know a bunch of shit that makes you live longer. See if you notice what the guy, everything I said would slowly fucking kill me. The Bose, the cigars, the horse, all of it just, it just eats away at your soul in your fucking liver, right? Women would go on the first, one of the first things they probably want is like the most beautiful fucking tub they ever could find. They could take a nice fucking bath. You know what? They're crazy little fucking soaps, right? They have a whole spa day and they'd have a friend that they could sit down and get all of that resentment out of their heart with someone who can actually listen to it. They download all of that shit. You just totally clean up their soul before they go into the next room and get fucking bang by Brad Pitt. You know, whoever the fucking Jake Gyllenhaal guy is nowadays.

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       Who is it? Is it Justin Bieber? Has he become a man yet? He's in his 20s. Right? He's riding the wave out of teen idol. Them slowly become an a man, right? As long as he doesn't remake blue lagoon, I think that kid's going to be all right. Um, anyways, my Jesus Christ, these 12 minutes of your life, you'll never get back. Um, you know what? Today's about everybody. Today's not about you. Today's not about me. Today's not even about America. You know what today's about. Today's about the Boston Bruins versus the Detroit Red Wings. That's what it's all about. Okay? It's funny that they play all these fucking games and it can come down to one God damn game for those of you who don't watch hockey, all right? Which is kind of me. I just pay attention to it because I've, are you fucking content once? Can I pass whatever worked the first fucking time?

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       You know, they're always like, you know, that's not secure enough. Well, it's like, it's so fucking secure. I can't do it on one time while I'm still on a fucking podcast. Jesus fucking Christ. Anyways, they play all these goddamn games. Let me get back into the nicest soothing tone that I had earlier. Um, they play all these fucking games, 80 goddamn games, whatever the hell it is. And you would think that, you know, by now everything would be all sorted out, right? Let's go to the playoff picture. The playoff picture. Here we go. I didn't need a picture. I need a brow to play playoff bracket. I can't read that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       Bracket. Challenge the fucking standings. That's how, that's how old I am. I think. I feel like if I just yell at a website, I'll do what I want. Um, all right so the, so the fucking red wings have 93 points. Oh they got 93. That's right. Cause they, that's right. Cause they beat the fucking filthy flyers. All the flyers needed that one. The flyers needed that one. For some reason I root for the Philadelphia Flyers. I like them. They know what I mean. I know that they'd been dirty and fought knowledge ship. He can't tell me it wasn't entertaining. You know, Ron Hextall come and flying out of the net cause he's pissed that he lost the Stanley Cup finals. I've always enjoyed that shit. Um, I don't like the offense, but I liked it. Team.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       Uh, but you know, Philly fans work at, you're not liking making you not like them. So they did the job with me. I don't like them. Um, so anyways, so Detroit beat them. So as of right now, Detroit has 93 points. Philadelphia has 91. The Bruins have 91, but for whatever fucking reason, I guess head their head, maybe we or we have a game at hand. I don't know what, we're still under the fucking bar line. So basically tonight, tonight, the red wings I think could solidify, let's see, I have two more. Get look to choice. Detroit wants to an idea. They're either in or they've totally fucking, you know, they'd have to basically put me in net to not make the playoffs. But if the Bruins, when we will go up two points on the Philadelphia flyers and a, this is the biggest fucking game.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       They're all big games this week, but this is a for [inaudible]. This is a big one this week. And uh, and other Redwings haven't been the greatest in the past few years, but they got enough guys left. Oh, and by the way, I want to say, shout out to that fucking Twitter cunt. That fucking laughed at me when I said, you know, Carolina fucking, I feel like they always get the best of us. And he was saying like, oh, we're the Bruins are six. So, and to the last fucking tie, well, you know something, I never forgot that game. Seven in 2009 when they came back and they fucking beat us. And just times, every time there's a big game like that, you know, something, they always beat us. And what happens? We play those kinds. And what happened? What happened? They ended up beating us in a shooter, but we did get one point then Christ. Um, I think you do right?

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       Don't you get one point that I don't, every time I turn it on, they fucking change the rule. Now they're doing three on three in the overtone, which I like, but you know, it makes me feel like I blacked out for five years. So anyways, we gotta to win that game tonight. Um, and I was hoping, uh, Detroit would look a little more tired than they did last night, but they totally looked like they were on their fucking game. The one thing we got going is it's back to back. Um, which usually during the season you'd have a let down, but there's too much at stake. So I think this is going to be a tough game. And, uh, um, I don't know. My heart says we're gonna win, but I don't know. We'll see. It's been tough for us lately. All right, let's, uh, oh, and by the way, the amount of people that hate the fucking Bruins, I, hey, it's like four white.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       We want one cup in 40 years. The fuck is your problem. You know, I love when our fucking teams sit there and they act like, you know, this team's dirty and this team has excuses, but our team's fucking squeaky clean. You know, I see the pieces of shit on my team, just the way I see them on your team, you know, I see your fucking coaches screaming and yelling anytime anybody touches your players.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       You know, you probably spend more time with your bedsheets than anything else you own. You really shouldn't skimp on your bedding, but most people do because great sheets are very expensive. Thanks to Boll and branch, that's not the case anymore. And when you spend the big bucks on sheets with super high thread count, you think you're getting the best. But what you're really getting is marketing Mumbo jumbo. Oh my God, dude, am I really have to read five paragraphs about sheets? Thread counts have nothing to do with quality and don't get me started on so-called Egyptian cotton. The fuck is that. That just came, just just the name of a plant grown in Pakistan, in China. Uh, well, you know, it didn't back in the date and the they'll no white man bring his ships over there for all the fucking spices and sheets. Isn't that what happened?

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       Um, you value your, you value your sleep. Don't put words in my mouth, but you know what? You're right. Instinctive son of a pitch. But whenever you head to a department store, you're forced to pay a huge markup for sheets that aren't even that great. Boll and branch sheets are different. First of all, let me cross my legs during this part. First of all, sit down and let me tell you a story. You can only get them at Boland, branch.com so you know you're paying for quality sheets and not for overhead. And quite frankly, they're the most comfortable sheets in the world they made with the entirely organic cotton and a night sleeping on Boll and branch sheets makes your day so much better. Three US presidents sleep on Boll and branch. Well how do you know that? Isn't there like a security issue? Jesus. How filthy or Bill Clinton's that fucking animal a, these are people who can afford to sleep on any brand of sheets in the world and they even choose bold and they even choose boll and branch.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       How can they afford to sleep on any brand in the world? They only make 400 grand a year before taxes. Oh that's right. Cause then they give speeches for fucking 500 grand and night to everybody. You put them in office. So they wash their bribe money. Oh, shut up bill. Okay, here we go. They even cut out all the middlemen, department store markups, which by the way are up to 800% so you're getting amazing luxurious sheets for a couple of hundred bucks. Boll and branch is so confident. Oh, this is all capital letters. Boll and branch is so confident. You'll love their sheets that they'll let you try them completely risk free for 30 nights, jerk off on them, fuck on them, sleep on them, drool on them. We don't give a shit. Uh, it gets even better.

So this is some fucking, this is the dumbest Shit I think I'm going to do. Oh, that's right. I can't play it on my fucking laptop for whatever fucking reason. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:26:18       yeah. Cause I have too many things signed into fucking iTunes and then my old shit, I can't, I don't remember the password for.

Speaker 4:          00:26:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       I thought the big brother was looking at me through the camera. Can't they fucking see? Can't they see that? Is that it's me. Let me see if I can fucking play this for you.

Speaker 4:          00:26:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:38       All right. So I always thought that this is how you counted it, right?

Speaker 5:          00:26:45       One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven one, two, three, four, one, three, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       Right. It finally dawned on me today that when I was counting four, four, and then three for four plus three is seven so you can count the whole fucking thing and she's seven

Speaker 2:          00:27:08       the one here we go.

Speaker 5:          00:27:11       Oh, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, three, two, three, four, five, six, seven 43 four, five,

Speaker 1:          00:27:21       six, seven, one. So it's really four fucking measures is seven and I was like, Oh, the plain who fucking Shevon twice. Then they go for four Dan, it's three, four days back to seven. All right. It's like no stupid that just making it sound like it's in four, four and then all of a sudden they lop off one beat and you're like, oh, what the fuck? But back to one again, which really is the layman's term for still being at seven. I learned that while walking at pit bull picking up dog shit this morning. Huh? What the fuck have you been doing? Um, so anyways, um,

Speaker 6:          00:28:04       how the fuck do I get out of this? You know, in defense to me as much as I also loved that album, that fucking, I don't all the new shit that I listened to. Uh, you know, as I watched the Grammy's and I was like, I am downloading everything that wings some Grammy's here, right? Not Everything, but you know, so I basically, I downloaded a, I can't remember Alabama shakes the weekend. Leonardo DiCaprio. What's a fuck set guys? That rapper who won everything? I can never remember. Kendrick Lamar, right? I downloaded all, all this shit that, and I like all of this stuff. I got to tell you that like, uh, the one that actually I, I liked the best is the weekend. I just think it's a fucking, it's an unbelievable album. Unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       You're an amazing voice. And some of the songs that he really does sound a lot like Michael Jackson, but not, and not even in a bad way, just like influenced by the guy. Um, so this morning when I walked, when I was walking around the block, I listened to rat round and round, starting the day off with the little Bobby blocks up, right? Then I listened to that sting song and I was thinking like, ah, that's what I figured out. Wait a minute. Four, three to seven. What the fuck? Literally picking up dog shit with a big goofy grin on my face and this fucking beautiful woman jog by looking at me like, is this guy excited about dog shit? See listening to a podcast about dog shit. Just one of those moments, you know, and just like, yeah, whatever, you know. Anyways. And then I was just like, alright, I keep, as much as I keep trying to listen to new music, I keep going back to the shit I listened to when I was growing up.

Speaker 1:          00:29:37       So, um, out of all the ones that I keep coming back to that guy's fucking album, I just think it's the shit. So I'm not, I'm not 100% over the hill, you know what I mean? And I actually have, unbeknownst to me, I have a college gig coming up, which I'm very excited about. I barely do college gigs anymore. I don't know why, you know, I have to keep doing college kids cause I gotta keep my fan base being, you know, I've got to keep getting the next generation of people how it works. You know, you can't, you don't want to grow old with your crowd and that just reminded you how old you are. It's like I should only think that, you know, twice a day when I'm brushing my teeth, you know, put the toothpaste on, you start brushing, you look up Jason far off. Oh it's me. You know, I only want to feel that twice and fill it twice

Speaker 6:          00:30:27       in a day. Um, but uh,

Speaker 7:          00:30:32       okay.

Speaker 6:          00:30:33       What happens is, is if you just kind of state, you know, with your fan base, you know, they get married, they have kids and even if they want to come out, they're so fucking tired. They just want to sleep if they actually get a moment, you know what I mean? So, uh, you got to keep the young kids coming out. The young kids that can't feel their face, but they love it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:56       I'm freaking out. Your coworkers just mumbling, you know, fucking do you fucking Kwok shocker. Um, I've got a problem for years now. I've been trapped in my KFC and wet wipes. Okay, that's disgusting. I used to be a bodybuilder and actor and a comedian with fucking prospects right in front of me, but then adulthood raped me in the eyes. Oh Jesus. Could you be more dramatic? It sounds like that fucking chick from a sex in the city. Crazy Bro. Broke my hat. I had, this is the guy again, crazy broad, broke my heart. I had to cut away old friends and family shutting me out of their smiles. All right, so this is like getting creepier with each sentence. If you don't bring this around in like two sentences, am I going to abandon this? Had a cut away from old friends and family's shutting me out of their smiles. Dude, what did you do that your friends and family decided they didn't want to be around you anyways? I don't feel sorry for myself or want any pity. Uh, I just, you're not going to get any. So good. I'm glad you don't. He goes, I just want to know how to get out of this. Never ending routine of demise. Well, first of all, I would just stop using those goth death metal words.

Speaker 7:          00:34:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       You know, demise when she got in here. Adult rape me in the eyes. These are like song lyrics,

Speaker 7:          00:34:23       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       depressed dude. What would be the name of this trafficker? Barker. I have to get wet wipes. Right? It sounds like I can't sing like that. Great digital and I've got my eyes and all these fucking kids get like wet fucking whiplash. I'm, I work too much in a jeweler that was supposed to pay for my comedy career when I don't work. I, uh, I was supposed to wait for my comedy career when I, when I don't work, uh, I sleep or oh, when I don't work, I sleep or watch endless DVDs. I'm 24 years old of what the fuck this reads. Like you have 56, dude, he goes, I'm tired all the time from all the hating of the world and my body just won't listen to the screaming frustration in my soul. Dude, you listen to like you listen to progressive metal. I'm guessing by the words you use here, uh, either that you played dungeons and dragons.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       I'm really not helping you depression by shitting on you through all of this. Um, don't worry. I'm going to give you some sunshine here in the end here. So I sometimes get a spark of motivation to get back in shape and just start writing scripts. But it only lasts for a day or two at the most. Yeah, exactly. And then, and then the work comes and you have to going. And that's what separates the people in life who fucking work and in make it. And those who don't, you know, everything's fun for a couple of fucking days. I'm going to get shredded. I'm gonna join a boxing gym. I'm going to look like I'm going to fight in a title fight and you go down there, you skip rope. I'm going to get abs. You're doing all the fucking shit in two days in, you know, after two days you get tired.

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       All right? And that's where you need the discipline to get up and go over there. Even though you don't want to. You know, people who've written Oscar when he scripts, I bet they don't like fucking doing it on, on a certain level, but they keep going. So I would just tell you to keep fucking going. Anyways, let me read the rest of this drum overly dramatic shit. I've lost all faith in the world. Have nothing to fight for anymore. I respect you. Go Fuck yourself attitude and want and want to know what you did to finally pick yourself up from your dark inflicted depression. Uh, sorry. It's not the funniest emails, but I could really do with you guys. I know, dude, I'm fucking with you. I know you going through some shit. So I, here we go. I'm going to help you out here.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       Uh, first thing I would do, get rid of the KFC and wet wipes. All right? If you're already kind of a depressed dude, if you eat bad food, that's just going add, cause I, I'm just speaking personally. Once again, not a licensed guy here in case you throw yourself off the fucking roof. All right? Um, yeah. Number one, this is what I do. Go out and get something healthy to eat. You know, drink some water. Okay? Get eight hours sleep. Wake up and need something healthy. Then go to the grocery store when you full and go buy a bunch of healthy shit. Okay? Chop up the veggies, chop up the lettuce, get a fucking salad already made in there so you don't have to think about it. All right, cook up some fucking chicken. Chop that shit up. Make some chicken salad. You got that in there to get yourself some fucking lunch fried and get yourself some real bread from a fucking bakery.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       Start with that bullshit. You start eating right and then just start working out. You're automatically gonna feel good about yourself and fucking stick with that. As far as that other shit goes. Dude, you're 24 years old. All right. I started comedy when I was 24 you sound like you've already been doing it and quit, so you're ahead of where where I was at at your age, so there's no reason to be depressed. All right. Um, this is how I got beyond my depression was I just started observing it. I looked at it as a spectator rather than feeling a thought and just accepting it and then being dragged to the bottom of the fucking ocean with it. I just started to pay attention. I just sat there and listened to what my brain was telling me, and it was a bunch of negative, oh my God, I'm going to fail and I have to go back and move in with my parents and they're going to die.

Speaker 1:          00:38:10       I'm going to be able to afford to pay for the house and then I'm gonna be homeless and then I'm just going to die. And, uh, you know, nothing's ever gonna work out for me. You know, those were the thoughts I was having. So I just sat back and observed them and I just started going, I don't want to think that. I want to think that. And I would just, as I felt them coming, I would just replace it with like a positive thought. I know this is really corny and simple, but I kinda started doing that. And the more I did that because it didn't quite work as to what actually did work in the beginning at all. But like I just kept doing it more and more, and then I just became conscious of when my brain was going in that direction. And, um, working out helps me eating right.

Speaker 1:          00:38:50       Helps me going down to a comedy club, telling jokes helps me out, play in drums, wrestling with my dog, you know, taking Nia out to dinner. Just go do something. Like, it's just a choice, you know, July 30th. So only gonna happen once. So am I gonna fucking be a miserable cunt on this or I said July 30th, 2012 is only gonna happen once. It's just, it's just a fucking choice dude. So you know, if what you're dealing with this clinical, then it's obviously way beyond me, so I don't need, you know, and then I'll have to fucking apologize like Fred Willard.

Speaker 2:          00:39:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       Um, I'm sorry that you didn't go to a psychiatrist and you went to a hacky comedian instead. Evidently that's my fault.

Speaker 8:          00:39:39       [inaudible] fuck you me these bad thoughts to this place because [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       Um, all right. Why don't we end with this segment? I'm sure I can do another 10 minutes on this to give you at least 45 minutes for the week. Let's end with this. This segment. Oh Jesus. Which is really taking on a life of its own. I thought it was going to die, but it is somehow risen.

Speaker 2:          00:40:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       Um, okay. Here we go. And get ready for bill is the dumbest person on the planet. All right, Bill, for what it's worth, I think you're fucking crazy and irresponsible explanation point. I can ever say the x Scullin x skull. Exclaim exclamation. There we go. Exclamation point. I just want to let you know that those words that you kind of know how to say, but you just sort of fly through them. Escalation point a what kind of person talks about God like that. And I love this shit. This is what they all do. You should. And I believe deep down inside you are, be ashamed of yourself. Dude. This is what I love about these fucking maniacs is they're so wrapped up into what they believe that they listen to, how much this person just keeps fucking including other invisible people. And then superimposing what he believes into what you know he thinks.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       I truly believe, because he's so wrapped up in his own fucking world that he can't possibly even fathom that somebody has a difference of opinion on this subject. So he goes, uh, you should, and I believe deep down inside you are, be ashamed of yourself. Dude, are your mom and dad's still alive? What exactly does that have to do with any, your shtick with respect to God is hurtful, offensive, offensive. And despicable. I'm in three things that always has to be three things. It can't be hurtful and despicable or offensive and hurtful. It has to be hurtful, offensive and despicable. Just like comedy has to come in threes. Um, how difficult it must be to spew hatred and vulgarities for shock value. Laughs, no talent in that my friend. That's the classic place that people go. Um, whenever you, whenever you, this is the classic guy where everything is funny until it comes around to the subject that they take seriously 100% and no one can even joke it, joke about it or even questioned it on any level.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       And then they always say that you're just doing it for shock because they find it shocking. It's like really my views on women, women haven't been, you know, that didn't offend you. All this shit that I've said over the two fucking years, none of that is offended you and Al of a sudden this does anyway, so he goes enjoy your success air quotes and all the money you are making on the backs of hardworking, decent people that understand what it means to follow. The rules and be the best they can be without putting other people and god down. The rest of us are watching and we are not laughing. Dude. How many people are in your bedroom as you're, do you have a group podcast listening party every week. All right, let's get back to that. Oh, evidently I am making a money on the backs of hardworking, decent people.

Speaker 1:          00:43:24       So let me get this straight because I'm standing on a stage. Evidently what I'm doing is not hard work. And if people are sitting in the audience automatically, they're all decent, hardworking people. And not only that, I'm making money on the backs of them, really do I have some sort of comedy sweatshop like you know, of comedy factory was sweatshop Labor. What I do is actually, uh, takes advantage of no one. I stand on a stage and I, I tell jokes and if you like what I say you, you sit and listen and if you don't, you walk out right where, where, you know, and I love how just because you're in the crowd, that means you're a decent human being. Do you know the amount of fucking freaks and scumbags that come up to me? This is what I found at a comedy show for the most part, decent people.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       They leave after the show. I didn't want to bug them and then they walk out and then mania x come up to me. You know, let's do some Jaeger and they fucking spit in your face and shit. You know, believe me. All right? But I know I made fun of God. So now, uh, you know, now all of a sudden I'm now all of a sudden you want to talk about people making, making money off of decent, hardworking people. Take a look at fucking organized religion. All right? Those guys will make those guys who live in pretty good, scaring the fucking shit out of you. Every God damn week. All right? And I'm entitled to an opinion and I never was cramming my opinion down your throat. I wasn't okay. You believe in what you believe in and I 100% respect that, but I have the right to question it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       You know? And you shouldn't find it shocking that I question it. You should. Shouldn't you just be what Jesus would do when Jesus just started praying for me. Anyways, let's, let's continue this just in case you're interested. I was raised Catholic, married and raised my children Catholic and definitely have my doubts about the whole organized religion thing. Great. So you agree with me? Not even sure that I believe in God. Once again, there's another appoint that we, that we agree on. I lost my father three years ago and never would have uttered these words in his presence. Neither would I. What am I voice go up. So dude, I did it on a podcast. All right, I'm sorry your father passed away. But you know that has nothing to do with me. Do you understand what you're doing here? Now all of a sudden you're making it seem like I'm walking in with my Mr microphone into the intensive care saying there's no god, you know, whispering into somebody's ear in a coma.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       You just go into the ground. We're all like, dear, I'm not doing that. I'm doing a podcast and I'm fucking around. Alright, if you want to take it seriously, that's your problem. Okay. And if you want to bring up your father passing away as some way to try to guilt me and to feeling like, I mean, you know what I'm saying? In a hateful, hurtful fucking way. Dude, those are all your issues. They have nothing to do with me. All right? 10. He goes on to say that his dad believed that there is something out there responsible for all the beauty in the world, uh, in our world and for our lives as human beings. I don't even disagree with that. I just know human beings have no idea what it is until they fucking die. So I'm not going to sit there and listen to another human being who tries to scare the shit out of me and who's living in a fucking palace telling me that if I become rich, I'm not going to heaven. I'm not out of my mind to think that that reeks of a fucking scam. The same way late at night when they have those fucking gold coins that evidently are with 50 bucks in this selling them for 1999 that that doesn't reek of a scam. Somebody actually sent me a a, an email. Of course I didn't save it. Evidently it's sprayed with like a dollar something worth of gold. Okay, so they're making, what is that? A 2000% profit.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       All right. Believe it or not, just because you're walking around talking about religion in the afterlife and and doing unto others and you're talking this great game, it doesn't mean that you can't be full of shit.

Speaker 7:          00:47:22       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:47:24       Okay, and I'm not saying that I'm right about what I feel, but this is just, it reeks of, of, of, of a scam. I really believe that there is some sort of thing out there and I wouldn't be surprised if there is something after this. I wouldn't be surprised if you just go into the ground and you decay and you give life to the next fucking thing. I wouldn't be surprised if earth is punishment for something that I did in a, in a different solar system. That's another thing about religion. Um, forget about the dinosaurs is it doesn't even bring up space. Okay. Let's say there is this all powerful beauty being. Okay, okay. And I'm just trying to question this right now. So I'm not trying to be shocking or I'm just questioning this. Let's say there is this all powerful being being, they're created, the everything that there is.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       Okay. The entire solar system, why would you do all of that and just put people on this one planet that's like, you created an n a, you built this house that has an infinity basically amount of rooms, bedrooms and you just put everybody, you're only using one room in the house. It doesn't make any fucking sense whatsoever. And that's one thing about Scientology for as much shit as people give Scientology, at least it has the brains to incorporate outer space. You know, I don't know if that's a really good point or if that's really fucking stupid, but you know, I don't fucking know. So anyways. Yeah. Dude, I wasn't trying to offend you or anything that you fucking, I was just trying to be funny and I'm just fucking around and if you want to take this shit seriously, that is totally your fucking choice. Um, you know, that's it. All right. I'm fucking done with that. All right, let's move on to the next person trashing me. Um, oh, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       Where the fuck is it? A Jesus Christ? I think I only bodily put one of them. I thought I had another one. I'm really just organized this week. That's cause you don't have Jesus in your life. You don't have Jason, another guy said, I love how you pick on, on, uh, on a, on a, uh, a punching bag of religion, basically saying like, it's very easy to make fun of Christians, but I don't dare make fun of Muslims because if you make fun of them, Oh Shit, look what's going to happen. You know? And, which I thought was fucking hilarious because the person was sitting there talking about how insensitive I am. And that basically, in a roundabout way, we're alluding to the fact that people who are Muslim means that you're, uh, you're a fucking, uh, uh, you know, you're going to blow up. Like they're all gonna blow up planes and that type of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       You know, I went to a wedding one time, this girl was Pakistani and they actually address that, that what they fucking hated was that all, you know, Christians thought that all of them just wanted to walk around blowing up shit. And, uh, and I also thought it was funny that this guy's fucking sitting there suggesting that, uh, people just because they're Christian, that they're peaceful when you know, what is it once every 18 months, some Jesus freaks fucking kills an doctor. That's pretty much par for the course, isn't it? Um, no, and it's, it's not safe to make fun of Jesus freaks. It really isn't. It really fucking isn't. And I think Bill Maher is out of his fucking mind to say what he says in like, or actually has balls the size of the Grand Canyon to say what the fuck he says and then just walk out in Wade into those people and just, I would never do that shit anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:50:53       And I got to admit the level with which that people take this shit seriously. It actually kind of creeps me out to continue talking about this shit. So a, this might be the last fucking week of it because I've definitely made my fucking points and at this point we're just going to go around in circles and I'm just going to piss people off. So, uh, let's move onto this last guy. What she brought up some great points. Um, all right, set a bunch of Nice stuff and then he said, all right, enough with the Dick Sucking. I was gonna try, I was going to criticize religion, but to describe those belief is, is to mock them there. And you know what dude? That's what I learned. Um, yeah, if you describe them, then you start making fun of them. And then everybody gets mad, or as you're saying, they're just so ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       You just have to, you know. Anyways, let's fly ahead here. Yeah. He said, you mentioned needing a code in the absence of religion to live by. Um, I'm not sure how much, um, of the, I don't read things as a Shtick, but I recommend an excellent text used in an intro to Undergrad and Undergrad ethics course called the elements of moral philosophy by James. I don't know if that's Raquel's or Rachael's. Um, everybody goes on and on about Jesus, but Socrates who define morality as how we ought to live, let a compelling life, as you probably know. Actually, I don't, I just know him as a party reference. Um, what are you fucking Socrates, you know, that's one of those references that even morons can use and get away with. And I'm sad to say I'm one of those people. Um, he said, I didn't know this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       He was found guilty of corrupting the youth. He thought Zeus, Venus, Aries, et Cetera, smacked of bullshit. All right, think about that. Right? They're corrupting the youth now. Every I Christians, Muslims, and everybody today would say that. Yeah, that is bullshit. That those people do not exist because now we've evolved to, there's only one God. There's only one bank. There's one world power. Um, and let's see, and his punishment, he was forced to take his own life by drinking hemlock poison. Once again another death because of organized religion. You know, these Jesus freaks, these, these people who are into fucking, I didn't, don't want the reason why I don't make fun of, uh, the Muslim religion is really because I don't know anything about it. And the reason why I make fun of Christianity's because that's what I was brought up. And those are the stories that, that I, that I hear and all I know about Muslims is basically, uh, you know, the couple of wars with Iraq.

Speaker 1:          00:53:27       So I basically don't know shit. I just think what you, you've wrapped your wrap your women up in bounty paper towels and then cut their clips off. And am I wrong? Am I wrong on that one? Either they're not allowed to show their fucking songs because, uh, you're going to get an erection. And because you wear that bed sheet, everybody's gonna fucking see it. I, I don't really think about it, but I would definitely make fun of it if I knew something about it, but I don't. All right. And I reserve the right to make fun of the fuck a religion that I was brought up. And, um, so anyways, he says, um, Socrates was a humble man, famously announcing all I know is my ignorance. Um, he sought I the one that I love people who would take that at face value. See, he shatty was you fucking moron, right? Yeah. Right. Yeah. You know, Jesus is the solution. Um, he sought answers to questions where his religions prohibits questioning answers.

Speaker 4:          00:54:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       Oh, fucking brilliant. And this guy's really smart. You should do a podcast instead of me. I'm a fucking idiot. Listen to that. He sought answers to questions, whereas religion prohibits questioning answers. And if anything fucking proves that it's the 50 emails I got this week. I like how I'm actually asking, like I'm questioning religion on any sort of intelligent level. Um, I think actually I think I am just cause I say cut and fuck doesn't mean I'm not, uh, bringing up some good questions. All right. Let's finish this for, uh, for Socrates. The unexamined life is not worth living. Uh, his sentiments on marriage and nagging women are remarkably markably, similar to your own, so underrated. Socrates, overrated. Jesus. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:55:03       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       Yeah, that, that's, you know, that's, that is the one thing, and I'm not being a dick here that I don't understand about people who, like I respect people who, who, you know, are raised in religion or, or find a religion that speaks to them and that they decide to commit their lives to what? And what I don't understand is you don't, it brings you this piece, right? Am I wrong there? All right. So it brings you this piece. But then if anybody questions that belief that you have, how quickly it turns violent, like the amount of people who died because they questioned these a holy people, it's this, you don't find that fucking like hilarious and ridiculous on any level like this sitting there calling the other person, that devil, because they're questioning their beliefs and they're saying that that other person is going to hell. And then they turn around and kill the person because they don't believe in the holy pure way that they live their life. I mean, I just, I can't get behind that.

Speaker 4:          00:56:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       I can't get behind that the same way. Is that the same way? It's just because you're a red sox fan. You can't recognize the talent of Derek Jeter and I gotta be like two full cuvees you fig now he's the shit. And I was fucking no. Why? Why do I continue with this shit? Um, I don't know. I don't fucking know. Anyways, that's the podcast for this week. And once again, I'm not disrespecting your religions. Okay? But this is my podcast and when I bring shit up, I fucking go off on it. And I, and I definitely go over the top saying that somebody was pent. Playing the upright bass with Jesus's Juggler is fucking hilarious because it's over the top. And I believe the God in my world thinks it's funny.

Speaker 4:          00:57:00       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:57:00       he's God. Why would he be intimidated? I bet another thing too, I don't understand why God would make all this stuff. Okay. And then just be so doe angry all the time. Jesus Christ here. I'd gone back in and again, I got a lot of questions. Fuck you. It's by podcast. I don't know. That's why I don't understand.

Speaker 4:          00:57:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       You know, I is, it is more like, you know, when you, when you build a bookshelf and you, you know, stand back and Meyer on your work and then it falls down on the floor and you're like God damn fucking piece of Shit and you start blaming the bookshelf even though you made it, you're the one who put it up there, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:57:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       I guess technically God didn't make a, he didn't make titty bars. I guess those are manmade, but a, you know the broad cinema ma or are wow, I'm really fucking, I was just gonna say maiden. His image isn't that, isn't that what you guys say? They found a devil. That's the devil. They got the devil in them. Um, all right. Whatever. All I'm saying is, cause it really got serious this week, people, people really got fucking, they took it a little too seriously. All right, so back the fuck off. Stop taking it so God damn seriously. And you know, why don't you actually practice what your preacher preaches and why don't you go pray for me? Why don't you do that instead of coming on here telling me, you know, giving me your wrath. Isn't that one of the seven deadly sins? You fucking maniacs. You just as fucked up as I am and you don't know shit either. Right? All right. I'm sorry. God bless all of you. Okay. I hope you find what works for you and a seriously. If I'm bugging you, don't listen to the podcast. God knows I'm not making any money off it. I don't give a fuck. That's it. You guys all have a great weekend. Uh, I tell you where I was going to be this week, but I'm worried some Jesus freak is going to show up. So a, that's it. That's it. Have a great week. I'll talk to you next Monday. Hopefully.
