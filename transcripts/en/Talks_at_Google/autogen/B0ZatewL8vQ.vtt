SPEAKER 1: So thank you guys for
joining us for our first Google

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.290
Talks in the Birmingham office.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.270
I have the great pleasure today
to introduce Bridget Russo,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.130
the CMO of Shinola.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.490
Before I do, for
those of you who

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.124
don't have a deep background
on the company itself,

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:21.540
I wanted to give
you a little bit.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.250
It was conceived in 2011.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160
So when we think
about our own brand,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.590
Shinola is only
about five years old.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.070
It is the maker of modern
handcraft watches, bicycles,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.942
leather goods, journals,
and pet accessories,

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:36.650
of which it sounds
like they're expanding

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.070
into even more products.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.300
So we'll hear from
Bridget about that.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.015
They're really
focused on again, you

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:43.390
think about those
of you who work

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.330
in the automotive industry,
some of the importance

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.180
of handcrafting, leather,
some of the more upscale ways

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.540
that we try and convey
important elements of our auto

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.270
manufacturers background.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.650
A lot of that is in the
messages that Shinola

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.720
brings into the market.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.680
So really interesting there.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.910
As far as their locations,
those of you probably know,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.730
they're headquartered here
in Detroit in the College

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.650
for Creative Studies
building, which

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.110
was a former automotive
research lab.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200
And then since the
company's founding,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.400
they have I think
about seven stores now

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.160
that they've opened up.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.730
As Bridget herself, a little
bit of background on Bridget.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.270
Her background started in
PR, which is coming in handy.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.830
Obviously as a CMO, you have
to deal with a lot of things,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.490
particularly in
social media nowadays.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.130
With her background in PR, she
started on the agency side--

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.650
very familiar to some of
you-- and then moved over

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.330
onto the client side, working
with Diesel in the fashion

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.430
industry.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.250
From there she moved
and started to work

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.900
with Eden, which is a company
that Bono started with his wife

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.760
to support some of the-- to
drive industry in Africa.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.260
And that moved her into
her own consultancy,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.950
which a lot of
our Googlers do is

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.200
to start their own businesses.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.520
And from there it led her
to Shinola and from New York

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.419
to Detroit.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.440
And so with that, we welcome
her and want to hear her story

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.510
and learn a bit
more about Shinola.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.060
So with that, I'll
welcome Bridget.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.305
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:27.760
BRIDGET RUSSO: Thank you for
taking the time out of your day

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.860
to hear the Shinola story.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.628
Can everybody hear me OK?

00:02:32.628 --> 00:02:33.128
OK.

00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:34.100
Cool.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.880
So I'm going to take
you through quickly,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.749
since we do have the
fireside chat, and I do

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.290
want to give you
guys the opportunity

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.660
to ask questions afterwards.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.200
So I'll kind of whiz
through this a little bit,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.270
give you a little background as
to why we started the company,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.290
and what's up next in
terms of new categories.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.230
So we started with building
a watch factory in Detroit.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.530
Back in 2011, people thought
our founder, Tom Kartsotis,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.140
was crazy.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.600
Why not accept
that manufacturing

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.850
is gone from this country?

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.420
Why not let the rust and weeds
finish what they started?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.970
Why not just embrace the
era of disposability?

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.711
And why didn't we buy a warmer
coat before we moved here?

00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:11.210
Through three Detroit
winters, we've

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.001
asked ourselves these
questions, and worked

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.590
not to find our answers,
but to build it.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.210
So really from the
beginning, the intention

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.770
was always to not
only be in a city

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.280
where manufacturing was in its
history and in its lifeblood,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.740
but also to be in
a city where we

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.050
could have a positive
impact on the community.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.170
In our case, in creating jobs.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.230
Here's a little video.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.730
So this is where it all began.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.783
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.616
-The question isn't why
do you build a watch

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:42.600
factory in Detroit, it's why
you built one anywhere else?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.170
This is the city that
made this country.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.280
With its steel, with its
skill, with its labor.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.880
Re-establishing
trades that haven't

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.690
been seen in this country
in a generation or more.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.590
It's a tall order
to return to form.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.000
But it's what hundreds
of Shinola employees

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.846
work towards every
day here in Detroit,

00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:02.410
where we believe in
the beauty of industry,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.220
the glory of manufacturing.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.450
Shinola.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.968
Where American is made.

00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:09.610
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.530
BRIDGET RUSSO: So it
started with watches.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.790
We launched our first
product in 2013.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.850
The factory opened
in 2012, which

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.019
is when I started
with the company.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.850
Alongside watches, we also
had bicycles, leather goods,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.390
and journals.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.410
But really our messaging
from the beginning

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.060
was watches built in
Detroit of quality.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.190
And so we started there.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.618
Our first watch was the Runwell.

00:04:36.618 --> 00:04:39.310
If you guys were
around at that time

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.290
paying attention to
some of the marketing,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.736
we had launched the Runwell
watch before we actually

00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:45.860
have product in the market.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.600
So that was March 2013.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.710
The previous year we
had a brand website up

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.700
where we were speaking
directly to the consumer

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.680
through social-- primarily at
the time Twitter and Facebook--

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.680
and really telling people
about our story directly,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.650
not going through the trades
and sort of the normal way

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.910
you would launch a brand.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.770
Showing product before
it was finished,

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.710
selling swatches of leather,
talking about our relationship

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.842
with the College for Creative
Studies, where we're based,

00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:14.800
to the degree that some
people were confused as

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.650
to what we were.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.680
They would be like, are
you a watch company?

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.860
Are you a bike company?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.490
Are you a school?

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.210
But that really helped lead us
to the launch of the Runwell.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.160
Fast forward to March of 2013.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.010
We had about 10,000 people on
our e-mail lists at that point.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.050
And about the same
number of followers

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.140
on Facebook and Twitter.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.820
And we launched the watch.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.470
We hadn't actually
made the watch yet.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.030
$550 price point.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.170
We had 2,500 units.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.380
By the end of that
week, so eight days,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.066
we sold out of the watch,
which was pretty incredible.

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.690
We really didn't know
in the beginning.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.370
There was some who thought
that Shinola would actually

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.810
be more of a company to make
watches for other brands.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.830
But then when we saw the
strength of the Runwell

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.800
in the Shinola brand, we
decided to go full force.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.590
Subsequently, we've
launched these other

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.170
what we call platforms.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.390
And most recently the Canfield,
which is a refined Runwell.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.250
Bicycles.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.000
So bicycles, going back
to the '80s really,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.370
that production went offshore.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.040
The US primarily one
of the biggest names,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.674
Schwinn, you might know.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:23.840
The brand's still out there.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.740
But it's not owned by
the family anymore.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.710
They were one of the last
to move their manufacturing

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.210
overseas.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.760
So they lost the right-- or
sold the rights to their name.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.710
But they did hold onto one
piece of their business,

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.880
called Waterford
Precision Cycles.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.950
So they were making
custom bicycles, $10,000

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.350
and up, that people
would wait months for.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.040
So we met Sky Yaeger.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.810
How we approach all
of our categories

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.925
is really finding leaders
within that category.

00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:53.220
So in the case of
bikes, that was Sky.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.657
Sky said, I know the
guy we need to go to.

00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:57.240
Richard Schwinn up
there in the corner

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.885
is a great grandson of the man
who started Schwinn bicycles.

00:07:00.885 --> 00:07:02.760
And we approached him
and said, what would it

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.890
take for you to make
bicycles for Shinola?

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.120
And we said we'll probably
make about 1,000 a year.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.810
He's like, I need
to hire more people.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.110
So we're like great.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.291
Right in line with
our messaging.

00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:15.540
So some people ask, well,
why are the bikes so pricey?

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.120
The Runwell is $3,000.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.720
The Bixby that you
see there is $2,000.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.500
And it's because of the
quality and the craftsmanship

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.400
that goes into it.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.470
So we make the frame
and fork with Waterford.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.900
And then we assemble the
bikes, as you see there,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.880
in our Detroit store.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.880
Paper.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.630
We work with a bindery in Ann
Arbor, or close to Ann Arbor,

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.335
called Malloy Brothers.

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:45.840
Sorry, I had a brain
fart there for a minute.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.134
And again, we really
saw the market.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.800
So with all of our
categories, we really

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.160
look at them in two
ways-- as brand builders

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.860
or as volume drivers.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.470
So bicycles, leather,
and soon to be

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.940
audio, which I'll tell
you about in a little bit,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.680
are really the volume drivers.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.700
And things like the journals,
bicycles, pet accessories,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.180
are the brand builders.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.630
They're equally as important.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:14.620
But it really helps us
not only kind of continue

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.570
to provide products that are
relevant to the lifestyle

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.510
of our consumer, but also
to add a point of difference

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.340
in the marketplace.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.770
So if you go into a
Neiman's or a Nordstrom

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.650
in the watch department you
might see a Shinola bike

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.270
hanging.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.940
We actually made all of the
buyers of the big department

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.539
stores come to Detroit before
they wanted to buy the line.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.130
So that definitely
was helpful in helping

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.110
them show the full breadth
of the brand in their stores.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.850
Leather.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.080
We recently signed on
a few years ago now.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.300
John and Richard.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.570
They had a brand called
Lambertson and Truex

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.140
that did very well.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.647
They're highly regarded
in the fashion industry.

00:08:53.647 --> 00:08:56.230
Then they moved on to Tiffany's
where they built their leather

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.830
business to a $50
million business,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.850
and were kind of
in semi-retirement

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.300
when we approached them to
run our leather business.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.210
So we started with a
small leather goods,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.340
and have expanded now
into bags, wallets, belts.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.920
Come this fall, we'll really
have a full representation

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.930
for women.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.290
So again, looking at leaders
within the categories

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.410
to lead the design
and production.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.540
And then pet accessories.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.610
So these are these
fun categories.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.970
Just as much work, but
ones that really help

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.410
create the buzz
around the brand.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.868
Because it's not
every day that you

00:09:31.868 --> 00:09:33.860
launch a new watch
or a new bicycle

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.660
or a new range of journals.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.372
But this is an opportunity to
get that PR earned media value.

00:09:42.372 --> 00:09:43.330
And then the marketing.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.230
So it all started--
this was the ad that we

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.470
ran going back in March 2013.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.170
At first we weren't
going to advertise.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.820
We're like, no.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.028
We're not that kind of brand.

00:09:53.028 --> 00:09:55.780
We're not going to do it.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.500
Right about when
I came on board,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.800
we hired an agency called
Partners and Spade, based out

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.430
of New York.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.130
They really helped us design the
next version of the site, which

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.690
is pretty much
what you see today,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.410
and really put a
stake in the ground

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:14.950
around Detroit-built
watches of quality.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.210
And we decided to
take this ad out.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.190
We ran it in the "New York
Times," "USA Today," "Detroit

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.780
Free Press," in the "Wall
Street Journal" sort of mid week

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.790
in the process of
selling the watch

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.820
and by the time the "New York
Times," Sunday Times style,

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.726
ran on Sunday.

00:10:29.726 --> 00:10:30.850
They were sold out already.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640
You might remember this.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.270
When Detroit
announced bankruptcy,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.765
a few days later, we ran
this in the "New York Times."

00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:41.390
"To those who have
written off Detroit,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.575
we give you the Birdie."

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:44.670
The Birdie happened to
be a watch that we were

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.340
releasing at the same time.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.840
And again, the PR value
on this was amazing.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.260
And again, you know
for me, if you guys

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.250
are familiar with PR
Newswire, that's where you

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.710
would put your press releases.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.910
I really saw the "New York
Times" as our PR Newswire.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.090
I found that when you had
something relevant that

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.250
had culturally relevant
impact, the "New York Times"

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.690
was a great vehicle.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.920
When it came to Mothers
Day and Fathers Day,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.660
and we were just announcing the
Runwell in a different color,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.590
that was probably
not the best ROI

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.964
to run a full page ad
in the "New York Times."

00:11:19.964 --> 00:11:22.130
And then the second year
we worked with Bruce Weber.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.930
So Bruce Weber, you
guys might know,

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.960
the famed fashion photographer.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.200
I like to say the first
year we showed people

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.120
what was behind our doors,
highlighting the people that

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.270
work in the factory and
establishing ourselves

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.420
as a leader within the industry.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.070
And then the next year with
our work with Bruce, really

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.280
is a love letter to Detroit,
celebrating the people

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.860
outside of our doors,
and why we came

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.760
to Detroit in the first place.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.090
Last year you might
remember the launch

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.060
in April of the Apple Watch.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.820
We called the agency I think
a week before and said, hey,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.310
can you guys come
up with something

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.140
that would kind of just
get us in the conversation

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.700
of this major launch?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.267
And so they came up with this.

00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:06.850
"A watch so smart
that it can tell you

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.410
the time just by looking at it.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:08.940
Runwell.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.130
Just smart enough."

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.905
So we ran these ads,
again, sprinkle here

00:12:13.905 --> 00:12:16.030
and there. "Wall Street
Journal," "New York Times,"

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.490
ran some digital around it too.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.960
And again, the buzz that
we created off of it

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.230
was really tremendous.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.460
In a time when-- and
we all know how much

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.030
Apple spends on advertising.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.210
So had a few friends
that work there.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.050
And I got a text from
one saying, cheeky.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.600
Which it was.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.330
And then this year.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.940
In an election
year, we knew jobs

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.290
was going to be a hot topic.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.150
And we really wanted
to celebrate the fact

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.150
that we created over 500
jobs since we launched.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.860
And so we came out
with this campaign.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.450
"There's a funny thing
that happens when you build

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.650
factories in this country.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.850
It's called jobs."

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.160
And again, really highlighting
the people behind the products.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.661
We are a true
manufacturing company

00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:57.910
built not by the things we
make, but by the people who

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.010
make them.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:05.130
This year in the past, we were
primarily-- our media plan

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.600
was primarily print.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.880
And we started to see
some diminishing returns

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.230
I would say, mid-last year.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.680
So we really did a shift
towards digital this year,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.350
working with premium partners
like "Vanity Fair," "Elle,"

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.880
"Harper's Bazaar,"
"Vice," to create content.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.730
So some of that you
guys might have seen.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.150
We'll continue with that
for second half of the year

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.740
around big product launches.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.890
So continuing to talk
about our leather,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.450
our watches, and expand
our reach outside

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.560
of our media consumers.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.710
Our big push for second half of
the year will be around women.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.520
The challenge that we do have
is that talking about jobs

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.250
is great.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.960
But when you're trying to sell
a hobo bag, talking about jobs

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.330
doesn't really help.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.650
It doesn't mean that women
don't care about creating jobs.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.110
But when you're trying to sell
someone this great leather bag,

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.700
that messaging doesn't
always link up together.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.616
So that's something that
we're working through

00:13:58.616 --> 00:14:01.400
now to understand
probably around September,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.181
around the debates, the jobs
messaging will come up again.

00:14:05.181 --> 00:14:06.930
But then we'll make a
shift towards really

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.160
focusing on celebrating
our women's product

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.410
and showing people that we're
serious about our women's

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.620
products.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.120
Retail.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.830
So our retail
environments are really,

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.260
in my view, part
of our marketing.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.740
We look at them as
living, breathing things.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.910
They're not museums
for products.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.980
They're really community spaces.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.930
So we activate our stores quite
frequently, two to three times

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.310
a month.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.800
We not only throw
our own events,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.930
but we open them up
to the community.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.320
So the local PR association
might hold their annual meeting

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.820
in the morning.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.990
We work with Creative Mornings
to hold talks in our stores.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.780
We're currently working with
a local barber shop in Detroit

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.430
called The Social Club, too.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.920
They do a series called Shop
Talk, where they actually cut

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.230
people's hair while they're
participating in a talk.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.480
It sounds weird, but it works.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.330
If anybody has attended,
they're pretty interesting.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.980
So we're doing that not only
in Detroit and Ann Arbor,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.010
but across cities.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.480
DC, New York, LA.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.362
And each store is really unique,
taking on the personality not

00:15:14.362 --> 00:15:15.820
only of the building
that we're in,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.440
but also the city that we're in.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.220
And there's a few.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.380
We're now at is
it 15, 16 stores?

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.440
By the end of this year
we'll have 20, and aim

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.502
to open eight to 10 every year.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.690
What's next.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.340
The fun part.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.490
Audio.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.040
So come October, November, we'll
start with turntables, working

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.640
with this gentleman here,
Alex Rossen, who again,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.740
is a leader within the category.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.470
He started a headphone
brand that he's got on right

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.040
there called Audeze.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.760
Looks like he has
waffles on his ears.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.520
But highly regarded within
the audiophile community.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.050
So again, we saw an opportunity.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.020
If you look at what
Beats did, Beats

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.180
charges a lot of money for a
product that doesn't really

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.360
warrant that price point.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.330
And everyone, you walk
around and you see them.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.788
Sure, a lot of
people in the office

00:16:06.788 --> 00:16:08.460
might have Beats headphones.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.640
But our audiophile
friends tell us

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.030
that it is not the
quality that it

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.280
should be for the price point.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.310
So we saw an opportunity
to bring value

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:23.170
into the category with good
design and audiophile quality.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.020
And then jewelry.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.120
So some of you may
recognize Pamela Love.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.700
She's a designer
out of New York.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.000
We're partnering
with her to launch

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.330
jewelry come mid-October.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.040
This will be part of a larger
Shinola women's launch.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.530
So not only jewelry, but
expanding our watch offering

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.760
in a new collection
called Gomelsky.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.790
We do have a style right
now called Gomelsky.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.360
But this is sort of
an offshoot of that.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.740
And this is one of
my favorite films

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.816
that we did with Bruce Weber.

00:16:51.816 --> 00:16:52.482
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:52.482 --> 00:16:53.130
-You know what?

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:58.096
Um, I think that when
it comes to Detroit,

00:16:58.096 --> 00:17:00.600
I view it just how I view love.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.680
Like I feel like in everything
you have like a soul mate.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.510
Right?

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:08.660
If I had to just give like one
line about the city of Detroit,

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.490
I would most definitely
say that I belong here.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.540
And it is definitely
a soul mate of mine.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.380
I was working on this
poem a few days ago.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.050
It's about the city of Detroit.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.506
But it's how it breathes
like, greatness, great kids,

00:17:21.506 --> 00:17:23.130
great boys, great
girls, how we grow up

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.380
to be great men and women.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.079
And I wanted to read it
to you, if that's fine.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.750
"Somewhere in the
projects, there's

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.750
a kid working on a project
to project to the world.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.100
He lives in a city that grows
boys and girls into lions

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.220
and tigers, a city that
takes the fire and the ashes,

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.120
builds, rebuilds,
turns abandoned houses

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.480
and empty fields into
things worth looking at.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.210
A place that never looks back.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.230
The center stage of a nation,
the heartbeat, the patience,

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.470
the music, the Motown, the
midtown, the downtown, the

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.790
always come back around.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.110
We fight for our
reputation, walk, ride,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.450
bike to our destination.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.640
Practice patient knows that
they can't forget about us.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.680
Detroit, the city that continues
to call the world's bluff.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.060
Somewhere there's a kid
working on a project

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.210
to project from a city that's
rebuilding, that we building

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.500
from the ashes together
so that everywhere there

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.790
can be Detroit.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:20.890
-Beautiful.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:21.330
God bless you.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:21.830
-Thank you.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.580
Thank you.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.710
-God bless you.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.360
-I'm glad you liked it.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.407
Thank you.

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:28.990
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:36.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.600
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.270
That was really powerful.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.354
I can see why you like it.

00:18:41.354 --> 00:18:42.936
BRIDGET RUSSO: It's
now two years old,

00:18:42.936 --> 00:18:44.410
and I think still
totally relevant.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.240
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.030
So you mentioned--
I've heard you

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.150
say in some of your
discussions, this idea

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.890
of conscious consumerism
and how a brand is

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.920
basically responsible for
being a really good brand.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.120
And so when you look
at some of this,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.430
and you can see how
you're investing

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.847
in having the best
people, build the products

00:19:06.847 --> 00:19:07.680
you want to present.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.180
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.013
BRIDGET RUSSO: Yeah.

00:19:10.013 --> 00:19:12.670
So it's a concept
that I was first

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.440
introduced to when
working for Bono and Ali

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.090
back in 2004 when they
launched the brand Eden.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.090
And they were really
pioneers in the space,

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.710
especially in fashion.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.190
The idea of conscious fashion.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.100
People didn't understand.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.990
The green movement
was happening.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.790
There was some organic
brands out there.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.930
None of them were
all that fashionable.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:37.980
So this idea that you could
have quality product out there,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.180
but by the nature of
your business practices,

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.040
your production
practices, you were also

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.420
helping to build communities
and have a positive impact.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.970
Coming from the fashion
industry, where you never

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.120
talked about your production,
in part because you didn't want

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.790
to let your competitors know
where you were manufacturing,

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.130
but also now we
know so many things

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.184
have happened since then.

00:19:59.184 --> 00:20:00.850
You guys probably
weren't even born yet.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.060
Kathie Lee Gifford.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:02.580
Nike.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.570
And everything subsequently
that happened from there.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.030
It wasn't pretty.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:12.200
The fashion industry can
be a pretty ugly industry,

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.050
or has been in the past.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:14.980
Not intentionally.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.360
I think as things went offshore,
that control and understanding

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.740
of how things were being
manufactured in other places,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.310
they weren't up to the
same standards as the US.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.010
So a lot of people
early on got burned.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.210
I don't think Nike
set out intentionally

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.580
to have children
making their clothes.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.730
But unfortunately, it's hard
to have that control when

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.170
you're doing things overseas.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.140
A lot has changed.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.559
But this idea of buying
products and supporting products

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:45.350
that have a positive
impact, whether that's

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.880
on the environment, whether
that's on the community,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.660
I think now for millennials
and anyone that's under 30,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.460
I think that's a big part
of that purchase decision.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.560
Certainly as for me,
I'm not under 30.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.910
But I think if all
other things are equal,

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.330
I'm willing to pay
a little bit more

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.330
to know that this
product is having

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.000
some sort of positive impact.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.460
At the end of the day, it still
has to be a strong product.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.290
So we learned it
even the hard way.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.370
We really put the mission
in front of the brand,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.750
and though of product second.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.210
And at Shinola, what I
really loved when I met them,

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.170
I was like, wow.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.890
This product is amazing.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.780
The fact that we were
creating jobs to me

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.840
was the cherry on top.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.020
But that product needs
to stand on its own.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.110
SPEAKER 1: Do you see that as
being increasingly challenging

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.690
as the demand for the
product increases,

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.410
and the scale and
the volume that you

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.820
need to fulfill that
demand increases?

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.240
As we think of other brands
who have maybe mentioned even

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.260
Nike in this case.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.300
Do you see that as a
challenge for Shinola?

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.841
BRIDGET RUSSO: It's
a huge challenge.

00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:52.530
You know, as you grow, and
we really look at everything

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.450
we do from in the beginning,
we looked at where

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.690
to source our shopping bags.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.960
And we said, well, we can
source them in the States

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.880
and spend $12 on them.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.450
Or we could take the savings
of sourcing the bag overseas

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.340
and put it towards R&amp;D to doing
what we're doing in Detroit

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.920
and helping to grow that.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.440
And since then, we started
with the watch factory.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.812
I didn't mention, but we opened
a leather factory two years ago

00:22:15.812 --> 00:22:18.510
where we're producing the
majority of our leather watch

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.690
straps and some of our
small leather goods.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.470
So again, continuing to
add to that capacity.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.650
The reality is, we're
in a global economy.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.370
So every single component
is not made under one roof.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.380
That hasn't existed
for a very long time.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.320
We felt very strongly
what we were doing-- we

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.900
were doing more than assembly.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.910
And so we use the word "build."

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.570
You guys probably read that's
got us into a little hot water

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.110
recently.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:48.210
But I think it's an opportunity
for us to work with the FTC

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:54.330
on clarifying for the consumer
and makers of products to say,

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.330
this isn't clear.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.740
It's not clear for the consumer.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.180
And it's not clear
for anyone who's

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.360
just trying to do business and
do the right thing in the US.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.200
You know, I can tell you
from experience there's stuff

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.770
out there that
says made in Italy

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.950
or made in France that is
definitely not made there.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:15.020
They might add a zipper at
the end, or a small stitch.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.800
And their country
allows them to say

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.250
that to preserve their
industry, or what's left of it.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.190
So this is happening
across the board.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:29.320
You know, the one thing I
can say to anyone, please.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.420
We do do tours.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.910
You're welcome to sign
yourself up for one.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.170
You walk through that factory.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.660
And you see the people there,
most of them Detroiters.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.600
It's hard to say
that we're not having

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.980
a positive social impact.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:47.080
And the most disheartening
thing about it

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.660
is when you try and
suggest to these people

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.610
that what they're
doing isn't important,

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.180
or what they're doing-- I heard
some comments, as people do,

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:55.854
on social media.

00:23:55.854 --> 00:23:56.895
Oh, a monkey can do that.

00:23:56.895 --> 00:23:59.080
It's like putting
together Ikea furniture.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.140
First of all, I'm
challenged putting together

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.540
Ikea furniture.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.790
I'm challenged putting
anything together, it seems.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.930
But it is hard.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.240
A watch is made up of
these tiny little parts.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.810
And to suggest that assembly
is not as complicated

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.890
or not an important job.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.324
It takes some level of skill.

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:21.740
You know, that's why we felt
very strongly around the word

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.960
"build."

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.240
Now we have to
qualify that to make

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.030
sure its clear that
its a combination of US

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.650
and imported parts,
something that we were always

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.960
transparent about when
you look into our FAQs.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.100
In fact, there's a question
is this American made?

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.400
And we answer that, and have
done from the very beginning.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:44.220
But I think that as a
brand, and also the FTC,

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.760
need to take this opportunity
to educate the consumer.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.892
Maybe there is a--
like with food.

00:24:48.892 --> 00:24:50.600
You know, if you guys
remember with food,

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.910
it was sort of the Wild West.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.170
And people-- natural and organic
and what did it all mean.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.870
Well now there are systems in
place and labeling in place.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.820
Maybe we need to do the same
thing with consumer goods.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.320
SPEAKER 1: Well,
it's clear that you

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.108
have made an impact in Detroit
beyond today's news of the FTC.

00:25:08.108 --> 00:25:12.660
So how does that--
sounds like you've

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.420
been trying to do that
regardless of what

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.660
retail store-- what location
you open a retail store.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.120
How do you guys factor that
into where you do open them up?

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.780
And how do you look to embed
yourselves in the community?

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.270
Like I know even
this Saturday you

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.740
have a local band playing
at the store in Detroit.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.480
So tell us a little
bit about how

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.030
you've continued to look
at where you open stores,

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.907
and how important
you've made an impact,

00:25:36.907 --> 00:25:39.240
but you're trying to make an
impact in the local market.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.010
BRIDGET RUSSO: I think for
us it's always a balance.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.500
We recently got
some investments.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.870
So we have a board of directors.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.780
And so there's a
responsibility we have now

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:55.040
to a group of people
versus one person.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.730
But we were just actually
having this conversation today.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.200
We're still a baby brand.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.350
So there has to be
that balance of brand

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.540
building and making sure that
we're still unique and special

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.940
for people, and high touch,
and also getting the ROI

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.620
and getting us to
profitability to make sure

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.720
that we're being
responsible and also growing

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.630
a sustainable brand.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.090
As far as the community
aspect is concerned,

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.439
we'll continue to look
at our manufacturing,

00:26:23.439 --> 00:26:25.730
not just in Detroit-- we're
actually looking at Chicago

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.370
potentially for eyewear.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:32.200
So parts of the manufacturing
that we can do in the States,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.110
we will.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.900
Whether that's through
our own facilities,

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:39.050
or partnering with facilities
that are out there.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.939
One of our leather
partners potentially

00:26:41.939 --> 00:26:43.730
could close, because
their rent's going up.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.771
And they can't afford it.

00:26:44.771 --> 00:26:47.280
So it's looking at
that and saying,

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.930
maybe we can put them
together with manufacturers

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.450
that we know in Florida
to combine efforts.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.160
One is strong in
high end hand-bags.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.940
The other one has great
process and back of house.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.570
How do you bring-- there's
so much time and effort

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.560
that we put into these
things to continue

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.300
to stand behind our goal, which
is to create American jobs.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.070
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.590
BRIDGET RUSSO: On a local
level, we go into markets

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.050
and really either it's
working with an agency

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:20.250
or just going in on our own
and making those relationships

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.340
with the local community.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.250
So the local makers,
different organizations

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.580
that are working
on job creation,

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.070
and really embedding ourself.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.370
In some cases, it might
be as simple as hosting

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.730
an event for them in our
store, or a fundraiser,

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.540
or donating a watch
for an auction.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.360
But again, making those
relationships on a local

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.240
level as well.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.150
And hopefully as we
start to grow and really

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:53.250
start to push through
tentpole initiatives,

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.160
I think the idea of
workforce development

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.140
is something that we can
be thought leaders in.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.380
So we're talking
now on how do we--

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.200
whether it's partnering with Job
Corps, which was started in DC,

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.790
but has local chapters
across the US,

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.280
and really help playing an
active role in this workforce

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:11.780
development.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.310
Because the reality
is-- and I was just

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.950
starting to educate
myself on it--

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.680
there's I think it's
something like 2 million

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.921
what they call middle
skill jobs out there.

00:28:21.921 --> 00:28:24.860
So primarily trade
manufacturing jobs,

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.900
that there are no longer that
generation with that skill set.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.670
So it's like a dying
breed of artisans.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:32.920
And two things need to happen.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.660
One, there needs to
be infrastructure

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.950
for the training.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.420
But also a PR
campaign to encourage

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.930
people to take these
jobs, because it's

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:45.440
a better job than working
at McDonald's or any

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.670
of the big box stores.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:51.240
And it's an opportunity to learn
a craft and work your way up.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.420
My mother owned a factory.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.720
She started working in
a factory in New York.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.577
And it put food on our table
and put me through school

00:28:58.577 --> 00:28:59.410
and through college.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.580
So it is a career opportunity.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.370
And we need to kind
of change the face

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.500
of what these jobs are.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.829
They're not dirty jobs.

00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:08.620
They're actually career
paths for everyone.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.441
It's not-- some people will
go on and start their own tech

00:29:12.441 --> 00:29:12.940
business.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.190
Or some people may decide
they want to be designers.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.880
But there's a lot of
these jobs out there,

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.136
and not the skilled
labor force to take them.

00:29:20.136 --> 00:29:21.760
And then we have the
unemployment rate.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.420
So you know, these things
can be mutually beneficial.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.500
SPEAKER 1: So was that a premise
at the start, do you think,

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.820
for the company at the heart
of it was job creation?

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.930
Did it start as really, really
strong, well-made products,

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.290
and then the job creation thing?

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.290
Because it is a really
interesting component.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.748
You didn't actually
mention I think

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:47.030
eyewear is one of the next areas
that you're going to go into.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:51.080
So you think about eyewear
and how you would now

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.470
repeat this whole process of
finding the right partners

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.190
and go about selling it.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:57.240
So curious about that.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.823
BRIDGET RUSSO: Job
creation was always

00:29:58.823 --> 00:30:00.840
part of the conversation,
alongside making

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.470
quality products that
were well-designed

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.610
and that were classic.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.870
From the business opportunities
standpoint, watches,

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:09.430
for instance.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:13.180
So you have watches at the
what they call fashion watches.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.780
So Michael Kors and brands
such as that at the $350, $500

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.280
range.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.830
And then you have
the high end luxury

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:22.880
watches-- Tag
Heuer and the like.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.130
And no one was really
at our price point

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:30.950
offering the quality with the
great brand story behind it.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.710
So we saw a business
opportunity as well.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.150
Warby Parker's a good example.

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.100
They saw a business opportunity.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.910
And they also have
a social impact part

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.560
of their business, which if you
notice is not front and center.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.350
It's sort of behind
the scenes, even more

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.800
so now than ever before,
when they first launched.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.380
So I think ultimately it has
to start with good product.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.870
It has to be somewhat
of a differentiator

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:53.980
in the marketplace.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.210
And there has to be a positive
impact in some way, shape,

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.200
or form, whether it's
double bottom line,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.670
or triple bottom line,
which is hard to achieve.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.500
But you know, I think
it's important now.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.431
And in the long-term,
it's just good business.

00:31:07.431 --> 00:31:09.930
SPEAKER 1: So always back to
that conscious consumerism type

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.740
thing.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.300
So we're here at Google.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.100
And data is part of our world.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.170
We love data.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.180
And so some of the
marketing examples as a CMO,

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.480
you talked about are
traditionally based.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.070
And then a lot of experiential
things you talked about

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.430
in your retail stores.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.970
Very experientially based.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.110
So can you talk
to this group who

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:34.250
really looks at a lot of data
in the campaigns and things

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:38.090
that they do, how you
think about marketing

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.974
and what kind of
data you look at

00:31:39.974 --> 00:31:41.890
based on the things that
are important to you,

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.391
and trying to reach
these consumers.

00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:44.223
BRIDGET RUSSO: Yeah.

00:31:44.223 --> 00:31:46.250
In the beginning we didn't
have data to look at.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.080
We had nothing to
benchmark it against.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.930
Now going into our fourth
year, we do have that data.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.590
And we are diving into that data
and actually working with you

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:00.210
guys, as well as a group
out of DC called Resonate

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.600
to really hone in on, OK.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.980
We have this fan base
here of Shinola advocates

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.050
and super fans.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.270
We know there are like people
out there who don't even

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.260
know we exist yet.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.380
So how do we develop
those personas?

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.840
And then we're-- first time
ever, believe it or not,

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.670
doing programmatic.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.870
So really looking at like
individuals out there,

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:28.150
and using a lot of
digital to reach them,

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.230
really cutting back on print.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.660
I'm a still big fan
on experiential.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.840
I think at the end,
it's about the mix.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.450
It's not like, oh, all
digital is the way to go,

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.834
or all print is the way to go.

00:32:38.834 --> 00:32:40.250
It's about the
mix, because that's

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.930
how people live their lives.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.330
That's how they're consuming
media and information.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.150
So it can't be all one way.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:50.300
I think part of the
success early on is that--

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.711
and again, this is
somewhat anecdotal.

00:32:52.711 --> 00:32:54.960
But people would tell me,
oh, you guys are everywhere.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.900
Well, we weren't.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.930
And no way had a budget
to be everywhere.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.820
But we were everywhere where
they were in the right moment.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.280
So you know.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.500
And there was a lot of
great PR value there.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.770
So they saw the PR.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.970
Then they'd go online and
see the social activity.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.260
Then they'd go outside
and see the out-of-home.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.740
It's how that mix
all works together.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.830
And then you have to
be careful-- you know,

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.640
the data, depending
on how you look at it,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.180
can drive you in
a direction that

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.770
may not be the right direction.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.769
This is somewhat
of a weird example.

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:29.060
But I'll give it to you anyway.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:35.620
So when I was working for
Bono, he often told this story.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.890
There's an NGO that went
into a village in Kenya.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:43.050
And the women were
walking like 5 miles

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:46.020
to clean water every day.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:50.140
And so they came in and they
built a well in the village.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.830
And the women kept
walking the five miles.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.170
Well, no one
stopped to ask them,

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.344
we're going to build a well.

00:33:56.344 --> 00:33:57.760
Where would you
like us to put it?

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.440
So finally, after the fact,
cause they were still puzzled,

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.530
they asked, why are you
still walking five miles?

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:04.930
And they said, well, it's
to get away from the men.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.422
That's our time to get away.

00:34:07.422 --> 00:34:08.505
No one asked the question.

00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:10.629
So they were like, well,
what if we did it halfway?

00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:12.449
They're like, perfect.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.909
And that was the
well they went to.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:17.070
So we can't forget that
this data is great.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.270
But we're all human
beings, right?

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.810
And there's aspects
to our behavior

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.090
that can't be put
on a spreadsheet.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:28.139
So the emotion and the
high touch of a brand.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:32.889
If you can maintain that in
some way, shape, or form,

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.460
you know especially when
you have limited dollars,

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.500
there has to be that element
of just human nature.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.315
And I don't know the answer for
every brand of what that is.

00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:44.223
And I still watch that video,
and think, oh, maybe we

00:34:44.223 --> 00:34:45.389
should run that in theaters.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.553
Just because, you
don't even know

00:34:47.553 --> 00:34:48.719
what the hell we're selling.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:49.880
But I'm intrigued.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.750
I want to know more about that
brand after seeing that video.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.650
So it is about the balance.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:55.719
It's about the mix.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.680
And don't be so
dictated by the data

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.030
that you lose the fact that
you are all human beings

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.810
and consumers as well.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.520
And that gut feeling of
what is right and taking

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.000
some calculated risk.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.340
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.190
I want to open it
up for any questions

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.270
that you all might have that
you'd like to ask Bridget.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.069
Go ahead.

00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.920
Thanks for coming in, first off.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.212
I did not know anything
about the association

00:35:19.212 --> 00:35:21.770
with the Schwinn family
to your bicycles.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:25.610
But that seems to be a model
in your brand extension.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.772
A personality or an expert
in the field to kind of

00:35:28.772 --> 00:35:30.002
help to launch that.

00:35:30.002 --> 00:35:31.970
Can you explain the
process of identifying

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:34.437
that person that represents
best the Shinola brand,

00:35:34.437 --> 00:35:36.395
cause I would think it's
more art than science.

00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:40.060
Going back to the data, of
like, is it a relationship?

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.180
How do you identify that
person that represents how

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.019
you want to launch the brand?

00:35:45.019 --> 00:35:46.560
BRIDGET RUSSO: We've
been very lucky.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.660
Our founder knows
a lot of people.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:55.260
And so it's a little bit of
asking around, asking advice

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.460
from friends.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.240
And then some people who
just somehow cross our paths

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.490
because someone might know
what we're up to and say,

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:04.960
I've got the person for you.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.120
You need to talk to
Sky Yaeger, or you

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.510
need to talk to Alex Rossen.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:12.690
So it's been pretty organic
from that perspective.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.820
And we've never
done big searches.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.010
I mean, even we just
named Tom Lewand, our CEO,

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:20.210
we didn't put the job out there.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.970
We never did.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.910
But we just start to
put our feelers out.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.050
Tom was working with us
on some side projects.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.030
And again, it was
that gut feeling

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:32.450
that our founder felt like
this was the right guy

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.240
to help lead the brand.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.150
And so that was
kind of, at least

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.470
to date, how decisions are made
around people in particular.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.810
And it makes for a
really-- Tom, our founder,

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:48.304
refers to us as the bar
scene in "Star Wars."

00:36:48.304 --> 00:36:50.480
And they took is as that.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.320
We all come from
varied backgrounds.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.940
But I think it's helpful
in keeping us on our toes,

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.790
and also seeing
different perspectives.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:01.010
The fact that Tom comes
from the sports arena,

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.780
and coming from that
background, I think

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.586
is an interesting perspective
for-- we don't even

00:37:05.586 --> 00:37:07.210
like to call ourselves
a fashion brand.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.470
We see ourselves more
as a design brand.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.540
So I think having
those outside voices

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.780
and that outside perspective.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.380
Because if you're all in
a room with the same--

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.420
if we just had a whole
bunch of fashion people,

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.147
we'd be doing things
very differently today.

00:37:20.147 --> 00:37:20.980
SPEAKER 1: Question.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:21.600
Go ahead.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.790
AUDIENCE: The sklil
trade has always

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.255
been kind of a passion of mine.

00:37:24.255 --> 00:37:26.360
I grew up downriver
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.942
In my parents'
generation had a shop.

00:37:28.942 --> 00:37:32.676
They had a actual working auto
shop within the high school

00:37:32.676 --> 00:37:33.300
and everything.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.660
And that generation was such
a stigma on [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.660
How do you feel
especially with how deeply

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.624
passionate people [INAUDIBLE]
upper middle that probably

00:37:44.624 --> 00:37:47.079
came from those families
that had the stigma.

00:37:47.079 --> 00:37:48.061
How do you do that?

00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:51.007
And where do you start
to try to remove it?

00:37:51.007 --> 00:37:52.480
Does it start with politicians?

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.953
Does it start in schools?

00:37:53.953 --> 00:37:56.430
Does it start with the brand
advocates that you have?

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.346
Recalibrating their
brand mindset?

00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:00.501
Where'd it really
start to get rid

00:38:00.501 --> 00:38:02.657
of that trade school
of underachieving,

00:38:02.657 --> 00:38:04.402
and you have to go to
a four-year school.

00:38:04.402 --> 00:38:06.652
Because those jobs aren't
gonna [INAUDIBLE] the skills

00:38:06.652 --> 00:38:09.007
do transcend and [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:09.007 --> 00:38:09.840
BRIDGET RUSSO: Yeah.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.510
I think definitely education
is one piece, and working

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:15.050
at the civil level,
just make sure

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.870
that you have the support
locally in these cities,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.170
because there are certain
cities like Detroit that

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:27.480
are more better poised
to really drive this.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.790
Buffalo is another good city.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:35.240
And also working with
partners in the media who

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.010
have such control now to really
shape people's opinions one

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.860
way or the other, to
help tell the story.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.680
And you know, especially
now with things like Etsy,

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.980
for instance.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.100
I think it's coming
back to where people

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.490
are interested in learning how
to make things on their own,

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.540
making things and selling them.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:58.590
Now with the great platform that
you can go direct to consumer.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.190
So it's good timing.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.090
And I think now
with kids coming out

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.170
of college with that degree,
that really expensive degree,

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.900
and no guarantee of a job, zero.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.440
You know.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.160
So people are looking
at different ways

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.710
of how they can build a career.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.890
And it's not the
traditional doctor, lawyer.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.620
Not everyone can
be an entrepreneur

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.760
and make the next
Uber or whatever.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.630
So education's a
big piece of it.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:31.150
But that you need that support
at the civil level to-- oh,

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.910
what's the word?

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:37.320
Making sure that there are
certain land agreements,

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.590
that it's not just about
building luxury condos.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.380
Because it's very
quick to say a factory

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:47.540
will not yield as much from
a real estate perspective

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.570
than a luxury condo.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.980
But you know, that's not going
to help build a community.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:57.200
And certainly not help build
diversity within the community.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.350
And I'm hoping Detroit
has an opportunity.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.940
And there's a lot of
people working hard at this

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.220
to help build this
infrastructure.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.770
And also, if we can
make it work in Detroit,

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:12.030
that's the blueprint, let's
hope, to do it in other cities.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.620
But I was one of those kids
who grew up in the factory.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.770
And I said from
a very young age,

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.060
I would never work
in the factory.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.050
My brothers, on the other
hand, did work in the factory.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.740
Made a lot more
money than I did.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:30.090
Got burned when things
by the '90s, that was it.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.430
But it's all coming back now.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.390
My brother actually
held on to his machines.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.560
And now his knitting
business, he's

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.117
getting the phone calls
that-- a lot of people

00:40:39.117 --> 00:40:39.950
sold their machines.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.260
He happened to hold on.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.167
But I think there's a
huge opportunity there.

00:40:44.167 --> 00:40:46.500
But it's going to be a lot
of different entities working

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.010
together.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.950
And there needs to
be a huge PR campaign

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:53.440
that the media can help drive
to change the perception.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.190
SPEAKER 1: So a lot
of people in this room

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.310
work with CMOs every day.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:02.920
They have to go and meet
and provide thoughts, ideas.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.420
Sitting there-- and
obviously you've

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.790
had a good PR background.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.690
It's helped set you
up for a lot of things

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:09.060
you're even handling today.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.560
Could you give them advice?

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.730
And how do you think
about when people

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.890
come in-- you said you
talked to your agency

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.794
about the ad that was going to
run when the Apple Watch was

00:41:18.794 --> 00:41:19.460
being announced.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:23.390
Can you give us any advice
for how you think about it?

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:26.240
Or when someone comes in to
talk with you about ideas

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.665
or thoughts, how you
think about things?

00:41:28.665 --> 00:41:30.040
BRIDGET RUSSO:
For me, I'm always

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.790
impressed when someone takes
the time to research your brand.

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:36.290
All the information's
out there now.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.050
Not all of it accurate.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:41.350
But there is a lot
of sources out there

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.790
where you can really educate
yourself about a brand.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.340
I mean, even for people
who are interviewing.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.320
I'm often shocked by people who
don't really do their research.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.960
I went, why are you here?

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.370
So do your research.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.410
Help them realize
that you took a moment

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.890
to not only understand
their brand,

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.265
but to understand
their business.

00:42:00.265 --> 00:42:03.600
So not only researching
Shinola, but looking

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:08.371
at where we sit in Nordstrom
and who's our competitive set,

00:42:08.371 --> 00:42:10.620
and looking at their business
leading up to a meeting.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.160
You don't need to
become a watch expert.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.920
But just gathering
that information

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.896
and bringing that to
the meeting to say,

00:42:17.896 --> 00:42:19.020
we looked at your business.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.680
We looked at your
competitive set.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.264
And here's some
learnings that we had

00:42:22.264 --> 00:42:23.430
from an outside perspective.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.640
Because often you guys
might see something

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.580
that we don't see because
we're in the thick of it.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.064
So I think a fresh approach
to just the information

00:42:32.064 --> 00:42:34.230
that's out there before you
even get to the meeting.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.440
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.490
You had a question.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.470
Go ahead.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:40.935
AUDIENCE: We all know Detroit is
world-famous for manufacturing.

00:42:40.935 --> 00:42:42.420
You talked about that.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.895
But also famous for creativity.

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:51.330
And I wondered if you could
speak a little bit to Detroit's

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.805
influence on Shinola designs.

00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:56.775
[INAUDIBLE] the
future, especially

00:42:56.775 --> 00:43:01.972
with some of these world-class
leaders in the new areas

00:43:01.972 --> 00:43:06.180
you're going into being New
York based, as you might expect.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.645
But how is Detroit
perhaps playing the role

00:43:09.645 --> 00:43:11.925
of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:11.925 --> 00:43:13.300
BRIDGET RUSSO:
For us, we're very

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.270
from a product perspective,
inspired by the architecture.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.820
So definitely the
architecture of Detroit.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.810
I would say the spirit and
the attitude of Detroit

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.000
you see in our marketing.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.650
And sort of the irreverence of
our voice comes from Detroit.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:34.560
That Detroit versus
everybody sort of sentiment.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:40.240
You know, I do think that in
order for Detroit to really

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.580
be a player as it was in
the global marketplace

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.300
from a creativity
innovation standpoint,

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.320
it needs to be a place
that maintains its talent,

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.660
because often what happens
is the talent's here.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:53.740
And they leave.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.590
They go to Chicago.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.070
They go to New York, because
the opportunity isn't here.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:02.220
So as businesses continue
to grow or move to Detroit,

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.340
I think that's an
opportunity to get back

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.810
in the ranks, if you will,
of being an innovative city,

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.610
of being a city that
drives creative.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.990
It certainly inspires
us every day.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:18.620
But I think being able
to keep the talent that

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.734
comes here is something
that we need to work on.

00:44:21.734 --> 00:44:23.900
I mean, the education system
is a whole other thing,

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.790
because if you're a young person
or if you're coming married

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.535
with kids, I don't have kids.

00:44:29.535 --> 00:44:30.410
So I live in Detroit.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:33.450
I'm not worried about the
education system personally.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.970
But it's a huge
problem, because I

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.680
have colleagues
of mine that say I

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.930
would love to live in Detroit.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.971
But I don't know where to
send my kids to school.

00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:44.080
So they'd drive them to
Grosse Point or whatever.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.830
After a while-- first
of all, not everyone

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.250
has access to do that.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.040
So those are things that
are really important.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.660
Just basic things.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.750
Our public school system
really needs a lot of work

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:57.450
in order to make this
an attractive city

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.890
for creative people, for
business-minded people

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:02.260
to live in, and build
a family, and not

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.260
have to go live in the
suburbs because they need

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.850
to be in a certain zip
code for their kids

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:07.820
to go to a good school.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.486
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:45:08.486 --> 00:45:10.290
Very important.

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:10.840
I'll

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.533
One last question
from the audience.

00:45:12.533 --> 00:45:14.301
And I'll close with one.

00:45:14.301 --> 00:45:14.800
Go ahead.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.720
AUDIENCE: So this may be a
little bit of [INAUDIBLE] here.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.270
When Shinola was
started, to what extent

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.910
was Detroit factored in
as the only location?

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:27.834
Or was it like, one of several
locations that were considered?

00:45:27.834 --> 00:45:29.720
I've heard how price
point was factored

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.872
into choosing Detroit
as a potential location

00:45:31.872 --> 00:45:32.830
to headquarter Shinola.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.884
And then part two of that.

00:45:34.884 --> 00:45:36.462
As you expand
internationally, what

00:45:36.462 --> 00:45:39.236
is the recognition of Detroit
on the international level?

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:41.354
And do you think that
Shinola itself is now

00:45:41.354 --> 00:45:43.520
going to become the vehicle
to help promote Detroit?

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.600
Rather than Detroit
promoted Shinola,

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.250
it almost seems like
it's now Shinola's turn

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.137
to promote Detroit [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:50.137 --> 00:45:52.220
BRIDGET RUSSO: Well, we
definitely are doing that.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.070
I mean, this brand,
part of our DNA,

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:58.710
what we built this brand on is
the fact that we're in Detroit,

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.610
the fact that we
have a watch factory

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:03.650
and a leather
factory in Detroit.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:06.560
The intention was always that
this would be a global brand.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:11.320
We didn't know how
the Detroit name would

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.190
resonate certainly outside
of Michigan, but even outside

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.840
of the US.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.440
What we're finding is people--
it's resonating because it's

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.550
that underdog story.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.128
People want Detroit to win.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:27.284
There's a Detroit everywhere.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.880
So, sorry.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.605
It is resonating.

00:46:38.605 --> 00:46:39.752
And I'm choking.

00:46:39.752 --> 00:46:41.440
SPEAKER 1: No, don't
choke, don't choke.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:41.939
It's funny.

00:46:41.939 --> 00:46:44.520
Cause I think as we
travel, many of us

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.010
travel all over the place.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:49.100
And we probably all feel that
we're the ones standing up

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:49.880
for Detroit.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.990
I know whether I'm here
or internationally, I

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.840
get teased a lot.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.580
Oh, Detroit.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.500
What's happening in Detroit?

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.416
And I'm like, come on.

00:46:58.416 --> 00:46:59.160
Detroit's great.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.940
So I feel like we're all
feel that a lot of time.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.170
BRIDGET RUSSO: But to
answer the price question.

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.472
It wasn't really so much price.

00:47:06.472 --> 00:47:08.680
Cause we invested a lot of
money to build the factory

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.030
and do the training,
which we continue to do.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.220
And we did not take
the tax incentives

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.240
that were offered to us.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.910
Certainly it's cheaper to
open a factory in Detroit

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:22.490
than it is in the middle
of Manhattan or LA.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:26.300
But really the
opportunity that we saw,

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.970
you had a workforce, a
trained and talented workforce

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:31.427
that were sitting without jobs.

00:47:31.427 --> 00:47:33.885
So we thought we could transfer
that skill into watchmaking

00:47:33.885 --> 00:47:36.250
and leather making.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.660
So sure.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.452
Is it cheaper to open
a factory in Detroit?

00:47:39.452 --> 00:47:39.951
Yes.

00:47:39.951 --> 00:47:42.500
I mean, that's changing now
with real estate booming the way

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.130
that it's doing.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.730
But it wasn't necessarily
about the price.

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:51.232
It was about the opportunity
and the talent base that

00:47:51.232 --> 00:47:52.440
exists here in manufacturing.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.650
SPEAKER 1: And so
one last question.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.600
You mentioned Shinola
to be a global brand.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.080
It's only about five years old.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.580
So what are the global
brands, the iconic brands

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.400
that may be on the wall or
in the thoughts of those

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.444
at Shinola to emulate?

00:48:10.444 --> 00:48:12.860
BRIDGET RUSSO: You know, even
though we poked fun at them,

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:16.320
Apple definitely is up there.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.950
And it was all in good fun.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:21.150
You know, Tesla.

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:22.690
Virgin.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.340
These are all brands
that we aspire to.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:29.630
I think Tesla would probably
be number one on that list.

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:30.140
You know.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:35.040
And it's been amazing to
just be a part of what's

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.950
happening in Detroit.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.580
We're one of you guys know,
how many people they're

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:42.090
working both small and on a
large scale like Dan Gilbert

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.590
to really help bring the
city back on its feet.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.760
And my hope is that
it continues to be

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.590
a place of equal opportunity,
that it doesn't just

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:57.610
become my lovely New York,
that million dollar plus condos

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:01.030
that most people can't
afford, because it really

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.540
hurts a city when it becomes
homogeneous like that.

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:08.730
So you have to make sure there's
a balance of opportunity that

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:10.900
maintains the diversity.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.100
That's one thing that I think
New York lost over the years,

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.600
because now you turn around,
and everywhere you go-- I mean,

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.130
Bed-Stuy, which I
remember growing up

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.260
as a kid in Brooklyn,
you just didn't go there.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.570
And now it's like luxury
apartment buildings

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.220
and townhouses all
over the place.

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:29.720
So.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.354
And that's going to keep
the creativity here as well.

00:49:32.354 --> 00:49:34.520
SPEAKER 1: Well, we want
to thank you for your time.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.740
We know how busy you are.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.940
And we have a
little gift for you.

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.210
And thank you for being
part of our first talks

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.840
at Google in the
