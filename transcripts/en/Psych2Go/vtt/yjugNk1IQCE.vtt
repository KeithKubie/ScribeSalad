00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.889
It's already difficult for introverts to find their niche in a world that predominantly

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.779
values extroverted tendencies. As a result, introverts needs are often overlooked,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.510
including the way they function in relationships. Here are 10 things you must consider if you're dating an introvert

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.169
Number one: Hold meaningful conversations

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.610
Introverts look for depth in a partner, someone who can keep up with them when they talk about

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.219
possibilities in theories. If there's one thing they never get tired of, it's the mere entertainment of ideas

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.869
Hoping to discuss open-ended questions, instead of ones which end in one-word answers

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.199
Enlighten them with your knowledge and wisdom. After all, intelligence is sexy, classy, and timeless

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.750
Number two: Spend time in less stimulating environments

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420
Introverts are sensitive to external surroundings

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.489
Instead of going to social parties, they prefer hanging out at small gatherings in quiet places

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.330
It's not really about the setting, but the company they choose to spend their time with

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.340
Number three: Take it slow

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.080
A slow and steady pace wins the race to an introverts heart. They're careful about who they let in

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.280
They like to gather as much information as possible, before they display more affection towards people

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.700
While their self-control might make them less exciting on the surface,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.660
There's so much more they can offer in a relationship that isn't based solely on impulse

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.679
So don't take it the wrong way if they don't display a lot of affection on the first date

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.720
Number four: Be sensitive

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.640
Introverts tend to internalize a lot, so they're prone to bottling things up inside

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.460
They need someone who can sense and consider their feelings, because they don't enjoy starting conflicts

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.740
That's not to say that they're necessarily afraid of it, but they're more careful about what battles to fight

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.780
Number five: Provide mental support

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.800
Introverts are prone to overthinking and overanalyzing

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.889
It's hard for them to stay in the present when their minds are filled with thoughts and concerns

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.890
They don't mean to do it, and it might create a distance and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.400
misunderstandings as a result. Try not to take it too personally

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.540
Chances are, they're probably ruminating over on what move to make next,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.800
because they care about how your relationship is growing, or they may have a lot of other things going on in their lives

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.500
Play the best friend role and provide support. It'll help them ease up, and they'll appreciate you more than ever

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.860
Number six: Read between the lines

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.800
Introverts are very subtle, so they're not usually outwardly flirtatious

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.620
The way they communicate is very nuanced. Pay close attention to what they say, and how they say it too.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.160
Sometimes, even the smallest phrases can have large meanings behind them

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.960
Number seven: Respect their space.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.180
While they may like you, Introverts also have a need for space

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.360
They need to go off on their own to recharge, so it's important not to be overbearing or suffocating

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.400
That would only add more to their stress levels, and may cause them to retreat within their shelves even more

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.499
Number eight: Spend quality time together

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.750
It's not about the amount of activities you guys end up doing, but the way you two interact with each other

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.880
Spending quality time with an Introvert is crucial,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.560
Although it may seem as if they go off on their own, at the end of the day,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.940
They still crave meaningful human interaction.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.680
Learning to make the most out of time spent together, creates a strong bonding experience

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.340
Number nine: Fully accept them.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.380
We live in a culture that's obsessed with self-improvement, always striving to be better

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.720
As Introverts living in an extroverted world, ever since a young age,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.200
They're seen as individuals who can be molded and conditioned to love being in the spotlight

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.420
because "better" somehow translates to "extraversion", which is pretty dehumanizing

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.340
When they're trying to build and maintain stable relationships, they don't want to be seen as potential projects to be fixed

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.740
Instead, we assure them, and be sure to express that you love them for who they are

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.780
Number ten: Don't assume

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.580
Always ask questions and communicate with Introverts. They may be slow to reveal things,

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.160
as communicating doesn't come easily to them, and their silence can often be misinterpreted

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.980
That's not to say they're incapable of expressing their thoughts,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.600
but a lot of potential conflict can be avoided, as long as you encourage them to converse with you

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.020
