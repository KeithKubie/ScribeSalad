00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.440
Where is 30 on the number line?

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.110
So on the number
line right over here,

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.090
we see that as we go from
0, the first slash isn't 1.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.590
It's 3.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.144
So every slash here is
going to go up by 3.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.060
So let's see if we can
figure out where 30 is.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.160
So this is already marked as 3.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.680
Now this is going to be 3 more.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:28.059
It's 6, 9, 12, 15,
18, 21, 24, 27, 30.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:29.850
Another way you could
have thought about it

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.750
is if each of these marks
are 3, to get to 30,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.260
we have to go to
10 of these marks.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.730
So you go 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.340
Let's do a few more.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.610
Where is 24 on the number line?

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.300
Well, once again, each of
these marks is again 3.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.880
So it's going to be 3, 6,
9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.390
Let's do one more.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.290
So now each mark is 4.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.750
So we're going to
go 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.250
Another way you
could think about it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.290
is if we're going up by 4,
you have to go up 5 times

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.270
to get up to 20.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.650
So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.725
Either way, this should
be the right answer.
