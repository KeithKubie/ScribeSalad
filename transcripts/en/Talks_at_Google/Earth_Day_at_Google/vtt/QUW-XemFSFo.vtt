MALE SPEAKER: We are thrilled
to host Sean Gerrity, who

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.220
is the president of the American
Prairie Reserve and a National

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.720
Geographic Explorer.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.645
And the aim of the
American Prairie Reserve

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:17.320
is to return to the golden era
of large scale conservation

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.220
in the United States.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.720
They aim to create
a wildlife preserve

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.450
in the prairies of Montana,
four times bigger than Yosemite,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.880
in a size that will eventually
rival that of the Serengeti

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.710
in Africa.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.380
And so in order to accomplish
that, there's the land deals,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.040
there's the acquisitions,
the plans within the park.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.200
But as Sean will say in his
speech today, the questions

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.580
and the issues that it
raises are far wider,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.070
looking at migration patterns
with birds, with animals.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.620
It's really a program of
nationwide importance.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.330
And so he will go
through and talk

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.200
about what the
foundation is up to

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.660
and show some of the
latest work and some images

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.787
from the reserve.

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:57.870
And we'll have time for
some questions at the end.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020
So please join me in
welcoming Sean to Google.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.725
Thank you.

00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:03.217
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.217 --> 00:01:05.050
SEAN GERRITY: Thank you
everybody very much.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.256
I appreciate it.

00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:07.880
And thanks for taking
the time to come.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.680
I know what a day at Google
must be like-- really busy.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.710
So I appreciate you coming out.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.920
I think what I'll do is to get
everybody kind on the same page

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.610
is start with a very
short video, just

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.160
of a few minutes,
that was developed

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.680
by National Geographic.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.840
I'll then go into more
detail about the project.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.080
And as Cliff said, we'll
take some questions for you.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.720
-The American Prairie Reserve is
the largest scale conservation

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.759
project underway now
in North America, one

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.925
of the biggest in the world.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.030
-The American Prairie
Reserve Project

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.090
is preserving one of
the fastest disappearing

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.163
pieces in the American West.

[WOLF YIPPING]

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.410
-I think one of the things
I'm most excited about

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.460
is it's not too.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.320
-When Lewis and Clark
came through here a couple

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.050
of hundred years
ago, about the time

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.070
they got to the
Montana border is

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.470
where they saw the
wildlife really

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.220
begin to increase in abundance.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.270
Modern day conservation
biology has

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.550
said we've got to
create vast reserves,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.866
if we want to bring back
all the wildlife in some

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:36.490
of these areas.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.865
And that's why when we created
the plans for the American

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:41.790
Prairie Reserve we
decided to go large.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.800
-Our ultimate dream is to
have a three million to three

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.850
and a half million acre
fully functioning ecosystem,

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.460
where all the animals that
were there 100 years ago, 150

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.655
years ago, have an opportunity
to interact with each other

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:05.925
again and have a major role
and impact on the landscape.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.610
-We're beginning to put
things back on that landscape.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.926
And we're really excited
to think about the day when

00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:29.820
it's all back in balance
the way it was for thousands

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.880
and thousands of years.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.950
-We have reintroduced bison, we
currently have about 250 bison.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.240
Clearly, we'll have the capacity
to have the largest bison

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.630
herd in the country.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:53.140
-This is about the
land and the wildlife.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.090
But it's also about people.

00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:01.146
We're very interested
in making this area

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:02.604
accessible to the public.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.360
-It has a lot of potential
for its scenic value,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.120
for its birding.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.170
-There is a lot of promise
for local communities.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.209
There's a tourism
aspect, just like you'd

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.600
find in Africa, other
parts of North America,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.260
South America, when you build
a reserve of this scale.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.940
-If somebody had
said, would you have

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.630
liked to have been a founder, a
co-founder of Yellowstone Park,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.410
how could you not want
to be on that team?

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.690
-It's an opportunity to be
involved in creating something

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.110
where you can see the tangible
results of your efforts

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.315
in your lifetime and have an
altruistic sense of accomplish.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.030
-The American Prairie Reserve
is critical to the existence

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.802
of future generations.

00:05:06.802 --> 00:05:09.790
It feeds everything
that it is to be human.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.440
-This is the time to seize
it and secure it forever,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.960
so it can be enjoyed for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:05:35.305 --> 00:05:37.800
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.770
SEAN GERRITY: OK, so as you
may have read in my background,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.260
I grew up in Montana.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.110
I work there now.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.490
But I spent about 20
years in this valley,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.490
working in a for profit.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.090
I started a company
back in 1984.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.040
It's still going 33 years later.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.180
We had an idea at the
time, and it seems

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.640
to have stuck pretty well.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.210
And I learned a lot
working here for 20 years.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.210
I know what the Valley
is like, I know the pace.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.010
I know what it takes
to be successful here.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.500
Our business at
the time, I don't

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.670
know how much it's changed.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.670
But at the time,
people in the Valley

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.200
were struggling
and going as fast

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.450
as they could to
hire the smartest

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.860
people they could
beg, borrow, or steal

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.020
to assemble their companies.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.040
And it was kind of
like hiring studio

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.130
musicians, who were exceedingly
good as individuals.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.910
But you put them all
together, and it was really

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.500
difficult sometimes
to create a band

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.080
and get those albums out the
door on a quarterly basis,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.800
before you missed the window.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.420
We had an idea on how
we could get teams up

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.700
and running, focused
on a common vision,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.190
faster than they would
normally otherwise do,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.100
particularly the
special individuals

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.145
that were coming to
the Valley at the time.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:47.020
I did that for about 20
years, and it sent me

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.000
all over the world, working with
lots of different industries,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.880
not just high tech.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.939
I was based here.

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:53.730
We built our company
up to about 40 people.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.150
And again, it's still going.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.487
So now what I've done
is parlay the skills

00:06:58.487 --> 00:07:00.820
and the ideas I got working
with so many different kinds

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.778
of folks in so many
different kinds of industry

00:07:02.778 --> 00:07:04.180
to something I
really care about,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.760
which also takes aligning a lot
of people onto a common vision,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.460
over a very long period of
time, not just for six or nine

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.282
months.

00:07:11.282 --> 00:07:13.240
So let me tell you a bit
more about the project

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.810
than the movie went into,
and what we're up to.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.770
As it said there, we're working
on a very, very large scale--

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.430
I'll tell you about that--
to put back everything that

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.340
used to be there, not
just little museum

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.570
pieces but all the
wildlife, including

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.280
the top trophic predators.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.650
Quite an ambitious effort.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.792
Some people said this
era is long gone,

00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:36.250
that you're just not able to
do this kind of thing anymore.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.970
We haven't done anything for
the last 60 years like it.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.940
We think it can be.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.300
And we're making some
really good progress.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.210
So when we talk about
big, how big are we going?

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.560
It's a lot of square miles,
comes up to over three million

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.899
acres, the size of this
thing when it's done.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:53.690
About the side of the
state of Connecticut,

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.510
for everybody who's
moved from back east.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.180
But maybe the best image is
the idea of the Serengeti,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.380
from a sheer square mile
standpoint and also the numbers

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.020
and variety of wildlife
on the landscape.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.520
Since we're in
California, if you

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.530
were to take a picture
of the eventual reserve,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.850
the size of it, if you put
one edge on the Golden Gate,

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.050
the other edge would go
far into the Sierra Nevada.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.350
Imagine one very lonely
paved road bisecting it,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.360
the rest of it all wildlife.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.105
No towns, just animals.

00:08:24.736 --> 00:08:26.610
Scientists tell us there
are only four places

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.910
left on earth to do a project
of this scale on the grasslands.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.130
Only four places left.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.840
And as we sit here today,
they're all shrinking.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.650
They're being plowed
up at the edges

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.894
to grow food for
our growing species.

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:42.842
We're working up there in
the Northern Great Plains,

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:45.050
for a lot of reasons, we
think one of the best spots,

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.010
if not the best
spot in the world

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.444
to do this kind of
project at this size.

00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:51.360
So if you zoom into the
Northern Great Plains,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.430
you'll see that it touches about
five states and two provinces

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.080
of Canada.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.710
On that little blue
spot is the best spot,

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.290
for a variety of
reasons, and it just

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.912
happens to be up in Northeastern
Montana is where it is.

00:09:02.912 --> 00:09:04.620
So a couple of reasons
why it's the best.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.930
Of all that big green
splotch there, it

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.750
has not yet been farmed,
it hasn't been plowed up.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.730
That's really key to do
something at this scale.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.872
A second reason is there's
a wildlife history that

00:09:15.872 --> 00:09:17.330
existed there, I'll
tell you about,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.710
that didn't exist anywhere
else in the Great Plains

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.190
to this extent.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.940
You don't have to buy it all.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.000
You only have to buy a small
amount and use that as glue,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.820
to pull together
existing public lands

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.930
to make the whole model work.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.150
And very unusual, unlike the
place where we're sitting here,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.620
people are moving out from
rural areas to the cities.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.450
And that's actually going
on since about World War I,

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.440
that steady decline
of population

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.500
gives us a lot of opportunity
to buy and assemble

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.795
a great deal of land.

00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:50.170
Now when you go over that
green area of the Great Plains,

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.910
most of it looks like this.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.880
It's very fragmented,
fenced, under cultivation,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.100
growing food for us, as I said.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.040
But there's one special,
very spectacular spot

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.790
in that place where
I've been showing you,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.500
where it's not yet turned over,
a blank canvas, if you will.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.540
If we can assemble it it in time
to put this whole thing back

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.832
together, we believe we do it,
and we can save it forever.

00:10:12.832 --> 00:10:15.860
The stories of wildlife have
been passed down actually

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.550
for thousands of years.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.880
People have been living on
this area, this landscape,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.420
since about 11,000 years ago,
when the last ice age receded.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.930
The stories of the wildlife
passed down through modern day

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.990
Native Americans who
have been there recently,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.710
in the last 600 or
700 years-- Crows,

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:37.050
Gros Ventre, Assiniboine,
Flatheads, Pend d'Oreilles.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.010
And people then started
writing it down,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.410
actually the stories, with
fur trappers from Hudson Bay

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.700
Company in the late
1700s, of course

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.910
Lewis and Clark,
in the early 1800s,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.230
told stories of being out
here, and what an incredibly

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.410
beautiful place it was.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.520
But also, the
wildlife experience,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.660
it was like nowhere
else in North America.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.350
People came also from Europe.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.000
Later on, as these stories
spread around the world,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.160
people like Karl Bodmer
who came from Germany

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.370
and did 50 images in this area.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.530
And they said at the
time, in the 1830s,

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.310
the Americans ought to save
this, before it's all gone.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.830
It's extraordinary.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.900
We didn't save it.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.340
Quite the opposite, with
Manifest Destiny people

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.210
came out, brought
livestock, put up fences.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.700
And the wildlife went away.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.010
And I mean, entirely went away.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.650
In that Connecticut Serengeti
size place I'm talking about,

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.850
every single bison, cougar,
grizzly bear, wolf, and more

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.730
were completely eradicated.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.580
Not one left in that area.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.650
That's a tough start
for a project like this.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.330
But while that
was happening, how

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.670
you'll probably remember in the
1870s, another idea was waxing.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.060
And that was some people
call it America's best idea,

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.210
and that's of our
national parks.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.480
It was a golden era.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.910
It lasted until
about 1950, when we

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.060
did our last one, Grand Teton.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.310
But during that amount
of time, we did Yosemite,

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.440
we did Glacier, the Grand
Canyon, the Everglades.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.890
It was incredible what happened.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.900
But we stopped.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.410
And we haven't done
one for 60 years.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.500
And ironically, we
missed the grasslands

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.082
during that golden age.

00:12:12.082 --> 00:12:13.540
And the grasslands,
because they're

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.030
low elevation and
incredible forage,

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.270
they have a carrying
capacity for wildlife,

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.530
a biological carrying
capacity for wildlife,

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.720
that exceeds all these
other parks combined.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.862
So our idea is to
restart that era.

00:12:26.862 --> 00:12:28.820
And right up there in
that dot I've showed you,

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.194
build the biggest
one that's ever

00:12:30.194 --> 00:12:32.830
been done, with an innovative
public private partnership

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.040
this time around.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.990
A million acres bigger
than Yellowstone.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.610
You can put all that wildlife
back and save it forever.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.280
I was in business
here for 20 years.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.340
I know what you guys have
to deal with each day.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.690
Focus, setting goals,
staying focused,

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.660
watching the scope creep.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.660
I know that.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.090
So we have three areas.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.120
And we always break things
into three, as you know.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.430
One is about assembling
the landscape.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.950
I'll tell you more about that.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.190
The next is when you have
the landscape together,

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.920
converting it or remodeling
it from livestock value

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.180
to biodiversity value.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.050
And lastly, how do we make sure
human beings, the people who

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.000
live in the area and
folks who are beginning

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.200
to visit from around
the world, how

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.410
do they begin to enjoy
and interact with it now?

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.116
Not waiting until
we're completely done.

00:13:18.116 --> 00:13:19.490
So going through
these three just

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.550
quickly, understanding
the landscape ownership

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.740
is key to understanding
the model, and why we can

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.680
move so fast and so affordably.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.630
That oval, there's that
Connecticut, Serengeti size

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.950
piece of property
there, it's big.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.520
The white pieces up there, the
white pieces are private land.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.960
And our model has us buying
500,000 acres of private bits

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.080
and gluing together all
the other colors, which

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.067
are different kinds
of public lands--

00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:48.400
Bureau of Land Management,
Fish and Wildlife Service, et

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.780
cetera.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.260
The idea is to put
it all together

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.520
and eventually create a
seamlessly managed reserve,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.895
after you've taken
down, frankly,

00:13:54.895 --> 00:13:58.660
thousands of miles
of barbed wire fence.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.270
The blue pieces here show
your our progress to date.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.770
We started from scratch, not
knowing how to raise money.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.000
We've raised nearly
$80 million so far.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.380
We've spent it really
quickly on land.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.460
This shows you about 16 to 17
property acquisitions to date.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.560
Our property acquisitions
tend to be big.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.340
They're about the
size of Palo Alto.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.660
Some are about the size
of Santa Clara County.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.930
That's the size of the ranches
we're putting together.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.250
Not easy, they're very complex.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.360
Eventually, we have 310,000
acres right now, we're

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.240
adding about 30,000 acres
a year to our model.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.850
When it's finished, the reserve
will look something like that.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.016
You can pull those boundaries
easily where you like.

00:14:37.016 --> 00:14:39.810
But that's the square
kilometers or square miles.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.570
Of course it won't
be that exact shape.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:42.770
But that's the idea.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.570
Seamlessly managed reserve.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.790
If you're an individual
or a herd of elk

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.040
you can walk across that.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.030
And you won't know
who owns what,

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.230
because the fences are
down, as are the "keep out"

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.650
signs that are existing today.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.900
People ask us, how can
you in this day and age

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.480
build something this big?

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.110
It must be incredibly
expensive to do this.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.272
It used to be done
by government fiat.

00:15:07.272 --> 00:15:08.730
So we say, well
take a look at some

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.580
of the things we're building
today at universities,

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.440
hospitals, museums.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.850
Next year, we're going to
start three new NFL football

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:16.840
stadiums.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.620
They come in a little
over $1 billion apiece.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.030
This project, the
biggest reserve ever done

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.180
in this country, all the
endowment, all the management

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.260
costs and all the
land purchase costs

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.980
are going to come in at just a
little bit over half the price

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.540
of one new football stadium.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.410
We think it's very
affordable, very doable.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.790
The second piece
here is the idea

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.970
of biodiversity restoration.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.470
And this is where
some of the things

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.819
I learned in Silicon
Valley come into play.

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:49.110
It's how do you look at
something that's that big, just

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.400
extraordinarily big, and get a
handle on what you just bought,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.126
and how you're going to
do the remodeling project?

00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:56.500
You need to go
out and understand

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.540
what it's like in
all kinds of seasons,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.070
in all kinds of
different topography.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.700
So in fact, using
Google technology,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.730
we're using a combination
of extremely low tech

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.260
with a very high tech
approach to doing this.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.990
It was daunting
in the beginning.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.450
We found out about
a group called

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.356
Adventurers and Scientists
for Conservation.

00:16:15.356 --> 00:16:17.071
A brilliant young
man started the idea.

00:16:17.071 --> 00:16:19.070
And he brings what's
called adventure scientists

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.200
from all around the world.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.590
And they walk on our reserve.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.370
Here, you see them in the middle
of winter, walking at about 25

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.310
below zero.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.569
They also walk in
August, at 105 above.

00:16:31.569 --> 00:16:33.360
We give them the
information and teach them

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.380
how to look for
the things that are

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.463
important to us for our
restoration and management

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:37.720
processes.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.960
They go out every day,
they're out there today.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.475
They walk anywhere from 5 to 15
miles a day, five days a week

00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:46.780
to collect the
information for us,

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.566
in all kinds of temperatures.

00:16:48.566 --> 00:16:50.440
Just in the first three
years of the project,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.190
they'll have done
one circumnavigation

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.840
of the entire earth, just
in this project area.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.220
This is six people.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.810
We switch them out
as they get tired.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.400
We get new ones, fresh horses.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.159
Here's an example.

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:04.700
Today, they're walking in what's
called the Sun Prairie unit.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.150
It's about 40 square
miles, about the size

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.252
of greater San Jose area.

00:17:09.252 --> 00:17:10.960
So this morning what
they would have done

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.970
is gotten together with
their Google tablets.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.460
They key in their GPS
units and their transects.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.006
When they go out,
they start to see

00:17:18.006 --> 00:17:20.589
information, the kind of things
that we have them looking for.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.220
They make information, they take
videos, they take photographs,

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.839
they write, et cetera.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:28.560
I live 300 miles away from the
reserve in Bozeman, Montana.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.750
And I can at night then
take a look at these pins,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.550
you're familiar with all this,
and see what happened that day.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.660
I can see they saw some
pronghorn antelope.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.490
That means they came back
from Canada in the summer.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.460
Now they're back on the
reserve, that's cool.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.460
See what they were doing,
where they were going,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.480
all of that, when they
were having their babies.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.390
They might have downloaded one
of 50 different camera traps

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.570
spread across 50 square miles.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.510
And this may look
boring, an elk eating.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.700
But it's interesting to us.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.219
It's 2:30 in the morning,
it's 15 degrees below zero.

00:17:57.219 --> 00:17:59.510
And even more interesting,
because we wanted this test,

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.900
that fence he's standing
by has one hot wire

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.970
running 7,000 volts through it.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.630
It keeps our bison in, but
it's permeable, like Gore-Tex,

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.290
to other wildlife.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.030
In about five more
minutes here, he

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.630
turns and jumps right
through the fence and scrapes

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.540
on that hot wire, and
it doesn't bother him.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.520
That's what we're looking for.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.310
So these folks, who are
doing very low tech stuff,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.860
very thoughtful, slow walking
people looking at things,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.250
using high tech they load
us the information using

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.870
Google technology.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.710
To us, we can make good
management decisions.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.100
Another challenge,
I'm sure you recognize

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.372
this with the kind of
projects you're doing.

00:18:36.372 --> 00:18:37.830
When you go for
something this big,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:38.880
it's hard to do it by yourself.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.980
You need collaborators.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.164
Here's an example of some
of our collaborators.

00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:44.580
But they come from their own
cultures and their own world.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.913
They see things differently,
speak a different language.

00:18:46.913 --> 00:18:48.290
How do you pull
them all together

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.160
to work on this one project?

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.110
I want them to look through the
same lens at this landscape,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.290
all through the same
lens, and figure out

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.300
how to work together.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.091
So we had to come up
with our own language.

00:18:59.091 --> 00:19:01.010
We called it the Freese Scale.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.300
As it's very simple thing.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.270
Mostly, we've taken
what you'd define

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.970
as a fully functioning
grassland ecosystem,

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.240
break it into 10 easily
discussable topic areas,

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.530
and say we want to
move up on the scale.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.281
We want to move into
the blue, as it were.

00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:16.780
That's what success
looks like, it's

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.080
a high score on this
particular scale.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.040
So for instance, number
eight is predators.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.980
The people who are
walking out there today,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.260
just last week they saw
their very first live cougar.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.682
Even cougar specialists
in their entire lifetime

00:19:29.682 --> 00:19:31.390
don't get to see live
cougars oftentimes.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.820
They saw one last week.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.940
So they would mark it two.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.065
At least we have a cougar.

00:19:35.065 --> 00:19:36.690
But you don't get
any higher than that.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.480
Because we have no wolves
and no grizzly bears, yet.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.799
So on big predators, you
would get a low score.

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:45.340
So our groups of
collaborators go out

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.570
into these Palo Alto or
Mountain View sized landscapes,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.650
walk, and work together, using
the same language to give

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.730
the thing a baseline score.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.600
You can add this up.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.560
Obviously, you've got
a total of 70 possible.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.800
And this particular
piece of ground got a 28.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.350
It also allows them to then talk
about year by year management

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.150
plans for moving the needle.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.010
And we all look at it
through the same way.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.000
And we have the same
success criteria.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.850
So this is really key for us.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.199
Some of the things
we're doing out there,

00:20:14.199 --> 00:20:15.490
we're doing all kinds of stuff.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.840
For instance, you saw one
of those things on fire.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.850
We want to incorporate natural
fire back into the landscape.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.550
We have to force it a bit.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.540
But we burn up lots
and lots of prairie,

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.600
like thousands of
acres at a time.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.005
That rejuvenates both the
soil, but it brings back

00:20:29.005 --> 00:20:33.010
the variety in the plant world.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.480
It's gotten too
homogeneous out there.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.550
Once we get that
variety going again,

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.830
we start to see
success in grasslands.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.690
Birds coming back
not just in numbers.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.850
We want abundance, but
we also want diversity.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.530
So when the diversity and
the abundance go up together,

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.660
now we're starting to win.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.560
We take down lots
and lots of fence,

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.040
so animals that can run
like pronghorn, like 65

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.060
miles per hour, fastest land
mammal in North America,

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.150
they don't do so well
when they hit fences.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.240
Lots of fences coming
down, hundreds of miles,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.270
allowing pronghorn, bighorn
sheep, other prairie animals

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.750
like elk to move freely
across a landscape again.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.670
We're importing some animals.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.080
Swift fox are coming soon.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.760
We started with bison, who
were gone for 100 years.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.730
We started with 16.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.780
With babies this year, we'll
be up over 600, on our way

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:26.300
to 10,000, which will be by far
the largest herd on the planet.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.540
And making room for
top trophic predators.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.780
For us, that's grizzly bears,
wolves, and mountain lions.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.290
Mountain lions just got
back, about 15 years ago,

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.700
after an 80-year absence.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.840
Wolves and bears are
getting closer all the time.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.920
Last thing, and that's
the human element,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.420
very important to us
in two distinct ways.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.960
The visitors, for sure.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.674
But what's really important
in big scale conservation

00:21:52.674 --> 00:21:54.090
around the world
is the people who

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.290
live in the periphery of
something like this vision.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.000
And you have to understand
the context you're working in.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.980
It could be fishermen,
it could be loggers.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.000
In our case, it's
cattle ranchers.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.770
More than 200 of them, raising
more than half a million head

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:08.740
of cattle.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.900
They took a long time getting
rid of all those bison, wolves,

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.760
and bears.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.051
Why would they want them back?

00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:16.050
We have to figure out--
they have to figure out,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.260
what's in this for us.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.780
They don't start off
excited, let me tell you.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.940
So we have to figure
out what can we do,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.920
if you think about it,
to soften those borders

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.790
around this big,
big, huge reserve.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.560
I mean, this is really big.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.560
How do we figure
out a way that they

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.550
can be winners in this thing?

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.960
We have a number of ideas.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.460
The first one out
of the gate that

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.350
tries to address what they want
to be, which is being a cattle

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.210
rancher, we started the only
wildlife-friendly beef company

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.440
in the US.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.080
It's called Wild Sky Beef.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.600
We're now selling thousands
of pounds of beef a week.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.410
You can get it in California,
New York, et cetera.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:51.270
Here's the idea.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.760
We go to them and say,
if you'll raise your beef

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.930
to our protocols,
which is this Freese

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.500
Scale, the exact same thing
we use to judge ourselves

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.830
in the core reserve,
you're on the periphery.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.260
If you'll raise your
beef to these protocols,

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.760
it will be like Delta, with the
silver and gold and platinum

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.440
levels.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.000
As you start to move up,
you get $0.05 per pound

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.860
live weight premium,
or $0.06, or $0.07,

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.440
depending on how far
you get up that scale.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.020
Now the neat thing is
now cattle ranchers,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.590
who were not too
excited about this,

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.350
are using the exact same scale.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.170
As you know in business, our
motivations can be different.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.080
But we're aligned to the
same desired end result,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.590
and that's beautiful.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.082
So Wild Sky is our first
idea out the door with this,

00:23:34.082 --> 00:23:35.290
and it's working pretty well.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.950
We have others to try
to soften those borders,

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.790
this is really key.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.430
I talked about biological
carrying capacity

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.930
of grasslands.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.400
Out here, there's probably a
biological carrying capacity

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.850
for about 600 grizzly bears.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.030
But what is the social
carrying capacity,

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.960
that's in the tolerance of
people, for all those bears?

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.130
It might be about
five right now.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.560
That might be pushing it.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.950
But we're going to get there.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.180
Most of our work is not science.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.250
It's actually sociology
and psychology.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.230
How do you increase the
social carrying capacity

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.070
for wildlife around the world?

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.310
Marine ecosystems are
the thing we're building.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.610
Visitors from around the
world are important to us.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.770
I've been to numerous
parks in Africa.

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.244
And it's often segmented,
based on what you can afford.

00:24:19.244 --> 00:24:20.660
We want this to
be for the public.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.572
We want this to
be for everybody.

00:24:22.572 --> 00:24:24.280
We've opened campgrounds,
just like you'd

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.279
find at the base El Cap
and Camp Four. $10 a night,

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:28.320
people are enjoying that.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.930
We're building more.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.770
We want to make sure
people are educated

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.580
and walk away enlightened
and excited and inspired.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.220
So there's lots of signage
going up, helping people

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.880
to understand species
by species how

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.980
things fit, even like prairie
dogs, in the ecological niche.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.200
Why they're so keystone,
why they're important.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.870
Some people want to
come out and camp,

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.375
but they have a different
idea what camping looks like.

00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:54.000
And they want to be out and have
the adventures during the day,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.680
happy to get dirty
being out in the wind,

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.680
traveling with our guides.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.096
But they want to
be able to say, I

00:24:58.096 --> 00:25:01.710
was in a tent, which
these are-- for sure,

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.760
they are canvas
tents, technically.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.000
But so they can go home
and brag about that.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.810
But they like air
conditioning and heat

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.590
and really nice thread
count sheets and showers

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.100
and this sort of thing.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.800
This is Kestrel Camp.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.610
They also get tired of ramen.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:16.880
So we don't give them ramen.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.970
We give them other things
when they're there.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.420
And we have a very
nice wine list.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.920
But they're out
there during the day

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.610
having these amazing,
big adventures.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.110
But then they come
back, and they're

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.050
able to spend time with
our naturalist guides,

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.650
spend time with
the other guests,

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.460
and get ready after a good
night's sleep in these tents,

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.850
go at it again the next day.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.320
There are lots of
other ways we're

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.590
getting people-- we're
working on layering in ways

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.280
to experience the prairie.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.260
I, again, 20 years
in Silicon Valley.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.010
I get the speed around here.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.360
Slowing people
down is important.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.240
What you're seeing
here is a transect

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.100
I'm doing with some
folks in September.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.890
We'll walk 250 miles,
from side to side,

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.490
across the reserve
in 14 or 15 days.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.290
Very slow circuitous
route- artists, writers,

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:05.230
some journalists, naturalists,
guides and others.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.900
And just have what we call a
land snorkeling roving salon,

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.020
basically.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.590
And yeah, it's 250 miles.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.800
Not so bad though, when
you can take time to stop

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.390
and have wonderful discussions.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.570
If any of you have
kayaked or boated

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.360
down the Grand Canyon
for three weeks,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.640
it's a similar kind of thing.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.120
Just cut off the outside
world for a while.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.640
Kids are just fantastic
to bring out here.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.430
And what I really love is when
they shut off their devices.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.840
I know it's important they
use their Google products.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.056
But for a little
bit, we ask them--

00:26:37.056 --> 00:26:38.430
they don't work
out there anyway.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.640
So we asked them to just
put down their devices,

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.700
teach them about this
naturalist stuff.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.300
And they just
absolutely come alive.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.660
They are really inspired
by what they're seeing.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.850
And we try to show them things
at the micro level, you know,

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:52.790
nematodes in the dirt.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.770
At the medium level, there are
some 2,000-pound bison walking

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.849
by, from a few yards away.

00:26:58.849 --> 00:27:01.390
But we also try to get them to
look at the big level as well.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.790
How this huge landscape, in
this big park that's being

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.850
built for them, is important.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.090
But it's connected to
something even bigger.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.680
And so we tell about
these pronghorn.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.430
Again, these are
very fast animals.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.100
But we tell them this is
only part of their home.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.100
Because every year, they
actually leave not only

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.990
Montana, but they leave
the United States.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.120
They walk 250 miles
north into Canada.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.060
That is their migration, the
longest pronghorn migration

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.110
in the country.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:32.820
They come back to Montana
in the wintertime.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.880
Long-billed curlews,
as Californians,

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.220
you will see walking up
and down the beach here

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.540
in California, but
only in the winter.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.390
Because in the summer,
they're in Montana.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.300
Same bird.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.200
They come up and they nest on
the American Prairie Reserve.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.790
And then they go to the Gulf.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.604
They come to California
in the wintertime to rest.

00:27:49.604 --> 00:27:51.270
And they turn around,
and they come back

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.530
and do that each year.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.521
It's a big migration.

00:27:54.521 --> 00:27:57.020
We tell the kids, we show them
a Swainson's hawk and we say,

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:57.520
guess what.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.220
These guys are really amazing.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.540
Swainson's, far bigger than
a curlew, they nest as well,

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.960
have their babies on American
Prairie Reserve, and then

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.710
this migration, all the
way to southern Argentina.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.590
14,000 miles round trip.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.450
They need to have solid anchors
and solid homes on both ends

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.130
that are not getting plowed up.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.220
Because they lose that
habitat, and then we lose

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.210
the Swainson's.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.130
So we're trying to
help them understand

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.260
the vastness of this
thing that we are building

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.270
for them and their grandkids.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.040
But also how it's interconnected
to so many other things,

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.640
by these unthought of
species that travel so far.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.440
We love, again, it's important
that they use their technology

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.580
products sometimes.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.910
But we love just having
them get quiet and just kind

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.100
of contemplate all this.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.190
And even sit and just
getting used to the sounds

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.004
of the Reserve as well.

00:28:46.004 --> 00:28:48.339
[ANIMAL SOUNDS]

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.750
So the chance to work on
this project, really, I think

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.640
is an incredible
privilege for me.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.320
I think our board and our
staff and our many supporters

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.260
feel the same way about it.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.320
Maybe one of the most
satisfying things to me

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.100
is the idea of
its lasting value.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.290
In a world where so many
things we build our impermanent

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:47.450
and ephemeral, this reserve,
like Yosemite and Yellowstone,

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.900
we know will be here hundreds
and hundreds of years

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.660
from today.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.612
That's pretty cool, I think.

00:29:52.612 --> 00:29:54.070
Personally, I like
the idea that we

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.240
might be inspiring young
people with the realization

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.330
that not everything big
and exciting and important

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.700
has been done yet.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.550
There's still a lot of room
for them to contribute.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.070
I want to show them that if
you can dream big and assemble

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.520
a group of talented, very
ambitious and caring people,

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.180
you can still do
incredible things.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.500
A big part of this project
involves constantly

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.110
testing conventional wisdom.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.830
And I learned to do that,
after 20 years in this valley.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:22.430
That's for sure.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.600
We've asked, is that golden
age of large scale conservation

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.720
really over?

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.850
What conditions might we
be able to get in place

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.880
to try to restart it again?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.190
We've also said, how might we
increase the social carrying

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.940
capacity for wildlife in
big reserves like this

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.160
around the world?

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.220
What if we could find and make
a way for all the stakeholders

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.171
to be winners in the process?

00:30:46.171 --> 00:30:48.160
These questions are fun.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.880
And they have led us to a lot of
breakthroughs, like the Freese

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.390
Scale, like Wild Sky Beef.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.990
I hope all of you
appreciate the advantages

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.260
of working in a place
like Silicon Valley

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.670
and an innovative
environment like Google.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.920
I think you're amassing
skills by the week

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.020
that you could apply to
a range of endeavors that

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.740
could be immensely satisfying
to you and incredibly meaningful

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.187
to society.

00:31:13.187 --> 00:31:15.270
And I hope you'll find the
time to come experience

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.510
this place, this big project.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.240
It is, in fact,
being built for you.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.501
So please come see
us sometime soon.

00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:24.000
Thank you.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:29.245 --> 00:31:31.370
AUDIENCE: What's the biggest
challenge that you all

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.370
face in dealing with
the existing landowners

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:37.250
and in expanding the park?

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.950
SEAN GERRITY: I think
probably the biggest one

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.370
is trying to understand
how big we're going to go.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.540
And I think the main
thing, as I said,

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.180
how they can be
winners in the process.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.600
What is in it for them.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.960
Wild Sky Beef is a good start.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.480
Just setting up and
being neighbors,

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.619
we have full time employees
out there, is a good start.

00:31:55.619 --> 00:31:57.410
But the biggest challenge
is getting people

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.035
to see how we're going to use it
differently than how it's been

00:32:00.035 --> 00:32:01.720
used for the last 100 years.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.470
AUDIENCE: So you talked
about this already

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:04.303
throughout the talk.

00:32:04.303 --> 00:32:06.840
But I guess, which
Silicon Valley lessons

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.892
are most important
for this start up?

00:32:08.892 --> 00:32:10.850
And in what ways has it
been the most different

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.130
from Silicon Valley?

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:14.930
SEAN GERRITY: Well,
that's a good question.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.286
I've never been involved
in non-profits before.

00:32:17.286 --> 00:32:19.160
I didn't really know
what the difference was.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.360
And I think the
interesting thing,

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.880
people are surprised
by my answer,

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.300
is I don't see any difference.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.950
I started a company
from scratch.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.692
I worked with a lot
of VCs over 20 years.

00:32:27.692 --> 00:32:29.150
I know what it's
like to try to get

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.880
an enterprise off the ground.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.450
Absolutely no
difference whatsoever,

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.250
in terms of particularly how
you set up your organization,

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:39.030
set quarterly objectives,
get a very clear set

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.180
of visionary goals that
are out about 18 months

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.520
and jump to those goals
and reset it again.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.120
No difference whatsoever,
same I did in biotech,

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.680
in the movie industry, and
banking, whatever else.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.170
I don't see any difference
with a for profit or nonprofit.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.230
Maybe that's a surprise.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:57.160
The fundraising
was a major shock.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.210
I thought you just get
a sales force going,

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.130
get a great executive
vice president of sales.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.032
And then everything's
great, and I don't

00:33:03.032 --> 00:33:04.610
have to think about it anymore.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.150
I can do what I got
involved in this for.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.320
That didn't happen.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.700
We have raised a lot of money.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.720
It's more work
than I understood.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.870
And I didn't quite get
the idea of the lack

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.450
of tangible quid pro quo.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:19.370
When I had a product
to sell here,

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.820
there was an exchange
of good or service.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.350
It takes a very special
person to give money.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.080
We found hundreds,
actually thousands of them.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.100
But the idea of just pure,
intrinsic value is tricky.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.640
And so, that is a big challenge.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.680
I think the best-- probably
the best lessons I mentioned

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.576
a couple of times here is in
the world of conservation,

00:33:41.576 --> 00:33:42.950
I'm not going to
say non-profits,

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.120
but in the industry
of conservation,

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.180
the assumptions are
incredibly rigid, I feel.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.970
And we come in and
say, does that really

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.050
have to be like that?

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.770
Is there another
way of doing it?

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.600
How about we start
a for profit company

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.470
that's owned by our non-profit?

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.610
So many people said, can
you even do that legally?

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.190
Absolutely you can
do that legally.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.930
So America Prairie Reserve
owns Wild Sky Beef.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.340
It's a for profit company
owned by a nonprofit.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.450
Lots of things like that.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.429
Pushing conventional
wisdom, thinking

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:13.219
about how you can
change hearts and minds

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.469
with the seed of an idea
and then just moving

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:16.580
it forward increments.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.139
Not trying to bowl people
over with the end result.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:21.690
That works here, I know.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:25.980
And probably the
lesson here is things

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.900
are not as easy as it seems.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.460
If you really knew how many
hours people actually put in

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.219
to start a company, most people
think, well that was easy.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.690
They just lucked out with this
idea, and they all got rich.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.469
It's not how it happens.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:40.360
I never experienced that,
between '84 and 2000.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.360
And I think the work
ethic is really important.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.650
I do think some
non-profits, to me,

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:48.400
just complain about
the outside world

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.100
not getting their mission.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.274
They would give us
more money, et cetera.

00:34:52.274 --> 00:34:53.440
They're not going to get it.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.190
You just have to work
really, really hard,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.240
for a very long period of time.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.392
This is just some of
the things I think.

00:34:59.392 --> 00:35:01.933
AUDIENCE: You mentioned using
some of the Google technologies

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:03.889
to track some of the
animals and photos.

00:35:03.889 --> 00:35:05.845
I'm curious which
ones you're using,

00:35:05.845 --> 00:35:07.239
and how they're working for you?

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:09.030
SEAN GERRITY: We're
scratching the surface.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.210
And we'd very much
like more help.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.880
So the most initial
ones right now

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.920
are laying out the
information that we

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.260
are getting from the
folks that are walking.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.200
Or being able to track-- we
have satellite radio collars

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.550
on some of the female bison.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.160
They're like they're
female elephants.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.580
If you can find the key females,
you can find the whole herd.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.570
And so they go wander big areas.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.550
So understanding
how to build maps.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.930
Where have they been,
not just last night,

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.600
but over the last
three months or so.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.200
And what are the
patterns we can see?

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.190
Why do they keep using
these particular areas?

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.590
They can go wherever they want.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:43.870
So that's really interesting.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.400
But it's probably a pretty low
level use of your technology,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.050
actually.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.160
But it's a big deal for us,
for management decisions.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.710
Beginning to get-- what I
would really love help on

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.480
is getting people to understand
what it looks like out there.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.110
My guess is when
you think prairie,

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.400
you might think about
cornfields in Kansas.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.727
That's not the scene
that is out there.

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:04.560
As you-- I don't know
if I can go backwards.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.560
As you see that, it's not
the prairie in Kansas.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.800
That's for sure.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.480
So the idea of even as
simple as the backpacks

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.160
that you can be carried and do
Google Street View, something

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.880
like that, to be able to take
the story out to the world.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.370
Last year I was in Azerbaijan,
I was in the United Arab

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.530
Emirates, I was in
London and Amsterdam.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.560
We're starting from scratch,
showing up in person.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.030
That's a lot of work.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.712
If we could use Google
technology and information

00:36:27.712 --> 00:36:29.670
like Street View to help
people understand what

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.030
we have out there and bring
things to them in a new way,

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.910
that would accelerate
our project.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.857
So we're just beginning
to think about how

00:36:37.857 --> 00:36:38.940
we might work with Google.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.510
We would just love it.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.360
AUDIENCE: A couple of questions.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:47.270
One is did you look at making
it a public private partnership,

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.400
getting some government
money or not?

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.960
And if you didn't, do you
think you will eventually

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.210
become self-sustainable,
where you won't need

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.850
any additional funding at all?

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.850
And the second question is how
did you come up with the land

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.770
area that you need?

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.870
Why this much land,
why not less land?

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.050
SEAN GERRITY: Yeah, let me go
backwards from the why 5,000

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:15.100
square miles, where
did that come from.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.900
What that came from is
conservation biologists looking

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.230
at grasslands in Africa,
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, et

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:22.730
cetera, taking a
look at if you have

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:26.020
a fully functioning ecosystem
with enough wildlife

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.770
for genetic diversity
and all that,

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:31.570
how much land might they need
to fold back in on themselves

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.800
and for everything to work?

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.510
What you need in the
grasslands is bigger

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.260
than most places like forests.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.280
Because there's natural
disasters that occur,

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.620
like an icing over.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.220
In Montana where we are, you
can have maybe 400 or 500

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.581
square miles get
snow than melting,

00:37:48.581 --> 00:37:50.830
we call it a chinook, and
then more snow and then more

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:51.400
melting.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.080
And the ice is so thick,
except for a bison,

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.040
most everything else
can't paw through it.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.360
They can't feed,
they'll starve to death.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.170
They need to be able to
shift over, like 80 miles.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.210
That's a big shift, like
going from here to Sacramento

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.280
to find food.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.700
Because the entire Bay
Area is totally iced.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.830
So you need big areas, so
you can have those disasters,

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.830
sometimes big fires,
which actually

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.010
a year later rejuvenate the
soil and make things better,

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:18.100
in the meanwhile
you're very hungry.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.450
So the threat of
fire and ice, which

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:23.529
is good for the
landscape, not good when

00:38:23.529 --> 00:38:24.820
you need to eat the next month.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.240
You need to be
able to move about.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.140
That's why it's so big.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.790
A lot of animals,
frankly, it's not

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:30.790
because they're cantankerous.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.081
But they don't quite get along.

00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:34.330
A grizzly bear needs
a lot of territory,

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.910
about 100 square miles.

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.500
They don't like bumping
into each other.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.860
And you have conflicts
when it's too tight.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.551
So wolf packs,
grizzly bears, cougars

00:38:44.551 --> 00:38:45.925
don't overlap in
their territory.

00:38:45.925 --> 00:38:46.950
It doesn't work.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.720
And big predators like
that need a lot of protein,

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.597
a lot of room, and not
conflicts with other species.

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:55.180
So grasslands are
some of the biggest,

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.182
about like marine
ecosystems, frankly.

00:38:58.182 --> 00:38:59.640
Tell me your other
question, sorry.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.250
That's how we got to
5,000 square miles.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.510
AUDIENCE: Tell me
about government money.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:04.635
SEAN GERRITY: Government
money, we would love some.

00:39:04.635 --> 00:39:07.050
If you know any government
people with extra money,

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.790
we'll stay after.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.680
Here's how the government
is contributing marvelously.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.680
Frankly, I have no complaints.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.450
Fundraising is hard, for sure.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.587
We're using it to
buy the private land.

00:39:18.587 --> 00:39:20.920
But the government is allowing
us, very progressively, I

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.310
think, to use 2 and 1/2 million
acres of BLM for this purpose.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:26.840
And we don't have to buy it.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.760
That saves about
$4 or $5 billion.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.570
That's key.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:34.100
They're allowing us to use
government public land,

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.460
without any kind of product like
oil and gas, timber, mining,

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.950
or cattle ranching.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:43.200
They're not asking us to use
it for commercial purposes.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.250
That's fantastic.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.880
And we're one of the only ones
they're allowing to do that.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.419
It's just never
been asked before.

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:49.960
Hey, can we use
millions and millions

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.380
of acres for absolutely nothing,
except the public's enjoyment?

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.330
So that's cool, I mean,
we don't have to buy it.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.090
Now if there's some extra
cash to help us out,

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:02.590
that would be
absolutely delightful.

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.760
We just haven't
penetrated that gain yet.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.494
Some of the bigger
organizations,

00:40:06.494 --> 00:40:08.160
Nature Conservancy,
World Wildlife Fund,

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.880
and Wildlife Conservation
Society, are good at it.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.220
But it took them 30 or 40
years to get good at it.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.669
We're a little
late to that party.

00:40:15.669 --> 00:40:16.710
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:17.960
I'm really excited about this.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.634
Can you tell me about global
warming, climate change,

00:40:20.634 --> 00:40:23.050
and how that's going to affect
the reserve over the years?

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.610
And if you're thinking
about that as a problem?

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.590
SEAN GERRITY: We're
thinking about it for sure.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.880
We're trying to work within
our sphere of influence,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.570
not out on our whole
spirit of concern.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.370
It certainly is
happening, undeniably.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.890
We can argue for days
whose fault it is.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.619
But it is happening.

00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:42.660
So for us, we look at how
do we protect ourselves

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.070
against the possible downsides.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.430
The main thing is to go big,
like we just talked about.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.290
That's why you go so big.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:55.220
If it gets warmer and
drier, we need more land

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.310
to support the same
kind of wildlife.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:59.950
Actually if it gets
warmer and more humid,

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.590
it's actually a plus.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.470
We don't know which
way it's going to go.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.480
If you had driven from here
across the United States,

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.100
you will feel dry in
California and around Davis,

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.080
dry in Nevada, dry in Montana.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.622
And you get just a
little bit halfway

00:41:12.622 --> 00:41:14.329
into North Dakota,
and all of the sudden,

00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:15.580
you hit the wall of humanity.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.590
You ever had that?

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.120
Minnesota, Wisconsin, all
of the sudden it gets humid.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.530
With more humidity,
it gets hotter too.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.750
You have lots more forage,
much more carrying capacity.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.870
We don't know which way
that's going to go for us.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.210
We're right on that line.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.140
The only thing we can do
is go absolutely huge.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.380
Make it bigger, don't settle.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.860
Don't compromise just because
we got tired of fundraising.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.770
That's the main thing.

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:42.950
There are, by the way, if
you go back 11,000 years,

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:46.670
and we didn't have the NOAA
or any weather services,

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.170
but we can do core
samples in the dry lakes.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.920
And we can see
what kind of pollen

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:54.735
existed 4,000 years ago, 7,000
years ago, 9,000 years ago.

00:41:54.735 --> 00:41:56.860
The pollen, you can
extrapolate what kind of plants

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.510
you had around you, right.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.560
There was a period of
time a drought, a big one.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.350
It was called the Alta Thermal.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:09.060
It started 8,500 years ago and
went to about 5,000 years ago.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.500
A 3,500 year drought,
where rainfall

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.240
was at about 13 inches, dropped
down to about seven inches

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.260
a year for 3,500 years.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.040
And there was still
wildlife out there.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.246
Then it slowly came
back, very slowly,

00:42:21.246 --> 00:42:22.870
over about a period
of 800 or 900 years

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.911
and came back to about
the average we have today,

00:42:24.911 --> 00:42:26.500
which is 13 inches a year.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.210
But that's a heck of a drought.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.210
I'm not worried about
drought or global warming.

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:34.030
I don't mean to be
cavalier, but these wildlife

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.495
are unbelievably resourceful,
in terms of the conditions they

00:42:37.495 --> 00:42:38.740
can live in.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.760
AUDIENCE: Follow up on
that question actually.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.250
Perennial bunch grass
has a high capacity

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.096
for carbon sequestration.

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.470
So is there an
opportunity as you

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.860
transition these ranch systems
back to traditional ecosystems

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.680
to sell offsets or
sort of leverage

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.570
that sequestration to sort
of push this project forward?

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.160
SEAN GERRITY: We get excited
and less excited here and there,

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.640
waxing and waning our
enthusiasm, based on the carbon

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.530
markets.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.070
It's been stumbling a bit.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:06.970
So we're ready.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:09.590
The land is really big,
and you're exactly right.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:11.240
Eventually, this will
be seen, I think,

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.220
as a terrific carbon
sink and viable

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.820
for what you're describing.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.780
In fact, the very first
group, from California,

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:23.160
has contacted us and
finally has a model

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.070
to where they can
give us what we

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.951
think is meaningful money on
a yearly basis, about $100,000

00:43:28.951 --> 00:43:29.450
a year.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.860
That doesn't buy
much land, but that's

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.140
about what we can get for now.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.780
If we nail down one piece,
put a conservation easement

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.590
on it, which we're doing anyway.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.120
And we're waiting for the
markets to catch up with us.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.970
We're ready to go.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.030
Know any great people,
tell them to call us.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.820
We're on the hunt.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.780
But you poke around
at it, and it's not

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.070
quite ready for prime time.

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.470
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:54.890
My first question is about
the BLM and your agreement

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:55.740
with them.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:00.990
Do they reserve the right to
come back 10, 20 years from now

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:05.800
and mine or pull anything that
they want to out of there,

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.700
without any consideration
of your original agreement?

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:12.050
And my second question
is about predators,

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.430
and how you're working
with the landowners that

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:19.660
are around the borders of
this area to get them to--

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.700
because the predators
are going to migrate too.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:25.949
So how are they going to
welcome them into the fold?

00:44:25.949 --> 00:44:27.990
SEAN GERRITY: With the
Bureau of Land Management,

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.280
you don't actually get a
contract or an agreement,

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.700
you get a lease.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:32.950
They tend to be 10 years.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:34.840
You can ask for 15 years.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:39.160
Where we're working,
since it started in 1936,

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.610
there's been no precedent
for them taking things away

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.360
from people, or neighbors
competing for neighbor's

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.890
property, that kind of thing.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:48.140
So it's relatively
relaxed and calm.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.320
There are other jurisdictions
like New Mexico, Utah,

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.530
and Nevada where the BLM can
be a lot more contentious.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.530
But it's culturally--
it's regional,

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.280
and Montana is kind
of a calm backwater,

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.577
from a BLM standpoint,
thankfully.

00:45:01.577 --> 00:45:03.410
The other thing I learned
in Silicon Valley,

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.452
back to your original
question, about what

00:45:05.452 --> 00:45:06.910
are some of the
important things is

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.409
when you want to get together
with some collaborators, study

00:45:09.409 --> 00:45:11.680
very, very carefully
where they're going.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.322
What are their values, what's
important to them in five, 10,

00:45:14.322 --> 00:45:15.370
15 years.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.120
We've taken a look at
their strategic plan

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.220
and the trajectory of the BLM.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.910
They're going in the
direction of more open lands

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:25.257
for the public, a higher
emphasis on biodiversity,

00:45:25.257 --> 00:45:27.340
if they don't get too much
pressure from industry.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.590
So we are a breath of fresh air.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:31.380
We are where they want to go.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.320
So we're actually
moving them faster

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.680
to their own strategic
plan than they are.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.700
We feel, we're trusting that
it's very unlikely they're

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.340
going to disrupt our path.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.890
Because this is the
kind of collaboration

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:47.300
they want, and you usually can't
get at this kind of a scale.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.510
So we're trusting that it's
going to last quite some time

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.090
and to race actually, to
create what I described here,

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.095
to where people cherish it so
much that they will go berserk

00:45:58.095 --> 00:45:59.720
if the government
tries to do anything.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.178
Like what happened with the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

00:46:02.178 --> 00:46:03.430
about eight years ago.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.280
They thought, let's just drill
there to increase our reserves.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.760
The public didn't
put up with it.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.780
They stopped it.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.720
Now that may get
threatened again,

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.360
but this is in the lower 48.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.620
People are coming to visit it.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.470
People are falling
in love with it.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.320
So our goal is to make it
such a rich cultural thing

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.550
and so wanted and valued
by the American public

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.840
that it would be quite
a fight to do something

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.025
in the patchy areas of BLM.

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:33.160
With the predators we're
doing a variety of things.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.160
One is we're paying
them money to not

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.110
complain about predators.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.220
Two-- that's not fair,
you just can't say

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.552
don't complain--
we're showing them

00:46:43.552 --> 00:46:45.510
ways to deal with them
that we're bringing back

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.820
from various areas
around the world.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:52.430
For instance, like in Namibia,
in the Waterberg Plateau

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:54.390
in northern Namibia, I
got to visit a rancher

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:55.516
area, very similar to this.

00:46:55.516 --> 00:46:57.431
They don't have wolves,
but they had cheetahs.

00:46:57.431 --> 00:46:59.360
And cheetahs kill
a lot of cattle.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.340
So do leopards.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.910
So they killed them left
and right, the ranchers do.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:04.450
They see it as a threat.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.240
A woman named Laurie Marker
started an organization there,

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.110
The Cheetah Conservation Fund.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:12.910
And she brought in
predator controlling dogs.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.800
There's kagans, there's
Anatolian bear dogs, even

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.947
Great Pyrenees, and others,
they all take different roles.

00:47:18.947 --> 00:47:21.030
But say you take a couple
of dogs about this size,

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.136
like Anatolian bear dogs.

00:47:22.136 --> 00:47:24.010
They're more awake than
this guy seems to be.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.410
But you give the rancher
two little puppies.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.820
And they put them, in this
case, with their goats.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.890
They don't herd, they're
worthless for herding.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.820
But they think the
goats are their buddies.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.929
A leopard or a cheetah
comes in, they break away

00:47:35.929 --> 00:47:38.220
from the goat herd and they'll
chase that cheetah down.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.450
If they catch it,
they'll tear it apart.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:42.930
So you put in
predator control dogs.

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.610
And they're $1,500 apiece.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.110
And you give them $3,000
worth of these little puppies,

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.200
show them how to use them.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.200
Show them how to stir
them into their cattle.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.180
And you lessen the chances
of coyotes or other things

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.951
bothering your livestock.

00:47:57.951 --> 00:48:00.450
The other thing we need to do
is make a landscape really big

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:03.780
and put wild protein
back in the landscape.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.840
There's about 3,500 elk
out there right now.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.987
We're shooting for
30,000 to 40,000 elk.

00:48:08.987 --> 00:48:10.820
There was no bison until
we brought them in.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.700
We're shooting for 10,000.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.930
With enough bison and
elk to chase around,

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:16.720
the livestock are
not that interesting.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.930
Seriously, I live
near Yellowstone.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.280
Very, very few cows ever
get killed by wolves.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.780
And Yellowstone is completely
surrounded by cattle ranching.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.260
They make a lot
of noise about it,

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.910
but you don't see
a lot of dead cows.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.050
You do see a lot of elk dying.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.390
So, lots and lots of
protein in a landscape,

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:34.050
it's a distraction thing.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:35.906
And make sure it's
big enough that they

00:48:35.906 --> 00:48:37.030
can live on this landscape.

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.890
It's going to be a million acres
bigger than Yellowstone Park.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.470
And lots of dead
things, frankly.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.140
Grizzly bears, their
favorite thing?

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.700
A dead bison.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.325
Nothing like a 2,000
pound dead bison

00:48:47.325 --> 00:48:49.700
sitting there to make your
day, if you're a grizzly bear.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.384
AUDIENCE: Are you
introducing them,

00:48:51.384 --> 00:48:54.779
or are you just waiting
for them to arrive?

00:48:54.779 --> 00:48:55.820
SEAN GERRITY: The latter.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.839
We can't do that, but
they're getting close.

00:48:57.839 --> 00:49:00.380
We know exactly where they are,
coming off the Rocky Mountain

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.890
Front with bison.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:05.154
Wolves are coming south
from Saskatchewan and out

00:49:05.154 --> 00:49:06.070
from Yellowstone Park.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.160
They're converging on that area.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.450
This is huge, and the
elk are already there.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:17.450
The wolf rumor mill is working,
and they're getting closer.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:22.472
And they used to be here,
many, many thousands of them.

00:49:22.472 --> 00:49:24.930
MALE SPEAKER: Having said that,
you can probably visit more

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:26.680
about this on your website.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.010
How can they find
out more information?

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:31.300
SEAN GERRITY: Yes,
so I have cards here,

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.950
if you'd like to
go on our website.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:35.820
I write a blog on
"National Geographic."

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.510
The best way to come
and get information

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.570
is come walk that
250 miles with us.

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.760
That's the best way, we
can talk day and night,

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.780
sit around the fire
with gin and tonics.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.970
Glad to do that.

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.990
And truly, come and see it.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.910
Many, many people
from California

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:51.910
come up to stay at Castro
Camp or wherever else.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.570
And you'd be surprised
how many people

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.050
you might know, you start
talking, who have been there,

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:58.470
some of them numerous times.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.405
And it's quite something.

00:50:00.405 --> 00:50:02.530
It's a place you can go
back to over and over again

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.740
in different seasons and
see something different.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.760
Whether you get to
see some coyotes,

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.860
the next time you come you
see the aurora borealis

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:12.050
or the northern lights from
your deck, sitting on your yurt,

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:13.890
because there are
no lights out there.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:15.200
It is really quite something.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.640
So coming to visit,
watching for information,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.890
come to "National Geographic."

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:19.840
Because we do new things.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.450
We just finished a science and
education center for instance.

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:24.550
Quite a lot activity this year.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.090
But come take
information from me.

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.530
And particularly we are
very interested in working

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:30.220
with Google.

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:33.110
It's hard to-- I know what it's
like working in this valley.

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.450
If I sat here for three
months, I wouldn't know Google.

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:36.910
There are so many
things happening

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.990
in interesting pockets
of the company.

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:42.360
Please, reach out to me, and
we'll be back in a second

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.010
and come to you and talk about
it and see how it might work.

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.660
But we would love
Google's help for sure.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.724
So any ideas, we're ready to go.

00:50:49.724 --> 00:50:51.390
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
Sean, thank you very

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:52.840
much for speaking at Google.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.256
SEAN GERRITY: Thank
you very much.

00:50:54.256 --> 00:50:55.630
