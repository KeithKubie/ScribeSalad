00:00:00.593 --> 00:00:01.543
Voiceover: In the last video,

00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:04.248
we had this situation where
we have to buy a truck

00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:07.067
every 3 years, because
that's how long they last,

00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:09.465
and we were, at first,
just expensing the truck.

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:12.072
It's $60,000 every 3 years,

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:14.134
but it did something very strange

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:15.339
to our operating profit.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.467
It made it look like,

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.044
the years that we bought the truck,

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:19.298
that our business didn't do well,

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:21.136
and the other years, it did really well,

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.337
even though this was a
really consistent business.

00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:24.805
What we hinted at in the last video is,

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:27.622
maybe we can do something

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:29.408
called "capitalizing" the expense.

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:31.267
We could capitalize the truck.

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:32.799
What we do is, instead of just saying

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.301
that the truck is an expense,

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.052
we can say that we're buying an asset,

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:37.593
that has some useful life

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:40.591
beyond the time that
we're just expensing it.

00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:43.005
What we do is, let's just put
a balance sheet right here,

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:45.757
at the beginning of year 1.

00:00:45.757 --> 00:00:48.787
At the beginning of year 1,
this is our balance sheet.

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:52.335
Balance sheet, right over here.

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:54.335
By capitalizing a truck,

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.394
we're essentially saying
we're going to spend $60,000.

00:00:56.394 --> 00:00:58.790
Let's say we start with $60,000 in cash.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.343
We use that $60,000 in
cash to buy a truck,

00:01:01.343 --> 00:01:04.521
so on our balance sheet
we now have only 1 asset,

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:07.456
called "a truck."

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:08.720
Let me do it this way.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.172
In the asset category, we have a truck,

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.003
and we are saying that
right when it's brand new,

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:16.835
it is worth $60,000,

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:19.582
and we have no liabilities,

00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:21.332
so I'll just put a 0 there,

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:24.338
and so our equity, our
shareholders' equity,

00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:27.338
60,000 - 0, which is 60,000.

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:32.011
Our company is worth $60,000 on our books.

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.208
The way that we account for this truck,

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:35.867
that lasts 3 years,

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:39.455
is we say, "Look, this has
a useful life of 3 years."

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:43.736
Essentially, "Let's just
spread that $60,000 out,

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.301
"over the 3 years," or
another way to say it,

00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:47.285
let's say that this truck

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:50.137
is costing us $20,000 a year.

00:01:50.137 --> 00:01:52.950
$20,000 a year.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.536
Or, another way we can say that,

00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:58.343
is that we can depreciate
the value of the truck,

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:01.803
and the depreciation is an expense.

00:02:01.803 --> 00:02:05.055
So, "depreciation of truck."

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:06.206
Instead of just calling it truck,

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:08.991
I'll call it the truck depreciation.

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.265
You could just really view this

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:13.458
as a way of spreading out
the cost of the truck.

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:14.729
In the first year,

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.337
we're going to depreciate
our truck by 20,000.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.064
We're going to say that it's 1 third ...

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:21.460
1 third of its value has been served,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.685
or it's now $20,000 worth less

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:25.737
at the end of the year,

00:02:25.737 --> 00:02:27.134
than it was at the beginning.

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:28.692
In the second year, 20,000.

00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:30.459
In the third year, 20,000.

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.394
We just really spread out the 60,000

00:02:32.394 --> 00:02:34.191
over the life of the truck.

00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:35.604
What that does is,

00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:37.938
it makes our operating profit consistent,

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:38.595
which it should be,

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.666
because we have a very
consistent business.

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:44.934
100 - 50 - 20. We make 30 in year 1,

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:46.674
30 in year 2,

00:02:46.674 --> 00:02:47.715
30 in year 3,

00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:48.770
and then we just keep going.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.529
These all become 20s,

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.666
and so, because we have
such a consistent business,

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:56.266
we make $30,000 the whole way through.

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:58.934
What does depreciation
do to our balance sheet?

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:00.535
At the beginning of year 1,

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:03.063
we had a truck that was worth $60,000.

00:03:03.063 --> 00:03:05.330
If you forward to the end of year 1,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.803
or the beginning of year 2,

00:03:06.803 --> 00:03:07.862
what's going to happen is,

00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:10.603
because we're depreciating
the value of the truck,

00:03:10.603 --> 00:03:11.665
on our balance sheet

00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:14.991
we took $20,000 depreciation expense,

00:03:14.991 --> 00:03:16.799
on our balance sheet
the value of the truck

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:17.819
over the course of the year

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.868
will go from 60,000 to 40,000.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.596
To 40,000.

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:24.904
Then at the end of year 2,

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.334
if we go another year forward,

00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:29.272
the value that we keep the
trucks on the books for

00:03:29.272 --> 00:03:32.128
will go down to 20,000.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.072
Then at the end of year 3,

00:03:34.072 --> 00:03:36.598
it's going to go down to 0,

00:03:36.598 --> 00:03:38.330
and then we go buy another truck,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.661
so we'll go back to
60,000; we'll keep going.

00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:41.998
The cool thing about this

00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:44.267
is it makes the expense very consistent,

00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:46.007
and actually more consistent

00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:47.998
with what our business is actually doing.
