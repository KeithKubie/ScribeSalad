00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.970
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: My name is Nancy
Groce and I'm with the Library

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.900
of Congress and today we
have a very special guest,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.200
David Bromberg.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.500
And we're going to be talking

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.160
about the David Bromberg
American Violin Collection,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.730
and specific fiddles and how you
came to acquire the collection

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.650
and maybe, what we
hope will happen

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.740
to the collection once it comes
here to the Library of Congress.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.040
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Very good.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.820
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: OK so, how did
you get into collecting violins,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.440
let's just start
with the basics?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.480
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,
I was a touring musician

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.480
and I played American
music and the first,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.910
I had a very good fiddler in the
band, Jay Unger was in my band,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.770
and I used to play
fiddle tunes on the guitar

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.210
and I decided I should try
and learn to play fiddle

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.730
because I knew how
I wanted to sound,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.380
I wanted to sound just like Jay.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.450
So, I was in Stockbridge,
Massachusetts

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.440
and there was a guy there who
had a wall full of violins

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.930
and I chose one and it turned
out to be an American one,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.950
which seemed proper because
I play American music

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.750
and I have whatever
poisonous gene it is

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.910
that makes people collectors

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.960
and I started collecting
American violins.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.370
At first, I didn't
know much about them,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.060
but the more I did it,
the more I learned.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.590
Eventually I went to
violin making school

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.690
and saw quite a few
beautiful violins

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.510
and knew better how
to organize things.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.560
Because I wasn't
interested in amateur,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.780
partly successful ventures,
and America has a lot of those.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You mean
people who do one violin or-- ?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.980
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah,
or have no training at all,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.030
and really have only seen one
maybe German factory violin,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.840
have a vague idea of what it
should it look like in the end,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.480
and there are tons of
those in the United States.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.030
And for a long time,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.560
the American violin dealers
thought that's all there was

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.070
and if they saw something
good they would tell me, oh,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.270
this isn't American, this
is German or this is French,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.500
or you know, anything
but American.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.800
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
that wasn't true?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.410
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
No, it wasn't true.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.510
Operating on the assumption

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.870
that Americans are not
genetically inferior

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.540
to Europeans, I couldn't see
why Americans couldn't have made

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.540
fine violins and the more
I learned about violins,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.490
the more astounded I was

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.650
that people would show
me an American violin

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.290
and just dismiss it as not
being worth a gorgeous thing,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.510
not being worth fixing
because it was American.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.110
That's changed now.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, how
many violins do you have now

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.040
in your collection?

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.430
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Um, 263,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.850
but actually a few
more than that even.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.390
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
these have been acquired

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.120
over how many years
of collecting?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Oh,
it must be close to 50.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And is
this the largest collection

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.650
of American violins?

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.600
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: It's the
largest and the only one

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.960
that I know of, of anything
approaching this size that is

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.130
of good violins and it
covers the length and breadth

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.560
of American violin making
from around 1848 to 1950.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.590
And there is no equivalent
collection of French violins

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.680
in France or German
violins in Germany

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.220
or Italian violins in Italy.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.010
There is nothing that
covers it like this.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.270
Not that I have every single
one, but I'm pretty close.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.140
Every single important
one, but I'm pretty close.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.050
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, you've
brought some examples of violins

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.670
to look at and I think in the
trade you called them fiddles,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.170
is there a difference
between fiddles and violins?

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.470
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.690
it's like a [inaudible] calls
his instrument his fiddle.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.700
Vassar Clements, who
I used to play with,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.060
one of the world's
greatest country fiddlers,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.830
used to call his his violin,
so you go figure, I don't know.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.960
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: OK, well
let's just start looking

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.260
at some that you brought in.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.770
I think you brought
in, the unifying theme

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.630
of the ones you brought in today
to the Library of Congress is

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.170
that they all have some
relationship to Chicago,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.810
and you lived in Chicago for
many years, is that right?

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.630
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes, I did.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.680
This one, which I wanted to
talk about first, this was made

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.410
by a man named Herman Macklett,
and he was a German immigrant.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.580
He settled in St. Paul where
he worked as an upholsterer

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.850
and he used to go
back and forth.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.700
He was born in 1835 in
Hanover, Germany and I know

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.090
that because it was written on
the inside of another Macklett

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.640
that I owned, G-- and the rest

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.290
of the word was no longer
visible, but then Hanover 1835,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.590
it had to have been [inaudible].

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Born in 1835?

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.700
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
In Hanover, Germany.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:50.380
And he was known
as the grandfather

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.400
of the first Carl Becker,
Carl Becker is very famous.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.810
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: As
a violin maker?

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.110
A late violin maker.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.410
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
As a violin maker.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.290
But, Macklett himself
was a fine violin maker.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.970
This is a beautiful violin
and a very healthy one.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.560
Allegedly, most of his were
lost in the Chicago Fire.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.600
I don't believe that actually
because I've seen more

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.000
than I expected to
see given that.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.100
He was in St. Paul and he
traveled back and forth

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.300
between St. Paul and Chicago,
finally officially moving

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.380
to Chicago in 1868 and he died,

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.720
I'm sorry 1864, and
he died in 1884.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.550
And people have speculated that
he must have seen French violins

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.810
and studied some really nice,
maybe a Vuillaume or something.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.680
And I have a different theory.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.980
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh,
what's your theory?

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.430
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: My theory
is that there were parts

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.910
of his life where we
don't know where he was

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.770
and I think he was either in New
York City or Astoria studying

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.340
with George Gemunder because
George Gemunder studied

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.640
with Vuillaume.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.940
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: He's a
well-known violin dealer

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.240
and maker in New York.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.890
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes,
and the significant thing

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.180
about George Gemunder as
opposed to the other members

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.110
of the family is he did work
for Vuillaume and there's a lot

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.530
of Vuillaume in his violins
and so I think that was

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.050
where Macklett developed
the French-ness in his-- .

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.660
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, you have
this direct line of master

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.860
to apprentice that you're
tracing down, that you can see

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.250
in people's instruments?

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.450
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah,
generally speaking.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.580
I brought one instrument
that I'll show you later,

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.880
by a self-taught maker,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.870
or a maker that I
think was self-taught.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.640
But this is Herman Macklett
and it's a lovely violin.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.160
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
he had a shop,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.240
after the first one
burned in the Chicago Fire.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.490
And isn't there a story about
him and his wife putting violins

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.510
in rain sacs and carrying
them across the Chicago River.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.010
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
Yeah, that's the story

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.880
that was passed down
in the family.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.380
Carl Becker knew that story.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.210
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, even
if it was one or two,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.110
that's still a great story.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.410
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
Well, he saved,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.500
he must have saved
some very good violins.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.400
This is a late one, I mean,
this one was made in 1879.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's
a beautiful instrument,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:24.350
it has a one piece back and,
yeah, very, very nicely done.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.820
So, and it's still playing,
like a lot of the instruments

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.820
in your collection, it's
still in playing condition.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.120
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Oh yes.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.460
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, our next
Chicago violin is which one?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.950
Which maker do you
want to feature next?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.620
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: This was
made by Johann Hornsteiner,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.980
and in many ways Johann
Hornsteiner was the single most

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.310
important maker in Chicago.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:55.210
He taught a generation of
violin makers in Chicago.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:01.650
He was the head of the Lion
and Healy shop for a while,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.020
and he worked in
different shops.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.270
He had his own shop
for a while and-- .

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.150
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And Lion
and Healy was a huge,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.380
not only violins but all
sorts of musical instruments,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.690
and they really supplied
a lot of America

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.780
and American orchestral
musicians for many,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.080
many years, I believe.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.380
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.240
and their violin
department was very important

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.910
and did business all
over the United States.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.770
The ironic thing about
Johann Hornsteiner is

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.720
that there are very few of
his instruments, I'm sorry,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.510
there's only this one that
we know of that still exists.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.920
He did a lot of repairs
and he taught people,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.390
but he was more enamored

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.160
of playing poker
than making violins.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.800
And so, one of his
apprentices was a great maker,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.000
named Frank Sindelar,
and most of the ones

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.630
with Johann Hornsteiner's label
were made by Frank Sindelar.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.630
But this was made by
Johann Hornsteiner.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.270
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, there's a
Hornsteiner family, in think,

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.820
in Mittenwald, in Germany?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.060
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: There
is a Hornsteiner family

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.190
that goes back many generations

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.850
as violin makers back
to the 18th Century.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.330
Actually, there was a
partnership between a maker

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.190
by the name of Neuner
and Hornsteiner

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.710
and they created a
factory in Mittenwald,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.240
Germany called Neuner
and Hornsteiner

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.150
and it has its origins
in the 18th Century

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.190
up through the 1930's.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:43.680
And, really the reinforcement

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.080
that this is Johann
Hornsteiner's,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.520
if there was no label, and
there are labels in violins

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.250
that he didn't make,
is that this violin is

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.470
like the most beautiful Neuner
and Hornsteiner ever made.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.610
There's an awful lot about it
that you can see those violins,

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.470
except it's so exquisitely done

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.570
and this was 1924 is
when this was made.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.870
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And,
what attracts you

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.250
when you're collecting
a violin like that?

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.950
Did you see it in a shop
window or did someone bring it

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.900
into your shop, or how
did you come by it?

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.120
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well, I
attract American violins.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.580
I gave a number of lectures to
each of the violin societies

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.500
and so when people run across
American violins, I get calls,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.460
not only from people within
the trade but, you know,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.260
other people are told,
well call Bromberg,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.310
he knows about American.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:45.340
And this came to
me from Jim Warren,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.520
from whom I've learned a lot,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.990
who has an important
shop in Chicago.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:58.970
He's the third generation
and his son who's

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.440
in the shop is now
the fourth generation.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.830
And when he got this he
called me because he knew

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.310
that I would be interested
and I was looking

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.610
for a Johann Hornsteiner.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.640
There was only one other that
we know of that he made himself

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.980
and that was a Guarneri
model, this is a Strad model.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.300
He made a Guarneri model for
Lou Wallace, who was a general

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.650
in the Civil War and
the author of Ben Hur.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.830
And his estate is a museum,

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.730
but the curators know
of no violin there.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.160
So, that one hopefully
will turn up someday.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.650
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, when someone
walks in with a violin like that

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.230
and opens the case, is
it immediately obvious

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.440
that it's an interesting
instrument?

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.740
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: To me?

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.640
It is to me yes.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.940
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
what do you look for,

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.440
what do, how do you-- ?

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.680
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,
beauty is functional

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.680
and it takes a little education

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.740
to learn what constitutes
beauty,

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:02.750
but that's the first
thing I look for is,

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.600
does it look beautiful?

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.520
And the fine violins
are always beautiful.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.400
Even the ugly ones are
beautiful in their own way.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That one
has a beautiful back,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.830
can we just want to see that.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.770
What's the wood on the back?

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.720
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Almost every
violin is made from maple back,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.060
sides and neck and spruce top.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.580
You occasionally will
find a cedar top,

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.500
but most are by far-- .

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.860
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And would
that be American wood?

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.820
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: This one does
not appear to be American wood,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.560
but there are some species of, a
lot of American wood has streaks

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.820
that go across the flames.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.450
And that's, then you know
you're looking at American wood,

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.920
but there are some species
that don't have that

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.220
and this never struck me

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.670
as being American
wood, but it could be.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.160
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So,
of all the years

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.620
that Johann Hornsteiner worked
and was influential in Chicago,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.380
that's the one instrument we
know of his that still survives?

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.680
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.270
I don't think there are many.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:16.170
I don't think he start
to finish made very many.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.610
But he did a lot
of restorations.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.400
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And poker.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.820
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: And poker.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.680
Although he was a
great restorer,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.270
he was not a very good expert.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:31.600
Jim Warren's grandfather
told me a story

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.300
about how the concert master
of the Chicago Symphony came

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.400
in with his violin
for some adjustment

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.000
and Johann Hornsteiner was
the only one in the shop

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.550
and he looked at this
gentleman's Strad

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.580
and said it was a very
fine German violin,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.390
which caused a bit of trouble.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:56.070
No, people from France think,
tend to think, not all of them

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.660
but many of them, think that
the most beautiful violins must

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.960
be French.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.510
And German makers think
they must be German.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:08.090
[ Laughter ]

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:14.240
Hornsteiner, I already said that
he taught a whole generation

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.880
and amongst the people
who worked

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.860
under his tutelage was
the first Carl Becker, so,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.680
that's where we'll go next.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: OK, let's-- .

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:30.260
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: To Carl
Becker, but not directly,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.680
we're going to take
a little side trip.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.490
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Ok,
let's see another fiddle.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.790
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: OK.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.850
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You have
another Chicago violin here,

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.750
can you tell me about that one?

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.160
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: This was made
by a man named William T. Lane,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.780
who was born in England,
probably London,

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:56.330
and came to the United
States and had a violin shop.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.870
He also worked in Lyon and
Healy under Johann Hornsteiner.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.660
Before that I suspect he
might have been self-taught.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.220
And he liked ivory
and he would put ivory

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.160
on different instruments
in different places.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.790
This one has it at the corners.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.090
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's unusual.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.140
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
It is very unusual.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.900
Nice wood.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.730
Probably American wood.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.790
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: How do you
know it's American wood?

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.950
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
See the streaks.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.140
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, that
go across the flame.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.440
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.740
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, interesting.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.890
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: In the 19th
Century the French used almost

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.260
exclusively American wood

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.890
because they believed it
was the best sounding.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.210
So, it wasn't just
Americans who used them.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.620
But, this is Lane, and I forgot

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.050
that there's another
important piece having to do

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.470
with Lane that I should show.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:58.950
I have a photograph of Carl
Becker at the age of 14.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.550
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: The
well-known violin,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.190
Chicago violin maker,
Carl Becker?

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.760
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: It's
very important violin maker,

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:10.560
and he studied with Lane before
he went to Lion and Healy.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.010
Now Lane was at Lion and Healy
and studied with Hornsteiner,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:22.500
and later Carl Becker also
went to Lion and Healy

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.680
and worked under Hornsteiner.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.140
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: This is
like a lot of other trades,

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.960
where people all know
each other and especially

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.490
since it's a master
apprenticeship trade,

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.790
there must be a lot

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.400
of connections among
American violin makers?

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.020
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Strangely,
there are not very many schools

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.490
of violin making in the United
States that I can perceive.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.450
Really, the most identifiable
school of violin making was

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:55.520
in Chicago and the fountain
head is Johann Hornsteiner.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:01.130
But, the immigrants
like George Gemunder

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:06.200
in New York had very
little influence as far

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.120
as I can detect in other makers.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.140
But Hornsteiner, you
can see it clearly.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.450
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
it's wonderful

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.570
that you've collected examples

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.510
from throughout the
Chicago school

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.390
so you can make these
connections

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.540
with your collection.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.380
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah, some
of Hornsteiner's disciples went

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:36.030
to Michigan and to other places,
but you can see an awful lot

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.790
of him in many Chicago
instruments.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.090
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now,
did you acquire

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.390
that instrument in Chicago.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.170
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes, I got
this when I was in Chicago.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.970
Which brings up something
interesting,

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.420
I put together this collection
when I was a touring musician.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.450
Otherwise I never
could have done it

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.460
because strangely enough,

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.150
American violins don't
seem to travel much.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.060
There were five makers whose
work can be found anywhere

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:09.360
in the United States because
they were made for firms

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.130
that sold all over
the United States.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.340
Carl Becker is one of them.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.090
But, I don't know that you
would find a W. T. Lane violin

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.390
anywhere but Chicago.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
how did you acquire it?

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.640
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,
I was living in Chicago

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.410
but I acquired the collection

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.510
because I was a traveling
musician and I would look

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.870
for violins wherever I went.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.310
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do
you play them?

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:40.700
Do you try playing them
before you buy them or-- ?

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.550
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
You generally can't.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.830
When you find an old violin
it's rarely in condition

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.740
to be played, unless it's been
in a shop and all fixed up,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.420
and I discovered when
I visit violin shops,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.290
when I started my collection,
that they had no respect

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.830
for any American violins,
"Oh there's one in the back,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.390
this guy wasn't to bad but it's
not worth my while to fix it,"

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.050
you know, and then they'd bring
out something that needed a lot

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.010
of work that might be gorgeous.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:15.910
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now you were at
a violin making school where?

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.210
And for how long?

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.510
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: In Chicago.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.810
I graduated.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.110
That's what brought
me to Chicago.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.140
I graduated from the Chicago
School of Violin Making.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, you
were a touring musician,

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.000
just found violin
making so fascinating

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.840
that you just decided
to try it yourself?

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.830
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: It's a
little more complicated.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.040
As a touring musician
I started my collection

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.840
and collected American violins
and around 1970 I got burnt out.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.870
I was working too much.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:46.270
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You were
doing very well as a musician.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.690
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: At that
time, I was doing well.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:53.910
But I stopped completely because
I discovered I wasn't doing

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.650
anything a musician does
when I wasn't traveling.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.360
I wasn't writing, I wasn't
practicing, I wasn't playing

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.240
with other musicians, so,
if I wasn't on the road.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.540
And I didn't want to
be one of these guys

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.830
who does a bitter imitation
of something he used to love.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.560
So, I decided to find something
else that I would enjoy

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.680
and devote my life to.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.530
And I was interested in violins,

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.620
so I went to violin
making school.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.920
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And how long
did you study violin making?

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.000
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I was at
the school for four years,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.980
to complete a 3-1/2-year
program.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.970
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: But
it's very rigorous.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.490
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: It should
be very rigorous if you really,

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.750
really apply yourself.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.700
Other people did much
better at it than I did,

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.490
but my interest really
was never in making,

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.910
I never wanted to be a maker.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.670
I wanted to understand how you
could look at a violin and tell

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.770
who made it, when and where.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.530
And you can't go by
the labels inside

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.600
because they're frequently
false.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.900
They're occasionally right,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.450
especially on the important
violins, that's wonderful.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:15.670
But, you can make a lot of
money by putting the label

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.260
of a great maker in a violin
that wasn't by that maker.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.750
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And most people
wouldn't know the difference?

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.050
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.850
they identify the
violins by the labels.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.940
The experts don't do that.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.620
So, I wanted to become
an expert.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.330
So, I wanted to be able
to identify violins.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.660
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
you really did.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:37.990
You established this shop,
in dealing with, as they say,

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.710
high end fiddles,
for very many years.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.120
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I'll be a
beginner until the day I die

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.320
because like music,
there's no bottom to this

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.200
and no one will ever
know it all.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.360
People consult me
on American violins,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.550
although American
violins are my hobby,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.030
my business is European
violins with one

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.830
or two Americans thrown in.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.500
This is a photograph of Carl
Becker at the age of 14.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:12.730
That was the year he
made his first violin,

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.520
when he was 14-years-old.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.730
And I think that this may
have been taken in the shop

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:23.190
of W. T. Lane, which
was the first place

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.460
that he got any tutelage.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.600
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: He started
his training with Lane.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.050
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah, he
started his training with Lane.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.410
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do you
know what year that is?

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:38.010
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes,
I think it would be 1901.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.390
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That is
such a terrific photograph.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.460
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.730
I have two Becker violins.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.030
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, can
we take a look at them?

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.680
Made by this man probably
a little later in his life.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.980
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
Made by Carl Becker.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.280
Yes, one of them not much later.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Let's
have a look at them.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.060
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: OK.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.510
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, you have
two lovely violins here from,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.980
made by Carl Becker in Chicago.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.240
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Carl G.
Becker, the first Carl Becker.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.540
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, right.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.070
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I was lucky
enough to know Carl F, his son,

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.240
who was a great maker also.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:19.830
He was born in 1887 and
made his first violin

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.900
in 1901 at the age of 14.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.180
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And that was
the photograph that you brought?

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.480
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
That's the photograph

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.780
that I showed you, yeah.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:33.300
And this one, he made at the
age of 20, so it would be 1917.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.130
And this is a copy
of a Guarnerius.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.290
And it's a beautiful violin

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:45.170
and it has the gorgeous
orange Becker varnish.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.030
Becker worked for Johann
Hornsteiner at Lion and Healy

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:58.120
but he did the bulk of his work
later as he developed into,

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:05.930
well even now you can
see he was brilliant.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.960
He worked for William
Lewis and Sons after that,

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.250
for quite a long time until
William Lewis was sold.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.390
And he was the head of
the William Lewis shop.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:22.560
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, he was
active the 1940's or the 1950's?

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.280
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
He was, I'm sorry,

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.880
dates are my, I will have to-- .

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: No, that's
OK, but he was a significant,

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.130
we'll do it this way, but
he was a significant force

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.240
for many decades in the
Chicago musical scene.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.050
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I think
he was, let me check this,

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.600
I think he was active
until the 70's.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Really?

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.750
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I
may be wrong, 50's?

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:51.200
He died, no I was
right, he died in 1975.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.500
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, he was,

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.420
so Carl G. Becker
was making violins

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.360
from about 1900 to the 1970's.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.660
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.960
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's
very impressive.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.560
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Through
to 1975, 1901 to 1975.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:12.150
And he was also a great
restorer and an excellent expert

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.820
at violin identification.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:21.290
So, this one is 1917.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:30.600
And this is a Stradivarius
model from 1933.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.340
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And the
other one is a Guarnerius.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.980
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: The
other is a Guarnerius copy,

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.280
copy of a Guarnerius.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.180
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And experts like
yourself can tell immediately

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:46.510
by the shape of the violin which
standard model is being echoed

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.290
by a contemporary maker?

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.120
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
Yeah, if one is, yeah.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.680
You can generally tell
first by the outline

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.980
and second by everything else.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.020
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah,
that's why you're an expert,

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.090
it's immediately
obvious, isn't it?

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:06.410
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,
Strad's and Guarneri's are easy.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.710
It can get harder.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.880
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Tell me
about the scroll on that one,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.470
that one has a lovely scroll.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.690
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
Yes, Carl Becker didn't

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:21.670
like carving scrolls
and his main competition

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:28.920
in Chicago was Carl George and
they used to accuse each other

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.460
of using German parts
and they were both right.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:37.170
Occasionally Carl Becker
would use a German scroll.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:41.080
Later on, when his son
became his partner,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.900
his son would do just
gorgeous scrolls.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.790
But, I wouldn't want to say
for sure who made this scroll,

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.090
it might have been Carl

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:54.330
or he might have modified
an import for the scroll.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:58.290
Scroll doesn't have a great deal
to do with the sound and that's

00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.590
where he was preoccupied.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.570
In Mercure, France,
which is a town

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.630
that at one time was
almost completely devoted

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.780
to violin making.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.270
They didn't consider the scroll
part of making the violin.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.710
There was, in the 20th Century,

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.080
there was a guy named
Joseph Delenyon [phonetic]

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.560
who would make all the scrolls
and he'd go from shop to shop

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.350
and the shop owner would
peek out the window and pick

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.610
out the ones he wanted.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.670
So, it's not an unusual thing.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:36.430
In the time when this, in the
time when this violin was made,

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.040
catalogs from the violin shops,

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.220
the big violin shops would
also sell violin wood,

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:47.130
they'd sell back wood, top
wood, rib wood and scrolls.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:50.130
They didn't sell scroll wood.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.430
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Interesting.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.630
Now, during the early
20's, well three quarters

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.080
of the 20th Century, if
you were a performer,

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.930
say with the Chicago Symphony,
you'd go to Carl Becker

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.320
to buy new instruments
or just take care

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.950
of your existing
instruments, is that right?

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.250
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:15.700
Carl was very important to
the musicians of Chicago.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.030
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Did
you ever meet him?

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.330
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: The senior?

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.630
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: No, he
died before I went to Chicago.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.930
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: But
you knew the son.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.060
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I
knew his son and grandson

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.250
and granddaughter, a couple
of his granddaughters.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.700
Grandson and one

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.710
of the granddaughters
are violin makers.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Still,
to this day?

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.310
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, it's
at least three generations.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:43.910
Was Becker-- ?

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.910
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Four, well
five if you count Macklett,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.260
and then there was a
generation in between

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:54.340
when there was no maker,
so you've got Macklett,

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:59.580
a generation with no
maker, Carl, oh four, OK,

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.710
math is not my strong point.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.560
There was something
that I wanted

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.020
to tell you and I got lost.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.890
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Did
his son have stories.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.310
What would be a story
that his son would tell

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.640
about Carl Senior?

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.060
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Carl Junior
had a great deal of respect

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:29.260
for his father and his father
taught him identification

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:34.090
as well as making, and they
used to go to Lake Pickerel,

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.460
Wisconsin to concentrate
on making.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:45.430
Although in later years,
Carl F. Becker, the son,

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.500
would go to Pickerel to make,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.890
but he'd always bring along
repairs and spent a lot

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.600
of time doing repair as well.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.390
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, just
to get out of Chicago,

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:57.040
they'd go to a quieter place
and concentrate on their art.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.340
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.380
There can be a lot of
competitions in one city

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:09.550
and sometimes the different
shops don't get along.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:17.120
But, one shop about
which I, Carl Becker,

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:21.880
Carl G. Becker wasn't very
close to, once told me

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.970
that if you couldn't
get a Stradivarius Cello

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:29.150
or a Montagnana Cello,
don't bother

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.080
with anything other
than a Becker.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.380
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's
quite a compliment,

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.890
especially from the competition.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.190
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Let's look
at another violin here.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.440
Who made this one?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.740
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
This violin was made

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:48.100
by Carl George in
Chicago in 1903.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:55.230
He was born in the late 19th
Century in eastern Europe

00:31:55.230 --> 00:32:00.350
and moved at the age of four
with his family to Toronto.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:05.360
And at the same time there was
a maker named Franz Wagner,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.790
a friend of the family and he
moved also to Toronto and then

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:17.460
when Carl George moved to
Chicago, Franz Wagner moved

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.050
as well and they
had a partnership

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.500
for a while, Wagner and George.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.840
So, he was probably
taught by Franz Wagner.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:32.240
He is one of the makers who,
although they weren't born

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.180
on this continent, learned
violin making on this continent.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.460
He was here since
the age of four.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:45.650
The Becker's were born here,
Macklett was born in Germany

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:51.030
and Lane was born in England.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.920
Did I show anything else?

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.380
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: No,
I think that's it.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:00.480
So, most of the violins in your
collection were made by people

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.970
who were trained in America?

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.590
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
It's hard to say.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:11.820
There is a proportion that
were trained in America

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:17.650
and there's a proportion
that were born in American

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:23.080
and there's some that were
born and trained in Europe,

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:27.720
but even in those you find
some interesting signs

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.110
that they were made in America.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:34.140
For example, the French makers,
there are a number of oddities

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.340
about the French makers
in the United States.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.850
For one thing, the
French makers didn't stay.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:43.960
The Italians, the Germans, the
Scandinavians, the English,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.820
they'd come here
and they would stay.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.780
The French couldn't
find a decent baguette

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.870
and they would go home.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:57.520
So, you have some very important
makers in the 19th Century

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.300
who came to the United
States from France.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.030
In the 19th Century it made
sense to get out of dodge,

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:11.000
because the violin business
was completely dominated

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.130
by J. B. Vuillaume in Paris.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:20.480
So, and in England, usually
they'd go from Paris to London

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.610
and London was dominated
by the hills,

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.810
so some of them would
come to the United States.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:29.820
Claude Murmol [phonetic]
came to the United States,

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.450
Paul Byee [phonetic] came
to the United States.

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:32.760
I have a Paul Byee [phonetic]

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.290
and a Murmol [phonetic]
in the collection.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:45.110
I did exhibit the collection
in Paris at one point,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.520
it was much smaller then.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:54.090
They have a festival called
Musicora and at that time it was

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.390
in the Grande [inaudible]

00:34:55.390 --> 00:35:00.590
and the French makers were
very anxious to see the work

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.410
of the French makers in America

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.930
because the violins would
be wholly their work,

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.590
no assistants.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.260
They couldn't afford to bring
their assistants all the way

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.680
from France.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.830
So, the Paul Byee [phonetic]
violin I have has a scroll

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:22.760
that's very different than
the Paul Byee's [phonetic]

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.040
that were made in
London or Paris.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.340
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And you think

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.450
that was his work
alone rather than-- ?

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:29.750
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I think

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.900
with the Murmol [phonetic]
the scroll is his work alone.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.360
With the Byee [phonetic],
he might have bought it

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.710
from somebody, there's something
very naive about the scroll

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.000
on the Paul Byee [phonetic]
and he might have bought it

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.520
from an American maker.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.600
That one's a puzzle.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.330
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's like a
mystery when you get a violin,

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.960
especially when there's
no label on it or even

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.350
if there is a label, to kind
of suss out where it came from

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.780
and who might have made it.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.420
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: That's
true, and I was presented

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:04.760
with a violin a few weeks
ago, gorgeous violin,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.120
and the color threw me.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.930
I'd never seen an
American violin that color.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:13.230
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You mean
the color of the varnish?

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.040
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: The color
of the varnish, it just really,

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.920
it distracted me and made it
very difficult for me to think

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.880
of who made something
of this color?

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.670
It's actually this color.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.440
I don't believe in polishing.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.610
But, I do believe in cleaning

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:39.300
and when I cleaned this before
bringing it here I found a color

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.230
that was pretty similar to
one of that mystery violin.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.860
And there were some other
characteristics that matched

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.840
so I want to get the two
together in the same room.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.930
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Let's talk
a little bit now about,

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.470
what would you like
to see happen

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:59.190
with your American
violin collection?

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:05.700
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I think it's
very important to have a place

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:12.330
where you can verify the
identity of a violin.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:20.180
Even American violins are
being misrepresented today.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:25.100
I don't know of anybody
who is doing the kind

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.610
of things that [inaudible] did.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:29.650
There may be people like that.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:33.050
But I do know that there are
people who look at a violin

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.830
and say, what was it, what
is it and what will it be?

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.980
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Sort of a
research library of violins.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.130
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Exactly,
because there are people in some

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.860
of the auctions, you can find
violins with Italian labels

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.650
that were made on
this continent.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:52.950
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, there's no
place you can go now to get a,

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:57.250
there's no museum or library
that has a collection of violins

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.700
that are sort of
encyclopedic of American makers?

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.000
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Right.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.550
And to me the collection
is a document

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.280
and it's an important document.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:12.700
But, it's also, it also
illustrates the quality

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.960
of American violins.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.510
As I said, there was a
long-standing prejudice

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.900
against things made here, it
had to be, if it was going

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.680
to be good, it had
to be from Europe.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.310
And I used to run into players
who had American violins and,

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.850
"This is my second violin,
and you know, it sounds good."

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:31.490
You know, they're, it
was like a talking dog.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:36.330
It didn't matter what
it said, it was just-- .

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:38.580
But, they do sound
good, you know,

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.600
the best made ones are
wonderful sounding things.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.460
As I told you with the Becker's,
you know, the preference

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:51.580
for a Becker cello over
everything except a Montagnana

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:57.410
and a Strad, and there was a,
the chief, the principal cellist

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.600
of the Chicago Symphony was a
gentleman named Frank Miller,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.810
until he died some years
ago, who always played

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:08.590
on a violin made in New York
City by a man named Paul Pilat.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.560
And he could have had anything,
could have had a Strad,

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.120
could have had a Montagnana,
but he loved the Pilat.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now, are
some of the instruments

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.610
in your collection playable.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.650
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah, quite
a few of them are playable.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.460
Everything I brought here is.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.760
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So-- .

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.970
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: So,
they can be played, yeah,

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.600
and not every single
one is set up.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:37.660
There are quite a few that are
not, but you know, you can play

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.730
on them and see what they do.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:46.360
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, would
it be, let me start again.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.530
So, if your collection were to
come someplace like the Library

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.390
of Congress, many of the
instruments could be used

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:59.350
or played or made
to speak again.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.880
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
There's no reason why not.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.580
Yeah, as I said, many of
them can be played today,

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:08.390
so that's kind of a given.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.950
They could be loaned out, they
could be used in concerts,

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.530
there are any number of
ways they can be used.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:19.140
But for me, because of my
own interest, the importance

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.470
of them is to see,
to have evidence.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.730
This was made by this person.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.190
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: A
reference library of violins?

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.490
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.730
There's a violin
auction in Boston,

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:40.050
the Skinner violin auction, and
there's an unusual custom there.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.930
Violin wholesalers take
rooms right across the street

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:49.930
from the auction house and
the violin dealers who come

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.280
to the auction, some of them
are not attracted so much

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:59.850
by the auction, but by
visiting the rooms of the people

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:03.860
who are there to sell
their violins and I used

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.430
to bring a room full of violins

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:09.500
up when I was wholesaling
violins,

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.720
as did many of my
colleagues, and there's a lot

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.790
that goes on in those rooms.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:18.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You
mean trading or-- .

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:22.280
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Trading,
buying, selling, identification.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.990
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Just passing
information back and forth?

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.290
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yeah.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.120
I mean, it's a busman's holiday.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.770
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Fascinating
world because there's just

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:34.720
so much to know about violins.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.210
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
It's something,

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:42.820
some people buy violins
over the internet,

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:48.480
which has always struck
me as buying a shoe

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.050
with no size specified,
off the internet

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.210
and a very fuzzy
photo, you know.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.960
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Do you have,

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:04.990
in your collection
of 263, more or less.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:08.140
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: No,
there's actually a couple more

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:13.510
that I didn't put any specific
value on, that are part

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.710
of the collection that will
come here with any luck.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.160
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I know
it's like asking you

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.200
to name a favorite child,
but do you have a couple

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.010
that are your favorites?

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.870
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: This
is one of my favorites.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.420
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And why,
this is the Carl George?

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.720
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: This
is the Carl George.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.200
I think it's a beautiful violin.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:39.260
I think he did a fantastic
job on this instrument

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:44.280
and I don't know
what else to say.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.580
I think this is a great violin.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.880
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It
appeals to you?

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.520
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
Yeah, it speaks to me.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.890
There are a few others.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:54.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, tell
me about that violin.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:56.800
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: This
violin was made by Carl George

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:02.360
for his sweetheart in 1904 and
in that year, the photograph

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.150
of Paganini's cannon, that's
what he called his violin,

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.570
appeared in the Chicago
newspaper

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:12.120
and Carl George copied
from the photograph.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.620
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Because
the original cannon,

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.110
which is a very famous
violin in Genoa.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.100
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: The
cannon lives in Genoa

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:24.260
and very rarely has it ever
left since Paganini's death.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.590
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What
makes a violin beautiful?

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.260
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Everything
about the way it's made.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.220
I mean the first thing that
most people see is the wood.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.160
The first thing the violin
experts see is the outline,

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.500
the silhouette.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.690
And the precision
with which it's made,

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:49.520
the quality of the wood and
the varnish are important,

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.810
but also every aspect of
the making, the arching,

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:58.810
the cleanness of the
execution of the purfling.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:06.890
It's three strips of wood that
are inlaid around the violin.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.810
The purpose of this
wood, of the purfling,

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:15.280
is to make the top weaker there
so that it if it's struck,

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.920
the crack will go as far
as the purfling and stop.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:24.390
For this reason, there are
some Italian and English makers

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.240
who didn't purfle the back,

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.700
because the back is
much stronger wood.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.970
But, the truth is that
violins look a little strange

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.730
without it.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.250
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
what about sound,

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:40.970
can you determine how a violin
will sound by just looking

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:48.050
at it, or do you
have to play it?

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:51.740
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: A violin
maker should be able to tell

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.740
if he can make a
violin sound good.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.660
If the violin is beautiful

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.240
and the three-dimensional
arch is beautiful

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.850
and the varnish allows it to
vibrate, then you should be able

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.830
to make it, then it's your
responsibility to make it sound.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:15.630
And I don't like altering
the thicknesses of the top

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:19.350
and the back, but there
are people who do that.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:24.320
I find that the importance of
the ribs is sometimes ignored.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.620
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: The
ribs are the sides?

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.920
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: The sides.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.080
How can you expect the
top and back to vibrate

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.620
if the sides are rigid?

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.480
It can't. And so,
I've had great success

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.920
with occasionally bringing
out the sound of an instrument

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.610
by bringing the ribs to
the proper thickness.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:45.410
But, you know, you also
have to do the right set up,

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:48.780
you have to have the
proper angle of the neck

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.360
and elevation here and here.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.060
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, and
there's some inside parts

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.630
to the violin right that
need to be adjusted.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.530
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,
there's a base bar along the,

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.880
that supports the base
and that's very important

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:06.690
to the sound, and
the fit and position

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.780
of the sound post is important.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.330
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Which is
the little post that goes

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.130
to the back to the front.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.350
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: The
wonderful and horrible things

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:20.740
about violins is that everything
counts, absolutely everything.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.930
This distance is extremely
important to the sound.

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:28.520
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Between the
bridge and the tailpiece.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.820
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.160
The position of the tail
gut is really important.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.630
How close together
they are or far apart.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:45.240
You can do marvelous things
that way and in our shop,

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:50.480
we are very slow to
move a sound post

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.200
because you can do an awful lot

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.390
with the lightest
tap on the bridge.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:47:02.270
Moving the sound post is
generally a bigger change

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:04.970
and you don't need
big changes to make

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:06.660
to a big change in the sound.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.420
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Can you
talk to me for just a minute

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.660
about American varnishes?

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:17.340
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,
varnish is a mysterious topic.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:22.450
Every couple of years someone
discovers the original varnish

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:24.720
and they publicize
it and therefore,

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.170
their violins are the ones you
should buy, but the truth is,

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:32.030
we have a lot of
different varnish recipes

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.700
and I think the original
varnish has been rediscovered

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.000
many times.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.360
The problem is, nobody
can prove it.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.920
Stradivarius, you know,
all this nonsense is made

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:49.090
about Stradivarius' varnish,
when it was exactly the same

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.140
as the varnish that was
used by everyone else

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.380
in his town, it had to be.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.750
Stradivarius was a member of
the Instrument Makers Guild

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.330
and the first law
of every guild is

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:01.260
that you must patronize
the other guild members

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.600
of the different guilds.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:07.200
So, Stradivarius by law
had to buy his varnish

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:12.120
from the apothecary as did every
other violin maker in town,

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.670
and they bought the same thing.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:18.310
And one of the clues to this
for me was the violinist

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:22.950
of J. B. Guadagnini who worked
in four or five different cities

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:25.880
and his varnish was different
in every city he went to.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.020
Because the apothecaries used
slightly different recipes

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.040
in every city and
there you have it.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.290
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And what
about American varnishes.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:40.600
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: There's
a cornucopia of them.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:46.560
I think it's very difficult to
identify an instrument's country

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:53.330
of origin by the varnish because
some makers used a different

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:56.800
formula of varnish on
every violin they made.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:02.470
So, the prescription for
varnish can be anything anywhere

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:04.770
in the world.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.480
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: OK.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.780
Thank you very much.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.080
Oh, two questions, OK.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.730
&gt;&gt; David, did you or
Nancy did you ask him

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.710
where the American's would
have gotten their wood source?

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:20.460
And David, do you have
any violins that you made?

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.980
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, do you
have any violins that you made?

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.650
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Do
I have to admit it?

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:28.950
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh, yeah sure.

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:30.940
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I
have a couple, yeah.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.240
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
do you play them?

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.630
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: No.

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:39.050
There is one that I used
to play occasionally.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:43.520
OK, I have the, I don't
know what to call it.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.340
I'm the only person
I've every heard

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:49.980
of who played Carnegie Hall
with his own violin three times,

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.930
three different violins.

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:54.840
So, there you go.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So,
all of them now can be,

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.190
you can say were
played in Carnegie Hall.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.490
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: I guess so.

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.500
I don't know where any but
the first one is now, so.

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.260
Oh yeah, I know where
two of them are.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.720
The third one I have no idea.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.470
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And are they
part of your collection?

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:11.960
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Only one.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.890
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And you
consider that your best violin?

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:17.150
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Oh
no, that's my first.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:21.320
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Let me
ask you another question.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.810
Can you talk a little bit

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:28.550
about where the American violin
makers got their wood from?

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:34.440
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well, it
depends in what period of time.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:41.840
In the, there were violin makers
early in the 19th Century,

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:47.500
there was a man named John
Antes in northern Pennsylvania

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:51.380
and there were others, and
they made their violins

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.580
with locally precured woods.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:51:00.890
As America became wealthier,
we imported more violins

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:02.920
and there were more
people making them

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:07.840
and we also imported
violin making wood.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:12.570
And as I mentioned, the
shops through the 19th

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:17.380
and early 20th Century would
sell violin makers tools

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:23.050
and back wood, side wood,
top wood and scrolls.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:31.370
But, in the 19th Century,
American wood became a fashion.

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:36.180
During the 19th Century,
many violin makers

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.410
in the United States, I'm
thinking particularly in Boston,

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.210
became, and New England
in general,

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.830
became really preoccupied

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:47.290
with obtaining the
oldest wood they could

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:54.840
and I have a violin I believe by
Calvin Baker, on which he wrote

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.270
on the label that the wood was

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:01.330
from a famous church dated
17 something or other.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.150
Now, modern, there's
a modern science

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:07.140
of wood called dendrochronology.

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:16.300
We can tell the age of the most
recent ring by comparing it

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:20.260
with [inaudible] samples, it's
a like a huge database of wood

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.920
from the primary places
from where wood comes,

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:27.440
and we've discovered that
the great makes of Cremona

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:32.250
in the 18th Century very
rarely used wood older

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:38.110
than five years old and
almost never older than 10.

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:42.720
So, you know, the
whole preoccupation

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:47.410
with old wood doesn't
seem to hold much water.

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:50.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So, the wood
that supposedly had been aged,

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:54.190
doesn't make much
difference in the sound?

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:55.490
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Well,

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:57.910
it might because
age does something,

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:03.040
but we don't know exactly what
and where and the great makers

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:07.510
in Cremona, being members of
the guild, had to buy wood

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:09.400
from the wood cutters guild.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.700
I mean, there are
all these stories

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:14.560
about the Stradivarius going
into a forest at midnight

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.810
and tapping the trees,
complete nonsense.

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.170
He had to buy it
from the same people

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:24.300
that every other instrument
maker in his town bought it from

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:27.340
and the only unique thing,

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:32.530
these wood cutters would
have a special shed

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:35.870
for instrument making
wood and the unique thing

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:39.100
about this shed is
that the floor

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:43.490
of the shed would
be lattice work

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:50.110
and they would throw old
vegetables underneath the wood

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:55.670
so the wood would be fumed
by the ammonia fumes,

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:59.200
they would be ammonia
fumed by the-- .

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.500
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: By
rotting vegetables?

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.190
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: By
rotting vegetables.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:03.520
How much this had to do

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.580
with anything is really a
serious question because none

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.180
of the wood that was exposed

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.610
to these fumes would end
up on the instrument.

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:14.870
You'd have to carve
away all the outsides

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:18.190
and so the fuming would
have to go pretty deep

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:21.970
and whether it does or
not, I couldn't tell you.

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.850
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And what
about using historic wood,

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:30.080
like from an old church
or a famous tree or,

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.240
do you have some examples
of that in your collection?

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.710
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg: Yes, as I
said, I have at least one violin

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:38.420
where it's written
either in the violin

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.970
or on the label sometimes, you
know, the wood from this was

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:48.100
from such and such a church,
constructed in 17 something.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:53.970
Wood, every few years
or so, someone will come

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:58.300
out with the secret of
Stradivari and then reveal

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.810
that the Stradivari's
and the Anandi's

00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:04.070
and the Guarneri's are
going to be useless soon

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:07.720
because they've reached the
end of their usefulness.

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:12.190
You know, wood can only
last so long and you know,

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:16.950
there are houses in Europe built
in the 14th Century out of wood

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:18.710
that are still quite healthy,

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:25.190
so I don't think that's
even close to true.

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:27.020
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: OK, thank
you so much for coming in

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:30.740
and sharing information about
these wonderful violins.

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:33.040
&gt;&gt; David Bromberg:
Thank you for having me.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:56.290

of the Library of Congress.
