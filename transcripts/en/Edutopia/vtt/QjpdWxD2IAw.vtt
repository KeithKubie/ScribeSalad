00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.616
&gt;&gt;Allyson: We've seen
success with these students.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:10.486
Ninety-eight percent of our students
go on to a four year college.

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:18.886
&gt;&gt;Joseph: High Tech High School
is a traditional academic program

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:20.566
with a vocational component.

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.846
&gt;&gt;Allyson: The vision of the school
is that interest drives learning.

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:27.686
The academics support the
career and technical vocation

00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:30.446
so that you have this really
well rounded, interested,

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:33.846
high level student who's doing
something that they love.

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:37.986
&gt;&gt;Joseph: We have majors in the school.

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:42.416
Those majors are the vocational areas
that the students can participate in.

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:46.506
We have a science department,
which is a combination

00:00:46.506 --> 00:00:50.266
of traditional academic
sciences as well as research.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:54.376
We have a technology department,
which is business technology,

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:57.576
computer applications
as well as graphic arts.

00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:01.046
We have our architecture
and engineering academy

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:04.746
and then we have a performing
arts program which consists

00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:10.356
of musical theater, dance,
audio technology and drama.

00:01:13.526 --> 00:01:17.436
&gt;&gt;John: As a freshman they get to
pick four of our vocational courses

00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:19.306
that they think they
might be interested in.

00:01:19.306 --> 00:01:21.506
The next year as a sophomore,
they take two

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:23.756
of our vocational courses
for half a year.

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:27.186
And then when they really want to
commit, say, "Oh, this is what we want

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:30.536
to do," then they take a full
year, their junior and senior year.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.826
&gt;&gt;Allyson: Every major needs
to have an advisory committee.

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:38.266
On that advisory committee,
you have parents,

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.556
you have students, you
have professionals.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.636
We're very tied into industry, so
what we do is we go to our partners

00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:47.746
and we say, "Tell us what
the students should know

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:49.336
by the time they get
out of high school."

00:01:49.336 --> 00:01:53.886
And the idea is that what we're teaching
in school is relevant to industry.

00:01:55.046 --> 00:02:00.336
&gt;&gt;John: in the twenty-first century,
communication, teamwork, research,

00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:02.966
knowing where to go for
your information,

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.036
is paramount to having
a successful career.

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:10.666
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Our teachers stay on the
cutting edge of their particular area.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:14.026
If they don't maintain
that dual citizenship,

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:15.986
they're going to be left
behind and we're not going

00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:18.666
to offer our students
what they need to succeed.

00:02:20.446 --> 00:02:21.986
&gt;&gt;Scott: I think as much as we can,

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:25.906
we try to share our own
experiences with them.

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:30.496
We have people coming in on a
regular basis, doing workshops

00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:35.066
with our students, and some of that is
through our professional connections.

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:39.156
&gt;&gt;Arun: In my department,
there are four other PhDs.

00:02:39.246 --> 00:02:41.536
They want to expand it
to the profession.

00:02:41.636 --> 00:02:43.596
They wanted to have project
based learning.

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:47.396
Besides the regular classroom
teaching, you will see a lot

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:51.376
of students inside the lab,
white coats, eye goggles,

00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:53.536
and working on their projects.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:57.726
&gt;&gt;Angelica: We're trying to find out
heat of combustion of biofuels compared

00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:00.766
to the heat of combustion of
diesel, because we're trying to see

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:02.936
which one's a better,
viable source of energy.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.076
Right now, we're trying to
see how much heat it produces.

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:08.816
&gt;&gt;Arun: I give them only the
framework, so we are trying

00:03:08.816 --> 00:03:10.856
to do it in a step process.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.576
That's how science is done.

00:03:12.576 --> 00:03:18.226
They are trying to solve a problem
and by doing that, they are learning.

00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:21.756
&gt;&gt;Allyson: One thing we do here, which
I think is a little different is,

00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:26.096
we have what are called unscheduled
periods, even for freshmen.

00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:29.726
We want them to learn at fourteen
years old, how to manage their time.

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:34.036
&gt;&gt;Max: As a freshman, you have to do a
lot of work, but as you get used to it,

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:38.736
it becomes much more manageable and
you find that your work ethic improves.

00:03:39.326 --> 00:03:41.176
&gt;&gt;Arun: Freedom is the
best thing for students.

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:45.746
If you give them this freedom to do
what they like or what they want to do,

00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:49.696
and then guide them through that, then
you have quite successful students.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:52.906
&gt;&gt;Allyson: We try and create a college
environment from the very beginning.

00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:55.096
That's why we have unscheduled periods.

00:03:55.096 --> 00:03:58.296
That's why we have remediation
programs after school,

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:00.726
a lot of social and emotional support.

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.466
I think the kids are happy and
I think that's why they do well.
