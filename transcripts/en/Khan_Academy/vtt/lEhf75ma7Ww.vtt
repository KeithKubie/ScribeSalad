00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.450
In the following table,
is y a function of x?

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.170
In order for y to
be a function of x,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.920
for any x that we input into
our little function box--

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.440
so let's say this is
y as a function of x.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.580
It needs to spit out
only one value of y.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.460
If it spit out
multiple values of y,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.660
then it might be a
relationship, but it's not

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.060
going to be a function.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.870
So this is a function.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.350
This is a function.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.260
If we had a situation where
if we input x into a box,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.340
it could be multiple
possible y's,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.060
then this is not a function.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.820
So let's think about this
table right over here.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.690
When x is equal to 1,
we get y is equal to 1.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.270
But when x is equal to 1
again, all of a sudden,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.880
y is equal to 2.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.620
So here we have a
situation where we input 1

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.520
into our little
relationship box,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.710
and when we input 1 into
our relationship box,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.270
we could get a 1, or
we could get a 2 for y.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.160
So this is definitely
not a function.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.910
For any input into
a function, it

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.060
has to map to
exactly one output.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.490
Here it's mapping
to two outputs.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.650
So this is not a function.
