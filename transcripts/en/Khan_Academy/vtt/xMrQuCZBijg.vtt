00:00:01.362 --> 00:00:04.006
- [Sal] This is Sal, here,
I'm here with Jeffrey Rosen,

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.233
head of the National Constitution Center

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:08.937
and we're gonna talk about Article Two

00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:10.998
of the United States Constitution.

00:00:10.998 --> 00:00:12.891
So, Jeffrey, what does the Article Two,

00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:14.761
what does Article Two deal with?

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.386
- [Jeffrey] It deals
with the executive power,

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:18.623
the powers of presidency
and it lays them out

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:21.997
and it starts by saying
the executive power shall

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:25.591
be vested in a President of
the United States of America.

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:29.350
- [Sal] And today that
seems somewhat commonsense,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.446
the the executive power is invested in the

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:32.798
President of the United States of America.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.171
Why did they, what's special about that?

00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.024
- [Jeffrey] Well, when the
Constitution was drafted,

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.864
it wasn't obvious we'd have
a single executive under the

00:00:39.864 --> 00:00:42.639
Articles of Confederation,
all the state governors,

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:46.248
some of them had plural executives.

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:48.597
Alexander Hamilton at the
Constitutional Convention

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:51.700
was proposing a kind of
monarchy, a President for Life,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.464
so the idea of setting out
limited powers for the presidency

00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:57.733
and specifying what they
were, creating a President

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.732
that was energetic enough
to achieve common purposes

00:01:00.732 --> 00:01:02.902
but restrained enough not to be a tyrant

00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:05.956
was a huge achievement
for the Constitution.

00:01:05.956 --> 00:01:07.663
- [Sal] That under the
Articles of Confederation

00:01:07.663 --> 00:01:09.883
there wasn't a proper
executive branch, it was really

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:13.582
the President presided, so
to speak, over Congress.

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:16.509
- [Jeffrey] That's right
and each, you needed

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.961
unanimous consent to get
anything done, which is why

00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.034
the Confederate Congress
couldn't raise money

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:24.929
to support the war efforts
and couldn't raise taxes.

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.017
So the framers came to
Philadelphia to create an

00:01:28.017 --> 00:01:31.432
energetic executive but one
that was also restrained

00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:34.414
and that's why the vesting
power is so important.

00:01:34.414 --> 00:01:38.858
It basically says that the,
all executive power is vested

00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:40.191
in the President

00:01:41.118 --> 00:01:43.899
but that power is not unlimited.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.791
Now, people have disagreed
about how much power

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:47.089
the vesting power grants.

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:49.342
Theodore Roosevelt had
this stewardship theory

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:52.334
that the President can do
anything that's not forbidden

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:54.345
by the Constitution and Article Two.

00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:58.089
William Howard Taft, who
came after Roosevelt,

00:01:58.089 --> 00:02:00.210
had the opposite theory,
a kind of judicial

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.463
theory of the President.

00:02:01.463 --> 00:02:04.446
He said the President can
only do what isn't forbidden.

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:06.681
So the question of whether
Article Two is the exclusive

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:09.412
series of presidential
powers or whether there

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:12.045
are other implicit powers
is a debate that continues

00:02:12.045 --> 00:02:13.386
to this day.

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:14.730
- [Sal] This will be fascinating.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.391
We'll go into much more
depth in future videos.

00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:18.428
And just going through
the rest of Section One,

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:20.879
it looks like there's
a lot of the mechanics

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.133
of what does it mean to
have a term of office.

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.050
What the, how you become President.

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.496
Is that essentially Section One?

00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:32.799
You see this first part, he
shall hold his office during

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.183
the term of four years and
together with the Vice President,

00:02:35.183 --> 00:02:37.480
chose for the same term,
be elected as follows.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.673
And then they kind of go into
the electoral college system.

00:02:39.673 --> 00:02:41.444
- [Jeffrey] Exactly, and then there are

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:42.482
a couple other requirements.

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:45.836
No person except a natural born citizen

00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:48.362
can be President and we
know that term was subject

00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:51.451
to some debate during the
recent presidential election.

00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:54.549
And then there's the provision
that says that Presidents

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.119
have to 35 years old,
it's the most explicit

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.607
part of the Constitution
and the point was to prevent

00:03:00.607 --> 00:03:03.209
aristocratic scions
without a lot of experience

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.477
from taking office.

00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:06.508
The framers were really
concerned about having

00:03:06.508 --> 00:03:08.639
new monarchies and they wanted
to make sure that Presidents

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.706
were seasoned enough
so that's why you can't

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:13.278
be President unless you're 35.

00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:15.139
- [Sal] Fascinating.

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.984
And as we go further,
and I've copied this text

00:03:18.984 --> 00:03:21.909
from your website, from the
National Constitution Center

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.271
and why did you all
highlight some of this text

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.948
of Article Two in this
yellow-orange color?

00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:28.800
- [Jeffrey] Well, we're really
thrilled by this website,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.593
we're excited to be doing a
series of videos with you,

00:03:31.593 --> 00:03:34.016
Sal, and it's the
interactive Constitution,

00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:36.452
folks can find it at
constitutioncenter.org.

00:03:36.452 --> 00:03:39.367
These are the main clauses
where we commission the top

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:41.206
liberal and conservative
scholars to write about

00:03:41.206 --> 00:03:43.602
what they agreed and
disagreed about these clauses.

00:03:43.602 --> 00:03:47.806
So in Section One of
Article Two, the main clause

00:03:47.806 --> 00:03:50.266
is the vesting clause and
that's the one to focus on.

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:52.086
The other stuff, as you
said, is basically just

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:54.106
requirements of what you have to

00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:55.335
be in order to be President.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.684
And then we highlighted
other important provisions

00:03:57.684 --> 00:04:00.499
in Sections Two, Three, and Four.

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.506
- [Sal] Yep and in
particular this section on

00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:06.709
the electoral college
system, this was superseded,

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.769
I saw, I learned from your
website, by the 12th Amendment.

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.373
Is that because of what happened with

00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:13.905
Aaron Burr and Thomas Jefferson?

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:15.856
- [Jeffrey] Yes, we know that
from the musical Hamilton,

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:18.451
the election of 1800 did not end well.

00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:21.534
There was actually a tie in the House

00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:25.874
and so it went into the

00:04:25.874 --> 00:04:27.699
electoral college and Aaron,

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.801
rather a tie in the electoral
college, it went to the House

00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:34.858
and Alexander Hamilton cast
his support for Jefferson

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:37.274
over Burr and Burr was
so furious about that

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:40.150
that he challenged Hamilton to the duel

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.842
that ultimately killed him.

00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:45.135
But the peculiarity of
having the original system

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:47.314
where the first place winner
in the electoral college

00:04:47.314 --> 00:04:49.202
became President and
the second place winner

00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:53.724
became Vice President was
so unwieldy that provision

00:04:53.724 --> 00:04:55.829
of the Constitution was
amended and now, as we know,

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.984
Presidents and vice Presidents
run on a single ticket.

00:04:59.984 --> 00:05:00.949
- [Sal] Yup, yup.

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.581
And the rest of Section
One, it kind of finishes

00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:04.714
off with, in the case of the
removal of the President,

00:05:04.714 --> 00:05:06.982
his death, resignation,
or inability to discharge

00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:10.183
the powers, it talks
about how Congress can

00:05:10.183 --> 00:05:12.675
provide for who should be President next.

00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:15.063
- [Jeffrey] Exactly, so,
and there are statutes

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:18.366
that provide that and
Congress has an elaborate

00:05:18.366 --> 00:05:21.127
rule of succession that
it's created as empowered

00:05:21.127 --> 00:05:23.478
by this part of the Constitution.

00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:25.835
- [Sal] Yep, and then
the last two pieces here,

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:27.954
it talks about just the
compensation of the President,

00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:31.034
cannot be increased or
diminished during the period

00:05:31.034 --> 00:05:33.743
for which he shall be
elected, maybe to prevent him

00:05:33.743 --> 00:05:36.803
from giving himself a raise
or herself from giving

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:39.498
herself a raise and then
the last is just the famous

00:05:39.498 --> 00:05:41.064
oath of office.

00:05:41.064 --> 00:05:43.836
I do solemnly swear or
affirm that I will faithfully

00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:48.247
execute the office of the
President of the United States

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:51.141
and will do to the best
of my ability, preserve,

00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:54.555
protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States.

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:56.213
- [Jeffrey] Sal, you did a
great job, although there was

00:05:56.213 --> 00:05:58.017
an extra do in there and
I'm pointing that out

00:05:58.017 --> 00:06:00.059
because you remember when
Chief Justice Roberts

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.656
administered the oath to President Obama.

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:04.058
The fact that he slightly
bungled it led Roberts,

00:06:04.058 --> 00:06:08.037
just to be safe, to
re-administer the oath.

00:06:08.037 --> 00:06:11.053
So, if you want, I can
do it again and maybe

00:06:11.053 --> 00:06:12.720
you'll be President.

00:06:13.947 --> 00:06:15.680
- [Sal] Sounds good.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.925
So then we get into Section
Two which is, I think, maybe,

00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:20.993
gets a little bit more involved.

00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:23.160
This first paragraph here,

00:06:24.623 --> 00:06:28.019
it says the President shall
be the Commander in Chief

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:31.780
of the Army and Navy of the
United States and clearly

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.887
they don't say all of the
different forces of the

00:06:35.887 --> 00:06:38.263
United States because we
didn't have an Air Force then.

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:39.146
- [Jeffrey] Yes.

00:06:39.146 --> 00:06:40.020
- [Sal] Or Marines.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.464
- [Jeffrey] We sure didn't,
but there was a concern about

00:06:43.464 --> 00:06:46.999
the king controlling the
military, so the two main

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:50.509
purposes of this Commander
in Chief clause are, first,

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.376
total civilian control of
the military and second,

00:06:53.376 --> 00:06:56.225
the idea that there's
just a single leader.

00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:59.874
So the military is
subordinate to civilian and

00:06:59.874 --> 00:07:02.633
democratically accountable
control and unlike the

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:06.404
Articles of Confederation, a
single person gets to control

00:07:06.404 --> 00:07:08.885
all of this power so that you can have a

00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:11.743
coordinated military force.

00:07:11.743 --> 00:07:13.896
- [Sal] And as simple and
as clean as this statement

00:07:13.896 --> 00:07:16.510
seems to be, in future
videos we'll discuss more

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.756
of how this may or may
not be in contention with

00:07:19.756 --> 00:07:22.062
the power given to Congress in Article One

00:07:22.062 --> 00:07:24.341
around the right to declare war.

00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:29.247
- [Jeffrey] Exactly right,
we know that the President

00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:31.914
in Section Two has the power to,

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.760
Congress has the power to
declare war and the question

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.078
of what the President can do
is contested, as you said.

00:07:43.078 --> 00:07:44.928
We'll talk about it more
later but everyone agrees

00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:49.808
that the President has the
ability to repel sudden attacks.

00:07:49.808 --> 00:07:52.209
At the same time, we
haven't had a declared war

00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:54.091
since World War Two,
although there's been lots of

00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:56.204
military actions and
the question of how much

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:58.096
independent power the
President has to initiate

00:07:58.096 --> 00:08:01.228
military action is very hotly contested.

00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:04.071
- [Sal] Yep, and in this next
section, this talks about

00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:06.951
the power of the
President to make treaties

00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:11.034
but with the advice and
consent of the Senate and

00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:15.183
it has to be approved,
provided two thirds of

00:08:15.183 --> 00:08:17.575
the senators present concur.

00:08:17.575 --> 00:08:20.616
- [Jeffrey] Yes, so the
treaty power is shared between

00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:23.797
the President and the Senate,
and generally people think

00:08:23.797 --> 00:08:26.210
that the Senate can approve
or disapprove or maybe

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.090
attach conditions or
reservations to the treaty

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.413
but the President, alone,
has the power to negotiate

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:35.766
treaties and that was a precedent
set by George Washington.

00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:37.789
So the treaty power is shared.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.729
- [Sal] And there's a lot
here cause it also talks

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:43.896
about the power of the President
to appoint ambassadors,

00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:47.767
other public ministers,
consuls, judges of the

00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:50.595
Supreme Court, and other
officers of the United States.

00:08:50.595 --> 00:08:52.405
So this is a pretty
important sentence there.

00:08:52.405 --> 00:08:53.492
- [Jeffrey] It sure is.

00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:55.541
We know now from the controversy over

00:08:55.541 --> 00:08:57.918
Supreme Court nominations
that the so-called advice

00:08:57.918 --> 00:09:01.137
and consent clause is really important.

00:09:01.137 --> 00:09:03.893
The advice and consent
clause is limited to

00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:08.425
high officers as opposed
to inferior officers.

00:09:08.425 --> 00:09:10.581
Because the clause says
for inferior officers,

00:09:10.581 --> 00:09:12.369
Congress can vest the
appointment in the President

00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:15.089
alone, in the courts of law or
the heads of the department.

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:17.814
But for high ranking officials
like Supreme Court judges,

00:09:17.814 --> 00:09:21.329
the President can nominate,
the Senate exercises advice

00:09:21.329 --> 00:09:25.381
and consent and this is a
shared power between the

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:27.292
President and Congress.

00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:29.578
- [Sal] Yes, and just
to make people familiar

00:09:29.578 --> 00:09:31.391
with the language, when
they're talking about inferior

00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:32.928
officers, they're not
making any judgment about

00:09:32.928 --> 00:09:35.641
those peoples capability,
they're more talking about

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:39.740
a more junior, less senior
officials in the government.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.635
- [Jeffrey] That's an
excellent point but although

00:09:41.635 --> 00:09:44.618
it is a term of art, it's
hugely important and people

00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:46.910
have disputed about who
counts as an inferior officer

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.247
cause a lot hangs on it.

00:09:49.247 --> 00:09:51.507
If the officer isn't inferior
then the President alone

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.359
doesn't get to appoint them.

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:54.367
- [Sal] And then they--

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:56.834
- [Jeffrey] Sorry, and
also the question of who

00:09:56.834 --> 00:09:59.134
the President can remove or
fire without Congressional

00:09:59.134 --> 00:10:01.751
approval is important
and may hinge on that

00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:03.750
question as well.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.447
- [Sal] Right, and we'll talk
more about it, but it seems

00:10:05.447 --> 00:10:09.466
like, you need Senate consent
for more of the getting

00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:12.799
people into their jobs but being able to

00:10:14.407 --> 00:10:16.523
remove them is oftentimes,
there's more power there

00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:17.644
for the President.

00:10:17.644 --> 00:10:19.892
- [Jeffrey] Absolutely,
although again, like most of

00:10:19.892 --> 00:10:22.577
these powers, they're
contested, there are arguments

00:10:22.577 --> 00:10:24.785
on both sides throughout
history and the Supreme

00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:28.070
Court has both recognized
the President's unitary

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.162
authority to fire
executive branch officials

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.091
but in other cases have said
that Congress can impose

00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:36.171
certain conditions on when the
President can fire someone.

00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:38.254
- [Sal] And somewhere we'll
talk about it more but

00:10:38.254 --> 00:10:41.056
this next sentence, really,
is also a really interesting

00:10:41.056 --> 00:10:43.587
one is that look, when
the Senate is in recess,

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.598
the power shall have the
President, the President

00:10:45.598 --> 00:10:47.779
shall have the power to
fill up all vacancies

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:50.658
and it seems like it's
a temporary filling of

00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:53.753
positions by granting
commissions which shall expire

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:55.947
at the end of their next session.

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:57.877
- [Jeffrey] That's exactly
right and the President's

00:10:57.877 --> 00:11:00.324
power to make recess
appointments was just litigated

00:11:00.324 --> 00:11:02.411
before the Supreme Court
and the Supreme Court

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:04.900
unanimously that President
Obama could not make

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.945
certain appointments because
Congress wasn't technically

00:11:07.945 --> 00:11:10.200
out of session, so the
question of when the Senate

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.566
is in recess is very
contested and the scope

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:16.492
of that power is really important as well.

00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:20.392
- [Sal] And Section Three,
it kind of just says,

00:11:20.392 --> 00:11:23.023
hey, the President can
get Congress together for

00:11:23.023 --> 00:11:24.947
the State of the Union,
can address Congress,

00:11:24.947 --> 00:11:28.722
can kind of tell Congress
what's on his or her mind.

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.055
- [Jeffrey] Yes.

00:11:31.568 --> 00:11:34.332
It does say that and
the State of the Union

00:11:34.332 --> 00:11:35.583
power is really important.

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:38.065
You know, there's one
other clause in Section Two

00:11:38.065 --> 00:11:40.142
that just might want to flag and that's

00:11:40.142 --> 00:11:41.892
the take care clause.

00:11:42.953 --> 00:11:45.643
Sorry, that's in Section
Three and I know you're about

00:11:45.643 --> 00:11:46.781
to get to it.

00:11:46.781 --> 00:11:49.448
So we start with this ability to

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:53.300
give Congress information
about the State of the Union,

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.633
the ability to convene
both Houses of Congress

00:11:55.633 --> 00:11:57.312
in cases of disagreement among them.

00:11:57.312 --> 00:11:59.662
Then you get to this really
core power, that he shall

00:11:59.662 --> 00:12:02.817
take care of the laws
we faithfully executed.

00:12:02.817 --> 00:12:04.737
- [Sal] And why is that
so important that he takes

00:12:04.737 --> 00:12:06.682
care of the laws?

00:12:06.682 --> 00:12:09.946
I mean, isn't that what the
executive should be doing?

00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:12.715
- [Jeffrey] Absolutely, but
there's a serious question,

00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:14.721
what happens if the
President believe a law

00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:17.696
is unconstitutional, then
is it the kind of law

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.220
that he has to execute?

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.966
And President Thomas Jefferson
said no, he refused to

00:12:21.966 --> 00:12:24.912
enforce the Sedition Acts
which basically allowed

00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:27.367
the government to punish
people who criticized

00:12:27.367 --> 00:12:29.472
the President on the
grounds that Jefferson

00:12:29.472 --> 00:12:31.818
believed that it was unconstitutional.

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:34.618
More recently, we've had a big
controversy over this clause

00:12:34.618 --> 00:12:37.245
when opponents of President
Obama's executive orders

00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:39.369
about immigration have said
that they're a violation

00:12:39.369 --> 00:12:41.820
of his power to take
care that the laws are

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.794
faithfully executed because,
according to opponents,

00:12:44.794 --> 00:12:47.957
Congress reached a different
immigration policy.

00:12:47.957 --> 00:12:50.290
The Supreme Court ultimately

00:12:51.424 --> 00:12:53.981
refused to cleanly decide
that because of the four four

00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:57.344
split and it didn't clearly
rule on the question

00:12:57.344 --> 00:13:00.515
of the take care clause
and the immigration policy.

00:13:00.515 --> 00:13:01.858
- [Sal] Fascinating.

00:13:01.858 --> 00:13:03.784
And just to finish up
here and we'll go deeper

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:07.222
in future videos as we
go into Section Four,

00:13:07.222 --> 00:13:09.189
this really just talks
about how the President

00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:11.190
or the Vice President
and all civil officers

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.687
of the United States, how they
might be removed from office.

00:13:13.687 --> 00:13:16.681
- [Jeffrey] That's right
and we know from not so

00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:18.901
distant history that the
only way the President

00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:21.450
can be removed from
office is by impeachment.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.263
A President is impeached
by the House and has to be

00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:25.837
convicted by Senate.

00:13:25.837 --> 00:13:27.771
Two Presidents have been
impeached in American history,

00:13:27.771 --> 00:13:29.484
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.

00:13:29.484 --> 00:13:32.224
Neither has been convicted
so we've never actually

00:13:32.224 --> 00:13:34.262
had a President who's
been removed from office

00:13:34.262 --> 00:13:35.327
under the impeachment clause.

00:13:35.327 --> 00:13:36.974
- [Sal] And a lot of
times in popular language,

00:13:36.974 --> 00:13:40.556
impeachment, to be clear,
impeachment is the accusation

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:44.192
and then you have to be held
at, no you actually did,

00:13:44.192 --> 00:13:46.896
those crimes happened and
that's what you're saying,

00:13:46.896 --> 00:13:48.373
the Senate is responsible for it.

00:13:48.373 --> 00:13:50.018
- [Jeffrey] That's right,
you can be impeached but

00:13:50.018 --> 00:13:51.948
acquitted and that's what
happened to both Bill Clinton

00:13:51.948 --> 00:13:54.309
and Andrew Johnson so it's
like being indicted but

00:13:54.309 --> 00:13:56.420
then you go to trial and
you're later acquitted,

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.753
you get to keep your office.

00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:01.405
- [Sal] Well thanks so much, Jeffrey,

00:14:01.405 --> 00:14:03.013
this is a super valuable overview.

00:14:03.013 --> 00:14:06.680
- [Jeffrey] Thanks,
it's been great to talk.
