00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.988
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:06.990
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.815
Well to my left, let's start
with our wonderful Ellen Hill

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.170
Zeringue from the Tigers.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.382
Ellen?

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:16.650
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
Hi everybody.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.650
And thank you for pronouncing
my name correctly.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.700
Nobody ever does that.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.860
It's like Zenger, Zengeroo.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.280
It's every-- anyway.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.530
So Ellen Hill Zeringue.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.500
I'm Vice President of Marketing
for the Detroit Tigers.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.290
I am entering into
my 20th season.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.810
I started when I was very young.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.540
And in my capacity as Vice
President of Marketing,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.840
I oversee marketing, branding,
special events, promotions,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.310
digital--

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.775
kind of everything that's fun.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:48.650
I work very closely with
my colleague, Molly,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.610
and also with my colleague
Marcia from Fox Sports Detroit.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.300
I am a graduate of
Spelman College.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.920
I have a degree in English.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.100
And before I joined
the Detroit Tigers,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.000
I worked in radio for Mix 92.3.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.050
I was the Director
of Marketing there.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.810
And before that, I
worked for a small agency

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.760
which is owned by an
African-American woman.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.440
It was a special
events, promotions.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.230
We did anything we
could do in the market

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.740
in the city of Detroit
to keep the doors open.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.490
The name of the company was
Jackie-- was Vaughn Marketing

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310
and was owned by Jackie Vaughn.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.350
And I'm at the
Detroit Tigers today

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.470
because Jackie
Vaughn, after I left,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.720
landed a contract at
the Detroit Tigers.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.250
And this is all
about connections.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.530
She landed a contract
at the Detroit Tigers

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.155
and called me when I was working
at the radio station and said,

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:34.988
I think that you should
become the Marketing

00:01:34.988 --> 00:01:36.440
Manager for the Detroit Tigers.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.263
So that's sort of my
story in a nutshell.

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:39.680
But again, it's
about connections.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.630
My first boss out of
college got me the job

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.006
that I'm still in today.

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.657
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:48.740
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: Hello.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.190
Good afternoon.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.560
My name is Molly Wurdack.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.540
And I'm the Director
of Marketing Strategy

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.980
with Olympia Entertainment.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.010
So my primary responsibilities
here, actually

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.350
within Little Caesar's Arena
where we're sitting today,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.340
are the oversight of all of
our partnership activation

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.660
that runs across all
of the properties

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.630
that we own, operate, and are
the facility managers for.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.120
So that's here at Little
Caesar's Arena and the Detroit

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.610
Red Wings, over at Comerica
Park with the Detroit

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.340
Tigers, the Fox Theater.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.520
All of those great venues
that we have the opportunity

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.440
to be able to partner with
on a day to day basis.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.680
So those are my primary
responsibilities,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.480
making sure that all
of our partnerships

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.480
are executed on a daily basis.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.700
I started out my
career and the NFL.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.010
I've been here with
Olympia Entertainment

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.530
for just over 11 years.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.630
So made a really
big switch from--

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.420
I was talking to some women
earlier this afternoon

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.030
coming from Joe Lewis Arena to
here at Little Caesar's Arena.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.760
It's been a big difference.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.070
But all great staples
within the city of Detroit.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.780
And so as I was mentioning
prior to my time here,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.990
I was working in the NFL
with the Miami Dolphins.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.830
So have been in sports
pretty much all of my career.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.660
So it's been a fantastic ride.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.940
I'm a graduate of
Ohio University.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.260
Did my undergrad and my
two master's degrees there.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.480
And my family and I
live in the suburbs.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.870
And we have come to
know Detroit as home.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.750
So being here 11 years,
although I'm not--

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.080
wasn't born and raised here,
this is where we call home now.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.083
And we're so proud to
be a part of this city.

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:30.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.970
MARCIA TURNER: Hi.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.170
I'm Marcia Turner.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.480
And I'm Vice President
and General Sales Manager

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.700
for Fox Sports Detroit.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.120
I have the privilege of working
with these ladies as well

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.560
as the Detroit Pistons.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.950
We have the exclusive rights,
agreements for the Detroit

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.920
Tigers, Detroit Red Wings,
and the Detroit Pistons.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.670
And so that allows me to work
with all of those brands.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.250
My responsibility
at Fox Sports is

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.080
to sell advertising in all
of those different products,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.740
not only on our
linear program or TV,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.500
but also on our digital
platforms as well

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.150
and streaming.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.950
We consider ourselves the
Cadillac, if you will,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.630
of having these wonderful,
wonderful relationships

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.100
with our teams.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.670
We are not anything if it's
not for Red Wings, Pistons,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.200
and Tigers.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.960
So we cherish the relationships
we have with them.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.470
I personally call
these two friends.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.300
If there's something
going on in my career,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.030
these are two people
that I reach out

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.140
to talk to and vise versa.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.830
So we've established very
long steadfast relationships.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.870
I've been with Fox for 10 years.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.200
I was with the Detroit
Free Press for 25 years,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.880
basically doing the same thing.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.720
Running the ad sales
department on the print side.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.040
I too am a Detroiter.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.650
I was born in New Jersey, but
moved here when I was seven.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.770
So I consider myself
to be a raised--

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.380
born and raised person
from the city of Detroit.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.050
We live in Detroit.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.320
I have two daughters.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.250
I graduated-- well I
graduated from Wayne State.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.410
But went to Spelman
all four years.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.160
So but came home and ended
up graduating the year

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.940
my dad died.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.680
So but that's me.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.740
That's it.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.470
SPEAKER 1: I would like to say--

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.690
Molly, I actually
just recently met.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.540
But to hear you all,
you know, again,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.990
when you sit with people who are
great people and your friends

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.070
and you know them.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.190
But then when you hear them
talk, you're like, really?

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.743
So I just had--

00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:39.660
I just had a few really
moments, like, really?

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.470
Didn't know that.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.790
Which is always a highlight.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.050
So let's see.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.580
Where do we begin?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.930
It's Women's History Month.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.120
So we will get down
to the nitty gritty.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.500
Tell us what it is really
like being a woman in sports,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.980
but a woman in sports
at an executive level.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.570
Because oftentimes, we are
the only woman in the room

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.400
at the level that
you all sit at.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.430
So as you all have had
these wonderful careers,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.300
you know, position primarily
touching sports in some arena,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.330
talk to us about how it has,
you know, where you started.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.610
What you saw, but
where it is now

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.230
in terms of the
progression of how

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:23.810
women are participating at an
executive level with sports.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.560
MARCIA TURNER: I'll
start with that.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.970
I happen to work for
a General Manager who

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.080
has four women
running the top five

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.490
departments in the network.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.100
So for Fox Sports
Detroit, there's

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.350
a woman in finance, a
woman running marketing,

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.080
a woman running
advertising, and a woman who

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.240
handles our traffic department.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.170
So I'm in a really
unique situation,

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.330
if there is such a thing.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.290
And I guess there's
not really unique.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.410
But I'm in a unique
situation in the sense

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.850
that you don't hear of that
in most of the regional sports

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.170
networks.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.810
But from the standpoint of
coming in at this level,

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.140
you know, you get a lot of men
who think, why in the world

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.980
would she be the person
that's responsible for all

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.790
of the sales?

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.480
And you all that are in this
room, you know, sales run--

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.760
it's pretty much the business
side of the organization.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.310
But how can she--

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.580
she didn't play
professional sports.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.860
Or she wasn't in
college in sports.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.530
Or she didn't come
from one of the teams.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.420
She came from newspapers.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.180
The goal in obtaining me
for Fox Sports Detroit

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.180
was to grow our retail business.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.110
And we have done that.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.300
It's about dollar signs, right?

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.420
Can this person bring
in advertising revenue

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.470
and represent our product
in a way that elevates us?

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.190
And we doubled the revenue.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.420
So I think we did just fine.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.640
SPEAKER 1: Marcia's
actually being very modest.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.130
Because she's also a GM--

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.510
General Manager.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.470
And how many--

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.450
MARCIA TURNER:
General Sales Manager.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.330
SPEAKER 1: General
Sales Managers.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.580
How many in the United States?

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.340
It's only--

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.860
MARCIA TURNER: There's 12 of us.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.350
And I'm the only female.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.400
SPEAKER 1: She is the
only female General Sales

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.750
Manager in the United States.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.360
And that is a big deal.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.040
And of course, if
she's the only woman,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.560
that means she's the only
African-American woman who

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.940
also holds that position.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.090
So you know, again, in
a world right now that

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.350
is illuminated with so much
stress and diversity, you know,

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.110
good and bad, these type
of things, I believe,

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.659
are very important to
make sure that we note.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.360
So oftentimes, when
I'm bragging about her,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.429
that's exactly what I say.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:43.148
Molly, go ahead.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:44.190
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: Sure.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.190
So when I started
out in the business,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.210
unfortunately, I really
didn't have any female mentors

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.210
that I could look up to.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.730
I was doing an interview
a couple of weeks

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.660
ago for a woman who writes a
blog specifically about women

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.050
in holding executive positions
in sports and entertainment.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.570
Her question to me was,
well, so who's your mentor?

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.810
And while I've had
a number of mentors

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.850
throughout my career,
when I started,

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.740
there just weren't
a lot of women

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.620
who played in this space,
understood that there were

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.700
opportunities in this space.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.620
And so, really for me,
it's really important

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.650
to make sure I'm continuing
to tell the story

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.880
and forge the path for younger
generations within the sports

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.215
and entertainment industry.

00:09:28.215 --> 00:09:29.340
Because I didn't have that.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.620
And while I had tremendous
mentors along the way,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.757
and still do today, I never
had that female mentorship.

00:09:36.757 --> 00:09:38.590
And so I think that
that's really important.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.280
And as we rise to the
level at which we're

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.380
at from an executive
perspective,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.190
that we remember
where we came from.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.450
And we continue to give
back to the individuals who

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.980
are coming behind us.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.280
Because we are going to forge
a path just as those before us

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.963
have done.

00:09:53.963 --> 00:09:55.380
And we need to
make sure that it's

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.200
the right path for the women
that follow in our footsteps.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.090
So I guess a little
bit different

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.180
take on your question.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:01.920
But--

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.320
SPEAKER 1: This is a talk.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:02.880
Anything--

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.040
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT:
But for me, that's--

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.980
you know, there just wasn't
a lot of opportunities

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.270
when I started out.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.790
And a lot of people to look up
to from a female perspective.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.710
So that's sort of how I look
and approach business on a day

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.940
to day basis.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.670
Everything that I do is about
giving back to the people

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.730
that I work with, that I
play in this community with,

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.830
and making sure that I'm
setting the right example,

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.380
no matter whether you're a
younger generation student,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.605
whether you're a female,
whether you're a male.

00:10:32.605 --> 00:10:34.980
I want to make sure that my
story is told not because I'm

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.080
necessarily a
female, but because I

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.880
do the right thing every day.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.420
And I walk the walk,
I talk the talk.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.700
And that's really what's
most important to me.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.390
And I think great opportunities
for people coming behind us

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.062
to look towards.

00:10:50.062 --> 00:10:51.520
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
What she said.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.020
I agree.

00:10:54.595 --> 00:10:56.720
When I first-- this is
going to sound kind of odd--

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.977
but when I first started
working in baseball,

00:10:58.977 --> 00:11:00.560
I don't think I
really realized that I

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.380
was one of the only women.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.210
Because the conversation
wasn't out there.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.850
We weren't even thinking
about what are the spaces

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.570
and places where women are not?

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.690
And so that's become much
more prevalent recently.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.190
I think for me,
when I first started

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.250
working in baseball what
was more significant

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.590
was that I was African-American.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.690
But now, many, many
years later, it

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.880
is becoming
increasingly important--

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.510
and I'm reminded all the time
that I am one of the few women.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.503
And I'm proud of that.

00:11:27.503 --> 00:11:29.420
And I think that's one
of the responsibilities

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.630
that we have as women when we
are forging into new spaces

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.760
is that we have to realize
that we have something

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.650
to bring to the table, right?

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.060
And that we are
unique and different.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.820
And that's OK and that's great.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.767
And so think about
what it is about you

00:11:42.767 --> 00:11:45.350
as a woman that you're bringing
to the table that is different

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.325
and that can change
the conversation.

00:11:47.325 --> 00:11:49.700
So I frequently tell-- when
we're talking about marketing

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.200
in my office-- this
is a huge joke--

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.742
I frequently tell my team when
we're talking about something,

00:11:53.742 --> 00:11:56.060
I say, OK, but what does
this single mom in Ferndale

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.640
with two kids think about that?

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.670
Can she afford to
come to the game?

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.620
Will her kids like doing that?

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.530
Because I believe very
strongly that as a woman,

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.465
I'm at the table for a reason
to keep the conversation going.

00:12:09.465 --> 00:12:11.840
Same thing I feel about being
an African-American, right?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.520
So I have a
responsibility of who

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.560
I am to keep the
conversation going

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.980
about things that haven't always
been discussed at the table.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.470
I'm also like Molly,
super, super, super excited

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.200
about the incredible
number of women

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.270
that I know that we have
at Fox Sports Detroit.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.450
But particularly at the
Red Wings and the Tigers.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.430
We have so many young women.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.340
And it is exciting to
see these young women.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.580
And several of them are
back there in the room.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.060
So many young women that
weren't there when I was there.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.890
And I just believe
the future is so

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.190
exciting for what I know they're
going to bring to the table.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.828
They're much more educated
than I was in terms of sports.

00:12:48.828 --> 00:12:51.370
They all have these great sports
degrees and stuff like that.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.960
I just came to the table cause
I could do marketing, right?

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.260
And it didn't exist.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.390
So I'm thrilled about that.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.930
And I also, like Molly,
and committed that I'm here

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.880
because I did have
two great mentors--

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.590
women mentors-- they
weren't in sports.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.810
But they were amazing
women who mentored me

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.100
from a business perspective.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.860
But I do everything
I can to make sure

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.960
that I'm reaching back
and helping to educate

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.768
and helping to have
those conversations.

00:13:13.768 --> 00:13:15.560
If it's the, yes, you
need to take the yoga

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.690
pants off conversation, I'm
the one to do that, right?

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.940
Because I think the world is--

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.040
I think we're in a crisis.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.250
We're in a yoga pants crisis.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.070
So I'm the one
that will do that.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.060
I'll also talk to you about--

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:27.560
right.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.610
MARCIA TURNER: And flip-flops.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.402
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
And flip-flops, right?

00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:31.790
So it's important.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.830
So I will have
those conversations

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.772
because somebody
did that for me.

00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:38.230
And that's the only way we're
all going to survive as women

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.843
and continue to make great
contributions in sports.

00:13:40.843 --> 00:13:42.260
MARCIA TURNER: I
just want to add,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.710
since I didn't get to talk
about mentoring women.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.520
It is so important.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.670
And many of you in
the room who know me

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.300
know that I have mentees
and I pride myself

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.480
on making sure that we are
giving back in the same way

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.730
that Ellen and Molly
both spoke about.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.910
It is imperative that women
when you get to this level,

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.000
that you find someone
that you can--

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.970
whose career you can touch,
that you can talk to.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.760
That can call you at any time
and say, this is a dream.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.290
This is something I want to do.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.150
And you stop what
you're doing to make

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.880
that happen for that person.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.610
I'm really, really big on that.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.120
So I just wanted to add that.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.950
See, you can't get
to the next question.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.450
SPEAKER 1: No, this
is what we want.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.570
This is a talk at Google.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.070
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
And I just want

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.310
to add what Marcia said
about so there's mentoring.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.110
But there's also
the friendships.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:34.070
And Marcia said it earlier, that
she can call on me or Molly.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.750
And you need that, right?

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.390
You need on your
executive level, whatever

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.160
level you're on, you
also need other women

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.510
that you can shut the door and
talk things through and say,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.160
am I doing this right?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.070
What do you think about this?

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:44.690
And share.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.610
And so I'm thrilled that
I have these ladies.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.290
There's also some other women--

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.960
Marcia's Director of Marketing
at Fox Sports Detroit, Lauren

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.740
Pober.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.990
There's Rebecca Falk, who
is the Director of Marketing

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.250
over at Intercom Radio.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.915
Those are like my soul sisters.

00:14:56.915 --> 00:14:58.790
I talk to them like, a
gazillion times a day.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.300
And it's really,
really important.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.800
And I think that I
wouldn't be where

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.410
I am if it weren't
for the network

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.000
that I have in these women.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.230
SPEAKER 1: That is wonderful.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.813
Like I'm sitting
here getting excited.

00:15:09.813 --> 00:15:13.060
So you guys said a few things
that definitely struck me

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.230
as we are sitting here.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:15.200
So two things.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.700
Let me see.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.540
Which one do I
want to start with?

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.010
You all, actually,
besides it being

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.380
in the title, game changers.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.680
Marcia, you specifically
mentioned that the technology

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.300
and the information that you all
began with even 10 years ago,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.730
it did not exist.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.820
You all have evolved
and watched social media

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.040
and all these other platforms--

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.150
Google.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.370
We're not that old--

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.980
impact your business.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.470
Tell us what that looks
like from where you sit.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:50.700
We see it from, oh, I can
watch sports anywhere now.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.800
But talk to us
about the evolution,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.040
the technology, you know,
of what sports is now.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.770
Because not only were
you game changers,

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.130
but you are actually at the
position now of dictating

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.650
and saying the type
of technology that

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.730
needs to evolve to support
what people are looking for,

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.910
what they're requiring.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.808
So what does that
look like for you all?

00:16:12.808 --> 00:16:14.350
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
Go ahead Marcia.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.950
I saw you.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.748
I was like, yes.

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:19.260
MARCIA TURNER: It is true.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.860
You can watch TV
anywhere, right?

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.260
We watch it on our phones,
we watch it on our tablets,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.840
we watch it on our
70 inch screens.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.110
And the beauty of
a technology now,

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:36.280
you don't have to sit somewhere
stationary to see a game.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.850
And one of the strengths
that Fox Sports

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.240
has is the fact that we
are on everything, right?

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.060
We're on Roku, we're
on your cable box,

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.310
we're on your Sling TV.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.360
We're everywhere.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.120
You can access sports.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.100
Now you may have to
authenticate, right?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.140
Through a cable
subscriber or something.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.330
But you're always going to be
able to watch their games--

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.080
the Red Wings or the
Tigers or the Pistons--

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.610
on Fox Sports Detroit.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.250
So technology, from
our perspective,

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:10.200
has just allowed us to open
the world to our games.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.900
Let everyone be able to see
the games wherever they are.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.260
Is that kind of what you're--

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.030
SPEAKER 1: What's
the challenges, too?

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:18.990
The same thing.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.819
Because it's
happening, you know.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:24.119
But as you sit
here, what are some

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.702
of the new technologies
or just things

00:17:25.702 --> 00:17:27.077
that you all are
seeing evolving?

00:17:27.077 --> 00:17:28.420
MARCIA TURNER: People that--

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.820
so I'm in sales, right?

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.810
And what is traditional
sales is to sell TV, right?

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.640
I want to see those
commercials on television.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.330
And it can be a
struggle for some

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.030
because they feel that we're
competing with ourselves when

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.980
we sell streaming.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.160
It's-- OK, that's a lesser rate.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:53.910
It's maybe not as conducive as
TV would be to a major agency.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.160
You're certainly not
going to get the dollars

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.360
from that standpoint.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.070
But the reality is, people
want to see it where they are.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.530
They want to watch
TV where they are.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.070
And we have to be able
to grow with the fact

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.250
that you're going to get
less money for that schedule.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.960
But it's beneficial to our
company and our overall way

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.510
in which we're doing
business to recognize

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.170
that we need to sell digitally
and we need to sell streaming

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.900
and we need to build
those packages,

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.570
just as what we started
with regular TV.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.070
So.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.920
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: So from
the sponsorship perspective,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.240
it's certainly changed in
the last even five years,

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.500
but even 10 years.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.310
And where we were 10 years
ago was really the basic--

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:47.420
the sale of what we would call
in the industry spots and dots,

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.080
right?

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.610
And that's what it was about.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.370
And that's certainly
still a component

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:56.240
of selling partnerships and
activating partnerships now.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.750
But what's becoming
more and more prevalent

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.990
is the desire for
brands to be integrated

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.660
into the brand in which
they're partnering with

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.920
to have a connection.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:12.020
And that is driven so much
through social, digital, web,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.680
all of those kinds of things.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.010
And so we need to
continuously be

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.320
creative in thinking
about new assets

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.560
that we can help bring to
these partnerships that

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.020
live above and beyond a sign
on a wall or a nice logo.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.860
While all those things are
great and very important.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.720
They provide extreme value
and exposure to partners.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.720
It's about that
extended and next level

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.900
connection to the
customer that these brands

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.040
want to partner with.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.100
So our ability to have
engagement with athletes

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.940
and how does that come to life
through social opportunities?

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.490
Are opportunities
to be able to--

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.220
if you have been downstairs
in the concourse at Little

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.530
Caesar's Arena-- to look
at augmented reality,

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.990
virtual reality.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.770
How these kinds of things come
to life within your building,

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.780
within your brand,
are really important.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.310
And I think augmented reality,
virtual reality, specifically,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.810
are two really big areas.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.630
While not totally
new technology,

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.580
they're definitely
pieces of technology

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.180
that can be taken
to the next level,

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.800
especially from a team
and a building perspective

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.460
that we're going to continue to
look to see how we can leverage

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.350
moving forward.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.160
I'd say the challenge is
while similar to Marcia,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.710
is certainly the adoption
of the new products.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.950
It also requires a pretty
significant investment

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.360
up front sometimes.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.600
And so to be able
to create the story

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.690
and be able to communicate
what the RLY is

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.300
to your leadership about
how this is going to deliver

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.330
on the back end, not
only financially, which

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.110
is most of the time the number
one and most important thing.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.660
But also how it's
going to create that

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.957
extended connection
to the customer.

00:20:55.957 --> 00:20:58.040
We talked-- Ellen and I
were actually at a meeting

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.582
this morning.

00:20:58.582 --> 00:21:01.100
And we were talking
about experiences.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.470
And it's not just about
coming to a game anymore.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.230
It's about the
experience that you

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:10.280
have with your spouse, with
your son or your daughter,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.050
with your neighbor.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.840
And so all of those
pieces of technology

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.007
can help bring that experience
to life more and enhance it.

00:21:19.007 --> 00:21:20.590
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
And I would also,

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.580
to sort of add on to what Molly
is saying, it's also about--

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:30.550
so I don't know how many people
have used the District app.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.330
Not the ones who work
for the district.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.830
OK.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.490
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.630
That's a shout out, Ellen.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.317
Tell everyone where
we should download

00:21:36.317 --> 00:21:37.775
and what we should
be experiencing.

00:21:37.775 --> 00:21:38.750
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
The District App.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.760
Particularly because
you're in this building.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.810
So the District App is
amazing because it really

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.690
helps to change the way that
you navigate and experience

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:47.800
the arena.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.580
It's like your personal little
guide is right there with you

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.350
and it gives you
parking information,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.820
it talks about merchandise.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.920
And also if you download
the app, you can get--

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.323
correct me if I'm wrong, Amanda,
and Molly-- you can get--

00:22:00.323 --> 00:22:01.990
there might be different
discount offers

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.670
that you might get at
times, programmed into it.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.830
My point is this.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.470
That the way-- the
customer expectation

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.020
in terms of how they
navigate arenas and ballparks

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.070
has changed dramatically.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.020
And so that's what
Molly's talking about.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.570
She's talked about it from
a sponsorship standpoint.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.180
But I mean from just from a
customer service experience.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.080
There's lots of things that we
used to do or lots of things

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.390
that we-- just the
way we interact

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.250
with, the places that we
go has completely changed.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.390
The other thing I want to say
is that, it's all about content.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.807
That's the biggest thing that
has changed from a marketing

00:22:33.807 --> 00:22:34.520
standpoint.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.750
The social media group falls
under my responsibility

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.470
at the ballpark.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.820
And we just hired
a content producer.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.530
And all he's-- down
in spring training.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.540
And all he's doing is
creating these videos.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.950
Videos, videos, videos.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.200
Because we have to grow
our social platform.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.050
And that is totally
different than what

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.342
it was like when I first--
when I first started working

00:22:55.342 --> 00:22:57.670
at the Tigers, we used to
take the newspaper clips

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.500
and copy them on the copy
machine and pass them around.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.080
And that's how we knew what
was going on in the world.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.543
OK hello.

00:23:04.543 --> 00:23:05.710
I've been there a long time.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.630
But think about it now.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.530
We, as a brand, have to
come up with content.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.420
And the other thing is
that a couple of years

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.270
ago, you know, the ninth inning,
turn the lights off, go home.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.780
That's it.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.840
We'd report back at
9:00 AM in the morning.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.750
No.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.220
It is 24 hours,
seven days a week.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.420
And we have to be
able to drive content,

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.450
add content, and then also
monitor player content.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.520
Monitor what customers
and consumers

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.930
are saying about our
brand and how we interact.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.260
So I would just say
that we have become just

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.990
a 24 hour, seven
day a week business

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.240
because of the
impact of digital.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.120
MARCIA TURNER: I just want to
add something about content.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.510
As Ellen was talking about
our social media platforms,

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:50.260
those have grown
just exponentially.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.730
And we have a social
media manager who is 24/7.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:24:00.160
Courtney is posting and engaging
with fans about the three

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.140
brands that we represent.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.660
But it's a constant process.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:09.550
And in addition, we have all
had to become much more familiar

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.560
with social media platforms.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.230
I mean, I used to use
Instagram to just monitor

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.700
my daughter's Instagram.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.720
Now I'm like a real player
on Instagram, you know?

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.740
I'm following people.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.090
I'm watching things
that are going on.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.720
But it also is
important to watch

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.050
what's going on in our industry
through Instagram and Twitter.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.900
And I've got followers.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.770
And it's just mind boggling
that I'm in this space

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:41.260
today when I too copied
everything off the newspaper,

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.510
cut it out, sent it
to all my clients,

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.120
would run over to the Detroit
Tigers and tell Ellen,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.302
did you read this?

00:24:47.302 --> 00:24:48.010
You're marketing.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.350
You really should be buying
this in the newspaper.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.840
And that's how our world was.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.310
But it's no longer that today.

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.900
And so Fox Sports continues
to evolve, if you will,

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.053
with our social platforms as
well as our digital platforms.

00:25:04.053 --> 00:25:06.220
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE: Can I
just add one quick thing?

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.840
And the other thing
is the one thing

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.890
that we're still competing with
is the live game experience.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.810
So there's all
these wonderful ways

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.820
for people to watch the game.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.870
The game can go with you.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.730
You can do all-- you
can pause the game.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.453
But I still want you to
come to the ballpark.

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:22.870
I need you to come
to the ballpark

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.970
and I need you to
enjoy the green grass

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.610
and have a conversation with
your friend and have a beer,

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:32.000
have a hot dog, have a
Miller Coors product.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.310
I need you-- have a Pepsi.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.840
Have a Pepsi.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.700
Little Caesar's Pizza.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.380
But that's important, right?

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.090
That is really our
biggest competitor

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:47.320
from a marketing
standpoint is that people

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.560
can take it with you.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.300
And that's great.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.220
But I also need you--
and I think Fox Sports

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.060
Detroit is great about this.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.750
They understand that
there's an intricate balance

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.260
between promoting the digital
interaction with the product

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.760
and also with driving people.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.000
Because they don't want an
empty ballpark more than I do.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.930
MARCIA TURNER: It doesn't
show up well on TV.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.110
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE: It
doesn't show up well on TV.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.240
It's not fun, right?

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.630
So together, we are
figuring out how

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.910
to create this
method or this model

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.130
so that we're driving
people into the ballpark

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.670
to experience it live.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.200
But also asking them to enjoy
it on their mobile devices

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.690
that we can integrate different
messages that we need to so

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.500
that Marcia can deliver, and my
group-- our sponsorship group,

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:32.410
Molly-- can get what they
need from a sales standpoint.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.720
SPEAKER 1: How do you
all juggle it all?

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.410
And I'm asking specifically
as I'm hearing this,

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.560
working in a marketing
world, knowing, you know,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.850
the challenges.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.910
Being a mother, having
friends, families,

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.470
all of these things
which is innate to women.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.480
We somehow figure out
how to juggle it all.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.080
But at the same time, as you
are existing in this world

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.000
to do all things as a woman,
how are you all doing that?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.977
Because to go from using the
copier and running over--

00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:10.810
I think that is so--

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.288
I cannot wait to turn
this into a snippet.

00:27:13.288 --> 00:27:14.580
Oh these are going to be short.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.050
So I was like, oh this is
social media gold right now.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.467
That's what I'm
actually thinking.

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:19.960
MARCIA TURNER: I was not lying.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.670
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
Marcia was--

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.840
I was Marcia's client.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.230
And that's how we met.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.990
I was Marcia's client at the
Detroit News and Free Press.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.860
And she is not kidding.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.360
She would drive the newspaper
over to me and go, here Ellen.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.090
Did you see this?

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.423
You should-- this is how we're
going to lay your ad out.

00:27:31.423 --> 00:27:34.423
That was so embarrassing.

00:27:34.423 --> 00:27:36.090
MARCIA TURNER: Forget
that Google stuff.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:41.180
It was like, get in your
car and Google over there.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.205
SPEAKER 1: Well now seriously,
words of wisdom, you know?

00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:47.110
We hear it, and
you make it happen.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.570
And it seems seamless.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.300
And I think, especially sitting
on the side of supporting

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.700
entrepreneurs--
many in this room--

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.480
you know, you struggle
with feeling adequate,

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.600
which oftentimes, being a woman
and all these other things

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.160
of lives changing and
how do we stay relevant?

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.480
And all these things that
are socially, I feel like,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.620
put on us anyway.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.000
You know, you're looking at.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.520
But really, what are
your words of wisdom

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.380
at being a such a high level?

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.610
Being the only in your position
oftentimes, if not in the room

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:22.200
at a very minimum, how do
you actually, you know--

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.480
how do you just keep
some type of balance?

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.520
What would you recommend
or what would you say?

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.260
And it may not be real balance.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.683
But you know, day by day,
how do you handle it?

00:28:32.683 --> 00:28:34.350
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
I have to go first?

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.592
I can't, like, feed
off of their ideas?

00:28:37.592 --> 00:28:39.550
So this is going to sound
really, really crazy.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.880
But one of the things that I
am committed to doing is making

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.422
sure-- this is going
to sound crazy--

00:28:43.422 --> 00:28:46.450
that I feel good
about the way I look.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.030
So I tell the young
women in my office

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.620
who do special
events and promotions

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.570
and they're working long
hours and stuff that.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.350
I'm like, nope.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.232
Stop.

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:56.440
While you're planning an
event, I'm like, nope, stop.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.982
The event going to
start in a minute.

00:28:57.982 --> 00:29:01.000
Go put your makeup on, comb
your hair, look organized.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.458
Because if you
don't look organized

00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:04.167
and you don't feel
organized, then no one

00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:06.070
else is going to have
confidence in you.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:09.250
So you know, I try to have
everything in my office

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.700
from like, makeup, toothbrush,
extra shoes, everything

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.520
so that I can always
come presentable.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.420
Because that actually
makes a difference.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.920
And you actually will
feel good about yourself.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.380
So it's about being prepared
and having all those resources.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.300
And then a friend
that you can go,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.633
do I have something in my teeth?

00:29:23.633 --> 00:29:25.090
And she'll tell you the truth.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.260
So that's part of it.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.920
And then also, I think
you have to have a hobby.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.420
Right?

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.880
Because we work really,
really, really long hours.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.910
I'm not sure how Marcia does
it because she has to champion

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.840
Red Wings, Tigers, and Pistons.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.840
So at least I get a little
bit of an off season.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.910
But you have to have a hobby.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.710
I have become an avid reader.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.560
I read all of the
time because it's

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:53.500
the only time when I'm at home
that I can just sort of escape.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.450
And you have to give
yourself the escape.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.490
Because you have to
have that balance.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.290
And for a long time I didn't
give myself that balance.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:06.170
And I worked-- we were
81 home games, right?

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.370
So that's a lot.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.772
And then sometimes
they start at 7 o'clock

00:30:09.772 --> 00:30:12.230
and during the evenings, and
sometimes they'll end at 9:00,

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.220
sometimes they'll end at 10:00.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.678
Sometimes they'll
have a rain delay

00:30:14.678 --> 00:30:16.230
and they'll end much
later than that.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:23.660
So you have to force yourself to
have a hobby and give balance.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.850
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: I think
Katrina's word, juggle,

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.970
is probably-- at least
in my experience--

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.140
better than balance.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.140
I don't truly know
if there is a balance

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.530
to be had in sports
and entertainment.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.600
I mean, there's not a
job description out there

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.750
that doesn't say nights,
weekends, holidays.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.730
Should they be
prepared to dig in.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.640
Because it's a lot.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.370
But certainly in addition
to what Ellen said,

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.850
I would say it's
really important

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.750
to have a support system.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.360
Whatever that means for you.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.520
For me, it's my husband.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.470
We work both crazy hours.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.720
But he supports me and
supports my career.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.530
And so we make
sacrifices every day

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.860
to make sure that each one
of us has the opportunity

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.410
to grow and succeed
in what we want to do.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.627
But that may be different
for the person sitting

00:31:14.627 --> 00:31:15.710
across the table from you.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.540
It may be your parents.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.250
It may be your daughter.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.630
It may be the people
that you work with.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.650
I can tell you that I would
not make it through the day

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.710
if it were not for the
people that work here.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.840
For the women that sit in
the back of this room who

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.810
I work with every day,
they keep me going.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.700
And that support
system is so important.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.670
If you don't have
that support system

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:42.093
inside of work and outside of
work, it's going to be tough.

00:31:42.093 --> 00:31:43.010
It's going to be hard.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:44.480
What keeps you
going if you don't

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.120
have those people around
you every single day

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.270
that you want to
go to battle for?

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.830
It makes the nights,
the weekends,

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.110
all the long hours worth it
when you have the support

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.960
system that's there to help
keeping you going when,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.293
it's not all roses, right?

00:31:59.293 --> 00:32:00.210
There are tough times.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:05.330
And so you need those people to
be able to help keep you going.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.730
MARCIA TURNER: Everything
that they said.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.450
But the juggling part, I
didn't think about it that way.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.200
But Molly, you're
absolutely correct.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.100
It's hard to say
what balance is.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.910
And what balance is to one
person is probably not balance.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:22.730
In my life, I do a
lot of games, right?

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.400
I go to Reds Wings,
Pistons, and Tigers games,

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.170
as Ellen mentioned.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:30.350
And then I, you know, I've
got two daughters, you know?

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:31.970
They're 27 and 20.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.770
And both out of town now.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:36.260
So I'm really that empty nester.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.650
But I adopted a dog, so I'm
really not an empty nester.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.690
Cause she is super important.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:45.020
But, and so life balance
even includes the dog, right?

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.650
My mother comes to my house
every day from 11:00 to 3:00

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.600
just to kind of
see after the dog.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.720
She misses her grandkids.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.630
But she thinks the dog is good.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:54.890
She thinks the dog's cool.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:33:03.510
But I also want to add
that having good friends,

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.380
people in the business,
people out of the business.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.020
I'm in a lot of
ladies organizations.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.470
I get a lot of strength and
encouragement from that.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.940
I have a lot of professional
things that I do.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.920
There is a lot of strength and
balance that comes with that.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.250
And then I'm a golfer, you know?

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.110
And so I've picked up golf.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.100
Maybe 20, 25 years ago.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.450
And I, on Wednesday nights,
I play with my league

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.400
and I'm there every Wednesday.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.620
And I move things
around so that I

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.460
can make sure that I
do the one hobby that I

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.520
enjoy that I do that.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.330
And so I think you have to find
things that you enjoy and make

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.440
that a part of your life.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.660
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE: I was
just going to say, and also

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.620
create a schedule.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.135
So I get my hair done at 6:30
in the morning on Fridays.

00:33:54.135 --> 00:33:56.510
So that she just went at 6:30
in the morning on Thursday.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.840
But that's so that I don't
have to-- hair is important.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840
Hair is important to me.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.300
But I don't have to deal with
that in the middle of the week,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.633
in the middle of the day, right?

00:34:02.633 --> 00:34:04.958
Marcia goes to yoga at
5:00 AM in the morning.

00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:06.500
I'm supposed to,
but I never make it.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.978
But Marcia goes to yoga
at 5:00 AM in the morning

00:34:08.978 --> 00:34:11.270
two days a week so that she
can get that out of the way

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.610
so that she can then
start her day fresh.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.793
And the maintenance
things are out of the way.

00:34:15.793 --> 00:34:17.210
So it's kind of
important to think

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.310
about your schedule
and the things that

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.280
are important to you.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.989
And how can you create a day so
that you can get all the things

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:26.000
in it that you need
to do and still

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.730
feel really good about yourself
and think about expanding,

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.800
you know, 6:00 AM is
really not that early.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.130
It's not that early
to get my hair done.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.297
It's kind of early for yoga.

00:34:33.297 --> 00:34:34.849
But anyway.

00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:36.224
MARCIA TURNER:
Get to yoga Ellen.

00:34:36.224 --> 00:34:37.760
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE: She's going
to call me tomorrow morning.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.719
Get to yoga.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.877
MARCIA TURNER: Get to yoga.

00:34:39.877 --> 00:34:40.460
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.730
So I'm going to switch it up
a little bit before we open up

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:45.620
the floor for
answer and question.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.320
Because Ellen actually
has a hard stop.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.040
I just feel so
privileged right now

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.639
that you all were able to
come together-- and be clear.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.770
Part of them being
able to come together

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.870
was related to opening day.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.230
Everybody, I was like, so
how is opening day affecting

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.550
everybody's schedule.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:05.840
No, not that week.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.650
Not that day.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:07.450
Spring training.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.110
I was like, this is real.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.550
You know, when you--

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.980
in their lives, you
know, we look at sports

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.410
and it's so glamorous and
glorious as you see it.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:18.380
But when you get to the
business side of it--

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.720
and I can say from
personal experience--

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.240
sometimes, I'm like, you
have another game today?

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.710
As much as I like
sports, I'm like, you do?

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.290
You are where today?

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.150
But you know, definitely
a highlight and a benefit.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:35.420
So we'll do a little bit,
just quick round robin,

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.016
just to hear, you
know, a little--

00:35:37.016 --> 00:35:39.070
and whatever comes
first to your mind.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:44.850
So as I'm looking at
you Ellen, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:45.350
Who are you?

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:49.340
Like, one word, who Ellen is.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.225
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE: A friend.

00:35:51.225 --> 00:35:52.350
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: Strong.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.850
SPEAKER 1: You guys
[INAUDIBLE] mic.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:54.960
MARCIA TURNER: Compassion.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.530
I'm a compassionate person.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.960
SPEAKER 1: When you are
making those hard decisions

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.600
and having those tough
conversations, who

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.233
are you then?

00:36:04.233 --> 00:36:05.400
MARCIA TURNER: You know, I--

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:05.790
this--

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.998
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: One word!

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:10.040
MARCIA TURNER: It requires
more than one word.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.140
That requires more
than one word.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.810
And it's interesting that
you gave the mic to me

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.070
and I said compassion.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.040
When I am having a rough
time, or, you know,

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.660
you have employees that
are having a rough time,

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.260
or you have issues
that are going on,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.950
I'm still
compassionate, you know?

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.820
And one of the podcasts--

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.098
I listen to a lot of podcasts.

00:36:30.098 --> 00:36:31.640
If you guys don't
do that, you really

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.800
should listen to podcasts.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.860
They're really great.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:38.240
But I was listening to a
podcast with Jeff Weiner,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.580
who is CEO for LinkedIn.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.940
And he talks about
compassionate leadership.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.400
And as I'm listening to this
guy, I'm like, that's me.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.870
I have literally fired a person
and went and had wine with them

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.610
that same evening.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.090
It doesn't take-- you
don't have to be mean.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.790
If someone is not
doing their job,

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.530
then you need to-- it's on you.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.590
You need to either figure
out how to train that person

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.310
to do their job, or how to
find a role that perhaps they

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:11.030
would be better suited for, or
find a way to transition them

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.380
out of that role, right?

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.210
I mean, it's not--

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.250
it is personal, but it's
not personal, right?

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:19.950
It's about whether or not this
business is right for you.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.160
And I think you can do all
of that with compassion.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.660
SPEAKER 1: Before
you answer, Molly,

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.480
that is such a good point,
because Women's History Month,

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.300
women's panel.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.690
Men, traditionally, do
not have to explain that.

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.240
When we talk about
hard conversations,

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.670
we talk about, you
know, butting heads,

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:40.060
working for opposite
teams, all of those things.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.330
When it comes to
men, generally, it's

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.920
almost celebrated,
like, hey, you know,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.153
they had a hard conversation.

00:37:46.153 --> 00:37:47.320
I had to tell him how it is.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.550
But we went out to
dinner afterwards.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.250
However, when a woman
who is the executive,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:56.050
the president, or the CEO,
now it becomes a conversation.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.000
Because it was, oh she fired me.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.950
And now it becomes
something else,

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.570
like, almost how dare you?

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.790
And many of us,
even if you haven't

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:05.200
experienced it
personally, I know

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.460
you probably heard the story.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.720
So just to, you know, that
really resonated well with me.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.760
Because I think about my career.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.580
And I was fired one
time when I was younger.

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.850
And he told me,
Kay, you gotta go.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.630
And I just looked at
him, like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.300
But to this day, Mr.
Johnson-- hi Mr. Johnson!

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.520
Still love him to this day.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.042
It was the best thing because
I was going through my--

00:38:30.042 --> 00:38:32.500
I was actually just coming out
of high school and all that.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.630
But he fired me.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:35.590
And it was OK.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.330
And he made me stronger.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.390
And I ended up working together
with him again as I go--

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.980
I still go see him and all
of those type of things.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.490
But being a woman,
you know, that's

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.560
just one of the things
that just touched me,

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.410
that we typically
don't have to explain.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.340
But you're right.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.800
The description of
it, when he fired me,

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.370
and I experienced that,
he was naturally still--

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:58.250
it was almost like--

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.650
I knew it was with love.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.610
I knew I needed to step it up.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:04.150
He was frustrated and he
did what he had to do.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.180
And it was one of my best
life learned lessons.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.645
MARCIA TURNER:
Normally they are.

00:39:08.645 --> 00:39:10.270
Normally they are
when you have to make

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.320
that kind of a decision.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.020
But I won't--

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.278
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: Thorough.

00:39:14.278 --> 00:39:15.320
SPEAKER 1: Molly's like--

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.165
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT:
And she said one word.

00:39:18.165 --> 00:39:19.190
No, rule follower.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.530
SPEAKER 1: No, no, no.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:22.030
MARCIA TURNER: And
you know I'm not.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.147
So.

00:39:23.147 --> 00:39:23.980
SPEAKER 1: Thorough.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.272
And what would you add to that?

00:39:25.272 --> 00:39:28.240
Because I really liked how
Marcia elaborated on it.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.350
You're thorough.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.030
But words of wisdom?

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.848
Hard conversations.

00:39:31.848 --> 00:39:32.890
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: Yeah.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.920
I mean, for me, when we're
making difficult decisions

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.830
and having conversations
at an executive level,

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.110
it's important to
be-- it doesn't really

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.555
matter what level you're at.

00:39:42.555 --> 00:39:43.930
When you're making
a decision, it

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:49.450
is important to be thorough
and thoughtful about everything

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.850
that could possibly be
affected by the decision

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.340
that you're doing, right?

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.410
In your personal life,
in business, right?

00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:00.400
Every decision that you
make has consequences,

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.600
has repercussions.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.500
Whatever it might be.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.040
Has positive outcomes.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.880
So being thorough and
thinking through all

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.770
of the possibilities
is really important.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:13.390
It's very easy to be able
to be first to judge,

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.510
to be first to talk, right?

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.920
But how do we take a step
back and listen, absorb,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.750
think about everything that
may be a result of the decision

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.220
that we're making.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.157
And then make the decision.

00:40:29.157 --> 00:40:30.740
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE:
So you're going--

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.090
you're thinking-- you're
going to think I was cheating.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:32.590
I wasn't.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.280
I was going to
say knowledgeable.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.160
And that is similar
exactly to what

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.190
Molly was saying to make
sure that I have asked

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.050
the second, third,
and fourth question

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.160
before I make a decision.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.190
And to make sure that everything
has been thought through

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:50.087
and exactly what Molly said.

00:40:50.087 --> 00:40:50.670
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.520
I cannot believe
we're at 1:52 so fast.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.170
So I am actually going to
open the floor for questions.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.760
And I think this
is a perfect time.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.270
We've definitely touched
upon a few topics.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.100
I did not say this
at the beginning.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.160
The hashtag, of course,
is #GoogleDigitalCoaches.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.770
I'm totally giving
myself a plug.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.740
And hashtag #TalksAtGoogle,
to be honest with you.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:18.220
So use those two hashtags
if you catch pictures today.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:18.910
I hope you are.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.050
So all right.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:25.150
I am going to go ahead and
come out of picture view

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:26.360
and we'll focus on them.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.260
But Tony, have a question?

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.830
AUDIENCE: So there
are some statistics

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:38.380
around the fastest group of
entrepreneurs in the country.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.870
And happen to be
women of Michigan.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:46.160
And so my question is, how
engaged are your organizations

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.790
or yourself personally
with the startup

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:52.690
community of female
entrepreneurs here in Detroit,

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.280
if at all?

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.140
MARCIA TURNER: I just
went to the Lip Bar.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:00.470
If you haven't been to the Lip
Bar, guys, that is so cool.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.170
I am like, oh my god.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.550
This-- but I'm telling you.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:07.000
Detroit is just a cool
spot right now, right?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.130
And there are so
many different places

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.640
that you can go in
the downtown area

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.100
and in [INAUDIBLE],,
in neighborhoods

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.470
that are owned by women.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.620
So if I read about
a place, I try

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:26.710
to make it my business to
frequent the Woodburns Spa.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.330
Wood Spa.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.430
Another woman owns that.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.930
There are tons of places.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.060
And I try to look for them.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.700
I try to search out,
you know, making sure

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.900
that I'm not giving back to the
community in which I live in.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.490
I volunteer a lot.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.380
So I got that covered.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.180
AUDIENCE: And even if
you see opportunities

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.840
within your organizations
to engage with start-ups,

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.415
if you identify possibilities.

00:42:51.415 --> 00:42:53.290
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE: So
Major League Baseball

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.430
has a Diverse Business
Partners Program.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.430
And it's specifically
designed to make sure

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:01.760
that we are engaging with women
and minority owned businesses.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.313
So I would encourage
you to go look

00:43:04.313 --> 00:43:06.730
at Major League Baseball and
the Diverse Business Partners

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:07.390
Program.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.460
And also that program
is extended, obviously,

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.080
through the Detroit
Tigers, right?

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.015
That's not my area of expertise.

00:43:12.015 --> 00:43:13.515
So I don't want to
really elaborate.

00:43:13.515 --> 00:43:17.230
But there is a commitment that
we do business with small--

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.188
with women owned and
minority owned businesses.

00:43:19.188 --> 00:43:20.772
The other thing is
that I think that I

00:43:20.772 --> 00:43:22.780
would take a look at
the District Detroit

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.810
and I would look at the space
that we're in and this area.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.180
There's lots of opportunities
for development here.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.630
So if you're looking
for an-- and I, again,

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.440
that's not my area of expertise.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.762
But I do know that the idea
is that we're obviously

00:43:35.762 --> 00:43:37.720
going to continue to grow
the District Detroit.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.990
But this is a perfect place.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:41.590
I mean, if you are a small
business owner or a business

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:45.160
owner, and you want to try
to be at the right place

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.960
where you have 40,000 fans from
Comerica Park and 60,000 fans

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.980
from Ford Field and
20,000 fans at LCA,

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.370
this is the place to be.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.880
So I would do your due diligence
if you're a small business

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.848
owner.

00:43:58.848 --> 00:44:00.640
Large business owner,
and try to figure out

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.000
how you can do something
with the District Detroit.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.140
At least investigate.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.140
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: You
know, similar to Marcia,

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.890
I definitely try to frequent
a lot of those businesses here

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.730
downtown.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.150
Specifically one that I
frequent very often is K9 to 5.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.010
Love them.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.720
Woman entrepreneur
and business owner.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.170
So my dogs are so appreciative
because they do not

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.560
love the inside of my walls
of my house every single day.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.260
But beyond that, I
would say, in addition

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.648
to what the Tigers are doing--

00:44:31.648 --> 00:44:33.440
specifically the Tigers,
and then certainly

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.110
on a league level, us
here at the Red Wings

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.800
are continuously looking
at ways that we impact

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.390
the community in which we live.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:43.430
And moving here to
the District Detroit

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.900
has opened up a lot of
opportunities for us.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:51.200
And so, on our website,
there is a whole showcase

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.350
of areas in which we are
touching the community that we

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:55.580
work in.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:00.290
And always looking to
expand on that work.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.130
So again, similar to Ellen.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.170
This is not my
area of expertise.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.680
But I did oversee
community relations

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.610
for a couple of years.

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:10.940
And the individual who runs
that is a fantastic gentleman,

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.020
Kevin Brown.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:15.440
Him and his team do a lot and
he is extremely passionate

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.427
about this city and
the work that us

00:45:18.427 --> 00:45:20.510
as an organization, the
Detroit Red Wings, Olympia

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.780
Entertainment, can do to impact
the community that we work in.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.200
AUDIENCE: My name
is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.900
When I can go back--

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.852
I can speak loud.

00:45:28.852 --> 00:45:29.810
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.840
I actually work in PR,
communications, marketing,

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.060
all of that whole
umbrella thing.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.280
But my passion has
always been more focused

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.400
on the entertainment,
sports, music side of things.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.470
Now granted, it's very
difficult, obviously,

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.560
to get into those types of
fields, especially as a woman--

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.362
young woman, woman of
color, just different types

00:45:48.362 --> 00:45:49.070
of those aspects.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.100
So you guys have gave me
some great gems to take home.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.140
But if you could
kind of let me know

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.500
what kind of spaces people
or organizations or things

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.960
I should look into to
try to find those types

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.460
of opportunities to work in it?

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.660
MARCIA TURNER: Are
you still in college?

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.290
AUDIENCE: No.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.800
MARCIA TURNER: OK.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.220
So you're--

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:04.810
AUDIENCE: I'm a
professional now.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.370
I'm a senior account executive
up the street at a PR firm.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:11.895
But just kind of looking
for, you know, advice.

00:46:11.895 --> 00:46:13.520
MARCIA TURNER: I
mean, I would tell you

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.260
like I tell my 28-year-old.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.350
If you're waiting for someone to
come and find you, they won't.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.580
So go find what it is
that you're looking for.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.200
If it's I want to work in
TV, find someone on TV,

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.210
write them a note,
send them an email.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.280
I answer all of my emails.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.270
I may not answer them soon,
as these ladies may say.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.620
She'll get to you.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.340
But I answer all of them.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.880
And as we all have
expressed, we are

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.440
really passionate about trying
to formulate relationships

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.690
with women, younger women, women
who aspire to do what we do.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:52.220
So find it.

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.030
Look for it.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:54.560
Send the person a note.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.910
Send them a text message.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:57.130
Send them an email.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:59.045
Get on their Instagram.

00:46:59.045 --> 00:47:02.040
You can Google, right,
through LinkedIn.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.180
You know, Google them, find
out what they're doing.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.430
And hit them up on LinkedIn.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:09.470
I mean, I answer all of it.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:13.465
So, and try to get
some direction there.

00:47:13.465 --> 00:47:15.840
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: I would
also say to use your network.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.780
This town is-- while we are
very large, we are very small.

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:23.930
And I guarantee
that you probably

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:27.710
know a handful of people
that know people that

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.900
work across sports and
entertainment industry

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.040
just here in Detroit.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.590
And so use your network.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:34.820
Talk to people.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:39.770
I mean, just buy people
coffee, take them out to lunch.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:41.295
Just pick their
brain, get to know,

00:47:41.295 --> 00:47:42.920
see who they know,
who they don't know,

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.830
how they can make
introductions for you.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.070
And I guess my piece of advice--

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:51.290
this is not a room of students.

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:54.860
But use-- don't
go to your network

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.603
when you need something.

00:47:56.603 --> 00:47:58.520
And so different, I
understand, because you're

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.530
interested in this space.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.660
But always keep that in mind.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.610
That's something that's
really important to me

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:08.720
is making sure that I'm
exercising my network

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.350
all year round, even
when I don't necessarily

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:13.040
need something.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.870
Because there's nothing
worse than somebody

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.840
that comes to you just when
they need something, right?

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.470
So.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:20.570
MARCIA TURNER: That's the
only time you hear from them.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:21.590
ELLEN HILL ZERINGUE: I
would just add real quickly.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:22.760
Think out of the box, right?

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.910
So there's 30 major
league baseball teams.

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:28.050
So there's only 30 of me.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:31.340
So you have to think about
what are the other companies,

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.370
programs, products that touch
sports or touch entertainment.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:35.780
I always tell interns that.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.220
They say I want
to work in sports.

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.720
I'm like, OK, well
that doesn't mean

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.210
you have to work for a
team, or for a league.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:44.090
It means you could
work in broadcasting,

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.930
or you could work for a
very high level partner

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:53.198
corporation that invests a lot
in their sports sponsorships.

00:48:53.198 --> 00:48:54.740
So there's all
different kinds of way

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.365
of looking at sports
and entertainment,

00:48:56.365 --> 00:48:58.092
not just the traditional ways.

00:48:58.092 --> 00:48:59.550
And it might be a
little bit easier

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.850
to get into one of the
non-traditional ways

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:03.350
than one of the
traditional ways.

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:05.756
But I wish you great success.

00:49:05.756 --> 00:49:06.923
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.502
SPEAKER 1: Can you
say phenomenal?

00:49:12.502 --> 00:49:18.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.580
Phenomenal women.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:21.820
Phenomenal.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.300
Phenomenal for so many reasons.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.790
And I want to say thank you all.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.292
Thank you so much.

00:49:28.292 --> 00:49:30.750
As a lady, I'm getting a little
sappy here, a little teary.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:35.020
So we're going to pull it in.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:39.540
But again, I have the
opportunity to speak often.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.850
Always impressed with
the people that I meet.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:44.480
And you know, always
love to hear stories,

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.930
always love to ask questions.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:49.050
So being able to ask questions
and hear the stories of people

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.870
that you look up to,
people that you love,

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:57.270
people that you can call on
and they will be there for you

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.470
at a drop of a dime.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.770
So now Molly, I feel like, oh.

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:04.620
Welcome to the party, sister.

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:08.730
And it feels good because
we're in a space right now.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.410
And I'm entering that space too.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.140
It's a little bit weird for me.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.170
But I'm there too, where
when people call me,

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:19.170
it makes me feel great
that I can answer.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:21.360
Trina, I need-- yes, what is it?

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.970
Give me 15 minutes and I
will call you right back.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:27.000
And generally, I'm a
pretty good connector.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.170
And it's because of, you know,
the leadership, the mentorship,

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.840
and the things that have
happened in my life for women

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.080
like this who sit here, who
have made it happen for me.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.130
I've always told people, I
give because those gave to me

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:43.260
when I was not deserving.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:47.280
Even when I did not deserve
the opportunity, so I felt,

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.460
they saw something in
me and said, it's OK.

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.750
It's OK.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:53.970
I believe you and I
know you will be OK.

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:57.780
Even if you're not all
the way there right now,

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.750
I will stand there for you
and I will support you.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:04.230
And this panel today
is a testimony to that.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:07.950
Because I know I was
totally, like, Lord,

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:11.040
please allow them all to
have a scheduled time that

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:11.700
will meet up.

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:17.250
And that will work for
them and everybody.

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:20.280
And even Google and everyone
who's sitting in this room.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.560
Because I had a mild panic
attack before I started.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.352
I was like, oh god.

00:51:23.352 --> 00:51:24.600
Who's coming?

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.520
I was like, they are somebody.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.130
But is somebody coming to see?

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.620
So I just want to say thank you.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.090
Thank you so much.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.730
We're going to actually
wrap up, again,

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.600
because their time
is very valuable,

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.640
we don't want to
overextend them.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.890
You may be able to catch them.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.380
We have to do a
couple of things,

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:45.395
which be the formal of
take a couple of pictures

00:51:45.395 --> 00:51:47.020
and, you know, shake
a couple of hands.

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.770
So if they can't get
to you right now,

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.040
don't be discouraged.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:55.210
They are accessible
as we had mentioned.

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:56.530
So I think that's about it.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:59.370
So thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:00.960

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.500

We had our wonderful panelists,
Marcia Turner, Molly--

00:52:06.268 --> 00:52:07.560
let me get it right this time--

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.727
MOLLY WURDACK-FOLT: Wurdack.
