00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.280
This is a multi-device world.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.330
Everyone uses their phone on the go.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.450
&gt;&gt; And they probably sit down with
their laptops when they get home.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.719
&gt;&gt; People probably visit
the same sites on both, but

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.376
that doesn't mean that they've
got the same intention.

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:13.335
Yeah.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.446
While you may peruse your favorite
online retailer while you're on the go,

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:18.683
you may not feel comfortable
taking out your wallet and

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:21.270
typing in your payment
information in public.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.360
Or maybe you just don't feel like
dealing with tiny little buttons and

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.010
you're in a big rush.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.543
&gt;&gt; So you wait until you get home
to actually make the purchase.

00:00:28.543 --> 00:00:30.002
It's perfectly reasonable.

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:34.294
And developers who take advantage of
this pattern stand to convert even

00:00:34.294 --> 00:00:35.660
more users.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.890
&gt;&gt; There are a few ways you could help
users start a form on one device and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.570
then finish on another.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.290
For instance,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.720
you could offer them a way to share an
item through social channels or email.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.120
Or there's an even simpler tactic,
save to a shopping cart.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.100
This let's users leave for
now without worrying.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.790
Because they know when
they come back later,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.930
their items will be waiting for them.
