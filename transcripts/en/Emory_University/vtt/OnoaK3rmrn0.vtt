00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.800
We know that what we do is stimulating the area underneath the target which sits about here.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.980
We know that that area is tightly connected to a region deep inside called

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.380
the anterior cingulate cortex, which is
crucially involved in depression.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.740
And so we are relaying that activation to 
different parts of the brain that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.510
appeared to be under active in
depression and basically turning them on.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.400
Here's what happens the first day. You walk in and you're nervous, I was nervous because

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.830
this was something new. I was seated in a
spa chair and I had a coil placed

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.600
against my head, and the doctor with the
assistant figures out your motor

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.450
threshold. So they did this by these test
pulses and when my finger, my thumb

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.530
twitched appropriately they knew they
had the right spot on my head.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.320
Then they moved it forward and they figured out the dosage. So that was the first day.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.200
I was astounded at how easy it was. I was
absolutely relieved that

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.440
I was, that it didn't hurt, other than the fact that the tapping, when the tapping goes in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.000
it's four seconds on, very fast da da da da da da.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.940
That's intense and it did take some getting used to. But what was really wonderful

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.500
about my first day with TMS was that my
TMS coordinator and the doctor both

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.200
managed my expectations. They both said look this isn't a quick fix this takes time.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.520
It's a cumulative process. It starts
at the outermost part of your brain and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.440
it has to keep overtime, every day going
for this treatment, work its way deeper

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.340
into the brain so that you can feel the
benefit of TMS.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.560
The fact that they said you know don't don't expect an instant relief here. You're going to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.940
you're going to need to be patient but
you're going to need to be confident and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.190
commit that this will this will help you

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.770
So that was my first day.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.500
Most of the time people do need daily treatments for a substantial time.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.080
It may be as short as a week it may be as long as five or six weeks to get the full benefit of treatment.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:44.820
Following that the hope is that having gotten people out of the deep hole of depression

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.440
it easier to stay out of the hole with an occasional boost of a transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.460
once a week, once every several weeks to keep you going well.
