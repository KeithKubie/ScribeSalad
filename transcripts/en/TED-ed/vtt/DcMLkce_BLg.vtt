00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:12.213
What if William Shakespeare had a sister
who matched his imagination,

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:15.192
his wit, and his way with words?

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:18.171
Would she have gone to school
and set the stage alight?

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:20.411
In her essay "A Room of One's Own,"

00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:24.102
Virginia Woolf argues that this would
have been impossible.

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:27.180
She concocts a fictional sister
who's stuck at home,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.152
snatching time to scribble a few pages

00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:33.213
before she finds herself
betrothed and runs away.

00:00:33.213 --> 00:00:39.433
While her brother finds fame and fortune,
she remains abandoned and anonymous.

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:40.755
In this thought experiment,

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.804
Woolf demonstrates the tragedy
of genius restricted,

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:48.634
and looks back through time for hints
of these hidden histories.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:51.754
She wrote, "When one reads 
of a witch being ducked,

00:00:51.754 --> 00:00:54.203
of a woman possessed by devils,

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:56.033
of a wise woman selling herbs,

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.141
or even a very remarkable man
who had a mother,

00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:02.094
then I think we're on the track
of a lost novelist,

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:03.734
a suppressed poet,

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:06.935
of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen."

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:10.515
"A Room of One's Own" considers a world
denied great works of art

00:01:10.515 --> 00:01:14.314
due to exclusion and inequality.

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:18.815
How best can we understand
the internal experience of alienation?

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:20.695
In both her essays and fiction,

00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:26.084
Virginia Woolf shapes the slippery nature 
of subjective experience into words.

00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:29.412
Her characters frequently lead inner lives
that are deeply at odds

00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:31.794
with their external existence.

00:01:31.794 --> 00:01:35.085
To help make sense of these disparities,
the next time you read Woolf,

00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:39.920
here are some aspects of her life
and work to consider.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.035
She was born Adeline Virginia Stephen
in 1882 to a large and wealthy family,

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:48.386
which enabled her to pursue a life
in the arts.

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:52.705
The death of her mother in 1895
was followed by that of her half-sister,

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:56.515
father, and brother 
within the next ten years.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:59.436
These losses led to Woolf's first
depressive episode

00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:03.696
and subsequent institutionalization.

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:05.666
As a young woman, she purchased a house

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:09.105
in the Bloomsbury area 
of London with her siblings.

00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:12.097
This brought her into contact
with a circle of creatives,

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.597
including E.M. Forster,

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:14.646
Clive Bell,

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:15.607
Roger Fry,

00:02:15.607 --> 00:02:17.366
and Leonard Woolf.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.906
These friends became known
as the Bloomsbury Group,

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.967
and Virginia and Leonard married in 1912.

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:25.977
The members of this group were prominent
figures in Modernism,

00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:28.697
a cultural movement that sought
to push the boundaries

00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:30.847
of how reality is represented.

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:35.268
Key features of Modernist writing include
the use of stream of consciousness,

00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:36.942
interior monologue,

00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:38.524
distortions in time,

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.183
and multiple or shifting perspectives.

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:43.135
These appear in the work of Ezra Pound,

00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:44.562
Gertrude Stein,

00:02:44.562 --> 00:02:45.383
James Joyce,

00:02:45.383 --> 00:02:48.343
and Woolf herself.

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:52.183
While reading Joyce's "Ulysses,"
Woolf began writing "Mrs. Dalloway."

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:56.411
Like "Ulysses," the text takes place
over the course of a single day

00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:59.914
and opens under seemingly
mundane circumstances.

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:03.895
"Mrs. Dalloway said she would
buy the flowers herself."

00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:07.023
But the novel dives deeply
into the characters' traumatic pasts,

00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:10.584
weaving the inner world of numbed
socialite Clarissa Dalloway,

00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:16.484
with that of the shell-shocked veteran
Septimus Warren Smith.

00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:20.544
Woolf uses interior monologue
to contrast the rich world of the mind

00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:24.015
against her characters' 
external existences.

00:03:24.015 --> 00:03:25.604
In her novel "To the Lighthouse,"

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:29.296
mundane moments, like a dinner party,
or losing a necklace

00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:33.126
trigger psychological revelations
in the lives of the Ramsay's,

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:37.975
a fictionalized version 
of Woolf's family growing up.

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:41.905
"To the Lighthouse" also contains
one of the most famous examples

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:45.076
of Woolf's radical representation of time.

00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:46.665
In the Time Passes section,

00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:50.175
ten years are distilled 
into about 20 pages.

00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:53.155
Here, the lack of human presence
in the Ramsays' beach house

00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:57.954
allows Woolf to reimagine time
in flashes and fragments of prose.

00:03:57.954 --> 00:04:01.016
"The house was left. 
The house was deserted.

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:05.316
It was left like a shell on a sand hill
to fill with dry salt grains

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:09.247
now that life had left it."

00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:10.546
In her novel "The Waves,"

00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:14.696
there is little distinction between
the narratives of the six main characters.

00:04:14.696 --> 00:04:17.476
Woolf experiments 
with collective consciousness,

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:21.115
at times collapsing the six voices
into one.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.157
"It is not one life that I look back upon:

00:04:23.157 --> 00:04:26.226
I am not one person: 
I am many people:

00:04:26.226 --> 00:04:28.527
I do not altogether know who I am,

00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:31.885
Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda or Louis,

00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:37.259
or how to distinguish 
my life from their's."

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.827
In "The Waves," six become one,
but in the gender-bending "Orlando,"

00:04:41.827 --> 00:04:45.688
a single character 
inhabits multiple identities.

00:04:45.688 --> 00:04:51.637
The protagonist is a poet who switches
between genders and lives for 300 years.

00:04:51.637 --> 00:04:54.059
With its fluid language 
and approach to identity,

00:04:54.059 --> 00:05:00.019
"Orlando" is considered 
a key text in gender studies.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:03.068
The mind can only fly 
so far from the body

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:06.058
before it returns 
to the constraints of life.

00:05:06.058 --> 00:05:09.010
Like many of her characters,
Woolf's life ended in tragedy

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.108
when she drowned herself at the age of 59.

00:05:12.108 --> 00:05:15.018
Yet, she expressed hope beyond suffering.

00:05:15.018 --> 00:05:17.788
Through deep thought,
Woolf's characters are shown

00:05:17.788 --> 00:05:21.400
to temporarily transcend 
their material reality,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.917
and in its careful consideration
of the complexity of the mind,

00:05:24.917 --> 00:05:29.989
her work charts the importance of making
our inner lives known to each other.
