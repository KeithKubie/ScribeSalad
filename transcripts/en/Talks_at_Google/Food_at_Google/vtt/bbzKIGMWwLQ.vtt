[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:07.170
JENNA TAYLOR: So
today, we're super

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.050
excited to have a chef and
cookbook author, Brooke Lewy,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.010
with us of the
"Vegetables on Fire"

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.280
cookbook, which truly could not
be more aligned with food team

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.180
values.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.990
We are all about making
vegetables the most delicious

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.220
part of your meal.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
And we really feel like a
predominantly plant-based diet,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.640
not only best for you but for
the environment and the world

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.440
that we're all trying
to live in together.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.490
We love meat.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.290
We love really
high quality meat.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.900
But vegetables, we think,
are truly the answer.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.830
And in this season of
grilling, nothing better

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.720
than my personal favorite
food, grilled broccoli,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.420
which there is an awesome
recipe in here for.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.362
So with that, welcome.

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:49.320
BROOKE LEWY: Thank you.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.750
Thank you guys so much for
having me and for coming.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.870
It's really exciting to
see the book come to life

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.690
and get to cook from it
with people instead of just

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.627
developing recipes on my own.

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:01.710
And I was saying before,
grilling in San Francisco

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.057
is sometimes solitary, because
it's always really cold

00:01:04.057 --> 00:01:05.640
JENNA TAYLOR: Out
on your fire escape.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.975
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:06.660
Exactly.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.730
So it's really nice to
have a bunch of people

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.180
that cook with instead
of trying to convince

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.340
people to come outside with me.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.190
So I don't know how-- how
many of you guys have grills,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.760
do grill?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.580
Just so I have an idea of
where you're coming from.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.895
So, oh, great.

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:23.160
So a lot of people grill.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.250
And the book also has tips
on how to make everything

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.010
at home if you don't inside.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.320
So it kind of works either way.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.821
So I think I'll get started.

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:34.320
The first--

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.400
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.520
What are we having today?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.228
The first recipe that
we're going to demo

00:01:37.228 --> 00:01:41.580
is a quinoa tabbouleh
stuffed pepper.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.620
So we'll get started, and
then the second recipe

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.600
is going to be a
carrot and avocado

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.524
salad with all of the seeds.

00:01:48.524 --> 00:01:49.440
With all of the seeds.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.760
JENNA TAYLOR: All of them.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.370
BROOKE LEWY: All of the seeds.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.520
Exactly.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.840
JENNA TAYLOR: I love it.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.640
I read the title.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.720
I'm like, you're
speaking my language.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.670
BROOKE LEWY: So the
idea for this book

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.300
is basically that vegetables
are as delicious as meat

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.340
and that they can
be super satisfying.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.170
So both of these
recipes really aim

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.000
to have a lot of
flavor and texture

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.790
and be really
satisfying on their own.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.280
That said, I have ideas for
how you could incorporate meat

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.750
if you want, if you want to
make them more substantial.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.750
So I'll kind of add that
in as we go through.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.594
So for the pepper, I
just cut them in half.

00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:25.260
You want to make them
like little bowls,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.926
because you're then
going to stuff them.

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:29.040
So I take all the
ribs and seeds out.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.380
We're going to add a
little bit of oil to them.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.790
You can add olive or canola.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.850
I use both in the book.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.730
I kind of-- to keep
things simple-- just like

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.790
to use the same kind that I'm
using later in the recipe.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.500
So like for this recipe
with the peppers,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.190
I'm using olive oil
for the dressing.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.040
So I just use olive
oil for the peppers,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.940
so you don't have to have
too many things around.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.560
Here, we happen to have both.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.480
Another thing that
I talk about a lot

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.550
are the tools that I
like to use to grill.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.052
And one of the things that I
like a lot are sheet trays.

00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:04.260
I actually really like the
quarter sheet trays, which

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.790
are half the size of this.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.950
They're awesome for
oiling vegetables

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.799
that don't fit well in a bowl.

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.340
We'll use them again
for the carrots.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.340
It works great for
asparagus, anything

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.455
that's sort of unwieldy.

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:18.330
JENNA TAYLOR: So you
see those grill baskets,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.121
but you're saying you
don't even need that.

00:03:20.121 --> 00:03:21.917
Just put a regular
sheet pan on your grill.

00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:24.000
BROOKE LEWY: You can use
these right on the grill,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.460
but I even just mean for
prepping your vegetables.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.530
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, gotcha.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.780
Yeah, well, this is the
best kitchen tool ever.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.585
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:32.460
And for bringing things
to and from the grill

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.110
so you don't have
a bunch of glass

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.050
bowls outside and
things that can break.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.280
So I'm just rubbing oil on
the outside of the peppers.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.800
I am going to sprinkle
with a little salt,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.246
because you want everything
really well seasoned.

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:49.620
One thing that I
came across when

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.370
I started writing this
book is that people

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.150
who are generally really
creative, competent cooks kind

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.610
of shut down when they
start grilling vegetables.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.000
And they just like default
to grilled zucchini or slices

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.867
of grilled eggplant, and
they're so boring and--

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:03.950
JENNA TAYLOR: Whomp-whomp.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.824
BROOKE LEWY: --bland.

00:04:04.824 --> 00:04:06.860
Yeah.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.950
Grilled zucchini does
absolutely nothing for me.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.480
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
totally the worst.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.020
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.776
And you're like,
ugh, I guess somebody

00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:13.400
decided to placate
the vegetarians here

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.860
at this barbecue.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.443
JENNA TAYLOR: I was so relieved
that you said that, because it

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:17.589
could not be worse, really.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.899
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.490
So my whole mission
in this book is

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.012
to encourage
people, be creative,

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:22.970
use some of the things.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.495
And even if you don't
make the whole recipe--

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:26.870
you'll see with
the carrot salad.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.730
If you're like, I don't have
time to do this whole thing.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.810
I'm not interested.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.750
Even if you just add the
seeds to the carrots,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.210
you have a dish that's
actually really delicious.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.710
And--

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.090
JENNA TAYLOR: Even if you
just grill the carrots.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.050
BROOKE LEWY: Even if you
just grill the carrots.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.800
JENNA TAYLOR: I
mean, I would argue

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.120
that'd still be delicious.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.630
BROOKE LEWY: Exactly.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.980
So while the peppers
are grilling,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.090
I just put them cut side down.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.089
I'm going to make the
tabbouleh for the-- that's

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:47.990
we're going to stuff them with.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.350
So we have quinoa that your
lovely team here already

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.010
cooked for me.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.880
We'll dump that in.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.540
And we have some tomatoes.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.930
We'll cut those up.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.620
I'll move this till
we need it again.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.889
So depending on-- you want
them on the smaller side,

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.680
because they're going
to go in the peppers.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.850
So you want bite-sized.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.190
So we'll just do a few.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.660
With the cucumber, you
could peel it or not,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.209
depending on your preference.

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:23.000
I'll peel a little.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.035
You want it pretty small.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.400
And all of the
recipes in this book

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.810
are meant to be flat-- flexible.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.720
I think that's one of
the things about grilling

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.600
is every grill is
a little different.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.800
Produce changes
depending on the year.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.460
So it's nice to be
able to mix it up.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.690
So this salad, you could
kind of do whatever.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.370
This is a pretty
classic tabbouleh

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.070
with cucumber and tomato.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.590
So we'll add some
cucumber in there.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.352
If it has a lot of seeds, a good
trick is to cut it like this

00:06:00.352 --> 00:06:01.310
and lay it on its side.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.340
Can you guys see kind of?

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.117
And then just cut out
the seeds this way.

00:06:06.117 --> 00:06:07.700
Sometimes, it's nice
to take those out

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.825
if there are a lot of them.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.400
So I'll put those in the bowl.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.000
Let's check out our
peppers real fast.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.630
Tongs are an indispensable
grilling tool.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.370
I don't like using
the ones that come--

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.480
they need a little
bit more time.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.980
See?

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.410
They have some marks, but
they're not really soft yet.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.060
The kind that come
with grill sets

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.610
are really stiff and
unwieldy, and they can often

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.070
hurt your delicate vegetables.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.110
So this kind that's just
sturdy and normal kitchen tongs

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.050
are great.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.000
The kind that comes tipped with
silicone are also really great.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.510
Those are my favorite
grilling tools.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.740
Let's keep adding
to our tabbouleh.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.840
We'll add some olives.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.978
If you don't like olives,
leave them out, obviously.

00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:56.478
Chop--

00:06:56.478 --> 00:06:57.910
AUDIENCE: Olive [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.092
BROOKE LEWY: Some people
don't like olives.

00:07:00.092 --> 00:07:01.550
JENNA TAYLOR: Also
not my favorite.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.591
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah, sorry.

00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:03.970
JENNA TAYLOR: Confession.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.570
Really black olives being the
worst offender of all of--

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.207
all of life.

00:07:08.207 --> 00:07:09.790
AUDIENCE: More flavor
than [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:10.560
JENNA TAYLOR: These look lovely.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.256
No offense.

00:07:11.256 --> 00:07:14.410
BROOKE LEWY: [LAUGHS] And
then tabbouleh generally

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.400
has a lot of herbs, so we'll
put some green onion in there.

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:24.700
While I'm just
chopping up the stuff,

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.660
I can talk a little bit more.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.920
You mentioned grill baskets.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.752
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:07:27.752 --> 00:07:29.210
Tools that you
would recommend, or.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.543
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah, so the
tongs, the quarter sheet trays

00:07:31.543 --> 00:07:34.510
are two of my
absolute favorites.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.360
In terms of grill
baskets, I don't really

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.730
like the very stiff ones.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.040
They work.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.890
They don't allow a lot
of that smoke flavor

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.530
to come up into the food.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.110
They make mesh
disposable ones that you

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.010
can use a bunch of times,
and they're like $3.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.602
You buy them at the hardware
store, and those work great.

00:07:53.602 --> 00:07:55.810
And if you're trying to
grill something that's rolly,

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.700
like tomatoes, you
can turn up the sides,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.382
so they don't roll off.

00:07:59.382 --> 00:08:01.090
JENNA TAYLOR: That
sounds like a pro tip.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.970
I'm going to look into that.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.860
I haven't used those before.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.260
BROOKE LEWY: They usually
come in packs of three.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.780
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.280
BROOKE LEWY: And
they're just like--

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.797
and also, you don't really
need to wash them as much.

00:08:08.797 --> 00:08:10.630
Because that's the best
thing about grilling

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.250
is that there's much--

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.442
many fewer dishes, I would say.

00:08:15.442 --> 00:08:16.660
I'm going to cut the parsley.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.010
I usually bunch it up.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.795
JENNA TAYLOR: What else
is indispensable to you?

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.420
BROOKE LEWY: The last
thing I would say

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.875
is heavy duty aluminum
foil is really useful.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.250
If you don't have
a grill basket,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.416
you can use that in a pinch.

00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:34.940
It's really great
for making packets.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.079
So if you make campfire-style
potatoes or you--

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:40.547
I have a recipe
for smoking beets,

00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:42.130
where you smoke them
in a foil packet.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.520
And it's actually one of my
favorite recipes in the book.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.960
It's really good
and super simple.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.610
OR also I do
artichokes that way.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.254
And I feel like
artichokes are very often

00:08:55.254 --> 00:08:57.670
cumbersome and annoying, and
people tend not to cook them.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.650
Because it's like you
need the salt water

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.010
bath and-- or lemon water
bath, and steam them,

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:03.870
and they'll get hot.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.828
But you can just put them
all in a foil packet,

00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:07.900
put them on your
grill, they cook.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.030
Eventually, you take
them out of the packet.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.446
You throw them on the grill
itself, and then they're done.

00:09:11.446 --> 00:09:15.410
And it's much less
of a production.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.407
So those are really
my main cooking tools.

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:19.990
JENNA TAYLOR: And
what got you started

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.573
with the idea for
the book in general?

00:09:21.573 --> 00:09:23.764
I mean, I love it, but--

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:25.180
BROOKE LEWY: To
be totally honest,

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.710
Chronicle came to
me with the idea.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.190
They were really excited
about it and said,

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.250
would you want to do it?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.260
Are you into it?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.817
And I was.

00:09:32.817 --> 00:09:34.900
JENNA TAYLOR: And you were
previously at Delfina--

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.370
BROOKE LEWY: Yes.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:35.780
JENNA TAYLOR: --at the time?

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.530
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.420
Mm-hmm.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.780
So I worked the
grill station there.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.030
There were some
veggies, mostly meat.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.910
Yeah.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.720
So--

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.880
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
such a fun project.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.560
BROOKE LEWY: It
came about that way.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:48.710
Yeah.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.543
And it's been great.

00:09:49.543 --> 00:09:52.690
And it definitely opened up
my eyes to grilling vegetables

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.065
and forced me to
be creative too.

00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:56.065
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, and
the glory of California,

00:09:56.065 --> 00:09:57.190
you can grill year round.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.940
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.300
JENNA TAYLOR: Right.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:58.390
BROOKE LEWY: That's true.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.840
JENNA TAYLOR: So it opens
up the possibilities.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.830
And I know you mentioned--
she's from New York.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.150
So probably not as
much grilling happening

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.412
in the winter in New York.

00:10:05.412 --> 00:10:06.370
BROOKE LEWY: It's true.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.490
So our peppers have gotten
soft halfway through,

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.680
which is what we're looking for.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.290
You can see they're starting
to bend a little this way.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.172
So I am going to--

00:10:17.172 --> 00:10:18.880
in this recipe, I like
to put some cheese

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.430
in the cavity itself to
get a little bit melty.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.330
And just make sure there's
cheese on both sides.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.632
So I'm going to put
some cheese in there

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:34.840
and put it back on the grill.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.150
And this is a really
good place to show

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.920
where you could put meat.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.920
If you wanted to do some,
you could get some--

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.900
I would saute some onion
and some ground lamb

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.440
and saute it in a pan, put it
in the pepper under the cheese,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.856
so it would get
warm-- stay warm.

00:10:50.856 --> 00:10:52.480
And then you put your
tabbouleh on top.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.980
And as you cut
through, then you get

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.610
tabbouleh and cheese and lamb.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.680
And so it becomes
even more substantial

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.400
if you have a mixed
crew of people.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.365
So we'll let those
cook on the other side.

00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:05.990
Our table tabbouleh
is almost finished.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.198
We need to make the dressing.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.920
I really like to make
my dressing right

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.730
in measuring cups.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.640
I feel like it saves dishes.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.140
I don't know if you can tell,
I'm really into saving dishes.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.450
JENNA TAYLOR: I am super
into your dish-less approach.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.920
BROOKE LEWY: Nobody
likes to do dishes.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.110
JENNA TAYLOR: No.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.760
BROOKE LEWY: And especially
if you're hanging out outside,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.120
the last thing you want to do
is go back in and be like, ugh,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.870
I have so many dishes to wash.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.932
JENNA TAYLOR: Look at
your mountain of dishes,

00:11:29.932 --> 00:11:31.390
and you're really
want to hang out.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:31.931
Yeah, I know.

00:11:31.931 --> 00:11:33.755
I support that.

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:34.255
Yeah.

00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:34.390
Right?

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:34.690
BROOKE LEWY: Exactly.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:35.560
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
everyone else is outside,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.140
and you're inside--

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.260
BROOKE LEWY: It's such a bummer.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.093
JENNA TAYLOR: Looking
at your pile of stuff.

00:11:39.093 --> 00:11:40.090
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.715
So lemon juice-- this is
a really simple dressing.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.480
It's nice to make the dressing
really bright, I would say.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.610
Another thing about
grilled vegetables

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.800
is that they're often just
really sweet and soft.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.750
And it's really important to
add enough salt and enough fat--

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.750
sorry, we're switching--

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.170
JENNA TAYLOR: An acid

00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.590
BROOKE LEWY: Acid, yeah.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.250
JENNA TAYLOR: --to
get that brightness.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:00.550
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah exactly.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.200
So all of these
recipes generally

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.440
have some kind of
fat or acid-- sorry.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.550
Lemon juice, pinch
of salt, pepper.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.585
Yeah, don't be afraid to
go big on the salting.

00:12:13.585 --> 00:12:15.680
Little whisk making
some dressing.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.620
[MIXING]

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.441
So we'll add this
to our tabbouleh.

00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:24.940
We'll leave this
here, because we're

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.430
going to do another dressing
for our carrot salad.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.470
Mix it all up.

00:12:33.981 --> 00:12:34.480
And--

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.796
[MIXING]

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.337
--looks good.

00:12:41.337 --> 00:12:42.670
Let's check back on our peppers.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.510
They're looking pretty good too.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.020
You just want them
cooked through

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.137
but to still have
some bite to them

00:12:53.137 --> 00:12:55.220
and to hold their shape,
obviously, because you're

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.053
going to stuff them.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.560
So we'll pull them off.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:09.499
And add some tabbouleh.

00:13:09.499 --> 00:13:11.540
The same thing that I was
saying with the seeds--

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.520
you don't have to go
through this whole thing

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.470
to make your grilled
vegetables delicious.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:20.720
Even if you just make a peanut
sauce or a quick sauce and--

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.490
Green Goddess in a blender--

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.310
the book has an entire
section on little things

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.540
like that you can
do even in advance

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.214
that just makes such
a big difference

00:13:29.214 --> 00:13:30.255
for your grilled veggies.

00:13:30.255 --> 00:13:32.135
JENNA TAYLOR: But this
seemed also just quick, easy.

00:13:32.135 --> 00:13:34.032
BROOKE LEWY: Well, it helps when
you guys do all the prep too.

00:13:34.032 --> 00:13:36.590
JENNA TAYLOR: I mean, all
they did was cook the quinoa.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.746
BROOKE LEWY: But it is really.

00:13:36.746 --> 00:13:37.245
It's true.

00:13:37.245 --> 00:13:39.080
It is really quick and easy.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.335
And-- sorry.

00:13:40.335 --> 00:13:41.960
JENNA TAYLOR: I mean,
theoretically you

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.270
could do like Trader Joe's
tabbouleh or something

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.920
and still your freshly
grilled pepper--

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.220
BROOKE LEWY: Totally.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:46.550
Totally.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.390
JENNA TAYLOR: And that
would be super delicious.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.550
BROOKE LEWY: And then look
how much more appealing

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.520
this looks than just a plate
of grilled zucchini next to all

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.414
your burgers.

00:13:53.414 --> 00:13:54.580
JENNA TAYLOR: Boo, zucchini.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.140
BROOKE LEWY: So I don't
know where we should--

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:56.650
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
that's beautiful.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:56.810
BROOKE LEWY: --put it.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.940
Sorry, I don't want to give
grilled zucchini a bad rap.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.680
JENNA TAYLOR: No, we should
just give it a bad rap.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.263
It's terrible.

00:14:01.263 --> 00:14:02.506
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:02.506 --> 00:14:03.672
Prejudiced against zucchini.

00:14:03.672 --> 00:14:03.790
Sorry.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.581
BROOKE LEWY: But it's
like, your vegetarian

00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:08.280
friends will be so much happy--
or not vegetarian friends.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:08.380
Anybody--

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.980
JENNA TAYLOR: People who
like to eat veggies, yeah.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.060
BROOKE LEWY: It's just--

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.870
JENNA TAYLOR: Well,
and I love the idea

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.360
of being able to have the same
dish that could be adapted

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.520
with meat if you really wanted
for people who especially

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.019
wanted that.

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:20.100
But I always disliked that
feeling of here's dinner,

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.350
and here's a vegetarian dish--

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:22.270
BROOKE LEWY: Totally.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.330
JENNA TAYLOR: --for
my vegetarian friend.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.930
BROOKE LEWY: Totally
it's really nice to--

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.900
JENNA TAYLOR: It's good
to have it really be--

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.450
BROOKE LEWY: --just
include everybody.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.020
JENNA TAYLOR: --inclusive.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.520
Yeah, right.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.641
Like a menu that is
delicious for all eaters.

00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:30.515
BROOKE LEWY: Totally.

00:14:30.515 --> 00:14:30.830
JENNA TAYLOR: Love that.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.470
BROOKE LEWY: So I'm going
to move this stuff away.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.660
Maybe I can just
put it on this side.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.136
Can I give this next to you?

00:14:37.136 --> 00:14:38.510
So those are the
stuffed peppers.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.220
Anybody have any
questions specifically

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.200
about stuffed peppers?

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:43.700
Yeah.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] substitute
any other tomatoes in here

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.120
if you don't have those ones.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.230
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, of course.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.612
Just cut them little.

00:14:49.612 --> 00:14:51.320
I mean, my mom said
to me a million times

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.820
when I was growing up
and helping her cook,

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.153
think about the size that you
want to put in your mouth,

00:14:55.153 --> 00:14:57.120
which I hated her for saying.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.670
But it's true.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.240
You just don't want
to all fall out.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.460
So for the carrots--

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:04.960
sorry.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.930
Any other questions
about the peppers?

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.638
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:08.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.140
BROOKE LEWY: Not really.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.450
It just adds a little
char to the outside.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.670
And also, vegetables don't
flare up nearly as much

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.560
as meat does, because
there's no fat dripping off.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.018
That's when you're
grilling, that's

00:15:17.018 --> 00:15:18.470
where the flare ups come from.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.970
And that's another
thing I would say

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.530
about cooking
vegetables in general

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.050
is that they're much
more forgiving than meat.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.300
It's not like you just
paid $35 for ribeye,

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.069
and if you mess it
up, your dinner sucks.

00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:30.485
And you just spent
a lot of money.

00:15:30.485 --> 00:15:31.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.297
You know, it's like you can--

00:15:32.297 --> 00:15:34.130
you-- we always want
to treat our food well,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.800
but you can always throw
a few extra vegetables in

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.090
or learn as you're going.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.520
And there's not
so much at stake.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.645
It's a really good way to
get comfortable grilling,

00:15:42.645 --> 00:15:44.570
to get to know your grill.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.340
JENNA TAYLOR: Gas or charcoal?

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.140
Dun, dun, dun.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.080
BROOKE LEWY: So I
think for vegetables

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.030
either one works
great, and gas is

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.070
the path of least resistance.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.670
Because you just turn it on.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.076
For me, I usually use charcoal.

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:00.200
You get a much better sear.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:00.490
JENNA TAYLOR: Flavor.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.031
BROOKE LEWY: I think
it's really hard

00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:05.330
to get a good sear on meat,
burgers, whatever on a gas

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.237
grill.

00:16:06.237 --> 00:16:07.070
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.550
JENNA TAYLOR: --the flavor of
charcoal too, that smokiness.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:10.730
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah, it's
just a different thing.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.600
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.398
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah?

00:16:12.398 --> 00:16:13.647
AUDIENCE: I'm new to grilling.

00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:14.606
What is a grill basket?

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:15.772
BROOKE LEWY: A grill basket?

00:16:15.772 --> 00:16:17.690
JENNA TAYLOR: What
is a grill basket?

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.480
BROOKE LEWY: I think most
people use grill baskets

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.400
for vegetables and for fish.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.724
There are kinds that just
sit on top of your grill.

00:16:25.724 --> 00:16:27.140
And then there's
other ones, where

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.514
if you're making a whole fish,
you put the fish in there.

00:16:29.514 --> 00:16:31.970
And you put it on,
and then you flip it.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.710
That's usually it.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.390
It's usually so
nothing falls down.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:35.950
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:36.741
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:40.370
You see them like perforated
metal baskets almost.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:43.900
Like a lot of times if
I'm doing asparagus,

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.910
and you don't want it to
fall between the cracks

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.690
of the grill, put
it in a basket.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.440
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.106
JENNA TAYLOR: Can you
use a grill basket

00:16:50.106 --> 00:16:51.000
for indoor cooking?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.450
BROOKE LEWY: I don't think
you'd really need to, so.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.160
JENNA TAYLOR: You
would use a regular pot

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.900
or pan or frying
pan or whatever.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.180
It's like a frying pan for
your grill to some extent.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.220
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.656
Yeah.

00:17:01.656 --> 00:17:03.530
If you're translating
the recipes to indoors,

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:08.203
either I'd use a grill pan if
you're grilling something like

00:17:08.203 --> 00:17:09.369
lettuce-- if you're-- sorry.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.349
If you're trying to do something
like a whole head of lettuce

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.510
or something, you could
use a grill pan for that.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.484
Otherwise, I use
the broiler a lot.

00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:19.400
But nothing's going to
fall through, you know.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:20.750
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.375
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
The basket, for me,

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:25.010
just generally keeps things
from falling through the spaces

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.700
in the grill.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.357
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:27.357 --> 00:17:29.690
So I'm going to move on to
the carrot and avocado salad.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:33.272
And just keep asking
questions as we go.

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:35.480
These are really beautiful
carrots that you guys got.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.450
They're pretty small.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.190
I think I would cut them
in half just the long way.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.910
One, like this, is really
tiny, so keep it as is.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.150
This salad was inspired by
one that I ate in New York

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.850
at a restaurant called ABC
Kitchen that's also really veg

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.440
forward.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:00.050
And it's just such a delicious
combination of things.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.480
So a little olive oil.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.400
See how easy this is to
do it on the grill pan

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.850
rather than fighting
with the shape of a bowl?

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.910
Salt, some pepper.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.490
If your carrots
were really small--

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.620
for this recipe, I
also use pimenton,

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.560
which is like a
smoky paprika that I

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.990
use in a lot of the recipes.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.157
It's kind of like a double
dose of that smoky flavor

00:18:23.157 --> 00:18:25.156
by the time you put the
vegetables on the grill.

00:18:25.156 --> 00:18:26.180
It works really nicely.

00:18:29.072 --> 00:18:32.660
We'll just toss them
around a little.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.700
This works great for
bringing things over,

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.990
especially if you're doing
the indoor/outdoor thing.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.990
And I know most people
don't like mis-en-place

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.970
their stuff on trays,
like you guys do here,

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.040
but it actually works
really well for the grill.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.380
I would say--

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.060
JENNA TAYLOR: Then you can
carry it all down to the grill.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:48.400
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.410
And it doesn't
have to be a tray.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.540
You could do it on a sheet pan.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.415
BROOKE LEWY: Exactly.

00:18:51.415 --> 00:18:53.326
It's really nice to
be super organized,

00:18:53.326 --> 00:18:55.700
so you don't have to be running
in and out, and like, oh,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.300
I forgot--

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.549
you know, I forget this thing.

00:18:57.549 --> 00:19:00.954
I forgot the other thing,
especially if you're

00:19:00.954 --> 00:19:02.870
grilling pizzas and
stuff, you want everything

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.859
to go pretty fast.

00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:05.150
Everything does go pretty fast.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.430
You want everything to
be pretty organized.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.850
So while those are grilling,
I'm going to toast my seeds.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.300
And when I toast seeds, I use
the path of least resistance.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.610
So if I need to use a
pan for something later,

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.000
I'll use a pan.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.060
I do it a lot in
the toaster oven,

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.770
just like whatever--
again, whatever

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.430
creates the fewest dishes.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.580
JENNA TAYLOR: [LAUGHS]
I love that philosophy.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.371
BROOKE LEWY: I'm going
to actually just put

00:19:27.371 --> 00:19:29.481
this right on the grill.

00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:30.980
I'm realizing now
that I'm at Google

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.480
that grilling vegetables is
like the most low-tech thing you

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.270
could possibly do.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.840
And I feel like I'm in
this high-tech world, where

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.050
I'm like, and I'm
just gonna use fire.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.190
JENNA TAYLOR: Food does
not have to be high-tech.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.586
No, it's all about--

00:19:40.586 --> 00:19:42.460
BROOKE LEWY: So I'm
going to let this-- maybe

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.610
I'll move my carrots over
a little to make room.

00:19:47.707 --> 00:19:50.040
And I'm a big fan of doing
whatever you can on the grill

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.955
too, because part of
grilling is that you don't

00:19:52.955 --> 00:19:54.080
have to get your house hot.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.930
You don't have to
turn on the oven.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.480
So there are a couple of
recipes in the book where you--

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.150
like fresh shakshuka.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.470
You grill the vegetables.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.480
You blend a bunch of them
up to make your sauce.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.300
And then you just put the
pan right back on the grill.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.990
So that works pretty well.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.900
So this recipe uses sesame
seeds, pumpkin seeds,

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.684
and sunflower seeds,
and pistachios.

00:20:14.684 --> 00:20:15.600
So I'm just going to--

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.530
JENNA TAYLOR: All of the seeds.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.480
BROOKE LEWY: All of seeds.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.170
JENNA TAYLOR: As you
said very clearly.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:18.920
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.510
So I'm actually going to
do my pistachios first.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.880
Doesn't matter what
order you do them in.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.250
Just toast them separately since
they toast at different rates.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.000
Give them a shake.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.510
We'll let those go.

00:20:37.966 --> 00:20:39.340
JENNA TAYLOR: It
is in a dry pan?

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:39.520
BROOKE LEWY: Yes.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.380
It is a dry pan.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.775
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:44.500
I feel like toasting nuts and
seeds is one of those kitchen

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.330
tests, where like,
don't walk away.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.170
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah,
no, it's true.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.035
They burn so fast.

00:20:48.035 --> 00:20:49.140
JENNA TAYLOR: So easily.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.170
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.280
And you just want to toast
them until they kind of smell

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.200
all nutty and golden and
have some color on them.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.150
So they'll go.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.620
And if you have people
who are allergic to nuts,

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.210
just leave them out.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.962
If you didn't want
to do nuts and seeds,

00:21:09.962 --> 00:21:12.170
or if you didn't want to
buy all the different seeds,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.940
you could buy one and just
have the volume be the same.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.620
Or you could use breadcrumbs.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.805
You could do-- pretty
flexible things.

00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:25.405
[SNIFFING]

00:21:27.305 --> 00:21:29.980
These are not-- they're going
to take a little while, I think.

00:21:32.639 --> 00:21:34.180
Some of the other
things I discovered

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.230
while writing this
book is that you

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.688
can use a lot of
the techniques you

00:21:36.688 --> 00:21:39.490
use with meats, like marinating
or pre-salting on vegetables

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:39.990
too.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.130
It works really well.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.960
So with something
like cabbage that's

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.950
so dense, if you salt it ahead
of time, like a few hours,

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.740
it really draws out the flavor.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.680
Same thing, I have a recipe
in there for a squash curry,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.330
where I marinate the squash
in the curry sauce, I guess.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.620
And it really just gets
the flavor in there.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.995
So there are lots of ways to
be creative with vegetables.

00:22:04.995 --> 00:22:06.703
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
that's a great point.

00:22:06.703 --> 00:22:09.040
I think people don't
always think about that.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.440
Like marinating a vegetable
could have the same effect,

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.660
or using the same
spice, like rubs,

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.680
that you might use
on a piece of meat.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.030
You could rub a head of
cauliflower or a cauliflower

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.000
steak and get a
similar taste profile.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.605
That's a pro tip
everybody talks about.

00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:26.230
I think there's a
whole generation that

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.550
did vegetables steamed.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.425
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:22:28.425 --> 00:22:29.800
JENNA TAYLOR: Many
of our parents

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.000
or grandparents kind
of default to that.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.210
And I just think that
there's so much you could do

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.260
in terms of vegetable cookery.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.679
BROOKE LEWY: It's true.

00:22:37.679 --> 00:22:39.970
JENNA TAYLOR: Treat them like
ingredients on their own.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.716
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:41.716 --> 00:22:43.090
So these carrots
are almost good.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.200
They're getting really
nice char marks.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.350
They're getting softer.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.780
You don't want them
to be too hard.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.690
I think our pistachios
are toasted.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.970
They're starting to
smell extra pistachioy.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:01.360
We'll put them back
in their little bowl.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.880
I'll do the
sunflower seeds next.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.539
We'll get those on the grill.

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:07.830
I'm gonna pull the carrots off.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.650
You could plate this up on
a really nice, big platter,

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.290
and it looks very beautiful.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.970
We'll just do an
individual portion.

00:23:25.414 --> 00:23:27.560
And this kind of salad you
don't toss all together.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.640
You layer it.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.320
So you'll see as we build it.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.272
Give our sunflower seeds a toss.

00:23:35.272 --> 00:23:36.605
We'll put these in the bowl too.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.885
And we'll do our pumpkin seeds.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.370
And let those heat up.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.140
JENNA TAYLOR: So what are
your layers going to be?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.340
BROOKE LEWY: We'll do
the layer of the carrots.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.890
And then-- oh, shoot.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:58.630
I forgot to grill my citrus.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:59.410
Sorry.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:04.480
So grilled citrus is another
really good chefy thing.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.080
Once you have your
grill on anyway,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.170
you might as well have
some grilled citrus,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.297
because even if you don't
do anything with it--

00:24:09.297 --> 00:24:09.880
which we will.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.100
We're going to
make the dressing.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.290
It looks really
pretty on the plate.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.500
It looks impressive.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.925
So let's add those.

00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:20.550
I'm doing exactly
what you shouldn't do

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.841
and walking away from my seeds.

00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:23.562
So hopefully they won't burn.

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:25.020
JENNA TAYLOR: We
put that juju out.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:25.619
I don't know.

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:26.160
It might now.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.909
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:28.140
Let's add our citrus on here.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:33.580
right.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.580
So we'll do the carrots.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.829
We'll do avocado, some arugula,
and then all the seeds.

00:24:39.829 --> 00:24:41.620
JENNA TAYLOR: So this
would be a great one,

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.705
like you said, to do
one big family style.

00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:44.580
BROOKE LEWY: Totally.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.512
JENNA TAYLOR: Platter,
barbecuing, or summer picnic.

00:24:47.512 --> 00:24:49.470
BROOKE LEWY: And it's
good at room temperature.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.230
I would say a lot of the
time grilled vegetables are

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.800
kind of best right when they
come off, I think, the grill.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.710
Room temperature vegetables are
leftover and not that great,

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:03.627
but this one is really
good at room temperature.

00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:05.460
So we'll wait for our
sesame seeds to toast.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.275
The citrus doesn't
take very long.

00:25:08.275 --> 00:25:09.900
JENNA TAYLOR: What
are you looking for?

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.437
Just some marks on it?

00:25:11.437 --> 00:25:13.020
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah,
and it kind of gets

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.870
soft and a little caramelized.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:20.449
So as soon as these get
there, I'll show them to you.

00:25:20.449 --> 00:25:21.990
The sesame seeds
are taking on color.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.355
They go faster than anything.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.320
Now they're kind of nutty
smelling, a little more golden

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.107
brown.

00:25:34.107 --> 00:25:35.690
They'll continue
cooking from the heat

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.020
of the pan a little bit, so you
can pull them a little early.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:44.520
That's a good tip, because they
can get burned really fast.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.530
So we have our seeds.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:51.545
We'll add a big pinch of
salt, mix them up a little.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.610
While our citrus is grilling,
we can get our avocado ready.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.120
I think everybody knows
how to cut avocados, right?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.120
JENNA TAYLOR: Carefully?

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.536
BROOKE LEWY: In
California-- yeah.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.440
Pry it open.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.087
And get that out of there.

00:26:16.087 --> 00:26:18.170
So I have to say, since
this is my first cookbook,

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.700
I realized a thing.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.560
That as somebody who
usually only cooks

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.837
the recipes that
have pictures, I

00:26:24.837 --> 00:26:27.170
beg you to look at the recipes
that don't have pictures.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.450
Because they're some
of the best ones.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.800
So I can add this avocado.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.330
JENNA TAYLOR: How do you make
that decision as the cookbook

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:33.830
author?

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.315
Do you get to say like--

00:26:35.315 --> 00:26:36.940
BROOKE LEWY: I wish
it was my decision.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.590
JENNA TAYLOR: --these are
the glamour shots I want.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.870
BROOKE LEWY: No.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.310
JENNA TAYLOR: Highlight
these, publisher.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.518
BROOKE LEWY: Maybe if you're
like Ina Garten, you do.

00:26:42.518 --> 00:26:44.024
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:44.024 --> 00:26:45.440
But if you're me,
they're like, we

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.731
want to shoot these 20 recipes.

00:26:46.731 --> 00:26:47.914
What do you think?

00:26:47.914 --> 00:26:49.830
JENNA TAYLOR: And you
have to say, sure thing!

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.600
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah, basically.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.110
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.920
BROOKE LEWY: I was like,
no, you should really

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.878
shoot these other ones.

00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:54.677
And you know.

00:26:54.677 --> 00:26:56.510
JENNA TAYLOR: But those
are the good sleeper

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.620
hits that, you
know, B-side tracks

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.870
people will come to love.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.390
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah,
and I would say

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.950
that a lot of the
time people ask me

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.205
what my favorite
recipes are in the book,

00:27:06.205 --> 00:27:07.580
and I really loved
the ones where

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.990
I had to learn as I was going.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:11.450
So like the smoked beets,
for example, or the squash

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.590
curry is really cool.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.620
The artichokes I've really--

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.210
that's a great technique.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.090
So this orange is
starting to get there.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:22.590
See?

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.460
It's nice and caramelized
There's brown spots.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.630
It's getting softer.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.090
So we can take this guy off.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.450
The lemons need- and this
lemon is pretty good too.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.710
So let's put these over here.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.110
And in trying to stress the
ease of grilling vegetables,

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.180
even if you took that
lemon and squeezed it

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.680
over your plate of
grilled zucchini,

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.400
it would be better than
if you just left it plain.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.774
So for this dressing, you
let these cool a little bit.

00:27:56.774 --> 00:27:58.315
You can see we're
building our salad.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.850
Again, dressing in
the measuring cup.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.630
Give it a squeeze.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.790
When you grill the lemon--
grill citrus, you also--

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.705
it gives up a lot more juice
than it would otherwise.

00:28:12.705 --> 00:28:14.830
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, I was
going to say, that thing.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:15.610
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:16.860
JENNA TAYLOR: It's impressive.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.980
BROOKE LEWY: And
it makes the citrus

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.850
a little bit less acidic, a
little sweeter and more mellow,

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.684
which is nice.

00:28:27.684 --> 00:28:29.600
This recipe makes more
dressing than you need,

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.141
but it's nice to
use on other salads.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.865
So we'll squeeze
all that in there.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.002
Maybe we'll leave this one on
the plate to be very pretty.

00:28:41.002 --> 00:28:42.460
JENNA TAYLOR:
"Chefy," as you said.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.890
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.430
This one, add some vinegar.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.850
This is apple cider vinegar
to add a little more acidity,

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.850
since the citrus does
get really sweet.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.760
Some salt-- probably
want to do a big pinch.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.260
Pepper.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.210
Whisk it up.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.555
[MIXING]

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.340
It's nice to add a little bit
to dress your greens first.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.481
So usually with greens--

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:10.730
I don't know if you guys know.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.352
The best way to dress a
salad is to salt it first

00:29:13.352 --> 00:29:14.810
before you add any
of the dressing.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.800
So the salt gets
evenly dispersed,

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.230
so it doesn't clump on the
pieces that are the wettest.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.270
That's good.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.020
JENNA TAYLOR:
That's a great tip.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.311
I hadn't heard that one before.

00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:23.680
BROOKE LEWY: Oh, yeah.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.980
It's a good way to go.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.420
That was one of the first
things I learned to Delfina.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.390
So you want to dress your
greens, so they're all dressed.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.480
Your hands work great.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.430
Tongs kind of bruise lettuces.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:42.410
So we'll add the
arugula around--

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.040
sorry.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.740
Pull some of your avocado
and your carrots on top,

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.100
so it's all mixed together.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.420
Add a little more dressing.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.510
Drizzle it over the top.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:06.572
And then, sprinkle
on all your seeds.

00:30:06.572 --> 00:30:07.780
JENNA TAYLOR: It's beautiful.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.360
It smells amazing from
where I'm standing.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.769
I don't know if you guys
are getting it but, whoof.

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:14.560
BROOKE LEWY: So you
can see all the layers.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.518
It does look really
beautiful on a big platter.

00:30:16.518 --> 00:30:19.720
And in each bite, you
get the kind of sweet,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.450
smoky from the carrot, and
the cool avocado, and all

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.405
the crunchy seeds, and
the citrusy dressing.

00:30:25.405 --> 00:30:28.390
And it's just at really
nice, balanced salad.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.930
JENNA TAYLOR: Beautiful.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:30.820
Thank you so much.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.320
BROOKE LEWY: Thank
you guys so much.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.459
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:35.459 --> 00:30:36.667
Thank you.

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:39.280
JENNA TAYLOR: Do you
guys have questions?

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.324
Yeah.

00:30:40.324 --> 00:30:41.740
Is there a particular
marinade you

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.510
recommend that's
especially good with veg?

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.260
BROOKE LEWY: Sure.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.570
I think they mostly all work.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.670
I mean, my favorite
marinades are

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.300
like the lemon, olive oil,
whatever herbs you have,

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.437
works great.

00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:55.270
A chimichurri sauce
works great, because you

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.550
can use it before and after.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.470
Or like a soy, sesame oil,
brown sugar kind of marinade

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.830
also works really well if I
want to go in a more like Asiany

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.780
direction.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:06.877
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:31:06.877 --> 00:31:07.540
You had a question over here?

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.165
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:31:08.165 --> 00:31:09.297
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:09.297 --> 00:31:10.630
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, cool question.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:11.980
So where do you get
your inspiration,

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.354
and how do you as
the cook really

00:31:13.354 --> 00:31:17.650
like learn in the process
of creating recipes?

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.440
BROOKE LEWY: I spent a lot of
time online googling things.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.510
I read a lot of cookbooks
and a lot of food web sites.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.090
And I feel like there's
inspiration everywhere.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.330
Or like the carrot
salad, if I go out to eat

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.160
and I really like
something that I eat,

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.550
kind of trying to figure out
how to recreate it at home

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.034
and then learning how to do it.

00:31:39.034 --> 00:31:40.450
It's just a lot
of trial and error

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:42.970
and cross-referencing
a lot of recipes

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.540
and trying out like, oh, this
technique for smoking potatoes

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.420
works really well.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.630
I wonder if it'll
work for beets too.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:49.990
They have a similar texture.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.610
JENNA TAYLOR: Who's your
favorite food blogger or food

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.110
website?

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.349
What's your go-to?

00:31:54.349 --> 00:31:56.390
BROOKE LEWY: So I have
two little kids right now.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:59.320
So a lot of my cooking
is really simple.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.240
A lot of Smitten
Kitchen recipes--

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.250
they always come out
really, really well.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.870
They're pretty easy.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:05.560
She also has a--

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.150
little kids.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.130
So she feels the insanity.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.501
JENNA TAYLOR: Many
of us do, surely.

00:32:11.501 --> 00:32:12.000
Yeah?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.470
AUDIENCE: What do you to get
your kids to eat vegetables?

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:15.220
JENNA TAYLOR: What
do you do to get

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.386
your kids to eat vegetables?

00:32:16.386 --> 00:32:17.770
Please, please tell me.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.020
BROOKE LEWY: I think that
they don't know what they're

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.850
supposed to like and not like.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.950
So I think if you--

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.070
I've gone so far as to tell
my son roasted brussel sprouts

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.720
are like brussel sprout french
fries, which he kind of-- he

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.429
ate one.

00:32:33.429 --> 00:32:33.970
I don't know.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:34.830
JENNA TAYLOR: He's
like, I don't know.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.220
All right.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:35.820
She's trying.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.190
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.270
But I mean, they don't
know what they're

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.400
supposed to like and not like.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.820
So if you're like, here, try it.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.500
It's delicious.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.782
Then, they're like, OK.

00:32:41.782 --> 00:32:42.740
And they might like it.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.031
They might not like it, but
as long as you treat it all

00:32:45.031 --> 00:32:47.780
like it's all just
food, you know,

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.250
that seems to kind
of work for me.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.330
JENNA TAYLOR: Don't
pre-prejudice them.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:50.450
BROOKE LEWY: It seems to
kind have worked for me.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.912
JENNA TAYLOR:
That's a cool idea.

00:32:50.912 --> 00:32:51.411
I like that.

00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:51.911
I like that.

00:32:51.911 --> 00:32:53.661
BROOKE LEWY: Or my
mother-in-law is always

00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:56.154
like, I can't believe you're
giving him kale or whatever.

00:32:56.154 --> 00:32:57.070
I'm like, he doesn't--

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.390
my son doesn't really eat kale.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.077
But I've made him try it.

00:33:00.077 --> 00:33:00.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:01.270
JENNA TAYLOR: Kale.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.070
BROOKE LEWY: He doesn't know.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.380
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, it's normal.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:02.975
BROOKE LEWY: I don't know.

00:33:02.975 --> 00:33:03.970
JENNA TAYLOR: He doesn't
know it's trendy.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.180
BROOKE LEWY: If you assume
he's not going to like it

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.580
and don't offer it, they're
never going to like it, so.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.080
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
a great approach.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.066
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:33:10.066 --> 00:33:12.220
JENNA TAYLOR: Ooh, what
about grilling avocado?

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.280
BROOKE LEWY: I have for this
salad, and it totally works.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.620
It's just whether you want
more of that the temperature

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.289
contrast or more grill flavor.

00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:22.330
But that's the great thing
about grilling, right?

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.080
You can do-- or
cooking in general--

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.810
you can just do a few--

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:26.360
JENNA TAYLOR:
Totally [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.110
BROOKE LEWY: Grill your avocado.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.017
Yeah.

00:33:28.017 --> 00:33:28.600
And I really--

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.020
JENNA TAYLOR: Sounds yummy.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:29.530
BROOKE LEWY: Oh, sorry.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.030
Yeah.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:33.550
And a lot of these recipes in
this book are pretty flexible.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.770
I give specified amounts
of oil, but really it's

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.052
like, use enough oil to
cook your vegetables.

00:33:38.052 --> 00:33:39.760
Your grill might be
hotter than my grill.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.250
And things might take longer.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.040
Who knows?

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.840
JENNA TAYLOR: Trust yourself.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.940
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah, exactly.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.440
Yeah?

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.595
BROOKE LEWY: How
hot the grill is?

00:33:47.595 --> 00:33:48.040
JENNA TAYLOR: OK, so question.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.320
Do you grill veg at
the same temps as meat,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.300
and do you have
methodology for monitoring

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.480
your grill temperature?

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.480
BROOKE LEWY: There's not
a great way to monitor.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.044
I mean, lots of people say the
hand test, which I have in--

00:33:58.044 --> 00:34:00.210
I put in the book and then
was reading more about it

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.626
and was like, oh,
yeah, of course.

00:34:01.626 --> 00:34:03.850
Everybody has different
pain thresholds.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.350
So that's probably
not the best way,

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.650
even though I wrote it in there.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.471
Vegetables, generally,
are at medium.

00:34:10.471 --> 00:34:11.679
They don't need to be as hot.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.120
I feel like meats
you cook hotter,

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.536
because you really
want that sear.

00:34:14.536 --> 00:34:18.310
And vegetables you need to
be a little more gentle.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:21.284
I would say, again,
test a piece and see

00:34:21.284 --> 00:34:22.659
if it seems like
the right amount

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:25.920
or if you want to wait for
the grill to cool down more.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.670
One thing I would say
that a lot of people

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.800
probably don't realize
is for charcoal grills,

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.550
you want to cook with
the top open mostly.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.925
And with gas grills, you want
to cook with the top closed

00:34:33.925 --> 00:34:34.840
to keep the heat in.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.940
I think a lot of
people get their grill,

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.969
don't read about how
you're supposed to do it,

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.323
and just cook with it open.

00:34:41.323 --> 00:34:43.239
And people will stand
there at their gas grill

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.340
like, why the hell
isn't anything cooking?

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.030
And that's why.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.594
You have to cook with the top
closed as much as you can.

00:34:49.594 --> 00:34:50.094
Yeah.

00:34:50.094 --> 00:34:51.080
AUDIENCE: And why
would you do that?

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.960
BROOKE LEWY: To allow
more air to circulate.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.667
So the way the heat goes is
different between the two.

00:34:56.667 --> 00:34:57.650
Yeah.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:58.150
What's that?

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.690
AUDIENCE: It's delicious.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:59.690
BROOKE LEWY: Oh, thanks.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.540
JENNA TAYLOR: Survey
says, super yummy.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:02.290
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:04.750
JENNA TAYLOR: And the
carrot dish is vegan.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.970
The peppers are vegetarian.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:08.256
Did you have a question?

00:35:08.256 --> 00:35:09.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:09.970
BROOKE LEWY: Cooking mushrooms?

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:10.840
JENNA TAYLOR: What
types of mushrooms

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.950
are best on the grill?

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.967
BROOKE LEWY: They're all
really good, honestly.

00:35:13.967 --> 00:35:15.550
I would definitely
use a grill basket.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:19.060
Mushrooms are hard
to get to stay.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.870
I know portobellos are classic
as the veggie alternative.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.520
I also think they're
kind of bland.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.020
Sorry.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.603
JENNA TAYLOR:
Marinated-- that's where

00:35:27.603 --> 00:35:29.040
I've applied marinating veggie.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.148
BROOKE LEWY: It's true.

00:35:29.148 --> 00:35:30.880
JENNA TAYLOR: Like a marinated
portobello can be good,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.410
but on their own, I mean, yeah.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:32.640
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.681
JENNA TAYLOR: Especially
if you are presenting it

00:35:34.681 --> 00:35:36.880
as a hamburger alternative.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.689
So your vegetarian friend, like,
do something to it, please.

00:35:39.689 --> 00:35:41.230
BROOKE LEWY: But in
the book, there's

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.826
a recipe for mixed
vegetable spring rolls.

00:35:43.826 --> 00:35:44.580
JENNA TAYLOR: Yum.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.246
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah,
that are really good.

00:35:46.246 --> 00:35:48.720
And you just use any
type of mushroom.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.650
For mushrooms, you
can use higher heat.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:52.840
And it releases that water.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.214
And just season
them really well.

00:35:54.214 --> 00:35:56.831
And really, any kind
is very delicious.

00:35:56.831 --> 00:35:57.706
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:57.706 --> 00:35:59.380
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
grilling indoors--

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.666
how do you decide what you do?

00:36:00.666 --> 00:36:03.040
BROOKE LEWY: It kind of depends
on what kind of vegetable

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.340
it is.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.631
So if you're just looking
for that sear on the outside,

00:36:05.631 --> 00:36:06.970
I would use a grill pan.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.310
If you're looking to cook
the vegetable through,

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:10.770
like the carrot--

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.280
or the peppers,
actually, I would

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.230
either roast it at a high
heat or use the broiler.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.500
And every recipe in the
book has the suggestion

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.219
for how I would--

00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:18.760
how I would--

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.676
JENNA TAYLOR: Perfect.

00:36:19.676 --> 00:36:21.270
Perfect.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:22.110
BROOKE LEWY: Yeah.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.110
JENNA TAYLOR: Excellent.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.580
Well, I thank you so much.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.330
BROOKE LEWY: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:25.870
JENNA TAYLOR: It was
so fun, and I love it.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.036
Right now, I can't wait to
go to the farmer's market

00:36:28.036 --> 00:36:30.920
this weekend and get a bunch
of stuff and grill it all up.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.590
So thank you, and
hopefully, you'll

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:33.730
come back and see us again.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.480
BROOKE LEWY: I would love that.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:34.979
Thank you.

00:36:34.979 --> 00:36:37.570
JENNA TAYLOR: They're all
eating, but I'll [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.653
BROOKE LEWY: Thanks, guys.

00:36:38.653 --> 00:36:40.920
[APPLAUSE]
