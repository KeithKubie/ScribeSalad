[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.150
SAI PRASAD: So very
quickly, my name is Sai.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.000
And what I'm going
to do today to start

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.906
is I'm going to run you all
through a very small story.

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:17.910
I'm not going to bore you all
with a talk on disability,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.950
accessibility,
inclusivity, and all that.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.190
Because not many
people are affected,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.830
except the disabled
people segment.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.380
But I'll run you through
a journey of my life.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.700
And probably there will
be a few key takeaways.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.650
And that's something that
you could be interested in.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.840
So to begin with, it
all started in 1984

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.720
when a couple in South
India fell in love.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.390
They got married,
and then I happened.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.000
And when it
happened, obviously I

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.435
had this additional
growth in spinal cord.

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:53.080
The doctors did not
know how to operate.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.860
And things got messed up.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.130
And there you go.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.830
I ended up with disability.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.940
The fun part about that is that
I never knew what being normal

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.690
was.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.740
So effectively, for me
to know what normal is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.940
isn't even there in my mindset.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.180
But the aspect that I was
born with a disability

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.730
came in much later in life.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.940
I believe that there are new
terms out here these days

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.300
calling disabled people
as physically challenged

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.960
or differently abled.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.586
If you are calling
a disabled person

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.960
as physically
challenged, it's as

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.510
if you're calling a single
person romantically challenged.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.135
It's actually not going to make
any difference in that person's

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:35.040
life whatsoever.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.740
Some people also say
disability is a state of mind.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.810
But imagine if I was
in college, and I'm

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.300
looking at three floors.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.466
And I have to climb
all the three floors.

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.840
And someone says,
hey, disability

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.930
is just a state of mind.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.760
You can still climb
the three floors.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.430
I'm basically getting nowhere
at the end of the day.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.620
So under these circumstances,
my life took a drastic turn.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.310
And this is what I'm going
to run you through, you all.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.340
So in 1984, when I was
born with this disability,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.740
it was very challenging
for my father.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.770
My mom and dad didn't have
much of a formal education.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.889
So it became really
difficult for them

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.070
on how do they bring
up a child like me.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.060
There was no terms
like inclusivity,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.790
accessibility, back then.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.290
And a lot of people
believed that it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.140
was sheer bad karma
in previous life

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.840
that they got blessed
with a child like me.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.965
But my dad did something
really interesting

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:29.340
at that particular
point of time.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.800
Unable to take the
pressure that comes

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.330
with having a child
with disability,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.990
he decided that he will
actually move out of the state.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.730
He worked for Indian Railways.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.290
He applied for a transfer.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.990
And we moved to Andhra Pradesh.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.826
This is even more
problematic because moving

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:46.200
from Tamil Nadu
to Andhra Pradesh

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.350
means my mom right now
has a language barrier.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.390
And she's with this kid.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.250
And nobody knows how my
life will turn out to be.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.030
And it's all pretty
messed up enough.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.970
Throughout all this, we also
belonged to a typical lower

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.900
middle class family.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.420
So effectively, while physical
disability is one challenge,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.470
lack of finances is a completely
different ballgame altogether.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.230
So if I get a fever, or if
I go through something which

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.830
will involve a
medical procedure,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.360
not only is that
emotional torture,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.320
but it is also going to
be a financial challenge.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.550
But across all these
challenges, what kept me

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.460
going was that I was not
even aware of my disability.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.530
Because when you're
four or six years old,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.630
you just don't know
that you are disabled.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.960
You just want to go out there,
play, have fun, and all that.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.520
But the one thing
that transformed

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.420
my life was my dad's thought
that the only way out of all

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.920
the ills that are
going to come down

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.280
to me because of my disability
was through education.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.170
He strongly believed
that education

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.780
was going to bring me
out of the challenges

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.130
that I'm going to face.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.090
And he tried to put
me into schools.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.090
And when he put me into
schools, the problem

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.190
was not that I had a disability.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.590
The problem came from the
parents of other children.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.520
Because they started to believe
that if their kid studies along

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.860
with me, then they
would mimic my habits.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.600
Some of them in turn
believed that some

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.190
of the disability aspects that
I have were probably contagious.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.769
And therefore, their children
will end up suffering.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.529
So they would politely go and
tell the principal and college

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.810
administrators that they
don't want me in the class.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.810
The college principal
will call over my parents.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.540
And every year, this
used to be a routine.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.330
So over eight years, I
had changed almost seven

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.530
to nine schools.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.030
As a result, I was never
properly adapted to one place.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.400
But the good part of it is
I had plenty of friends.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.890
Or, at least I
thought I knew people.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.800
So eventually, I moved
on to 10th class.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.430
And I promised my dad
that, you know, Dad?

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.410
Whatever happens
in class 10th, I

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.920
will definitely get state first
rank in the public entrance

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.106
examination.

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:56.730
The fun part about that promise
was that when the results came,

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.010
I got first, but
from the bottom.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.640
Basically, I passed
essentially with one mark.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.761
I couldn't-- I basically scored
60% on my overall 10th class

00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:08.260
exam.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.420
And when the results came
on the computer screen,

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.920
my dad was shocked.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.540
My mom started to cry.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.440
My sister wanted to disown me.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.970
And I was pretty much happy
that I basically passed.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.100
So after that, when I told my
dad that I wanted to pursue

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.020
[INAUDIBLE] and all, he
just looked at me and said,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.540
you just passed
12th class barely.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.440
That's enough for us.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.340
So I moved on to
class 11, class 12.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.790
And the interesting aspect
about those two years

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.400
was that I, for the
very first time,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.920
saw that my parents
were disappointed in me.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.610
Think of it.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.920
A lot of time, for us
Indians, the motivation

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.980
comes from two reasons.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.110
One, out of passion.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.890
The other reason is our
parents are disappointed in us.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.030
It's like half the
life for us goes off

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.090
in proving to them that
we are worth [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.090
So effectively, my teachers
were very happy after 10th class

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.160
that this fellow
even passed the exam.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.110
But my parents
were disappointed.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.170
For the very first
time in life, I

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.300
felt that someone had
expectations on me.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.530
And unlike expectations creating
pressure, I actually felt good.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.630
Because I was not
just hopeless case.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.950
Hopeless cases are two types.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.710
One, you don't have
hope on yourself.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.770
Number two, others
don't have hope on you.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.630
So effectively, I
was very, very happy

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.790
that my parents were
actually disappointed.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.770
Because they still
had hope on me.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.350
But somehow, when I sat down to
study, nothing went into head.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.690
Every day to the college, my
mom would take me up on a cycle.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.460
In front of the
entire colony, she

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.140
would kind of put
me on the cycle

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.970
and just drive me to college.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.200
Then, exactly at 4 o'clock,
she would be there,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.080
then bring me up back to house.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.760
And she did that for exactly
750 times, like two years.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.860
And even then when I
read physics, chemistry,

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.240
nothing went into head.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.580
And I was cricket crazy.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.000
That was the irony
of life, right?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.420
God kind of gives you
passion for something

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.530
but doesn't give you
the talent for the same.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.340
And that's where we want to
plug the gap with effort.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.620
So effectively, I
was cricket crazy.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.170
Half the time, I used to
watch cricket matches.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.890
And one fine day,
somewhere in 2001,

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.100
there was this particular moment
where my dad was threatening me

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.121
that, I'll literally break the
TV if you don't go and study

00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:17.620
right now.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.640
And I told him, Dad, I
promise you I'll study.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.920
Let Rahul Dravid get out,
and I will study for sure.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.790
And that was a fateful day
because Rahul Dravid not only

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.370
batted that day, but he batted
for three continuous days

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.930
in that Kolkata Test match.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.420
And I never got to study
for those three days.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.890
But as he kept batting
and batting and batting,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.790
I realized one thing.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.430
He was a frustrating guy.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.010
He's not an extremely
talented guy.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.600
He was not the
Sachin of their team.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.820
But he was a guy who
would never get out.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.131
I mean, when he gets
out, India is happy.

00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:48.880
Just imagine that.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.940
Like, when Dravid
gets out, people

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.350
cheer because Sachin is
going to come down next.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.740
And if our own team is
happy that he's getting out,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.780
imagine what the
opposition would feel.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.670
So effectively, that
particular moment,

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.160
I realized that
maybe I might not

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.785
be able to hang
around and be talented

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:07.440
like Sachin and my subjects.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.030
But I'll hang around and
study and get frustrated

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.070
with physics and chemistry and
all those subjects like Dravid

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.750
would.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.270
So I started to study for
the first time in life.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.770
I kind of, let's say,
rectified some of the subjects

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.830
and then kind of picked up
the logic in mathematics.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.530
And when the eventual
results came,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.250
I secured 942nd rank in the
state engineering entrance

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.039
exam, with state first in
the physically handicapped

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.250
category.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.760
Now, when I secured the state
first rank in the physically

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.150
handicapped category, my mom did
marketing in the entire colony.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.442
She was like, my
son got state first.

00:08:42.442 --> 00:08:43.400
My son got state first.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.560
My son got state first.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.640
And within about 15 minutes,
the entire colony knew.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.390
And I started to believe that
every engineering college

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.680
seat belongs to me.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.900
Because at the end of the
day, I had the reservation.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.720
And I thought, OK, now my life
is almost going to be set.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.450
So when we eventually
went to counseling,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.940
this was the funny part.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.740
If you all watched
this movie called

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.990
"Inception," where
Christopher Nolan comes up

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.120
with this concept called
dream within dream,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.760
our government came up with
this concept called reservation

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.950
within reservation long back.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.750
And I was not aware of it.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.000
So I was state first
rank in physically

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.920
handicapped category.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.470
But I was state first
physically handicapped with OC.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.740
The reservation was
split back then based

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.340
on the principles of not
only physically handicapped,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.760
but also physically handicapped
and again on the cost basis.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.980
So effectively, the
dream was to study.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.050
It was Osmania University,
computer science.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.330
The system put me
into CBIT College,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.660
at electrical
engineering department.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.990
That change in
college introduced me

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.310
to one great person.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.287
Because if you know
where this college is,

00:09:51.287 --> 00:09:52.870
this is literally
on-site opportunity.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.220
So every day, you have
to travel literally 60,

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.700
70 kilometers to even
go to the college.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.150
And on the day I took
the seat in this college

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.680
and went back home, I met
the first villain of my life.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.462
Now, every life has a villain.

00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:07.170
And I finally met the
villain of my life.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.830
The villain of the life was the
next-door auntie to my house.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.700
The day I got back to the house,
she was there waiting for me.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.210
And she was like, you know,
Sai, did you take the seat?

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.990
And I was like, yeah,
I took the seat.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.070
And she was like, which college?

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.740
And I said, CBIT.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.450
And she was like, where is it?

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.570
And I said, it's there
somewhere only in the city.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.754
And she started to rag me.

00:10:32.754 --> 00:10:34.420
She was like, you
know, how will you go?

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.480
Will you be able
to climb the bus?

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.370
Will all these things
work out for you?

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.170
Why are you going
off troubling people

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.850
like this and all that stuff?

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.890
In five minutes,
in this where there

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.645
was no R code, no
Facebook, no Twitter,

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:49.020
this auntie followed my life.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.045
And she kind of kept
an up-to-date event of,

00:10:52.045 --> 00:10:53.670
what are the events
that are happening?

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.830
So when she realized
that my family was

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.410
going to have a tough time
with me getting educated

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.960
in an engineering college daily,
she put a status on Facebook

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.040
in her community
saying, this family

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.340
is going to suffer for
the next four years.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.910
Then, 15 aunties
commented on it.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.110
30 aunties shared it.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.685
And within no time
in our colony,

00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:13.650
we had become the
family that was going

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.520
to have a rough ride all over.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.950
But those four years were rough.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.130
Somehow, I managed to graduate.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.320
I was-- one of the
advantages of being

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.880
a disabled person is that
there is so much focus that you

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.470
can put on only few events.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.380
Because there are only few
events which you can focus on.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.550
So effectively, my
restriction in mobility

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.850
allowed me to become a good
reader over a period of time.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.780
I started to focus
on my education.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.029
My dad had insisted
that if at all I am ever

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:48.570
going to succeed in
life, it is going

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.360
to be through education only.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.410
And repeatedly hearing
that statement and advice

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.640
kind of over time molded me into
a person who strongly started

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.840
to believe in my dad's view.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.449
I read this meme
earlier today saying

00:12:03.449 --> 00:12:05.490
that when you repeat a
lie enough number of times

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.400
and loudly enough, people
will start to believe it.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.290
The same also holds
good with truth.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.420
When you repeat a truth
enough number of times

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.596
and say it loudly enough,
people will start to believe it.

00:12:15.596 --> 00:12:17.470
And that's what I started
to believe as well.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.520
I started to believe that my
education will kind of bring me

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.360
out of all troubles.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.500
So I worked hard,
graduated again

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.530
at the top of the
university at CBIT.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.610
And in the moment, where
I was getting placed,

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.560
I got placed with Infosys.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.980
And finally, when I got
placed with Infosys,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.870
Infosys asked me to move
to Mysore for training.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.370
Now, here was a guy who,
for almost 20, 22 years,

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.600
lived with his family.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.900
Every activity of his life was
taken care of by his parents.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.580
So when I suddenly
moved to Infosys,

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.950
I experienced what
freedom was like.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.250
I was happy that Infosys was not
allowing parents into campus.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.990
If they did, my parents would
have stayed there as well.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.760
So finally, I got
hold of a wheelchair.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.170
I lived there for four months.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.120
And everything was going
great until one fine day,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.500
I met the HR.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.670
And there was this particular
conversation I had with him.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.340
And he said, you know what, Sai?

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.540
The postings have come out.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.220
And you're going to
get posted to Pune.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.160
Now, that was a shocker
for me because I was

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.080
expecting posting in Hyderabad.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.770
So effectively, I told him, sir,
I don't want posting to Pune.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.380
And then he said, why?

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.910
So I said, I have
this disability.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.350
And I can't take care of myself.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.670
So you know what?

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.650
Why don't you give me
a posting to Hyderabad?

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.620
And then he looked at
me straight on the face.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.820
And he said, you know what?

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.620
If Pune was Paris,
wouldn't you go?

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.870
And then I looked at him back.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.850
And I said, but
Pune is not Paris.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.960
So effectively, I much later
realized that that's not

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.234
how you talk to HRs.

00:13:53.234 --> 00:13:54.650
But, you know,
when you are young,

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:59.080
and the blood is flowing in
you, that's how you talk.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.810
Then, he looked back at me.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.470
And he said, you know, in a 30
years long corporate career,

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.650
one or two years here and
there should not matter.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.150
So go.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.580
So I just couldn't take that.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.730
I had this huge ego back
then, believing that I

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.990
was the top of my college.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.300
And therefore, I have
a right to whatever

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.120
posting that I want-- silly
thoughts that go on in head.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.420
So in an emotional moment,
in a very emotional moment,

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.450
I typed an email which
was a resignation email.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.690
And I clicked on send.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:30.900
Outlook sent it.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.810
I had no idea back then
of the consequences of it.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.800
The shocking part was that
the HR actually accepted it.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.030
And there you go.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.490
Within four months of
my getting into Infosys,

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.161
I was out of the job.

00:14:43.161 --> 00:14:45.660
Now, the bigger challenge was,
how do I tell this to my dad?

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.790
Because here I was, just
finished the training.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.276
How do I go and tell my
dad that, you know what?

00:14:50.276 --> 00:14:51.505
OK.

00:14:51.505 --> 00:14:54.242
And in that moment,
I needed ideas.

00:14:54.242 --> 00:14:56.700
So I looked at the inspiration
of our entire country, which

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.320
is Mahatma Gandhi.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.874
Now, Gandhi wrote a letter
to his father saying,

00:15:01.874 --> 00:15:03.540
you know, this is
what happened in life.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.340
And Gandhi's father forgave him.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.040
I thought the same approach
will work for me also.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.080
So I wrote a nice
letter, telling my dad

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.540
that stuff happened.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.890
So stuff must happen
going forward.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.880
So we have to do
stuff in between.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.880
And when he read the
letter, he didn't cry.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.590
He made the other person cry.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.320
So effectively, there
was a big fight in house.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.610
Dad was scolding Mom.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.470
When Dad scolds Mom, Mom cries.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.685
When Mom cries, sister cries.

00:15:29.685 --> 00:15:31.710
When sister cries,
Dad gets angry more.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.100
This is called avalanche
effect basically, no?

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.930
And this was going on
crazy back in life.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.560
And at one emotional moment,
I finally told my dad,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.550
you know what?

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.710
I have figured this out.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.530
When I lived in Infosys, I could
survive there for four months

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.920
because the wheelchair
was accessible--

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.400
the very first time I used
the word accessible in life.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.100
Literally, it took me
23 years to tell my dad

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.560
that that place was accessible.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.620
I survived there.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.495
I think I will go
abroad and study.

00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:03.810
The moment I said
that, Dad laughed.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.610
And then I said,
Dad, I am serious.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.950
And then, he got serious.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.500
So I said-- I laughed.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.930
And then I said, you know what?

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.370
I was just kidding around.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.390
But that's just an idea.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.660
So on one other fine day,
I went to this kitchen

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.050
where my mom was cooking.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.560
And I said, ma, do you think
going abroad and studying

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.700
would be a good idea?

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.750
And she got emotional.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.000
And she was like, would
you leave me and go?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.250
Can you survive and all that?

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.490
Why is life like this?

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.380
I think Shani period is running
for you and all that stuff.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.950
So she was like, let's go
and meet an astrologer.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.850
And I was like, where is that
coming into picture right now?

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.840
So I really had no clue
what to do back then.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.350
So I started with a
step-by-step approach.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.450
I told my dad that,
you know what?

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.020
I'll search for a new job.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.530
But one condition, let
me just try the GRE exam.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.660
Let's just have that as
a backup option and see.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.010
So effectively, my dad agreed.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.770
I started to take the GRE exam.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.000
And then, once the
GRE exam got cleared,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.590
and I scored really well
on that, I went to my dad

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.640
and said, you know what?

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.599
A lot of my friends who
went abroad are doing well.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.250
It is not that I want to go.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.890
It's just that I want to admit
so that I can tell people

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.569
it was my choice not to go.

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.240
Because right now, when I
tell people that I did not go,

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.005
they are thinking that, who
even gave you that first to go

00:17:18.005 --> 00:17:18.810
and all that stuff?

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.730
So then he said, OK, apply
to about three universities.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.670
So I applied to three
universities in all--

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.520
Stanford, Wisconsin-Madison,
Texas A&amp;M, College Station.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.910
All the three universities
gave the admit back then.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.896
And I was shellshocked.

00:17:33.896 --> 00:17:35.520
Because how the hell
did they admit me?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.550
I thought the IQ of the school
fell down by almost 10 points

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.860
the day I got the admit.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.950
But when I saw the admit,
I was really happy.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.090
So I went to my dad.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.790
And I said-- now the
ultimate talk had to happen.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.280
So I told him, we
have come this far.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.840
Can we make the
leap going forward?

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.370
So when I look back
at that moment,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.860
I felt that that was
a transitional point.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.570
Because large ideas,
when you tell people,

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.710
it'll be extremely stupid.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.050
To give you kind of
a context to this,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.480
this is back in the freshers
party in our college.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.730
There were two kinds of
freshers party in our college.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.586
One was the management freshers
and the actual freshers party.

00:18:14.586 --> 00:18:15.960
Management freshers
is like where

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.450
they give one Sprite,
one samosa and say

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.250
how great the college is.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.070
The actual freshers
is where the seniors

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.500
invited all the juniors.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.150
And there were three rounds
to that freshers party.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.760
The first round was
the introduction round.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.950
The second round was
the proposal round.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.710
The third round was
the dance round.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.840
To make it into the dance
round, what we had to do

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.990
was give a very good
introduction of ourselves.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:40.910
And in the proposal
round, every guy

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.920
had to propose to
a girl with a rose.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.130
And she had to
kind of accept it.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.070
And only if she accepts, we
make it into the dance round.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.040
When the rules were
announced, me and my friend

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.390
were shellshocked.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.510
Because we knew that we were the
[INAUDIBLE] boys of the class.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.000
And if we take a rose and get
onstage and call a female up,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.700
she will be like, did
this fellow just seriously

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.250
think that I am the one
for him and all that stuff?

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.850
So effectively, as
me and my friend

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.950
sat down and wondered,
what the hell should we do,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.870
my friend started to laugh.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.400
And I was like, what happened?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.230
And then he said, idea.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.990
And whenever a friend
says idea, do not trust.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.330
But at that point, I was naive.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.663
So effectively, I looked at him.

00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:21.660
And I asked him,
what's the idea?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.100
Then he said, you
know what, Sai?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.300
Go and propose to the most
beautiful girl in the class.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.810
And I was like, are you crazy?

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.500
And he was like, yeah, trust me.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.900
Go and propose to the most
beautiful girl in the class.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.608
And I was like, what's
the point of that?

00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:36.330
She'll reject.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.800
And then he said,
that's the point.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.080
When you have to take a
risk, take a maximum risk.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.080
When you take a risk,
take a maximum risk.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.850
If it works out, that's it.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.320
You can do festival.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.090
But if it doesn't
work out, nobody even

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.890
expected it to work out.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.150
So everybody will say
that the girl was problem.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.600
So the idea looked good.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.720
But I also had to take a rose
and convince the female out.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.240
So I took a rose, went to her.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.530
And I said, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
and all that stuff.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.620
And it didn't work out.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.400
But much later, when I was
sitting down with my dad,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.560
I told him, you know what, Dad?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.920
We are taking a risk.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.500
But if it works, great.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.590
It doesn't work, at least
I'll become a lecturer.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.560
So when we are taking a risk,
let's take maximum risk.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.940
Finally, he said,
OK, let's take this.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.580
The moment he made the
decision to support me,

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.010
that was the point where
I also thanked him.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.960
And I said, there
was a point in life

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.910
where he was convincing me
that I should get educated.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.460
Here was a point
in life where I was

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.230
trying to convince
him back, saying

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.090
I need education for myself.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.330
And then he said, OK, all these
sentimental lilacs are good.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.120
But figure out how we are going
to take care of the finances.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.010
But on that day when
he got convinced,

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.120
and he started to tell
relatives and other people

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.310
that we have decided
to send our son abroad,

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.410
was that a madness began.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.774
Because people were
like, are you crazy?

00:20:59.774 --> 00:21:01.690
How would you be able
to send your son abroad?

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.920
He cannot even climb
a bus in the city.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.670
How do you think he's going to
live abroad and all that stuff?

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.960
My mom started to become
emotionally very weak.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.120
So I made her sat next to
YouTube, made her watch videos,

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.640
showed her how US is
accessible and much more

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.890
friendly to people
there, and tried

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.280
to do a lot of convincing.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.600
But it didn't work out.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.090
That was also the point
where a lot of people

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.350
actually questioned me.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.510
They started throwing
Sanskrit quotations,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:33.070
like [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] They
started to say things like,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.807
because your time is bad, you're
getting thoughts like this.

00:21:35.807 --> 00:21:37.390
Some other people
were like, you know,

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.310
you had a wonderful
job with Infosys.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.710
Why quit that and
trouble your parents?

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.770
Some people even went
to an extreme extent.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.311
They were like, you
know, your sister

00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:48.250
won't get married if you are
doing all this crazy stuff.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.610
And yet, at that moment, I
was really, really focused

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.080
on the education.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.670
And there was this
big problem on,

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.240
how do I generate the
finances to study?

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.160
So me and my crazy
friend, we started

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.120
to roam around all the NGOs.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.400
We kind of showed
them our offer letter.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.980
And we kind of
said, you know what?

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.350
I have this admit from
Stanford and Wisconsin.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.960
If you can go ahead
and sponsor us,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.690
at least for the first semester,
it would be really helpful.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.660
We roamed around
every NGO in the city.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.060
At the end of the day, the
only one thing that we got

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.950
was the petrol bill
for the scooty.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.290
So effectively,
nothing worked out.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.190
And then I was really depressed.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.044
I was fighting at
home every day.

00:22:27.044 --> 00:22:28.710
And then one fine
day, my friend called.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.790
And he said, idea.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.370
And I was like, OK,
what is your idea?

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.000
And he said, let's
approach the media.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.090
So as if that was not enough,
we approached the media,

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.090
and enough that we couldn't even
get through the security gate.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.940
So we stood outside the security
guard for "The Hindu" newspaper

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.007
one fine day.

00:22:47.007 --> 00:22:49.090
We started standing outside
around like 11 o'clock

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:49.960
in the morning.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.120
Roughly around 3 o'clock,
one guy came out.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.890
And as he came
out, we said, sir,

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.000
I have an admit at this
particular university.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.670
So would you like to write
an article about us--

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:01.557
about me?

00:23:01.557 --> 00:23:03.140
And then he was like,
which university

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.780
did you get an admit in?

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.440
And then I said, I got the
admit in Wisconsin and Stanford.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.630
Would you go ahead
and write the article?

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.630
Then, he said, everybody
gets an admit for MSDs.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.740
Just what's the big deal?

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.690
Then, my friend had
enough presence of mind.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:18.680
He said, sir, but this
guy's handicapped.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.630
So this was at that
moment a begging moment.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.680
So we were literally selling
our disability for an article.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.102
And then that guy was shocked.

00:23:25.102 --> 00:23:26.810
And he was like, are
you really disabled?

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.226
And I was like, do you want
me to walk and show right now?

00:23:29.226 --> 00:23:33.300
And effectively, he
took the interview.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.550
And next day morning,
even as I was waking up,

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.660
there was a huge noise
outside the house.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.430
And inside the house,
whistles were flying.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.560
And I was like, what
the hell just happened?

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.290
So as I woke up
and was wondering

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.540
what actually happened, I
looked at-- my dad gave me

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.800
the newspaper.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.660
"The Hindu"
newspaper, front page,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.090
below portion, there was
this beautiful article

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.690
called "Physically Handicapped,
but Mentally Tough"

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.550
with my photograph in it.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.420
That was not the problem.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.890
The problem was the article
quoted my dad's salary.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.140
And it said, this person's
salary is this much.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.050
And therefore, he's not
able to kind of progress.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.570
Therefore, if any kindhearted
soul is there, please sponsor.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.190
That was also not the problem.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.000
The problem was old villain
read this newspaper.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.660
And effectively, she asked my
mother early in the morning,

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.090
is your husband's
salary this much only?

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.470
And this was an evil hurt.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.040
So effectively, there was this
huge fight going on in house.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.899
And effectively, all over
again avalanche effect

00:24:33.899 --> 00:24:36.440
because my dad was like, when
did you even give this article?

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.280
Do you even have an
idea what happens

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.790
if you kind of pitch to the
media and stuff like that?

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:44.470
The TV remote broke because
I threw it on the floor

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.510
in anger and all that stuff.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.790
Literally, I started
to feel guilty.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.770
At one point, I just
wanted to get the hell out

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.730
of the country.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.060
Finally, we started an
entrepreneurial venture.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.740
And we kind of made some money.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.950
I generated some
money to kind of cover

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:04.060
for the first semester expenses,
and started to go to the US,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.630
and started pursuing
my education abroad.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.370
In the first year at Wisconsin--

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:13.030
I took up Wisconsin because
it was much less expensive.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.070
And they offered me the
computer science course.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.620
So effectively, when
I started my course

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:22.000
on the very first day,
September 19, 2007,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.060
the day I landed in Chicago,
a fantastic event happened.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.560
Lehman Brothers collapsed.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.390
So the world went
into recession.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.800
So effectively, when
I [INAUDIBLE] Shani

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.410
period together happened.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.970
So effectively, I
just didn't know

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.770
how that will impact my life.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.710
What happened was the dollar
value went up by four rupees.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:42.270
And that means the fee
increased like crazy.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.480
And on top of that,
I thought the US

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.810
is what we see in MTV
or anything like that.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.780
But I chose a place
where it snows.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.200
I thought I would choose that
place because snow is cool.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.540
Then, I realized
first snow is cold.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.050
Second problem was I thought
when there is a lot of snow,

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:04.560
everybody faces
difficulty to move around.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.320
I, by default, face
difficulty to move around.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.250
So it would kind
of get nullified.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.490
Much later, I realized that
everybody has a way around it.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.160
I don't.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.550
Because when I use
my manual wheelchair,

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.440
on the snow-filled
area, it's going

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.360
to become literally crazy.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.950
So on one fine day, I
got caught up in snow.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.152
I collapsed because
of hypothermia.

00:26:25.152 --> 00:26:26.860
And then when I woke
up, it was literally

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.710
two days later in a hospital,
along with a $15,000 bill.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.820
And I was probably at the
lowest point in my life.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.300
Looking back, I don't know what
kind of kept me going then.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.150
I would just say that at that
particular point of time,

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.040
I was sick and tired of life.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.110
There was-- there is
always a point in life

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:48.280
where, no matter how hard you
try, everything falls apart.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.010
At that moment, some
people break forever.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.360
Some people become numb.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.040
They become like Joker.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.900
They'll be like, you know, I
want to do something chaotic.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.310
And I just decided to
continue my education

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.990
at that particular point.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.120
Over a period of time,
scholarship opportunities

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:04.670
opened up.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.430
I cracked through
the scholarship

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.500
and somehow graduated
again top of the class

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.570
in Wisconsin-Madison.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.670
Now, here was the
interesting aspect.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.470
When I went through
all this struggle,

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.490
and I could graduate
top of the class,

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.430
I wanted to make a fantastic
video showing people

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.880
that any person can
overcome the odds.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.720
And they need not
struggle so much.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.590
And so much of perception
hurts should not have happened.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.980
So I made this
fantastic video in which

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.410
I showed what are the
facilities available for people

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:39.280
with disabilities in the US,
how the education system there

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.420
is different from the
education system here.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.802
I showed how accessibility is
important and not reservation.

00:27:45.802 --> 00:27:47.260
Because in our
country, reservation

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.968
is provided for people
with disabilities.

00:27:48.968 --> 00:27:51.460
Reservation for people with
disabilities is like telling,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.650
you know what?

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.900
We give you 3%
reservation, which

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.200
means that if
there is a college,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.660
and the college has stairs,
and you are facing a challenge

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.240
to climb those
stairs, well, climb

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.540
the stairs no matter what.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.940
But if you get
low marks, I still

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.470
kind of give you the admit.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.200
It just does not make sense
that you solve the disability

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.440
problem with a reservation.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.939
You need to solve the disability
problem with accessibility.

00:28:14.939 --> 00:28:17.130
So I made a fantastic
video explaining this

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.060
and put it on YouTube.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.590
Two people watched it--

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.890
me, my friend.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.890
OK, my friend gave up halfway.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:28.500
So effectively, I was like,
what the hell just happened?

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.810
And I tried to promote that
video as much as possible.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.400
And nothing worked out.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.500
So on that fateful day,
I was a little low.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.160
And when I was going back,
and my mother's birthday

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.250
was coming up--

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.190
and when my mom's
birthday was coming up,

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.960
I'd never missed celebrating
her birthday at any time.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.590
So this time, I wanted to
celebrate it in a very big way.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.980
And since I was just about
to graduate, I decided--

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.910
I saw this ad for skydiving.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.850
So when me and my
friend were there

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.119
standing next to each
other, my friend said, idea.

00:28:57.119 --> 00:28:58.660
And I was like, OK,
what's your idea?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.430
And he said, you know what?

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.090
Get on top of the plane.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.949
Let's take the flight to 14,000
feet, jump out of the flight,

00:29:05.949 --> 00:29:07.490
and then wish your
mom happy birthday

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.250
in front of the whole world.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.440
So the idea looked good.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.010
In an emotional moment, I paid.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.380
On top of the flight,
when I wanted to jump,

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.287
I jumped, but because I paid.

00:29:19.287 --> 00:29:21.370
Primarily because if I
hadn't jumped out of there,

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.320
and my dad came to know it,
he would have pushed me.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.819
He would have called
the flight back

00:29:24.819 --> 00:29:26.770
and said, jump all over again.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.530
When I was in the
midair, I had forgotten

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.820
that it was my mom's birthday.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.027
Because I had to get down.

00:29:33.027 --> 00:29:35.110
Because my mom's birthday
would have been probably

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.560
my death day.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.790
And I also realized that
normally when people skydive,

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.320
and they get land, they
land on their feet and walk.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.190
Whereas with me,
the legs were tied.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.795
Because I cannot land.

00:29:46.795 --> 00:29:49.950
And before landing in, I had
to bend down, pull the legs

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.280
upwards, and land on my back.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.270
And we had no idea how
this was going to work out.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.490
But that's what you do when
you're emotional, stupid,

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:58.820
and younger.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.870
And finally, when we
kind of took the risk,

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:06.400
came down, and landed, my
friend had enough common sense

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.230
to put an Indian
flag in my hand.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.110
And together, both
of us screamed

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.610
that this is for
the cause of people

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.560
with disabilities in India.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.860
That video went viral.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.620
And people were like,
disabled guys skydive.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:20.861
Disabled guys skydive.

00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:23.360
Some people were like, you are
my inspiration, and all that.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.290
So there was this actual
video where I talked sense.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.170
And there was
another video, which

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.870
had no relation whatsoever
with disability--

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.210
it was just about a guy
jumping from a plane.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.440
And when he skydived,
people were like--

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.030
they were caught.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.630
And the attention was there.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.000
And that's when I
actually understood

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.220
that in India, the messaging
needs to be a little different.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.640
So that was the
first point I started

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.560
to think maybe we
shouldn't preach

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.380
to people about accessibility.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.150
We should probably try it
from a different angle.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.840
So I started with
analyzing the root cause

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.940
to try and find out,
why is there a stigma

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.890
associated with the
word disability?

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.560
And that took me to
religious textbooks.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.400
The first book that I read
was this "Bhagavad Gita" book,

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.240
where I read the
word called "karma."

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.220
People said, you
experience disability

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.720
because you did bad
karma in previous life.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.050
And imagine as a disabled
person, you're reading this.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.750
This is Lord Krishna telling
you on your face, your last

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.935
[INAUDIBLE] tough.

00:31:20.935 --> 00:31:23.590
This [INAUDIBLE],, you are
going to experience stuff.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.670
That hurt.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:27.400
But as I was reading
that book further,

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.980
I also started to read in
that book that he said,

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.410
life is composed of five
elements-- sky, earth, water,

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.390
fire, air.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.550
And he then adds,
only a person who

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.860
has a straight,
vertical spinal cord

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.730
can experience all these
five elements to totality.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.170
And I was like, OK,
this is where I got you.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.040
Because if that is
what you want, and you

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.510
tell that only a person with
complete, straight spinal cord

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.690
can experience this,
let me prove to you

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.090
that that's not true.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.930
So I came up with
this elaborate plan

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.890
that for sky, we
started with skydiving.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.650
For earth, I went
to the Grand Canyon.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:05.250
We kind of rented a helicopter,
went inside the Grand Canyon,

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.800
stayed there for a week.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.800
And what happened
because of that?

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.300
Nothing.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.520
Just my manager got
upset because I was not

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.060
available for a week.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.900
So effectively, it was not
heading in any direction.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.460
Then came water.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.260
The water was the big challenge.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.112
Because I wanted
to do scuba diving.

00:32:21.112 --> 00:32:23.320
But my friend advised me,
saying that, you know what?

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.410
Scuba diving is what
honeymoon couples do.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.400
Think big.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.570
And then I asked him, what
do you mean think big?

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:32.910
Then, he said, there
is a place on Earth

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.000
where the Pacific Ocean and
the Atlantic Ocean intersect.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.650
Why don't you take a jump there?

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.620
And I was like, that is a dream.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.400
That is fantasy.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.540
That is stupidity.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.520
And then there is
a zone beyond that.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.832
Why do you ever think
I'll get into that zone?

00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:47.790
Then, he said, no, Sai.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.330
Let's try out.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:52.560
And so I started to look
out for people who would go,

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.960
who had done that
probably previously.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.150
Then, I met this guy.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.080
He was the first man to walk
the North Pole and South Pole

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.820
back in the 1980s.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.620
When I asked him over
email, why did you

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.935
walk to North Pole and
South Pole in the 1980s--

00:33:06.935 --> 00:33:10.470
that, too-- he said,
just because it's there.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.840
So effectively, then
I realized there

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.740
are crazy people on the planet.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.040
Then I asked him,
don't you think

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.500
that's a little
stupid thing to do?

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.360
Then, he wrote me
an elaborate email.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.620
He said, you know what, Sai?

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.360
When I first walked
the South Pole

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.600
and then came back
to my native country,

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.270
England, the very first
question that people asked me

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.770
when I returned from Antarctica
was that, was it cold, Robert?

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.910
So effectively, when
he said people--

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.000
when you come from
Antarctica, and people ask,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.760
was that continent cold,
then at that moment,

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.670
you know that people are
inherently a little stupid.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.670
Therefore, you don't need to
bother about their opinions.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.980
And over email
exchanges, I figured out

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.870
that he was going on
another expedition

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:55.060
to Antarctica that
particular year.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.660
So I asked him if I could
join him in the same.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.570
And he more than was glad.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.860
He asked me to fundraise for it.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.170
I went to a couple of companies
and asked them to support me.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.389
And they said, no,
this is not a venture

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:11.020
that they would
be interested in.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.400
So I looked at setting
up my own venture.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.150
I started to train
for the GMAT, wherein

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.679
I could raise money
to go ahead and start

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.020
going on this expedition.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.310
It was almost like a
six-month planning.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.960
I lived in Argentina
for almost 20 days.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.550
Because the terrain
on the Andes is

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.070
going to be similar to
the terrain in Antarctica.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.949
So effectively, I was
training on the Andes.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.050
And if you actually
look at this pic,

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:38.469
well, we trained for 15
days on this Andes range

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.020
and then started
on our expedition.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.723
We took all these
lovely pictures.

00:34:41.723 --> 00:34:43.139
Then, we went onto
the expedition.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.860
One of the classic mistakes
that I did during training

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.780
was that I was never
wearing hand gloves while I

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.460
was holding my crutches.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.260
But when I went
to the Antarctic,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.810
the first thing I had to
do was wear hand gloves.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.930
And then I realized the moment
I wear those thick hand gloves,

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.730
I can never hold my crutches.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.710
I can never actually
hold my crutches.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.040
So the entire plan
literally went to dogs.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.620
At that moment, I decided I'd
take revenge on the British

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.650
because we carried them on our
country for almost 200 years.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.150
So I asked this
British man, can you

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.310
carry me for about
two miles so that we

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.740
can get into the continent
once we reach that?

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.380
He said, OK, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.090
Then, we designed sledges.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.770
We got pulled for
almost like five miles.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.160
And on Shivaratri day,
at the intersection

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.320
of the Pacific and
the Atlantic Ocean,

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.200
I decided I'd take what is
called as the polar plunge.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.100
And we recorded that moment.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.990
And finally, on the Shivaratri
day only, we kind of--

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.540
I became the first
Asian with a disability

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.970
to step onto the
Antarctic continent.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.840
And from there, we kind
of put up these pictures.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.670
And by the time I
returned to India,

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.309
this video started to go viral.

00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:52.350
And people were like, you
know, a handicapped guy

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.220
went to Antarctica.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.450
So this fellow
went to Antarctica.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.970
So then people are like, if
that fellow goes to Antarctica,

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.950
he can at least go to
school and all that stuff.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.560
And when people started
to notice all this--

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.010
meanwhile, as if all
this was not enough,

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.201
old villain re-entered life.

00:36:07.201 --> 00:36:08.700
And she was like,
you know, I always

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.820
knew that you had the
talent to do excellent life

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.250
and that you could do well
and achieve big things.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.870
So why don't you guide my
children also and inspire

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:18.870
them and all that stuff?

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.730
And that was the
first point I realized

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.330
in life that people's opinions
can change drastically.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.690
They'll have one view of you
today, another view of you

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.690
the next day.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.870
Their opinions
have no stability.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:35.970
And another thing was, as if
all these good things were not

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.700
enough, out of nowhere--
remember the video that I first

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.690
put up which had two views?

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.660
That was picked
up by Aamir Khan.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.770
And he was launching his
show "Satyamev Jayate."

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.620
And the amount of research
that went into that video kind

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.360
of impressed him.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.460
And he said, why don't
you actually come over

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.290
and have a talk on this show?

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.390
So this was like a
classic Steve Jobs

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.980
quote, where the dots
got connected backwards.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.010
And effectively from
there on, once I

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.820
got into "Satyamev Jayate,"
ISB was also interested.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:07.050
I started working with ISB
and graduated from the school.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.840
I started to work for
home ministry, wherein

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.820
we kind of looked at
generating jobs for people

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.220
with disabilities where
disability could actually

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.870
be an advantage.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:20.190
But before we get there,
it was at this moment

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:24.120
wherein I started to do the
sky, earth, water thing,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.900
I started to realize that a
lot of people in our country

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.140
are very, very stigmatic
about even expressing

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.110
that they have a disability.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:33.960
We are in a city.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.760
We are in Hyderabad.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.760
So effectively, we talk
of words like inclusivity,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.410
accessibility, and all that.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:43.740
But when you go 50 miles south
of the city, or any direction

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.050
of the city, if you
go into a rural area,

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.960
people wouldn't even want to
share that their child would

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.190
have a disability.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.060
That's primarily because
they're worried about how

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.950
the life will actually turn up.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.876
But just reflect that--

00:37:57.876 --> 00:37:59.250
reflecting on that
and wondering,

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:02.550
how can I actually
help those people?

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.830
I was talking to my
professor at ISB.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.870
And he was like, you
did all these projects

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.410
about sky, earth, water, and
all that stuff, which is great.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:13.620
But it is only working on
the awareness component.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.270
He said, every
social problem has

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.010
got three components in all.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.910
One, the awareness component.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.700
Another is the action component.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.610
And third is the
accountability component.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:25.710
Things like this
generate awareness

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.450
that there is a
problem out there.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.250
There could be a
solution out there.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.285
There's a very interesting talk
by my professor-- conversation

00:38:31.285 --> 00:38:32.784
with my professor--
where he told me

00:38:32.784 --> 00:38:36.840
that, Sai, while a lot of people
say that these activities are

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.740
inspiring, ask yourself
what inspiration is.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.590
Inspiration is not about
overcoming a challenge.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.800
Because if you are inspiring
by doing all these activities

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.360
and overcoming the
challenge, you're

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.600
also sending a soft message that
there is going to be a problem.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.210
And still, people
have to overcome it.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.820
It's almost like a mother
will come to the college.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.207
And if the mother sees
me, she tells that child,

00:38:59.207 --> 00:38:59.790
you know what?

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.280
There is this kid.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.920
He climbed the three floors.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.360
He kind of did well in life.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.820
So you also climb three floors.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.520
You will also do well
in life and all that.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.960
He told me that
inspiration is not

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.400
about overcoming the challenge.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.700
True inspiration is about asking
why the challenge is there

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:15.800
in the first place.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.140
And how can we remove that
challenge once and for all?

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.790
He challenged me to
think beyond the obvious.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.660
And he said, you know, stop
on the awareness aspect

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.870
and think more on the action
and accountability angle.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.660
And it is there that the
major challenge came.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.060
Because when I started to
work on the action items,

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.150
I wanted to generate jobs
for people with disabilities.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:38.460
Within that, we looked
at four segments.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.500
One segment was the educated
and employed segment,

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.520
which is what is a
justice or a fair system--

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.370
educated people with
disabilities, those

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.390
people being employed.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:52.390
Then, there are uneducated
people with disabilities.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:53.370
They are employed.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:54.090
That's rare.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.950
You wouldn't find
anyone up there.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:58.200
Then, there are educated
people with disabilities,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.070
but they are not employed.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.950
This is the
discrimination segment.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.380
Finally came the
uneducated people

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.340
with disabilities and
not being employed.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.490
There are God knows
how many people exactly

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.170
with disabilities
in our country.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:17.670
Believe it or not, in 2010,
the government of India

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.910
even refused to count the number
of people with disabilities.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:23.340
Because the major challenge--
when we filed the RTA,

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.370
we came to know as to why
people with disabilities

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:31.350
were not counted was when
the census is conducted,

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.690
you have to go to
a particular place

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:36.715
and ask questions to the people.

00:40:36.715 --> 00:40:39.990
And in remote villages,
interior villages and all,

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.910
you speak in local language.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.310
So effectively, when
the census is conducted,

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.140
and you go to a
particular house,

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.940
you have to ask
that person, do you

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.880
have anyone with a mental
disability or mental challenge

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.771
at your house?

00:40:51.771 --> 00:40:53.770
Effectively, in Hindi,
you have to basically ask

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.770
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:57.980
So effectively, that
gets very offensive.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.730
So you just can't go
into a house and say,

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.100
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:08.684
So effectively, since there
was no terminology for people

00:41:08.684 --> 00:41:10.350
with mental disabilities,
the government

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.770
decided a sweet shortcut.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.070
They decided, let's not count.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:17.470
So effectively, it took a
long time for the government

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:21.197
to decide, we have to frame a
word for this, then ask them.

00:41:21.197 --> 00:41:23.530
Right now, their trending
word is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.610
So basically, we have our
divine organ right now.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:27.870
Because of which I can--

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.300
I don't know-- do what?

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.350
But the government has
decided that right now,

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:32.950
we all will be called
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.491
And now, we are
going to get counted.

00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:36.280
And policies are
going to be framed.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:36.780
Fair enough.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.110
But there was this huge
group of people who

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.230
were uneducated and unemployed.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.520
This is almost like 3%
to 7% of the country.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.320
And they are going
to be left out

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.870
of the employment frame, which
means they can't contribute

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:50.500
to GDP, which
means they're going

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.270
to be a burden on the
family that's earning,

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:57.450
which means that there is
going to be unrest, which

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:00.550
means that there is
going to be frustration.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:04.650
And effectively, it was
my goal that instead

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.900
of working in the
discrimination segment,

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.490
we might want to
work in the segment

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:11.780
where people are
uneducated and unemployed.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.330
That took my focus to
the hospitality industry,

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.240
wherein I looked at jobs
for people with disabilities

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.670
where disability
could be an advantage.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.030
The primary source of the idea
came from the Mughal emperors,

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.590
wherein all the servants of
the queen of the Mughal emperor

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:30.280
either used to be blind,
all the spies or any others

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.410
used to be deaf.

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:34.040
They used their
disability in such a way

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.810
that effectively in
that job, disability

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:39.540
would be a primary advantage.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.170
Now, I'm not debating the
morals or ethics of this.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.820
But it got the job done.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.670
We looked at certain jobs
where noise could be a problem.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.600
For instance, if there
is a traffic police,

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.430
and he's going to get
affected by the traffic noise,

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.980
we believe-- and he has to
speak only through signs.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.110
Then, a person with
a hearing disability

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.520
would be an ideal fit.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.360
In fact, a person with
hearing disability

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.620
could be a job requirement
in that scenario.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.470
Because if you're constantly
exposed to so much noise,

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.490
you get frustrated.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:09.930
Then you get angry.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:10.860
You get drunk.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.840
Then, you go and beat your wife.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.630
So effectively, you could
prevent this whole chain

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:18.480
of events, wherein
we looked at any job

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.900
where noise was going to be
a deterrent to the quality

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.270
of the performance,
the hearing impairment

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:26.460
will actually act
as a deterrent.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.950
And we kind of made
a fantastic report

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.560
for the hospitality industry.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.730
We also looked at the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.220
We looked at a few jobs
in the IT industry.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.110
And we flipped the
paradigm, wherein

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.870
instead of asking
corporates to generate jobs

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:42.990
for people with disabilities,
we kind of looked at the people

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:46.170
with disabilities and thought,
hey, what jobs are they

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:48.960
going to be in in which
their disability in itself

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.900
is going to be
actually an advantage?

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.150
We made a fantastic report.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:56.500
We submitted it to
the Home Ministry.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.190
I don't know what happened
after that, how many jobs we got

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.990
generated, or how
many samosas got

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.120
eaten on that research report.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.840
But effectively, we started
to make slow progress.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.170
That took my attention finally
to the third component, which

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.390
is on the accountability angle.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:17.040
A lot of times, people
believe that any issue related

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.670
to disability should actually
be addressed by government.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:22.740
But when I actually
look at it, it

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.140
is not something that the
government needs to address.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.000
For instance, if
I go to my father

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.750
and say, Dad, this room
and this table's location

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.600
here is kind of
hurting me, he does not

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.600
tell me, go and speak to
the district collector.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.940
He will come and change.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.280
My dad doesn't run an
initiative at house saying,

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.740
today, we'll consider
it as World Disability

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.280
Day in our house.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.790
And he doesn't run
inclusivity initiatives.

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:48.150
He doesn't basically
run it like a corporate.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:51.990
The reason he took care
of me was that he could--

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:55.710
he believed that I was
part of the family.

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.450
I wouldn't even call it love.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.460
He believed that it
was his responsibility.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.500
Once I became his
family member, he

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.900
believed that
everything I face is

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.390
going to be ending up
as the responsibility

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:07.980
or accountability on him.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.140
He took responsibility
for my education.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.640
He took accountability.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.300
When the principals called year
after year, year after year,

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.480
and said, your son would not
be an ideal fit at this school,

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.460
he moved me around
at multiple schools.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.240
He spoke and convinced
multiple principals.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.750
When my mom kind of took me
across the street every day

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:30.060
all those two years,
they didn't look at it

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.900
as an initiative or an
extracurricular activity

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.850
at house.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.240
They knew that this was a
fundamental responsibility.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.380
Because they knew that I
was part of the family.

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.900
Somehow, when I move into
a corporate environment

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:48.090
from a family, that angle
on, this member is my family,

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:49.170
gets missing.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.290
Because we start to think,
hey, he's different.

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.550
My life is different.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.830
I have my own problems in life.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:56.910
Let me sort that out.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:59.710
The HR is there for this.

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:01.950
And I believe that is what
we are trying to address

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.630
through initiatives like this.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:07.410
Because you would really want
to understand that each person

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:10.470
right from the bottom of the
ground to the top-level CEO

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.740
can play a huge role,
can play a huge role.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.370
It could be something as small
as the height of this chair.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.520
When you are addressing
a particular gathering,

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.710
that makes all the
difference to what

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:28.080
the person is going to feel
and excel at the office on.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.870
And when you start to
show so much empathy,

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:34.910
then the person also feels
responsible to contribute.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.660
For instance, remember
back in 10th class,

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:40.055
I really didn't care what
my performance in education

00:46:40.055 --> 00:46:40.680
is going to be?

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.290
But when I realized that
my parents were putting

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:46.650
in so much effort, and
that they were disappointed

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.530
with my performance, and
then I went out of the way

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:53.670
to actually help
and focus and study

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.140
and finally start to deliver.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.840
And there came a point
over a period of time

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.430
where my own attitude,
abilities, and talents

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.930
transformed.

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:04.650
And I sat in front of my dad,
the man who first told me

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.480
education is the way out--

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.180
there came a day where
I told him, Dad, I need

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.590
to go ahead and study abroad.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.330
I don't care what
your fears are.

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:13.950
This is what I need to do.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.470
That's the transformation
that happens.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.300
Through this
transformation, there

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.910
are going to be conflicts.

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.220
There are going to be villains.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.140
There are going to be opinions.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.040
There are going to be failures.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.410
There are going to be
stupid moments that are

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.090
going to be moments of guilt.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:32.310
But you will realize
that when you're

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:34.565
fighting for what
you are believing in

00:47:34.565 --> 00:47:35.940
and when you're
fighting for what

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.840
you think is right for your
life, things might go wrong.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.390
But even if they go wrong,
you will do course correction

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:43.770
over a period of time.

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:46.200
And you will end up in a place
wherein hopefully, one day,

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.790
you can sit in a place--

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:49.890
sit on a chair like
me, I am doing today,

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:53.130
and probably talk of what
happened over 30 years of life

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:54.302
in a 30-minute seminar.

00:47:54.302 --> 00:47:56.010
That's pretty much
what I actually wanted

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.750
to convey over this session.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.330
If you have any questions, I'd
be more than glad to take it.

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:01.110
Thank you.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.560
