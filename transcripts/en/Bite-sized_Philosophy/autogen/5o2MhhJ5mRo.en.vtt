productive labor out of them was the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
productive labor out of them was the
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.929
productive labor out of them was the
death of tens of millions of people we

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
death of tens of millions of people we
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.090
death of tens of millions of people we
don't even know the estimates range from

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
don't even know the estimates range from
 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.649
don't even know the estimates range from
15 to 60 million and like we won't get

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
15 to 60 million and like we won't get
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.510
15 to 60 million and like we won't get
to Picayune about the numbers because

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
to Picayune about the numbers because
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609
to Picayune about the numbers because
after the first 10 million you kind of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
after the first 10 million you kind of
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.580
after the first 10 million you kind of
made your point and the fact that we

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
made your point and the fact that we
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.160
made your point and the fact that we
don't know between 15 and 60 is actually

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
don't know between 15 and 60 is actually
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.570
don't know between 15 and 60 is actually
an indication of the horror of it

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580
an indication of the horror of it
 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.460
an indication of the horror of it
because our count is off by tens of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
because our count is off by tens of
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.730
because our count is off by tens of
millions and that's only within the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
millions and that's only within the
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.210
millions and that's only within the
century and then there was the 1956

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
century and then there was the 1956
 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.730
century and then there was the 1956
crackdown on Hungary and the 1968

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740
crackdown on Hungary and the 1968
 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.830
crackdown on Hungary and the 1968
invasion of Czechoslovakia then there

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
invasion of Czechoslovakia then there
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.470
invasion of Czechoslovakia then there
was the whole like thermonuclear

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480
was the whole like thermonuclear
 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.300
was the whole like thermonuclear
Holocaust thing that was going on at the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310
Holocaust thing that was going on at the
 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.030
Holocaust thing that was going on at the
same time in the fact that in 1962 and

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
same time in the fact that in 1962 and
 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.900
same time in the fact that in 1962 and
in 1984 we were seconds away from

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
in 1984 we were seconds away from
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.550
in 1984 we were seconds away from
complete annihilation right during the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
complete annihilation right during the
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.040
complete annihilation right during the
Cuban Missile Crisis the keys were in

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050
Cuban Missile Crisis the keys were in
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.440
Cuban Missile Crisis the keys were in
the intercontinental ballistic missile

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450
the intercontinental ballistic missile
 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.350
the intercontinental ballistic missile
release systems and Castro as he

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360
release systems and Castro as he
 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.810
release systems and Castro as he
admitted to Jimmy Carter in case any of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820
admitted to Jimmy Carter in case any of
 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.330
admitted to Jimmy Carter in case any of
you or Castro fans which you shouldn't

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
you or Castro fans which you shouldn't
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.690
you or Castro fans which you shouldn't
be that he was perfectly willing to have

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
be that he was perfectly willing to have
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.040
be that he was perfectly willing to have
Cuba annihilate it if it would have

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
Cuba annihilate it if it would have
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.300
Cuba annihilate it if it would have
meant the defeat of the United States

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310
 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.050
and then in 1984 approximately I may

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060
and then in 1984 approximately I may
 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.180
and then in 1984 approximately I may
have the date exactly wrong the Russians

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190
have the date exactly wrong the Russians
 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.640
have the date exactly wrong the Russians
received an indication from their early

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650
received an indication from their early
 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.260
received an indication from their early
warning systems that the Americans had

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270
warning systems that the Americans had
 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.610
warning systems that the Americans had
launched five thermonuclear missiles and

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620
launched five thermonuclear missiles and
 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.500
launched five thermonuclear missiles and
one Russian decided that it was a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
one Russian decided that it was a
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.020
one Russian decided that it was a
mistake and refused to launch the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
mistake and refused to launch the
 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.450
mistake and refused to launch the
retaliation and he just died about two

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460
retaliation and he just died about two
 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.170
retaliation and he just died about two
weeks ago so you know that was pretty

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180
weeks ago so you know that was pretty
 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.850
weeks ago so you know that was pretty
close and so that was experiment number

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860
close and so that was experiment number
 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.350
close and so that was experiment number
one let's say that that wasn't good that

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360
one let's say that that wasn't good that
 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.940
one let's say that that wasn't good that
experiment let's put it that way it

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
experiment let's put it that way it
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.680
experiment let's put it that way it
wasn't good it was exactly the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690
wasn't good it was exactly the
 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.560
wasn't good it was exactly the
antithesis of good it was precisely the
