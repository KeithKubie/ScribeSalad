[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.860
KAT JUNGNICKEL:
Thank you very much.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.984
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:16.630
So thank you for the invitation.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.560
As [INAUDIBLE] was saying, I'm
a sociologist at Goldsmiths.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.110
I'm interested in citizenship,
and gender, and technology,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.840
and invention, which is very
much what this book is all

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.130
about.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.463
So I'm going to tell you a
little bit about the research

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:32.470
project that underpins
this new publication.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.350
And it's ostensibly about
Victorian engineering,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.410
the history of patenting and
radical feminist cultures

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.490
of invention.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.470
But I'm here to do
what pretty much is

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.080
a bit of cycling, sewing,
and suffrage storytelling.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.861
So my research tells
the story of inventors,

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:50.110
who helped to shape the
landscape in which women could

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.440
move in new ways
independently, unchaperoned

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.740
in public space, who embraced
a plethora of new technologies,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.950
such as the bicycle, the
sewing machine, new waterproof

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.340
and woolen fabrics, and
a range of new media,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.710
and who pushed at the
parameters of established forms

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.720
of gendered citizenship.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.417
And all of this, I believe--

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.500
and I will argue-- can be
told through the history

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.270
of cyclewear.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.559
But first of all, why am
I looking at cyclewear

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:17.350
in the first place?

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.540
Why does cyclewear matter?

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.180
Can I find out who
is a cyclist here?

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.810
Ooh, OK, quite a lot
of you-- terrific.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.840
So initially, the idea for this
came from an amazing post-doc

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.410
that I've been doing,
where I was studying

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.260
contemporary cycling research.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.000
And it was about the
cultures of cycling.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.880
I was looking at four different
field sites around the UK

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.230
with Rachel Oldroyd and her
great project exploring,

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.930
in some cases, why cycle
rates in some places in the UK

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.670
were much higher than others.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.700
It involved a whole mixed
methods approach of ethnography

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.710
and a lot of interviews.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.710
But I was really struck by how
unprovoked cyclists would often

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.100
talk about what they would wear
to cycle and the effect this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.630
had on other users.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.150
In some circumstances,
looking like a proper cyclist

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.420
enabled people to carve out
cycling identities and kind

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.490
of legitimizes
space on the road.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.190
And in others-- and women were
particularly articulate about

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.340
this--

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.590
being visibly
identifiable as a cyclists

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.920
sometimes resulted in
unwelcome responses

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.690
from other road users.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.210
And people also seemed to
identify with the struggle

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.270
to find appropriate clothing
that fitted on the bike

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.420
and also for when you
arrive at your destination.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.750
And female cyclists also
lamented the limited range

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.760
of cyclewear available
to them in relation

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.929
to what was available
for men, more broadly.

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.470
They talked about having to hack
or adapt their own clothing,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.290
buy men's wear, and do things
with that, because they

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.290
felt there was a limited kind
of high-tech range for them.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.790
And at the time,
also, the media was

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.740
starting to identify
a particular type

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.900
of dressed cyclist,
the Lycra lout.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.420
And here with
seemingly appropriate

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.580
technical materiality
for cycling,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.780
Lycra was becoming shorthand
for kind of an anti-social form

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.110
of mobility.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.830
So clearly, what
cyclists wore mattered.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.240
And it mattered a lot.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.270
So I began to ask, why
does cyclewear matter?

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.490
Where do these
anxieties come from?

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.330
And what can we learn about
what we wear to cycle today

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.590
from learning more about
what we've worn in the past?

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.490
So my research focuses
on a very small period

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.940
of history, 1895 to 1899.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.100
It was a radical intersection
of new technology

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.550
and social and cultural change.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.730
And it was when the bicycle
boom swept through this country,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.620
and it was also a
time of dress reform.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.890
And emancipation activities
were gaining traction

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.080
advocating for more women's
rights and freedoms.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.060
There was a growth
of new printed media,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.420
particularly around
cycling periodicals,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.690
and an influx of new ideas
from travelers from abroad.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.340
So I've been
looking particularly

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.400
at what early cyclists
wore to ride bikes.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.190
And cyclewear really
provides an interesting lens,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.000
I think, into society.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.480
So as a sociologist,
I consider clothing

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.020
as a device that reflects and
also produces social, cultural,

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.690
and political worlds.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.190
And clothing is
not just something

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.890
that covers or protects
bodies but thinking

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.650
of it as a technology that
enables and constrains

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.720
different forms of mobility.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.570
And in the 1890s, clothing was
a critical means through which

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.300
bodies are made to fit,
both physically and also

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.910
ideologically, with changing
ideas about being in

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.120
and moving through public
space and attaching

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.850
to all these new and
exciting technologies.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.604
And some bodies
fitted much easier

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:33.770
with these new technologies.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.230
And some bodies had
to be made to fit.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.490
So I've been
focusing particularly

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.959
on middle-and-upper-class
women, because they were

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.250
at the cutting edge of fashion.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.160
They had money to
embrace new technology,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.650
as well as the leisure
time to enjoy it.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.690
They had exposure
to media and ideas

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.600
from around the world and the
social and cultural capital

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.930
to push back against
conventional social codes

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.370
and norms.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.160
So what was happening
in the 1890s?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.370
I'm going to set the scene
a little bit with a letter.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.150
It was written in 1897 by Kitty
J. Buckman to a friend of hers

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.690
about her cycling experiences.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.560
And she writes this.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.140
She says, "Minnie says, Oxford
is the most bigoted place

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.250
in the kingdom.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.840
It certainly cannot be worse to
ride in Oxford than in London,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.120
especially London suburbs.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.230
It's awful.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.610
One wants nerves of iron.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.160
The shouts and the yells
of children deafen one.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.590
The women shriek with
laughter or groan and hiss.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.290
And all sorts of remarks are
shouted, occasionally some not

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.060
fit for publication.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.150
One needs to be very
brave to stand all that.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.450
And it makes one feel mad.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.370
And one's idea of
humanity at large sink

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.340
to a very low standard."

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.920
So Kitty clearly loves cycling.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.100
And there's lots of letters
between her and her friends

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.510
about how much they loved it.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.400
But the fact that she says it
took nerves of iron to ride,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.530
it clearly wasn't always
a relaxing or safe pastime

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.520
in late 19th century Britain.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.190
Rather, as evoked
by these letters,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.740
it was fraught with verbal
and sometimes even physical

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.280
assault from general
public in some places.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.510
So why was this?

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.150
Why did mobile women
get treated in this way?

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.870
What were they doing and wearing
to elicit such social violence?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.685
And how and in what
ways did they respond?

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.890
So both men and women
really enthusiastically

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.940
took to cycling.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.370
But they both had very different
experiences in the 1890s.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.650
It was considerably
easier for upper-class men

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.210
initially, because their bodies
and society's understandings

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.210
about masculine mobility
and their clothing

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.270
meant they fitted with the
bicycle much more easily.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.100
And as Jennifer
Hargreaves writes,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.170
sports constituted a unique
form of cultural life.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.690
There were
overwhelmingly symbols

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.030
of masculinity and
chauvinism, embodying

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.970
aggressive displays of physical
power and competitiveness.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.740
In the 19th century
there's no question

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.690
that sports were the
natural domain of men

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.130
and to be good at them
was essentially masculine.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.380
And the popularity of cycling--

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.280
and cycling racing,
in particular--

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.850
really helped to shape men's
attachment to cycling, as well

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.690
as their cyclewear, reinforcing
its masculine appeal.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.850
And cutting-edge
designs for racing bikes

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.850
also trickled down into
the consumer market.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.880
So men were much
more easily to adopt

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.050
the confident, high-tech cycling
consumer right from the start.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.660
And a slew of popular
periodicals, such as these,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.060
"The Hub" and "The
Wheeler," were

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.811
very quick to respond to
this popular interest.

00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:29.060
And they regularly published
details of all the racing

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.300
events and showcased the winners
in collectible commemorative

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.720
posters like this.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.130
So you can see the
discourse of heroism

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.090
were embedded in these
accounts that powerfully

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.040
linked masculinity and cycling.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.290
We see language such
as speed, and agility,

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.580
and performance, champion,
professional, and skill.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.890
And you can see, also, men's
clothing wasn't terribly

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.170
much of an issue here, either.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.070
They were much more easily
able to discard things

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.550
that were seen as kind of
problematic on a bicycle

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.280
to the point where there's
not much even happening there.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.330
And to the left, you
can see almost a prelude

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.210
to cycling skin suits even
happening over 110 years ago.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.310
So women in cycling--

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.860
women, too, found cycling
incredibly exciting.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.510
And we can probably
barely imagine

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.690
the unparalleled sense of
excitement, and freedom,

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.000
and independence that would
have come from cycling

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.540
at that time for them.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.180
However, their
bodies, and dress,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.250
and mobile engagement
public space

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.290
were much more complicated.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.350
Up until the mid 1880s,
middle-and-upper-class

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.870
women's bodies in Victorian
society were defined

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.799
by the moral responsibility of
reproduction and deeply rooted

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.470
in one place, being the home.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.740
Exercise was deemed
unnecessary, unhealthy even,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.830
and even detrimental to
her matrimonial duties,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.370
given her main purpose was the
caring and bearing of children.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.200
And fashions may
not have been always

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.260
as complicated as this
French visiting dress.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.110
But they ostensibly reinforced
many of these beliefs

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.180
about women's role in society.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.940
They comprised up to 7
pounds of heavy petticoats,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.410
long, floor-length skirts,
tightly laced corsets,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.657
blouses, jackets, veils,
hats, gloves, and much more.

00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:12.740
And together, these
restrictions on women's bodies

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.080
produced kind of a
largely immobile citizen,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.130
incapable, it was seen,
as being able to do

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.590
much physical or indeed
mental, economical kind

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.120
of political movement.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.420
However, close to
the 19th century,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.980
things were really changing.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.350
Women's rights activists
were continuing

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.980
to agitate for women's freedom
of movement out of the home

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.942
into education and business.

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:37.400
Public debates
about the importance

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.320
of exercise for women
was actually changing.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.140
And doctors who'd previously
been very negative about it

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.710
were suddenly coming out and
cautiously recommending it.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.410
And dress reform was emerging
in the UK for both sexes.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:53.600
And the UK'S Rational
Dress Society

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.520
had been around since the 1880s.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.400
And they were campaigning for
what they called rational dress

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.410
over irrational fashion.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.660
And rational dress
comprised of a whole range

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.710
of different garments.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.360
But they're
ostensibly recognized

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.140
as a looser corset,
or no corset at all,

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.970
and a pair of bifurcated
trousers such as bloomers

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.880
and knickerbockers, and no
skirt, or a shorter skirt.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.390
So shocking was this change
in dress in public space

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.520
that it really
divided the nation.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.500
Dress reform was
incredibly controversial,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.780
with many arguing that
the public's distaste

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.900
for this radical form of
masculinized clothing for women

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.610
damaged women's
freedom of movement.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.970
And it really split women
cyclists and dress reformers

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.750
alike.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.480
And it was also,
of course, a time

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.880
of expanding popular media,
especially fueled, as I said,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.520
by the popularity of cycling.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.160
And lots of publications
really targeted women

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.890
as these new
consumers of cycling.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.010
And "The Lady Cyclist" was one
such publication, very popular

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.150
at the time.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.650
It was launched in 1896.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.350
And it was edited by man, but
it had lots of contributions

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.550
from women.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.580
And it put forward this really
powerful, new visual language

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.850
and technological imaginary
that placed women firmly

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.790
in cycling's fashionable set
and carving a space for them

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.250
in what had been pretty much
a masculine cycling world.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.890
So it was really important.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.140
And it gave many the permission
to continue the sport

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.810
or provide incentive
for the tentative.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.970
However, these
publications also provide

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.480
an awful lot of
advice and suggestions

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.500
for the lady cyclist, and
what they should do or not do,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.270
what they should dress
and not dress in,

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.910
and a regular
column such as "Why

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.780
A Lady Cyclist Should Always
Dress Well," cycling fashions.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.200
And there are illustrations
of the ideal lady cyclist

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.590
from the point of view
of our various artists,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.380
as well as my favorite,
"Array Yourself Becomingly."

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.690
And overall, it was really
imperative that the lady

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.730
cyclist appear
feminine while mobile,

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.910
with emphasis on being graceful,
and neat, and sensible,

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.730
and becoming, charming,
dignified, modest, and more.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.840
So you note how this discourse
is quite different from men

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.370
and cycling's discourse.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.670
But ostensibly, they
were firmly discouraged

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:13.700
not to show any effort or
strain while cycling, in order

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.127
to maintain this kind of
feminine form of mobility.

00:12:17.127 --> 00:12:18.710
So it's quite a lot
of pressure, then,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.960
to be a lady cyclist,
for any of us who

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.850
know what it's like to cycle.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.140
So another thing, bike
portraits were really popular

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.730
in the 1890s.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.570
It's kind of the equivalent
of the selfie now, I imagine.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.240
Having access to all
these new technologies,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.320
such as the bicycle, a new
cycling garment, and a camera

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.620
illustrated great
cultural cachet.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.860
And you've got to admit, Mrs.
H.H. Timberlake here of Wigan

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.440
is looking pretty elegant,
and dignified, and modest,

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.930
and charming, and
very feminine there.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.170
But she's also wearing
an awful lot of clothes.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.080
And she's not moving.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.100
Because the reality is that it
was actually quite difficult to

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.260
look graceful, and
elegant, and modest,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.200
and graceful on a moving
bicycle, especially when you're

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.884
wearing that many clothes.

00:13:09.884 --> 00:13:12.300
Because that many clothes can
make you fall off your bike.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.870
And it did.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.060
Because the reality of
cycling in what was called

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.190
ordinary dress was
very difficult.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.100
Skirts and petticoats caught in
chain rings, as you'd imagine.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.260
Material wrapped around
petals, flew into spokes.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.170
It even blew--
because in some cases,

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.740
dresses were quite wide--

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.950
it would even blew into
wheels, and blew up, and even

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.610
obscured cyclists view as
some of the newspaper reports

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.060
would indicate.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.060
And newspapers also
regularly noted

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.420
with kind of gruesome
detail accounts of women

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.140
dying or becoming disfigured
as a result of cycling crashes,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.210
often due to their clothing.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.010
And this discourse
reinforced the idea

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.060
that many had that women
weren't natural cyclists,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.400
and they were kind of not
very confident, and a bit

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.320
technologically incompetent.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.270
However, it is very
difficult to cycle

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.910
wearing this many
clothes, especially when

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.070
it keeps making you fall off.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.830
But the choice to cycle in
more appropriate cyclewear,

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.800
such as more rational
dress at the time,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.685
wasn't necessarily
socially safer.

00:14:09.685 --> 00:14:11.310
Because cycling in
more rational dress,

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.220
such as bloomers or
removing your skirt,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:19.140
would expose you to the
potential spectrum of responses

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.000
from all classes of society.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.720
And it could result in verbal
and even physical assault.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.490
Cyclists were
harassed in streets.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.470
They were subjected
to rocks, and sticks,

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.260
and incredibly rude remarks.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.770
They were denied
entry into places.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.240
And they were gossiped about.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.856
I can't imagine
just how difficult

00:14:34.856 --> 00:14:36.480
that would have been
to kind of get out

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.040
there and cycle when
you knew that was going

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.289
to happen in different places.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.200
So one of the reasons that
women cyclists in cyclewear

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.480
elicited such
responses is that they

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.430
were seen by some
to be encroaching

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.170
in what had
previously been men's

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.120
lifestyles and privileges.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.320
Society feared women
getting out alone,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.700
unchaperoned, moving at speed.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.770
And in some cases,
even smoking--

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.180
the fact that it
would lead women

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.730
into these potentially kind
of bad behaviors and pursuits.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.511
And lady cyclists were a
favorite topic for discussion

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:11.510
and debate in the media.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.440
And lots of poems, and
diatribes, and cartoons really

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.740
use this in order to generate
discussion, and debate,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.390
and audiences.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.160
And I particularly
love this image,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.350
because she really doesn't look
like she cares at all about it.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.790
She's overdressed.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.400
Look at that brooch on her head.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.890
She's not clearly
particularly good at cycling.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.680
She had just run
someone off the road.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.730
She's unchaperoned.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.570
She's smoking.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.250
And she's clearly
a danger to others.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.315
But she's just keep
on going with it.

00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:44.690
And clearly, this
cartoon is kind

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.040
of mocking a lot of these fears.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.280
But most threatening to
some parts of society

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.010
was the fact that
women were out there.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.964
They were carving out new
feminine modes and mobility.

00:15:53.964 --> 00:15:54.880
They are unchaperoned.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.713
They're moving at speed,
at different times,

00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:58.940
and in different places
than ever before.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.440
And cycling,
therefore, for some,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.270
was emblematic of women
rejecting their natural roles

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.200
at home, caring and bearing
of children, the caring

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.790
and bearing of others.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.290
And their actions potentially
threatened the very contiguity

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.170
of humanity.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.570
This is how intense the
conversation was going.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.450
What's going to happen if women
are out there cycling and not

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.790
helping to produce
healthy offspring?

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.830
So it really polarized society.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.770
A female body on
a bicycle, how it

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.780
moved, how it was
dressed swiftly

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.810
became a site of
intense, public debate

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.420
about the broader role
of women in society.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.540
And as a result, you had to
be quite brave in some places

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.920
to get out there and go riding.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.890
However, fortunately,
nothing was

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.510
going to stop quite
a lot of women

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:48.020
from cycling after
that experience,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.024
the unparalleled
excitement of it.

00:16:50.024 --> 00:16:51.440
And there are many
ways that women

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.800
responded to what had become
known as the dress problem.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.950
Some braved ordinary
fashion on their bicycles

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.580
and just suffered whatever
kind of crashes might happen.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.579
Some wore rational dress,
like Kitty and her friends,

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.609
and braved the social response.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:11.030
Some elicited
site-specific strategies,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.839
which involved wearing one
garment for city riding

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.490
and then changing
into something more

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.130
appropriate for proper riding
when nobody could really

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:20.359
see you.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:24.890
And others responded inventively
through the dress itself.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.619
And this is what I've been
particularly interested in.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.320
And I don't know if anyone knows
of Rozsika Parker's great book,

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.020
"The Subversive Stitch."

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.920
It relates to women's engagement
in the art of embroidery.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.710
But I think it really
relates to sewing, as well.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.810
Because she says,
"The art of embroidery

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.810
has been the means of educating
women into the feminine ideal

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.580
and of proving
they've attained it.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.830
But it has also provided
a weapon of resistance

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.570
to the constraints
of femininity."

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.380
So what I discovered
in doing quite a lot

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.810
of archival research
about this period of time

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.390
is that quite a number
of these pioneering women

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.660
who really wanted
to cycle and wanted

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.960
to respond through
the dress itself

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.190
used all the tools, and the
skills, and the networks

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.630
at their disposal to redefine
the parameters of femininity

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.850
through their clothing.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:18.300
So these challenges to
women's freedom of movement

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.910
created the conditions
ripe for invention.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.010
And it turns out, some
of these pioneering women

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.100
not only imagined,
designed, made,

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.440
and wore radical new
forms of cyclewear,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.110
but they also patented
their designs,

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.900
which is terrific for us.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.320
The mid-1890s is marked not
only by a boom in cycling

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.082
but a boom in
patenting, as well.

00:18:40.082 --> 00:18:42.540
I haven't got time to tell you
about all the kind of things

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.331
that come together.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.120
But handily, it's in the book.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.550
But there was a long
history of patent reform

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.200
that slightly coincides with the
reform to the Married Women's

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.700
Property Act that
actually enabled

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.030
them to have more control
and power over their ideas.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.510
But it was a remarkable time
for inventiveness, especially

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.590
for and by women.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.340
Because cycling's dress problem
was so immobilizing for women

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.940
that cyclewear inventions
became a primary vehicle

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.160
for women's entry into
the world of patenting.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.440
That became statistically
relevant for the first time,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.030
so they get talked
about in new ways.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.150
So what are patents?

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.864
Have many of you
done patent research?

00:19:20.864 --> 00:19:21.720
No.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.350
Me either, until
this project, too.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.530
What are patents?

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.230
A patent is a temporary
monopoly on the economic benefit

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.210
that can be derived
from an invention.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.310
As such, a patent turns an
idea into a form of property.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.880
The person who has a new
idea, a patent asserts,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.860
can own it in the same
way that he or she

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.530
can own land or money.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.160
OK.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.770
But why are patents interesting
to sociologists and to you?

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.630
Well, patents provide an
incredible material history

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.959
of invention.

00:19:54.959 --> 00:19:56.625
As Ruth Schwartz-Cowan
writes, "If there

00:19:56.625 --> 00:19:58.041
were no such thing
as a patent, we

00:19:58.041 --> 00:20:00.790
would not know very
much about inventors."

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.130
And patents, I think, are
fascinating design objects.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.280
Because inventors describe
in detail the problem they're

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.770
attempting to solve,
and in doing so,

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.560
provide us with a glimpse
of the sociocultural context

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.800
at the time.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.640
The inventor tells us about
themselves, their name,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.680
address, self-identified
vocation,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.700
their married status--

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.110
mostly for women.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.850
They identify the problem.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.890
Then they tell us how
they've solved it.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.890
And they go into great
detail about who it's for,

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.100
what materials,
what technologies,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.580
how it relates to
past inventions,

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.550
and the many ways that
it can be put to use.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.320
Patents were also
particularly good record

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.960
of women's inventiveness.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.910
As [INAUDIBLE]
says, patent records

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.470
are inherently useful
in this regard,

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.150
because they provide
a continuous source

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.430
of information about
market-related activities

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.640
of women.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.900
So they're an amazing resource
of first-hand accounts

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.520
of women from this period.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.160
They give voice to a group
that were very often silenced

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.700
by history.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.980
We don't often hear
much about them.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.440
And they're also
continuous, valuable record.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.040
They provide evidence of women
as being creative inventors

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.580
and continually contributing
to cycling's history.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.310
When we often look at
more conventional records,

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.140
women tend to pop
up in the account.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.310
This shows us that there's an
evolving and connected history

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.470
of their contributions.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.260
And they present
a range of voices,

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.110
not just in a triumphal,
loud, or more traditionally,

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.490
heroic kind of stories that
are conventionally successful.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.100
Patent databases record
the work of all the ideas

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.289
that go into the
archive, regardless of

00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:37.330
whether or not they've
actually been successfully

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.150
taken out and produced
into something.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.910
So they're still an incredible,
useful body of data,

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.010
because it shows what
people were thinking about

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.530
and how they were drawing on
the past to claim the present

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.780
and imagine different futures.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.260
And they speak to
future makers and users.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.310
They provide detailed
instructions for somebody else.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.860
And they provide all that
detail for somebody else

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.900
to remake the invention--
so a little bit more

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.740
on that in a second.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.720
And they're not boring.

00:22:08.012 --> 00:22:09.470
To be honest, I
was a bit concerned

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.850
during this much patent
research and hauling away

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.620
in archives for a number
of years, it turned out.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.630
Because I'm more
of an ethnographer.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.790
I would spend time
with people actually

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.410
going and living with
different communities,

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.120
doing lots of field work, and
interviewing people, hanging

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.550
out with people,
building things.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.980
It was quite lively and dynamic
hanging around with people

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.430
who are alive.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.180
So I was a little
bit concerned doing

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.910
all of this as to whether it
would be as interesting as it

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.120
turned out to be.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.200
But it turns out the story
of Victorian inventors

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.410
and patentees is far from the
kind of dry and dull account

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.020
relegated to the dusty
corners of archives.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.270
Combined with
genealogical research,

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.850
the race to patent ideas at
the turn of the last century

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.160
is full of drama and excitement.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.670
And successful inventors were--
as Ruth Schwartz-Cowan talks

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.365
about--

00:22:59.365 --> 00:23:01.490
they were celebrated in
print, and from the pulpit,

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.380
household names either
in their own right

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.020
or because of the names of
the companies they founded.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.280
Newspapers quoted them.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.290
Popular magazines
recounted their exploits.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.870
And huge crowds turned
out to hear about them.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.970
It really was, I
think in the 1890s,

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.520
the equivalent of
the early dot com

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.590
boom of the turn of
the last century.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.960
Lots of people were so
excited by this potential

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.710
of an idea that could
radically change your future.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.010
It could really propel your
social mobility in ways that

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.230
other kind of jobs or
opportunities couldn't.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.492
And also, look at the books
I get to hang out with.

00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:36.200
They're enormous.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.075
I should have had my
hand in there for scale.

00:23:38.075 --> 00:23:39.720
But they really were huge.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.840
And invariably, they're filled
with all the dust of the 1890s.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.550
I would leave kind of wearing
and bodied with materiality

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.580
and I fear probably leaving
some of myself in it, as well.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.030
That's another talk.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.970
But I've been
particularly influenced

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.980
by a feminist turn
in the archives

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.810
to see not only what is
present in the archives,

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:01.080
but also what is
absent, and critically

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.630
consider the politics
that shape collections.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.910
So as Ann Stoler
has written, this

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.400
involves a move from
the archive as a source

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.530
to archive as a subject.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.480
And she talks about
archiving as a process

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.280
and thinking about
it as a thing.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.200
And likewise, Kate
Eichhorn's work

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.750
is really interesting about
archives, because she says,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.910
it's not so much a turn to
the past but another way

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.650
to understand the present.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.020
So I began to see these
kind of spaces and materials

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.159
as opportunities to find, to
piece together these stories.

00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:29.700
Because they're
certainly not sitting

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.220
there waiting to just read
them, particularly women's

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.270
stories in the past.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.395
They're kind of everywhere.

00:24:34.395 --> 00:24:35.190
They're fragmented.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.710
It's a way of trying to
piece these pieces together

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:42.150
but also trying to resist
making it a smooth narrative.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.411
Because I don't know for sure.

00:24:43.411 --> 00:24:44.910
So I'm trying to
piece them together

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:48.390
but still maintain an
opportunity for other people

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.070
to interpret this material.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.030
So, what were they inventing?

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.650
Looking across these patents,
a central aim becomes clear.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.240
And it's quite ambitious.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.930
They aim to create garments that
did two things, that operated

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.140
as a successful
form of cyclewear

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.850
while still giving
the appearance

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:11.882
of an ordinary skirt.

00:25:11.882 --> 00:25:13.340
So they're trying
to make something

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.140
that does both things.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.040
And you can see, this
is just a few cut-outs

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.680
for a number of
different patterns.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.820
It will have the appearance
of an ordinary walking skirt.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.320
My invention relates
to improvements

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.736
to lady's skirts
that would render

00:25:24.736 --> 00:25:26.930
them equally
adaptable for cyclists

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.030
and be indistinguishable.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.980
They're trying to
really ambitiously do

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.167
two things in one.

00:25:33.167 --> 00:25:35.250
And there are a number of
ways that they did this.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.160
And I've identified five themes.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:45.740
Inventive solution number one,
attach women to their clothing.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.820
Inventors used a whole array
of straps, and buckles,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.690
and even metal belts, and a
whole range of chains, as well,

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.870
to prevent a skirt from
flapping and flying about,

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.250
which was the problem.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.030
And funny enough,
more male inventors

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.600
thought this was a better idea
than the female inventors.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.180
Women were more about taking
this stuff away, rather than

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:08.020
adding more things on there.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.930
Inventive solution number
two, tailor the skirt

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.490
to fit the bike.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.890
So this cut some of
the bulk of the skirt

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.800
and the layers of petticoats
which were flapping around.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.810
And the aim was to fit
the skirt over both sides

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.120
of the back wheel without
going into it, which is what

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.611
this image is showing there.

00:26:23.611 --> 00:26:25.360
But when you moved
away from your bicycle,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.990
it was indiscernible that
you were wearing cyclewear.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.570
So it limited some of the
potential for crashes.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.880
But the skirt was still flapping
quite close to that back wheel.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.010
And there were a lot of critics
of this particular invention.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.170
Inventive solution
number three is what

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.540
I call built-in bifurcation.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.069
So you might love your bloomers.

00:26:46.069 --> 00:26:47.360
You might be very keen on them.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.700
But maybe you didn't want
anyone else to see them.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.227
So perhaps you are committed
to rational dress and women's

00:26:53.227 --> 00:26:55.310
suffrage, but you weren't
so keen in having things

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.350
thrown at you in public.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.870
So you wore them, but you
kept them hidden by a skirt.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.550
So there are a number
of different ideas

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.970
that had bloomers sewn into
them, replacing the petticoat.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.780
So it removed a lot
of those layers.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.530
And if your skirt did
fly out, then you're

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.330
still kind of covered.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.602
Inventive solution number
four is what I technically

00:27:14.602 --> 00:27:15.810
call the really big bloomers.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.560
They look like a skirt they're
so big, as you can see.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.450
They kind of hid
the fact that you've

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.650
got bifurcation going
on there and hid

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.940
your independently-moving
legs to a degree,

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.430
but still freed
your legs to peddle,

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.590
and kept the loose
material in check.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.652
And I really like these.

00:27:37.652 --> 00:27:39.360
And I've made a number
of pairs of these.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.250
And they're
phenomenal for snacks.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.910
And cyclists really
like their snacks.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.570
You can get a lot of pockets
happening in there with a lot

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.140
of food without anyone knowing.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.370
Inventive solution number
five, convertible costumes--

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.310
now these garments
really ambitiously aimed

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.130
for both respectable
fashion, urban street wear,

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.960
and cyclewear.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.540
So the inventors engineered
deliberately-concealed

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.080
technological systems
into their skirts--

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.140
into their skirts--
using pulley systems,

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.620
and gathering devices, and
cords, and buttons, and loops,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.330
and other mechanisms
into the seams,

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.240
and hems, and
waistbands that enabled

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.480
wearers to secretly switch
from modal identities,

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.870
from perambulate walking to
cycling when they needed.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.230
And this is the theme we
became very struck by.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.390
And more women than men
really took to this.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.850
And this is the biggest
theme out of all of those.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.787
So, what do we do next?

00:28:35.787 --> 00:28:37.620
I really want to see
these things in action.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.359
How do they work?

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:39.150
How were they made?

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.230
How were they repaired?

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.860
Did they work at all?

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.120
So I've been around so many
of the museums and galleries

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.760
in the UK looking at
Victorian sportswear.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.280
And I don't know if anyone's
done this, but it's amazing.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.900
You go into museums
and galleries.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.420
And they have such
an amazing collection

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.910
of Victorian garments,
as well as other things.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.220
And curators are really
keen to bring them up

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.650
out of the archive, because
they're not all on show,

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.840
and to provide them to you
to explore and engage with.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.500
And there's lots.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.699
For me, there was
yachting, and horse riding,

00:29:10.699 --> 00:29:12.990
and gymnastics, and swimming,
and golfing, and walking,

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:19.170
and all sorts of things, but
no convertible cycle outfits.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.720
So I haven't found yet
any evidence of these,

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.250
even though I will
show an example

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.980
to show very clearly that quite
a number of them were made,

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.750
were successful,
and distributed,

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.310
and worn by people.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.040
So why aren't they
available, considering

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.020
lots of other things are?

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.180
Well, you talk to curators
and think about this

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.340
for awhile, cyclewear
gets worn out.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.370
I don't know how many of you
think about your old cycling

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.800
knicks and think the
National Gallery needs them.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.690
Probably not.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.650
So inventions also were
hidden in plain sight.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.720
One of the purposes of
them was that no one

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.180
knew about it unless you
were transforming them.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.359
So they were designed
not to be seen.

00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:57.900
And quite possibly,
if you don't know

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.483
what you're looking for when you
just get one of these skirts,

00:30:00.483 --> 00:30:03.027
you may not know that these
things are built into them.

00:30:03.027 --> 00:30:04.860
And of course, women's
invention in the past

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.930
not necessarily recognized
or highly valued

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.190
for what it is, and as per
gender conventions of the time,

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.290
either ignored or
slightly written out

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.430
of history, as well.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.850
And even if they were
available, these garments

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.300
are really made for mobility.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.110
They're live, dynamic,
transformable, convertible

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.047
objects.

00:30:23.047 --> 00:30:24.880
It's really hard to
gain insights from them.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.670
Even though it's
amazing when you go in,

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:27.720
this is kind of what you.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.860
You get the object.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.810
You get these tools
of investigation,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.355
being a tape measure, a pencil,
some paper, a magnifying glass.

00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:37.070
And that's how you
interview costumes.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.070
And it's interesting.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.440
They're kind as recalcitrant
as human interviewees.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.020
They'll tell you some
things and keep other things

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.350
to themselves.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.620
But even if I had
these costumes,

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.630
as I came to understand,
a lot of these

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.090
really only make sense
on and with the body.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.390
They're hard to
understand off the body.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.060
And understandably,
the curators probably

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.310
wouldn't have let me put
them on, convert them, and go

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.060
for a bike ride.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.470
And frankly, these are so small.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.300
This body was not
going to fit into them.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.890
And I'm committed
to this project.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.910
But I haven't been
wearing a corset for it.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.560
So after doing a
lot of this research

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.180
and finding no evidence
of the material garments,

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.860
we figured we had the
instructions in the patents.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.630
We have the step-by-step,
detailed provisions

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.880
by the inventors themselves.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.690
We should make some.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.430
So I've been working
with a team of a patent

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.860
cutter, a weaver, and
an artist to remake

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.450
a collection of these.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:39.120
And I've been calling this
Making Things To Make Sense

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.260
Of Things along the way.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.260
And it builds on a long
history, as you probably

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.920
know, in science and the history
of technology for reproductions

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.150
and replications, where you
explore through practice.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.500
Other forms are kind of
sensory and bodily knowledge

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.470
and ask, what can you
learn from doing this

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.011
that you wouldn't
just get from doing

00:31:57.011 --> 00:31:59.250
textual analysis of a patent?

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.750
And patents provide really
rich instruction for it.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.250
Because the nature
of patent is such

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.041
that the language and
drawings must provide

00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:07.980
full clear and exact description
of inventions such as

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.360
will enable others
skilled in the art which

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.340
it pertains to make use of it.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.340
So in the case of
a clothing patent,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.170
anyone knowledgeable
in the art of sewing

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:20.220
should be able to
reproduce these.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.560
And we also argue that
making these kind of credit

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.270
a relationship with people
who'd lived 130 years before.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.490
We got into this dialogue
with the inventors

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:33.100
through their inventions
and conducted an ethnography

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.470
of making along the way.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.210
And it got incredibly messy,
because I'm a sociologist.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.280
So I don't get a
lot of studio space.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.000
And this is quite a
big sociology office.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.810
But there was lot of
floor work going on here.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.770
So I stuck a camera to
the ceiling, a GoPro,

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.390
and took photographs every 10
seconds for the last six weeks

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.110
of the project-- you can imagine
how much data I have from

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.040
this--

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.237
and made time-lapse films.

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:55.820
So I don't have wanted to show
you, but they're on my website.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.180
And just the amount of
movement and dynamism

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.880
captured from that perspective
became another form of data,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.550
as well as kind of
doing field notes.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:09.170
So we made a collection
of five of these garments.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.120
I said I would make five
skirts, but it really

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.328
doesn't make sense if you
don't make the whole thing.

00:33:13.328 --> 00:33:16.250
So we ended up making about
27 pieces of clothing,

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.690
as well as all the iterations.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.606
Because trying to work
out how to build things

00:33:19.606 --> 00:33:22.130
like pulley systems
into skirts, it

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.890
turns out you need to do a few
iterations at different scales

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.420
to even work out what that is.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.086
Because I don't know
about you, but I've

00:33:28.086 --> 00:33:32.150
never seen a pulley system in
a skirt before this project.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.180
So I'm actually wearing one of
the convertible costumes now.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.910
I'm not normally
dressed like this.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.520
So I can introduce it to you.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.810
Good.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:47.930
I'm wearing a patented
convertible Victorian cycling

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:52.790
costume that was designed by
Alice Bygrave, a dressmaker

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.170
of Brixton in 1895.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.800
She was 35 years old
when she lodged her UK

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.750
patent for improvements
in ladies cycling skirts.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.860
And the aim of the design--

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.840
actually, one thing.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.810
If you've ever patented
or know about patenting,

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.909
you'll be amazed at
how quick this is.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:12.530
The complete
specification was left

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.449
on the 1 of November, 1895.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.840
And it was accepted on
the 6 of December, 1895.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.310
I don't think that
happens anymore.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.143
It's quite exciting.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:24.080
The aim of her
design was to provide

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.030
a skirt that was
proper for wear when

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.810
either on or off the machine.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.110
So she's trying to do
this ambitious thing,

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.620
look like you're in reputable
and respectable street wear

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.530
and then converted
into a cyclewear

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.670
and able to convert
it back again.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.790
So she clearly knew
she was onto something,

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:46.130
because she went on to patent
it in three other countries.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:50.735
She patented it in Switzerland,
in Canada, and in the US.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.210
And a common difficulty
when doing patent studies

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.900
is losing the trail
really quickly.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.760
Often, the inventor's
name get lost

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.450
when a commercial organization
picks up an idea, when they

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.130
rename it, and distribute it.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:12.040
This didn't happen
with Alice Bygrave.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.820
Jaeger, the British fashion
house, picked up this patent,

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.860
clearly recognized
the value of it,

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.620
and proceeded to
distribute the design

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.600
under her name, the
Bygrave Convertible

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.190
Skirt, which is obviously really
good for us in tracing this--

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.050
and as an editorial in
popular cycling magazines,

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.510
and newspapers, and
periodicals started to appear.

00:35:35.096 --> 00:35:36.470
The Bygrave
Convertible Skirt was

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.590
quite a hit that captured
the nation's imagination.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.530
It was regularly demonstrated
at all the big cycling shows.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:46.390
Lots of reviews were
written about it

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.770
in not only the
cycling magazines

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.550
but also in much bigger,
broader newspapers.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.830
And it started to be
distributed all around the UK.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.980
And this is an example of
one of Jaeger's distributors

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.570
that really drives
this forward--

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.570
the new Bygrave Convertible
Skirt, suitable for cycling,

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.770
et cetera.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:09.520
And it was written
about in US media.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.040
Because she traveled over there
in order to lodge a patent

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.080
and do new deals.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.350
So here it is in "The
San Francisco Chronicle"

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.090
and "The St. Louis Times."

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:24.720
And it even wound
its way to Australia.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.280
It was distributed by Jaeger.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.372
And it was sold in David Jones.

00:36:29.372 --> 00:36:30.830
If people know,
it's a big retailer

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.230
that's still around today.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.552
And it was available in
Sydney and in Melbourne--

00:36:34.552 --> 00:36:36.010
and again, was
talked about in lots

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.030
of newspapers around the place.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.710
So this is an example of not
all patents clearly leave

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.445
the patent archive.

00:36:43.445 --> 00:36:44.320
But some of them did.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.930
And this very much did.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:49.960
So before I show you the
invention, a little bit more

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.570
about her family's influences
to kind of understand how

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.820
she got to what she got to--

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.260
her mother was a dressmaker.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.430
And so is Alice Bygrave.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.770
She self-identifies as one.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.630
Her parents had a
watch and clock-making

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:05.565
shop in Chelsea, King's Road.

00:37:05.565 --> 00:37:07.690
And her brother and
sister-in-law were professional

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:09.010
cyclists--

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.220
so watching clock-making,
a bit of sewing,

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.230
cycling coming together.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:17.750
So, what did she design?

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.030
This is one of her drawings.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:25.060
So she's got to be wearing
a corset, don't you think?

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.796
The size of that waist
versus her shoulders--

00:37:27.796 --> 00:37:29.420
anyway, she seems to
be kind of holding

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.280
on to her waist
in some formation.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.780
There's something
going on there.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.363
So this is what you'd
look like as you

00:37:34.363 --> 00:37:37.460
were walking along the street
and not looking like a cyclist.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:42.172
You get to your bicycle,
and then you do this to it.

00:37:42.172 --> 00:37:45.030
So you leave your bicycle,
you'd look like that.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.796
And you'd do this.

00:37:45.796 --> 00:37:48.420
So what she's effectively done--
and I'll move around the front

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.740
now so you can see--

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.990
she's got, effectively, a
very simple A-line skirt

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.600
that otherwise you wouldn't
guess that I was a cyclist.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.310
But then hidden
that the waistband

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.850
are a series of chords
that she has in buttonholes

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.760
that don't have any buttons
that's just part of a system.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.970
And you would ruche up
the front like a curtain.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:10.990
We were starting to call
this a skirtain thing.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.270
And you would tie
it at the waist.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.720
She actually had a much
cleverer design, clearly,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.070
than what we've done with this.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.710
Because I've broken
this several times.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:24.180
It adds a new level of
potential malfunction

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.860
to a talk when you
can ruin your dress,

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.860
as well as your PowerPoint.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.060
And then, usefully, she has a
series of pulleys at the back,

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.785
as well, that she's-- as you can
see, I've got different cords--

00:38:35.785 --> 00:38:37.410
that she's lipped
through to the front.

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.910
So you're not
flapping at the back.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:39.750
You would grab this.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:43.470
And then you would ruche
up the back, as well,

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.790
and tie this off.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:48.210
So then suddenly, you've
revealed some of your bloomers

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:49.286
but not too much of them.

00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:50.660
And I actually
cycled here today,

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.118
because I don't
live very far away.

00:38:52.118 --> 00:38:53.500
And I wasn't going to change.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.750
I thought it might be quicker.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.010
And it really does work.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.760
And you would tie them
off, and hide them.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.100
And then she talked
about how it was still

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.390
kind of an attractive skirt--

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.790
silk festoons, she called
it-- over the hips, which,

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.550
to be honest, I didn't know
what that meant until I started

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.770
to festoon over the hips--

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.144
so incredibly useful.

00:39:12.144 --> 00:39:13.560
But the nice thing,
then, about it

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.600
is that you would
then, once you got off

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.500
your bike-- it's called the
Quick Change Convertible Skirt.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.410
You would undo your knots,
and then drop it straight

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:25.550
back down again.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.140
And then it would just hide.

00:39:34.095 --> 00:39:36.090
And I think what
this research really

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:44.460
highlights is the role of women
as engineers, and as designers,

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.460
and as feminist inventors.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.650
These stories really add
new layers and textures

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:50.730
to cycling history.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.250
They depict women as
critically-engaged, creative

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.842
citizens actively driving
social and technical change.

00:39:56.842 --> 00:39:58.050
And this is really important.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.270
Because with few
exceptions, women

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.600
are mostly framed as being
kind of passive or ornamental

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:07.320
bystanders, caught up in
waves of technical change,

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.460
symbols of social upheaval,
not catalysts of it.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.230
And so what this
research does, it

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.910
sits in the context of
feminist reclamation projects.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.362
Because it brings to light
accounts of women's engagement

00:40:20.362 --> 00:40:22.320
with cycling that
demonstrate they weren't just

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.220
located as bystanders
but actively engaged

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.530
trying to make change.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.350
And they're doing
this by putting

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.830
their radically different clad
bodies out in public space.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.960
But also, claiming their
ideas through patenting

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.300
was not only a practical way
of sharing and distributing

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.390
the ideas, but it was
also a political act.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:45.090
Because they were carving
out new space on the road

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.190
and also in legal
and economic worlds.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.620
They were being talked about
in this whole new world

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.700
of invention.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.850
The annual patent
controller reports

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.920
sounded a little bit
surprised every year

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.470
when they would going to talk
about the statistics of women's

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:03.120
inventiveness, because
it was new in the 1890s.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.810
And also, cyclewear--

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.770
I went into this project to
ask, how does cyclewear matter?

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.000
It's always mattered.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.560
It mattered right
from the beginning.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.810
And it kind of
still matters today.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.880
And although society has changed
dramatically over the last two

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.000
centuries, many
of the issues that

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.320
marginalized women and inhibited
their cycling uptake remain

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.100
remarkably kind of familiar,
such as the assumption

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:30.240
that physical exertion is
incompatible with femininity,

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.940
and how women are still
disproportionately

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.330
harassed in public space often
in relation to what they wear.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.130
These issues are not new.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:41.790
But women have always credibly
and critically responded

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:44.310
to these challenges in order
to do the things that they

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.010
want to do in spite of them.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:52.260
So why do we know so little
about these kind of inventions?

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.971
Who else and what
else don't we know

00:41:53.971 --> 00:41:56.220
about is the questions just
kept on coming out while I

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.350
was doing this kind of stuff.

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:01.170
How many other amazing
ideas are out there,

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:05.610
either hidden, or undervalued,
or erased from our histories?

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.220
How do we seek out
other ideas like this

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.000
or listen to other kind
of silenced voices?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.160
What else could we know?

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.380
And I just want to
leave with a question.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.110
If we learn more about a
wider range of inventors

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:22.920
and inventions, might it change
how we think about and inhabit

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.180
the present?

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.380
And how would it help us imagine
and make different futures?

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.430
