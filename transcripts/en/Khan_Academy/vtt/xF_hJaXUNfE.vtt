00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.030
In this video, I'm going to
attempt to give you an

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.000
intuition behind why
multiplying binomials involve

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.670
combinatorics

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.950
Why we actually have the
binomial coefficients

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.240
in there at all.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.060
And I'm going to do
multiple colors.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.100
The colors will actually be
non-arbitrary this time.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.180
Just to give you an intuition.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.200
So let's multiply a plus
b to the third power.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:30.280
Well, a plus b to the third
power, that's a plus b times--

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.540
and I'm going to keep
switching colors.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.450
You're going to have to bear
with me, but it should

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.260
hopefully be fruitful.-- Times
a plus b, times-- let me pick

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.960
an appropriately different
color, maybe a blue--

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.330
times a plus b.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.820
And let's do this as a
distributive property.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:03.490
This equals a times-- go
back in green-- a plus b.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.370
With a different green.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.010
Want to make sure I use the
right green, just because the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.520
colors matter this time.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.000
a plus b-- this is tedious,
but it's worth it--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.560
plus b times a plus b.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:34.890
And then all of that
times a plus b again.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.450
And let's multiply
this inside part.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.910
I'm just going to keep
it and multiply it out.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:49.690
So it's going to be a times
green a-- we know they're all

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.610
the same a-- plus-- I should do
the pluses in a neutral color,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.050
but it's OK-- plus a times--
you might be finding this

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.300
tedious, but it's going to pay
off in the end-- a times b.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:25.400
Then we have plus b times a,
plus yellow b times green b.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
And then all of that--
we're almost there.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.680
We're almost there.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.580
All of that times a plus b.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.820
And it's essentially,
we're going to multiply

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.320
a times everything.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.220
This blue a times all of
this, and plus this blue

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.080
b times all of this.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.120
So let's multiply the blue
a times all of this.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.195
So the first term will
be yellow a, green

00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:48.540
a, and then blue a.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:03:00.450
So it'll be a, a, a.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.580
Oh it's a different blue, but
I think you get the point.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.650
Plus this times blue a.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:25.260
So yellow a, green b, and then
blue a, plus yellow b, green

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.640
a, blue a-- hopefully I'm
not confusing you-- baa.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.980
b, a, a.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.170
We're almost there.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:45.510
Plus yellow b times
green b times blue a.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.880
So we did all the
blue a's, finally.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.980
There's a blue a.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.210
Plus--.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.750
Now we're going to do the
blue b times everything.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.810
So it's yellow a times green a.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.030
Right?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.290
Yellow a, green a, then blue b,
times green a, times blue b--

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.090
almost there, I know this is
tedious-- times blue

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.990
b, plus yellow a.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.170
Intuition doesn't
come easy, though.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.710
Yellow a-- so we're on
this term-- yellow

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.930
a, green b, blue b.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.110
So green b times blue b.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.810
Now we're at yellow b-- the
good thing about the colors

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.630
is it's easy to keep
track of where we are.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:46.980
Plus yellow b times
green a times blue b.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.090
And then we're at the last one.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:05:01.830
Plus yellow b, green
b, times blue b.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.070
So this is the expansion
of a plus b to the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.890
third power, right?

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.190
We haven't simplified
it at all, and I did

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.870
that for a reason.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.520
Because you see that every term
here-- what's happening here?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.200
Every term has exactly
one-- it's 3 numbers

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.600
being multiplied, right?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.210
Every term is 3 numbers
being multiplied.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.110
And it's one of, you know, the
yellow number comes from the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.770
first-- from this
yellow a plus b.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.810
The green number-- the
middle number-- comes from

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.330
this middle a plus b.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.210
And then the blue number comes
from this right hand a plus b.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.080
And you saw me, I went all
the way through it, right?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.340
So hopefully you
believe this point.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.990
So let's think about it a
couple of different ways.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.550
To generate each of these terms
in the expansion of a plus b to

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.360
the third, we're picking either
a or b from-- from the yellow a

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.880
plus b, we're picking
either a or b.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.060
Right?

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.630
We picked an a here,
we picked an a here.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.920
We picked a b here, a b here,
an a here, an a here, a b--.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.140
And the group from the green
a plus b, we're picking

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.580
either an a or a b.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.760
And then from the blue a
plus b, we're picking

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.090
either an a or a b.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.890
Right?

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.450
So essentially the expansion,
if you think about it, this

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:22.950
expansion-- we've essentially
done every way of choosing

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.100
3 different things.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.910
Every way of picking either
an a or a b, from these

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.130
3 different terms.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.700
And that ends up with
these-- what is this?

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.140
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 terms.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.640
Right?

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.990
Now let's make it a little
bit-- let's give you a

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.150
little bit more intuition
of what's going on.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.640
And I think if you're starting
to realize why this is dealing

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.730
with permutations and
combinations, in particular.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.410
Once we simplify
it, what happens?

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.990
This is a to the cubed, right?

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.130
That's the only a cubed term.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.310
This is a squared b.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.920
What are the other
a squared b terms?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.440
Let's see, a squared b.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.760
This is also a squared b.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.860
So let me write down
all the a squared.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.800
So let's see-- let's
see how many a squared

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.210
b terms there are.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.670
I'll do it in a neutral color.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.000
So this is a squared b.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.360
This is ba squared, but
that's also a squared b.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.490
What's another a squared b?

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.810
This is also a squared b,
right? a times a times b.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.460
So there was 3 ways
to get a squared b.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.800
And that's why when we
eventually write the expansion,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.230
it's going to-- we know that
the coefficient in front of it

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.840
is 3a squared b, right?

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.880
The coefficient on the a
squared b term, when we

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.620
actually multiply it out.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.870
And we've done that several
times already, when we did the

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.360
binomial theorem, which we
took to the third power.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.740
So where did this 3 come from,
and why is that the same thing

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.070
as when we learned the
definition of the

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.730
binomial theorem?

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.770
Why is, you know, does it just
happen to be the case that

00:07:53.770 --> 00:08:01.360
that's the same thing as 3
choose 2 times a squared b?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:01.880
Well, no.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.250
Think of it this way.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.090
We already know that every
term here, every term in the

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.880
expansion, we're essentially
picking either an a or a b

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.970
from each of these, right?

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.500
We have to pick one term
from each of these.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.720
So the way you could think of
it, for a squared b-- to get a

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.410
squared b-- we have to
essentially say, well,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.040
how many combinations?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.990
And that's the key word.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.440
How many combinations are
there, where out of these

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.910
3 a plus b terms, I'm
choosing the a term?

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.920
I'm choosing 2 a terms.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.590
Because to get a squared, I
have to pick an a term twice.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.940
And so that's where I have
to pick 2 a terms out of

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.970
the three times I pick.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.630
So I'm picking three times.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.650
Two of the times, I'm
picking an a term.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.050
So out of three times,
I'm choosing 2.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.560
And that's where 3 choose
2 comes from, for the

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.880
a squared b term.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.950
And so you could, for the ab
squared term, you could say,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.100
well, I'm picking an a once.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.780
How many ways are there to
choose a once when I'm

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.120
taking from 3 things?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.130
So it could be 3 choose 1.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.200
But that's also the same thing,
or should be equal to-- you

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.360
could also say, well, I'm
picking-- how many ways are

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.770
there to pick b twice if
I'm picking three times?

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.870
Well, if it's a b squared,
I'm picking b twice.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.110
So that should be equal to
3 choose 2 ab squared.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.960
And if you work these out, you
will find that, yes, these

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.790
both turn out to be 3.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.480
And actually, that's why
there's some symmetry there,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.330
and the combinations
all work out.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.810
But hopefully, that's
giving you an intuition.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.340
Essentially, when you're
doing the-- so the binomial

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.280
expansion of this--.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.870
Let me just rewrite it again.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.260
You know, this is a
plus b to the third.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:59.150
It's 3 choose 0 of a cubed b to
the zero, plus 3 choose 1 of

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.530
a squared b to the
one, we could say.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:14.860
Plus 3 choose 2 of ab squared,
plus 3 choose 3 of a

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.420
to the zero, b cubed.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.350
So what's this saying?

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.710
What's 3 choose 3 saying?

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.180
How many ways-- if I'm choosing
from 3 different things-- how

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.670
many ways can I pick
exactly 3 b's?

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.490
That's how you can view it.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.200
How many ways can I pick 3 b's?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.750
I'm either picking
an a or a b, right?

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.660
You could say it's either a
heads or tails, or you know,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.570
red or black or white,
but it's either a or b.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.800
How many ways can I choose b
three times from 3 things?

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.990
Well, when you evaluate this,
you get this to b one,

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.830
and that makes sense.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.710
Because it's 1b cubed.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:52.090
And similarly, I mean, you
could view this as how many

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.260
ways, when I'm picking
out of 3 things, can

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.760
I pick exactly 0 b's?

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.670
That's 3 choose [? b. ?]

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.110
How many ways can I
pick exactly 0 b's?

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.780
Well, that's the same thing
as how many ways can

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.760
I pick exactly 3 a's?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.480
This is also 1.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.420
There's only 1 way to do it.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.520
And that's the way.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.710
Once again, there's only
1 way to do this one,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.380
and this was the way.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.220
There's 3 ways to
get a squared b.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.980
There's 3 combinations.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.260
There's 3 possible-- actually,
well, unique permutations.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.610
But they're all the
same combination.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.340
So there's 3 identical
combinations for picking 2 a's

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.490
and a b, and those are this
one, this one, and this one.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.440
So hopefully, I
didn't confuse you.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.830
And hopefully at minimum, that
gives you a glancing intuition

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.040
of why combinations are even
involved in the binomial

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.180
theorem, or whether they're
even involved when you're

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.400
expanding a binomial
to some power.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.020
And at best, I really hope that
I've given you a deep intuition

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.430
for why this happens.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.770
I will see you in
the next video.
