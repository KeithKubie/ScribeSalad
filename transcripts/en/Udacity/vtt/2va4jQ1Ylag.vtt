00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.870
Okay, so I have two copies of the ABO gene, one from my

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.550
mom and one from my dad. And together they make my blood type?

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.410
&gt;&gt; Exectly. And if you have two alleles, then you'll be blood type A.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.010
&gt;&gt; But if I have two B alleles I'll be blood type B. But if I

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.540
have a B and an O allele, I'll be blood type B because O doesn't make anything?

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.920
&gt;&gt; Exactly and the same is true for the A blood type.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.490
You could be Two A aleles, or you can be A and O.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.600
&gt;&gt; But then for AB blood

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.640
type, you'd have to have one A alele and one B alele.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.780
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Now, let's go back to the clinic.
