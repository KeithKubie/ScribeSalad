00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.610
Now that we have our
parametrization right

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.170
over here, let's get down to the
business of actually evaluating

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.350
this surface integral.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.891
It's a little bit
involved, but we'll

00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:11.260
try to do it step by step.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.843
And so the first
thing I'm going to do

00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:17.540
is figure out what d sigma
is in terms of s and t,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.070
in terms of our parameters.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.660
So we can turn this whole
thing into a double integral

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.461
with respect to-- or a double
integral in the s, t plane.

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:27.884
And remember, d sigma
right over here,

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:29.550
it's just a little
chunk of the surface.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.980
It's a little area of the
surface right over there.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.290
And we saw in previous
videos, the ones

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.960
where we learned what
a surface integral even

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.910
is, we saw that d
sigma right over there,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.190
it is equivalent to the
magnitude of the cross product

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.380
of the partial of our
parametrization with respect

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.100
to one parameter crossed
with the parametrization

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.090
with respect to
the other parameter

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.424
times the differentials
of each of the parameters.

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:02.340
So this is what we're
going to use right here.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.810
It's a pretty simple looking
statement, but as we'll see,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.980
taking cross products tend
to get a little bit hairy.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.680
Especially cross products of
three dimensional vectors.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.080
But we'll do it step by step.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840
But before we even
take the cross product,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.180
we first have to take the
partial of this with respect

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.260
to s, and then the partial
of this with respect to t.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.950
So first, let's take the
partial with respect to s--

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.830
the partial of r
with respect to s.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.120
So right over here, all
the stuff with the t in it,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.840
you can just view
that as a constant.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.510
So cosine of t isn't
going to change.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.190
The partial of-- or the
derivative of cosine of s

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.337
with respect to s is
negative sine of s.

00:01:38.337 --> 00:01:39.920
So this is going to
be equal to-- I'll

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.830
put the negative out front--
negative cosine of t sine of s.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.940
I'm going to keep everything
that has a t involved purple.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.900
Sine of s.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.410
And let me make-- I don't know.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.240
I'll make the vectors orange--
i, and then you we'll plus

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.110
and once again, we'll take the
derivative with respect to s,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.250
cosine of t is just a
constant, derivative

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.650
of sine of s with respect
to s is cosine of s.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:17.540
So it's going to be plus
cosine of t cosine of s j.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.670
And then plus the derivative
of this with respect to s.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.920
Well, this is just a constant.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.112
The derivative of 5 with
respect to s would just be 0.

00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:29.070
This is the same thing.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.820
It's just a constant
with-- this does not

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.410
change with respect to s.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.140
So it does-- so our partial here
with respect to s is just 0.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.600
So we could write even 0k.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.827
Let me write 0-- I'll just
write 0k right over there.

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:44.410
And that's nice to
see because that'll

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.830
make our cross product a little
bit more straightforward.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.540
Now, let's take the
partial with respect to t.

00:02:59.372 --> 00:03:00.855
all right.

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:02.980
And we get-- so the derivative
of this with respect

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.020
to t-- now, cosine
of s is the constant.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.180
Derivative of cosine
t with respect to t

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.800
is negative sine of t.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:21.540
So this is going to be negative
sine of t cosine of s i--

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.630
I'll do it in that-- I'll
use this blue-- i, and then

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.750
plus-- now derivative of
this with respect to t.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.240
Derivative of cosine of
t is negative sine of t.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:41.970
So once again, so now we have
minus sine of t sine of s--

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.610
my hand is already
hurting from this.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.770
This is a painful problem.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.709
j plus derivative of sine
of t with respect to t.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.500
We're taking the partial
with respect to t.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.120
It's just cosine of t.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.840
So plus cosine of t.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.990
And now times the k unit vector.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.120
Now we're ready to take the
cross product of these two

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.647
characters right over here.

00:04:04.647 --> 00:04:06.980
And to take the cross products--
let me write this down.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.396
So we're going to
say, we're going

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:12.735
to take the cross product
of that with that.

00:04:12.735 --> 00:04:14.110
Is going to be
equal to-- and I'm

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.936
going to set up
this huge matrix.

00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:18.769
Or, it's really just a
three by three matrix

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.019
but it's going to
be huge because it's

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.643
going to take up a
lot of space to have

00:04:21.643 --> 00:04:22.950
to write down all this stuff.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.360
So maybe I'll take up
about that much space

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.800
so that I have space to work in.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.990
And I'll write my
unit vectors up here.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.740
i, j, k.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.970
Or at least this is
how I like to remember

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.070
how to take cross products
of three dimensional vectors.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.160
Take the determinant
of this three

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.890
by three matrix-- the
first row are just

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.800
our unit vectors-- the second
row is the first vector

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.690
that I'm taking the
cross product of.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.922
So this is going to be negative.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.880
I'm just going to rewrite
this right over here.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.775
So it's going to be negative
cosine of t sine of s.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.670
And then you have
cosine of t cosine of s.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.840
And then you have 0
which will hopefully

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.940
simplify our calculations.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.750
And then you have the next
vector, that's the third row.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.301
Negative sine of t cosine of s.

00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:21.050
And I encourage you
to do this on your own

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.320
if you already know
where this is going.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.045
It's good practice.

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:24.794
Even if you have to
watch this whole thing

00:05:24.794 --> 00:05:27.170
to see how it's done, try to
then do it again on your own

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.627
because this is
one of those things

00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:30.970
you really got to do yourself
to really have it sit in.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.330
Negative sine of t sine of s.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.040
And then finally, cosine of t.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.360
So let's take the
determinant now.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.330
So first we'll think
about our i component.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.110
Are i component, you
would essentially

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.910
ignore this column-- the first
column in the first row--

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.870
and then take the determinant of
this submatrix right over here.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.380
So it's going to
be i-- so this is

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.417
going to be equal to
i times something.

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:01.250
I'll put the something
in parentheses there.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.250
Normally you see the
something in front of the i

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.520
but you can swap them there.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.030
So let me just-- so it's
going to be i times something.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.750
Ignore this column, that row.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.310
This determinant is cosine of t
cosine of s times cosine of t,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.140
which is going to be
cosine squared of t.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.390
Let me write it a little neater.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.960
Cosine squared of t cosine of s.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.340
And then from that we need
to subtract 0 times this.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.947
But that's just going to be 0
so we're just left with that.

00:06:28.947 --> 00:06:30.530
Now we're going to
do the j component.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.529
But you probably remember
the checkerboard thing

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:35.000
when you have to evaluate
three by three matrices.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.910
Positive, negative, positive.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.490
So you will have a negative--
you write a negative j.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.180
A negative coefficient, I
guess, in front of the j times

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.170
something.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.890
And so you ignore
j's column, j's row.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.460
And so you have negative
cosine of t sine

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.220
of s times cosine of t.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.250
Well, that's going
to be negative cosine

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.657
squared of t times sine of s.

00:07:00.657 --> 00:07:02.240
Let me make sure I'm
doing that right.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.410
Ignore that and that.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.170
It's going to be
that times that.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.190
So yep.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.430
Negative cosine sine of
s minus 0 times that.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.756
And so that's just going to
be 0, so we can ignore it.

00:07:13.756 --> 00:07:15.630
And you have a negative
times a negative here

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.900
so they can both
become positive.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.770
And then finally, you
have the k component.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.853
And once again, you can
go back to positive there.

00:07:21.853 --> 00:07:24.120
Positive, negative, positive
on the coefficients.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.420
That's just evaluating
a three by three matrix.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.530
And then you have plus
k times-- and now this

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.030
might get a little
bit more involved

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.540
because we won't have
the 0 to help us out.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.180
Ignore this row,
ignore this column,

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.840
take the determinant
of this sub two by two.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.350
You have negative
cosine t sine s times

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.004
negative sine of t sine s.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.170
Well, that's going to be--
the negatives cancel out.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.420
So it's going to
be cosine of t sine

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.340
of t times sine squared of s.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.800
And then, from that
we're going to subtract

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.214
the product of these two things.

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:03.880
But that product is
going to be negative

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.338
so you subtract a
negative-- that's

00:08:05.338 --> 00:08:07.030
the same thing as
adding a positive.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.880
So plus-- and you're going to
have cosine t sine t again--

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.410
plus cosine t-- let me scroll
to the right a little bit--

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.230
plus cosine t sine t again.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.560
And that's times
cosine squared of s.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.720
Now this is already
looking pretty hairy

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.883
but it already looks like
a simplification there.

00:08:31.883 --> 00:08:33.549
And that's where the
colors are helpful.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.360
Actually, now I have
trouble doing math

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.909
in anything other than
multiple pastel colors

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.659
because this actually
makes it much easier

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.524
to see some patterns.

00:08:41.524 --> 00:08:42.940
And so what we can
do over here is

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.520
we can factor out
the cosine t sine t.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.720
And so this is equal to
cosine t sine t times sine

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.810
squared s plus cosine squared s.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.700
And this we know the
definition of the unit circle.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.500
This is just going
to be equal to 1.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.270
So that was a significant
simplification.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.860
And so now we get
our cross product

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.050
being equal to-- let
me just rewrite it all.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.560
Our cross product.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:19.950
r sub s crossed with r sub t
is going to be equal to cosine

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:33.000
squared t cosine s times our i
unit vector plus cosine squared

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:45.150
t cosine sine of s
times our j unit vector

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:51.130
plus-- all we have left because
this is just 1-- cosine t sine

00:09:51.130 --> 00:10:01.900
t times our k unit vector.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.567
So that was pretty good
but we're still not done.

00:10:04.567 --> 00:10:06.650
We need to figure out the
magnitude of this thing.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.610
Remember, d sigma
simplified to the magnitude

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.987
of this thing times ds dt.

00:10:10.987 --> 00:10:13.070
So let's figure out what
the magnitude of that is.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.528
And this is really
the home stretch

00:10:14.528 --> 00:10:16.100
so I'm really
crossing my fingers

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.870
that I don't make any
careless mistakes now.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:24.550
So the magnitude of
all of this business

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.750
is going to be equal
to the square root--

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.850
and I'm just going to
square each of these terms

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.433
and then add them
up-- the square root

00:10:31.433 --> 00:10:34.370
of the sum of the squares
of each of those terms.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.800
So the square of
this is going to be--

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.680
cosine squared squared is
cosine to the fourth-- cosine

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:47.760
to the fourth t cosine
squared of s plus cosine

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.670
to the fourth t sine
squared s-- and I already

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:58.560
see a pattern jumping
out-- plus cosine

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.370
squared t sine squared t.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.530
Now, the first pattern
I see is this--

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.420
is just this first
part right over here.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.680
We can factor out a
cosine to the fourth t.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.970
Then we get something
like this happening again.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.700
So let's do that.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.350
So these first two terms
are equal to cosine

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:24.090
to the fourth t times cosine
squared s plus sine squared s.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.050
Which, once again,
we know is just 1.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.690
So this whole expression
has simplified

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.390
to cosine to the fourth t
plus cosine squared t sine

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.380
squared t.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.400
Now we can attempt to
simplify this again

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.900
because this term
and this term both

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.310
have a cosine squared t in them.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.627
So let's factor those out.

00:11:42.627 --> 00:11:44.460
So this is going to be
equal to-- everything

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.050
I'm doing is under
the radical sign.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:51.670
So this is going to be
equal to a cosine squared

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.450
t times cosine squared t.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.450
And when you factor out
a cosine squared t here,

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.230
you just have a plus
a sine squared t.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.410
And that's nice because that,
once again, simplified to 1.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.024
All of this is under
the radical sign.

00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:07.940
Maybe I'll keep drawing
the radical signs here

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.300
to make it clear that
all this is still

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.520
under the radical sign.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.580
And then this is really,
really useful for us

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.180
because the square root
of cosine squared of t

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.470
is just going to be cosine of t.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.770
So all of that business
actually finally simplified

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.510
to something pretty
straightforward.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:30.230
So all of this is just going
to be equal to cosine of t.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.260
So going back to what
we wanted before,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.130
we want to rewrite what d sigma.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.180
It's just cosine t ds dt.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.830
so let me write that down.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.050
So d sigma-- and then we can
use this for the next part-- d

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:48.130
sigma is equal to
cosine of t ds dt.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.680
And I'll see you
in the next part.
