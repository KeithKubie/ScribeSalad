JULIAN
When I become president of these United States,

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:12.490
I solemnly swear that the voices of every
man, woman, and baboon will be heard!

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.730

*face*

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.981
JULIAN
Hello participating members of society, Julian

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:19.700
and my running mate Trace here for DNews.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.570
Two and a half thousand years ago, some ancient
Greek people got together in Athens and decided

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.480
that not having a say in their government
was a bunch of minotaur skata.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.500
TRACE
They decided there should be a system where

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.430
everyone, well, men at least, could have an
equal say in decision making, and they named

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.579
their new system Demokratia, which translates
to Power of the People.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.910
JULIAN
Right on!

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.879
This has for the most part been regarded as
a step in the right direction.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.079
Getting together, coming to a decision with
equal voices regardless of our position in

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.079
society.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.289
It’s what separates us from monkeys.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.979
*pause*
I’m totally kidding, monkeys do that too,

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.420
as observed by researchers from the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.469
TRACE
The researchers tracked the movements of a

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.659
troop of olive baboons in Kenya and found
that every member of the troop had an equal

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.489
say in where they all went.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.719
JULIAN
This was surprising, because olive baboons

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.020
have a strong social hierarchy, and dominant
members get choice picks of food or mates

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.360
over their subordinates.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.840
But when it comes to trekking across the savannah,
olive baboons move more like a school of fish

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840
or flock of birds.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.491
TRACE
In other words, no dominant members of the

00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:22.229
troop had a disproportionate say on where
the entire gang went.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.500
When two monkeys started moving in different
directions, the rest of the troop would decide

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.969
which to follow, and eventually the whole
group would go with the decision of the majority.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.939
And if the two initiators picked directions
that were similar, the group would choose

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.300
a path that split the difference.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.300
They compromised!

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.049
Americans are more stubborn than baboons!

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.149
JULIAN
That's going to knock us in the polls.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.310
You may be thinking that, sure, group based
decision making may not be uniquely human,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.100
but it sounds like a primate thing at most.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.079
Well it’s not, democracy has been observed
in… bees.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.200
I know, bees have a “queen” so you might
think that technically makes them a monarchy.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.280
But the queen only has that title because
she gave birth to everyone in the colony,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.690
it’s exactly how British people work.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.570
TRACE
I would like to state on behalf of DNews that

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.409
that is not a thing.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.110
Anyway, and like England’s constitutional
monarchy, the people, I guess in this case

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.740
bee-ple, have a say in some issues.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.110
If the hive is deciding it’s time to choose
a new location, bees who are in the know weigh

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.050
in on the benefits of the potential sites.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.870
Size, flower density, humidity, amount of
honey they'd have to put into the NHS…

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.170
JULIAN
The National Honey Service.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.860
TRACE
Then the individual bees vote using the power

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.890
of dance, and once they have enough bees in
on the dance craze they brexit their old hive

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.100
and head to the site the majority picked with
the queen in tow.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.090
JULIAN
Of course, some bees will stay behind at the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.290
old site where new queens are hatched.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.750
Usually the first queen to mature breaks out
and murders the other infant queens to establish

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.490
herself at the top.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.780
TRACE
However if the original colony was very large,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.840
then the bees will actually send out two new
groups to set up colonies, and the second

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.920
group needs a strong queen of their own.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.930
JULIAN
In order to find out which potential queen

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.540
is most Bee-once, the workers will actually
protect all the developing queens until they

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.710
hatch, and then let them fight to the death.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.210
You can think of it as an election.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.300
TRACE
Of course not all animals or insects that

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.010
live in groups have democratic systems.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.840
Wolf packs or ant colonies don’t work like
baboons or bees because their strategy seems

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.970
to be working for them so far.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.880
JULIAN
Will democracy turn out to be the system that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.640
leads to long term success for you in particular
and our species as a whole?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.440
There’s only one way to find out, and that’s
to participate in it.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.510
Sometimes in a democracy people use their
voice to elect someone who would rather the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.630
people shut up.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.710
To learn why this odd hybrid called an authoritarian
democracy happens, check out Trace’s video

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.700
here.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:04:15.600
TRACE
Do you think 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.040
more than half the people are right more than
half the time, or would you vote to scrap

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.530
democracy and try something else?
