MARTY JOHNSON: It's only eight
miles between campus and here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.600
This is one of the wealthiest
counties in the country, and

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.510
this is one of the poorest urban
areas in the country.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.120
MARIA FLORES-MILLS: I think
particularly for student

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.830
athletes, their focus is so much
about their sports and

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.020
their academics over the year
that this represents probably

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.610
a unique opportunity that
otherwise might not fit into

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.940
their schedules, but is another
way of them stepping

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.970
outside of the Princeton bubble,
actually seeing some

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.420
of their theories and class
work in action.

LUKE TAYLOR: Obviously, one
afternoon is just a drop in

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.980
the bucket.


00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.060
But I think the major impact
that an afternoon like this

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.330
does is raise awareness among
student athletes at Princeton

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.840
in terms of how we can interact
with the community,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.930
and what changes we can
make on a large scale.

JIM SIMON: Volunteer groups
allow us to have a lot of

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.350
diverse projects going on at one
time and be able to kind

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.870
of fill the demand for they're
getting things done

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.980
when we need it.


00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.710
In this site here we're putting
in raised beds so we

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.280
can have some space for
production, but we're also

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.750
going to put in a small
greenhouse so we could make

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.720
use of the off-season
for growing.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.140
But can also have this as
a place where we can do

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.870
demonstrations, maybe composting
workshops, have a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.170
small greenhouse, do other
sorts of functions, do

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.650
environmental education
activities.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.080
So a lot of multi-use space here
for urban agriculture.

BRANDON GLYCK: It's always a
great experience when you can

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.540
bring together all the athletes
on campus to do

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.010
something community-oriented
like this.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.930
You don't always get to stay
in touch with a lot of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.650
different athletes
because everybody

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.300
has different seasons.


00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.380
Something like this is just a
great opportunity to bring

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.630
everybody together.

BOB CALLAHAN: First off, real
credit to the Princeton

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.570
Varsity Club to set up this
relationship in the first

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.970
place because it makes it
extra special as it is a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.140
Princeton alumnus--


00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.960
someone who has left school, was
an athlete here, but when

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.250
they left school decided to stay
in public service in a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.190
way, and donating their
time and efforts

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.630
to improve the community.


00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.890
It's nice to be able to connect
different generations

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.110
of Princeton alumni.
