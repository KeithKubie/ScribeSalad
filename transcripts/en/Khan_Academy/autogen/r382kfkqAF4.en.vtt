00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149
we've already seen several videos where

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159
we've already seen several videos where
 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.700
we've already seen several videos where
we one learned what the Pythagorean

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710
we one learned what the Pythagorean
 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.829
we one learned what the Pythagorean
theorem is and how it can be applied to

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
theorem is and how it can be applied to
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.440
theorem is and how it can be applied to
find the sides of right triangles and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
find the sides of right triangles and
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.209
find the sides of right triangles and
even to find the distances between

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219
even to find the distances between
 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.390
even to find the distances between
points on the Cartesian plane so this

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
points on the Cartesian plane so this
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.050
points on the Cartesian plane so this
the Pythagorean theorem and just as a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
the Pythagorean theorem and just as a
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.019
the Pythagorean theorem and just as a
bit of a review it tells us that if I

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
bit of a review it tells us that if I
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.380
bit of a review it tells us that if I
have a right triangle if I have a right

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
have a right triangle if I have a right
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.730
have a right triangle if I have a right
triangle and if C is the side opposite

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
triangle and if C is the side opposite
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.859
triangle and if C is the side opposite
the right angle right that's my right

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
the right angle right that's my right
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.200
the right angle right that's my right
angle C is that side it's the longest

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
angle C is that side it's the longest
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.310
angle C is that side it's the longest
side we called that the hypotenuse

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320
side we called that the hypotenuse
 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.600
side we called that the hypotenuse
hypotenuse I'll write the whole word hi

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
hypotenuse I'll write the whole word hi
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.119
hypotenuse I'll write the whole word hi
pot hi pot in use then the square of the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
pot hi pot in use then the square of the
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.279
pot hi pot in use then the square of the
other sides the sum of the squares of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
other sides the sum of the squares of
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810
other sides the sum of the squares of
the other side will be equal to C

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
the other side will be equal to C
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.750
the other side will be equal to C
squared so if this side is a this side

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
squared so if this side is a this side
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.450
squared so if this side is a this side
is B the Pythagorean theorem tells us

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
is B the Pythagorean theorem tells us
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.290
is B the Pythagorean theorem tells us
that a squared plus B squared is going

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
that a squared plus B squared is going
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.430
that a squared plus B squared is going
to be equal to C squared and we did

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
to be equal to C squared and we did
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380
to be equal to C squared and we did
several problems where we use this to

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
several problems where we use this to
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.230
several problems where we use this to
solve different triangles what I want to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
solve different triangles what I want to
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.460
solve different triangles what I want to
show you in this video is really a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
show you in this video is really a
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.010
show you in this video is really a
visual you can view it as a visual proof

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
visual you can view it as a visual proof
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.740
visual you can view it as a visual proof
of the Pythagorean theorem to see why

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
of the Pythagorean theorem to see why
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230
of the Pythagorean theorem to see why
this actually makes sense and to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
this actually makes sense and to
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.789
this actually makes sense and to
understand that I'm going to draw a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
understand that I'm going to draw a
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.249
understand that I'm going to draw a
little bit of a diagram here so let's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
little bit of a diagram here so let's
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010
little bit of a diagram here so let's
let me draw a little right triangle here

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
let me draw a little right triangle here
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.280
let me draw a little right triangle here
so let's say that that is my right

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
so let's say that that is my right
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.950
so let's say that that is my right
triangle and let's say that this is a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
triangle and let's say that this is a
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.130
triangle and let's say that this is a
this is B that is my right angle then

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
this is B that is my right angle then
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.859
this is B that is my right angle then
that right there this right here that

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
that right there this right here that
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.830
that right there this right here that
length right there is C now what I'm

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
length right there is C now what I'm
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.210
length right there is C now what I'm
going to do is draw this exact same

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
going to do is draw this exact same
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100
going to do is draw this exact same
triangle but I'm going to rotate it a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
triangle but I'm going to rotate it a
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.480
triangle but I'm going to rotate it a
little bit you're going to see what I'm

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
little bit you're going to see what I'm
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.219
little bit you're going to see what I'm
talking about this right here is the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
talking about this right here is the
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.480
talking about this right here is the
exact same triangle that I just drew

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490
exact same triangle that I just drew
 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.960
exact same triangle that I just drew
except I rotated it so this is a this is

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
except I rotated it so this is a this is
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.410
except I rotated it so this is a this is
B and now this is C you this is the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
B and now this is C you this is the
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880
B and now this is C you this is the
exact you could you could do this you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
exact you could you could do this you
 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.170
exact you could you could do this you
know you could you could take a ruler

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
know you could you could take a ruler
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.670
know you could you could take a ruler
out and actually do it in a you know

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
out and actually do it in a you know
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.020
out and actually do it in a you know
pick up the a B and C and you can

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
pick up the a B and C and you can
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.999
pick up the a B and C and you can
actually get you just rotate this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
actually get you just rotate this
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.800
actually get you just rotate this
triangle around to the right like this

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
triangle around to the right like this
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.450
triangle around to the right like this
you could just rotate it like that and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
you could just rotate it like that and
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.459
you could just rotate it like that and
you would get this triangle right just

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
you would get this triangle right just
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.589
you would get this triangle right just
like that now I'm going to rotate it

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
like that now I'm going to rotate it
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.260
like that now I'm going to rotate it
again I'm going to rotate it again and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
again I'm going to rotate it again and
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.790
again I'm going to rotate it again and
I'm just going to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
I'm just going to
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.560
I'm just going to
you can imagine copy and pasting it and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570
you can imagine copy and pasting it and
 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.800
you can imagine copy and pasting it and
then I will get this triangle I will get

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
then I will get this triangle I will get
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.990
then I will get this triangle I will get
that triangle just like that and once

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000
that triangle just like that and once
 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.600
that triangle just like that and once
again this is a this is B and this is C

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610
again this is a this is B and this is C
 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.310
again this is a this is B and this is C
these are all these triangles are all

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320
these are all these triangles are all
 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440
these are all these triangles are all
the exact same triangle the exact same

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
the exact same triangle the exact same
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.200
the exact same triangle the exact same
measure now let me rotate this again and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210
measure now let me rotate this again and
 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.730
measure now let me rotate this again and
I'll get this triangle I will get I will

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740
I'll get this triangle I will get I will
 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.320
I'll get this triangle I will get I will
get this triangle right here and once

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
get this triangle right here and once
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.660
get this triangle right here and once
again this is a this length right here

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
again this is a this length right here
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.360
again this is a this length right here
is a this length right here is B and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
is a this length right here is B and
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.370
is a this length right here is B and
this is the hypotenuse of this right

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380
this is the hypotenuse of this right
 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.150
this is the hypotenuse of this right
angle this is C now what do we have here

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
angle this is C now what do we have here
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.370
angle this is C now what do we have here
what do we have here we have all of

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
what do we have here we have all of
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.040
what do we have here we have all of
these right angles and inside I have

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
these right angles and inside I have
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.550
these right angles and inside I have
this other square that is inscribed into

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
this other square that is inscribed into
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.920
this other square that is inscribed into
this right angle and I can prove to you

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930
this right angle and I can prove to you
 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.310
this right angle and I can prove to you
if you like that these are also these

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320
if you like that these are also these
 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.820
if you like that these are also these
are also right angles and you know why

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830
are also right angles and you know why
 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.530
are also right angles and you know why
don't I just show it to you you might

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
don't I just show it to you you might
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.660
don't I just show it to you you might
you may or may not already be familiar

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
you may or may not already be familiar
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.730
you may or may not already be familiar
that the angles in a triangle add up to

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740
that the angles in a triangle add up to
 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.450
that the angles in a triangle add up to
180 so if you call if you call this

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460
180 so if you call if you call this
 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.530
180 so if you call if you call this
angle X you call this angle Y we know

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540
angle X you call this angle Y we know
 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.130
angle X you call this angle Y we know
that X plus y plus 90 degrees have to be

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140
that X plus y plus 90 degrees have to be
 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.560
that X plus y plus 90 degrees have to be
equal to 180 so X plus y plus 90 have to

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570
equal to 180 so X plus y plus 90 have to
 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.090
equal to 180 so X plus y plus 90 have to
be equal to 180 or you could say that if

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100
be equal to 180 or you could say that if
 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.950
be equal to 180 or you could say that if
you subtract 90 from both sides of this

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960
you subtract 90 from both sides of this
 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.550
you subtract 90 from both sides of this
equation X plus y are going to be equal

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560
equation X plus y are going to be equal
 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.890
equation X plus y are going to be equal
to 90 I just subtracted 90 from both

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
to 90 I just subtracted 90 from both
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.700
to 90 I just subtracted 90 from both
sides this disappears 180 minus 90 is 90

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710
sides this disappears 180 minus 90 is 90
 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.490
sides this disappears 180 minus 90 is 90
and this x and y they're all over if

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
and this x and y they're all over if
 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.190
and this x and y they're all over if
this angle is X right here so is this

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
this angle is X right here so is this
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.930
this angle is X right here so is this
angle because the exact same triangle so

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
angle because the exact same triangle so
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.200
angle because the exact same triangle so
is this angle so is this angle if this

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210
is this angle so is this angle if this
 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.750
is this angle so is this angle if this
angle is y so is that angle so is that

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760
angle is y so is that angle so is that
 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.580
angle is y so is that angle so is that
angle and so is that angle now you may

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590
angle and so is that angle now you may
 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.190
angle and so is that angle now you may
already or may or may not already know

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200
already or may or may not already know
 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.640
already or may or may not already know
that if you have three angles that form

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650
that if you have three angles that form
 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.699
that if you have three angles that form
a line so let me draw it if you have

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709
a line so let me draw it if you have
 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.070
a line so let me draw it if you have
three angles that form a line like this

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080
three angles that form a line like this
 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.580
three angles that form a line like this
so let's say we have angle a angle B and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590
so let's say we have angle a angle B and
 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.450
so let's say we have angle a angle B and
angle

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460
angle
 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.310
angle
let me draw be a little bit different

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320
let me draw be a little bit different
 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.120
let me draw be a little bit different
angle

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130
angle
 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.750
angle
eeee and angle see just like that and

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760
eeee and angle see just like that and
 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.970
eeee and angle see just like that and
together they kind of form a you could

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980
together they kind of form a you could
 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.370
together they kind of form a you could
imagine a semicircle or they go from one

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380
imagine a semicircle or they go from one
 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.770
imagine a semicircle or they go from one
line all the way back that a B plus C

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780
line all the way back that a B plus C
 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.140
line all the way back that a B plus C
are going to be equal to 180 a plus B

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150
are going to be equal to 180 a plus B
 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.070
are going to be equal to 180 a plus B
plus C is going to be equal to 180

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080
plus C is going to be equal to 180
 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.640
plus C is going to be equal to 180
degrees they complete a 180 degree arc

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650
degrees they complete a 180 degree arc
 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.880
degrees they complete a 180 degree arc
now if you look at let's say this point

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890
now if you look at let's say this point
 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.510
now if you look at let's say this point
right here on our diagram you can see

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520
right here on our diagram you can see
 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.480
right here on our diagram you can see
that the angle X plus this angle right

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490
that the angle X plus this angle right
 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.930
that the angle X plus this angle right
here which I'll call it well I'll just

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940
here which I'll call it well I'll just
 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.300
here which I'll call it well I'll just
call it what should I call it I could

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310
call it what should I call it I could
 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.310
call it what should I call it I could
call it angle Z X plus Z plus y is going

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320
call it angle Z X plus Z plus y is going
 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.590
call it angle Z X plus Z plus y is going
to be equal to 180 degrees they form a

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600
to be equal to 180 degrees they form a
 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.280
to be equal to 180 degrees they form a
line so X plus Z plus y or maybe I

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290
line so X plus Z plus y or maybe I
 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.730
line so X plus Z plus y or maybe I
should write it as X plus y plus Z is

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740
should write it as X plus y plus Z is
 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.460
should write it as X plus y plus Z is
equal to 180 now we already know that X

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470
equal to 180 now we already know that X
 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.000
equal to 180 now we already know that X
plus y is equal to 90 so this is equal

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010
plus y is equal to 90 so this is equal
 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.080
plus y is equal to 90 so this is equal
to 90 so 90 plus Z is equal to 180 Z

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090
to 90 so 90 plus Z is equal to 180 Z
 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.030
to 90 so 90 plus Z is equal to 180 Z
minus or both sides of this equation

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040
minus or both sides of this equation
 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.850
minus or both sides of this equation
minus 90 degrees you get 180 minus 90

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860
minus 90 degrees you get 180 minus 90
 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.130
minus 90 degrees you get 180 minus 90
I just subtracting 90 from both sides so

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140
I just subtracting 90 from both sides so
 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.880
I just subtracting 90 from both sides so
Z is equal to 90 degrees so this is

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890
Z is equal to 90 degrees so this is
 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.800
Z is equal to 90 degrees so this is
definitely these are all 90-degree

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810
definitely these are all 90-degree
 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.590
definitely these are all 90-degree
angles inside their sides are all the

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600
angles inside their sides are all the
 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.890
angles inside their sides are all the
same length of C so this is a square in

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900
same length of C so this is a square in
 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.820
same length of C so this is a square in
the middle of this diagram now let's

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830
the middle of this diagram now let's
 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.650
the middle of this diagram now let's
take a little bit let's think a little

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660
take a little bit let's think a little
 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.560
take a little bit let's think a little
bit about what the area of the square is

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570
bit about what the area of the square is
 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.750
bit about what the area of the square is
and there's two ways there's two ways we

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760
and there's two ways there's two ways we
 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.910
and there's two ways there's two ways we
can come up with the area of that square

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920
can come up with the area of that square
 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.560
can come up with the area of that square
so let me draw something here so the

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570
so let me draw something here so the
 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.060
so let me draw something here so the
first easy way to think of the area of

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070
first easy way to think of the area of
 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.280
first easy way to think of the area of
square was to square this length is C

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290
square was to square this length is C
 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.440
square was to square this length is C
that length is C to figure out the area

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450
that length is C to figure out the area
 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.300
that length is C to figure out the area
I just met one side by the other side

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310
I just met one side by the other side
 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.960
I just met one side by the other side
it's C times C or C squared so if I want

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970
it's C times C or C squared so if I want
 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.280
it's C times C or C squared so if I want
the area of that right there it is

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290
the area of that right there it is
 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.980
the area of that right there it is
C squared C times C area is equal to C

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990
C squared C times C area is equal to C
 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.220
C squared C times C area is equal to C
squared but how else could we figure out

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230
squared but how else could we figure out
 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.240
squared but how else could we figure out
that area well we could figure out we

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250
that area well we could figure out we
 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.100
that area well we could figure out we
could say well it's also that would be

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110
could say well it's also that would be
 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.680
could say well it's also that would be
the area of this larger square of this

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690
the area of this larger square of this
 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.810
the area of this larger square of this
whole square over here

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820
whole square over here
 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.030
whole square over here
right - - the area of these triangles -

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040
right - - the area of these triangles -
 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.910
right - - the area of these triangles -
the area of this triangles that also

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920
the area of this triangles that also
 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.460
the area of this triangles that also
would give us the area of that inside

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470
would give us the area of that inside
 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.130
would give us the area of that inside
square so what is the area of this

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140
square so what is the area of this
 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.670
square so what is the area of this
outside bigger square well each of its

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680
outside bigger square well each of its
 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.080
outside bigger square well each of its
sides are a plus B a plus B and so you

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090
sides are a plus B a plus B and so you
 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.970
sides are a plus B a plus B and so you
take a plus B if you want the area you

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980
take a plus B if you want the area you
 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.310
take a plus B if you want the area you
could say a plus B times a plus B or a

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320
could say a plus B times a plus B or a
 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.390
could say a plus B times a plus B or a
plus B squared right that's the area of

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400
plus B squared right that's the area of
 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.480
plus B squared right that's the area of
the outer of the outer square but we

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490
the outer of the outer square but we
 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.250
the outer of the outer square but we
still to get the area of our inner

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260
still to get the area of our inner
 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.970
still to get the area of our inner
square let me the area of small square

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980
square let me the area of small square
 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.580
square let me the area of small square
area of small square we still have to

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590
area of small square we still have to
 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.380
area of small square we still have to
subtract out the area of these triangles

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.390
subtract out the area of these triangles
 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.790
subtract out the area of these triangles
and what are the areas of these

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800
and what are the areas of these
 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.070
and what are the areas of these
triangles well the area of each of them

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080
triangles well the area of each of them
 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.410
triangles well the area of each of them
so we have to subtract out the area of

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420
so we have to subtract out the area of
 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.150
so we have to subtract out the area of
each of them is one half times base

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160
each of them is one half times base
 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.150
each of them is one half times base
times height or a base times height a be

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160
times height or a base times height a be
 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.390
times height or a base times height a be
1/2 a B that's how big that's the area

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400
1/2 a B that's how big that's the area
 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.940
1/2 a B that's how big that's the area
of each of these triangles now we have 1

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:38.950
of each of these triangles now we have 1
 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.160
of each of these triangles now we have 1
2 3 4 of these triangles so it's 4 times

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.170
2 3 4 of these triangles so it's 4 times
 

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.830
2 3 4 of these triangles so it's 4 times
1/2 a B this is another way of getting

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840
1/2 a B this is another way of getting
 

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.040
1/2 a B this is another way of getting
the area of this inside of this inside

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.050
the area of this inside of this inside
 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.500
the area of this inside of this inside
smaller square now let's just do a

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.510
smaller square now let's just do a
 

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.700
smaller square now let's just do a
little bit of algebra we're pretty

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:53.710
little bit of algebra we're pretty
 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.190
little bit of algebra we're pretty
familiar with this to essentially

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.200
familiar with this to essentially
 

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.260
familiar with this to essentially
simplify the right-hand side of this

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.270
simplify the right-hand side of this
 

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.350

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.140
plus B a times a is a squared plus 2 a B
plus B squared and then we have - what

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.150
plus B squared and then we have - what
 

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.570
plus B squared and then we have - what
do we have right here - to a B right 4

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:12.580
do we have right here - to a B right 4
 

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.920
do we have right here - to a B right 4
times 1/2 is 2 so minus 2 a B well these

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:16.930
times 1/2 is 2 so minus 2 a B well these
 

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.980
times 1/2 is 2 so minus 2 a B well these
cancel out - a B - 2 a B we're just left

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:19.990
cancel out - a B - 2 a B we're just left
 

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.460
cancel out - a B - 2 a B we're just left
with a squared + B squared so the area

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:23.470
with a squared + B squared so the area
 

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.460
with a squared + B squared so the area
