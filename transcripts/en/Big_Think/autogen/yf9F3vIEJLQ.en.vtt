addiction is compulsive behavior despite

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
addiction is compulsive behavior despite
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.940
addiction is compulsive behavior despite
negative consequences and it's really

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
negative consequences and it's really
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.830
negative consequences and it's really
important to start by defining addiction

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
important to start by defining addiction
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.720
important to start by defining addiction
because for a long time we really

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730
because for a long time we really
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.480
because for a long time we really
defined it very poorly we used to think

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490
defined it very poorly we used to think
 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.120
defined it very poorly we used to think
that addiction was needing a substance

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
that addiction was needing a substance
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.330
that addiction was needing a substance
to function and what that resulted in

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
to function and what that resulted in
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.760
to function and what that resulted in
was that cocaine was not addictive

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770
was that cocaine was not addictive
 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.950
was that cocaine was not addictive
because cocaine does not produce

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
because cocaine does not produce
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.440
because cocaine does not produce
physical withdrawal that is noticeable

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450
physical withdrawal that is noticeable
 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.940
physical withdrawal that is noticeable
you may be cranky and irritable and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
you may be cranky and irritable and
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.270
you may be cranky and irritable and
crave cocaine but you won't be puking

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
crave cocaine but you won't be puking
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.970
crave cocaine but you won't be puking
and shaking and have the classic

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
and shaking and have the classic
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.099
and shaking and have the classic
symptoms that you would see with alcohol

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109
symptoms that you would see with alcohol
 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.889
symptoms that you would see with alcohol
or heroin withdrawal so cocaine wasn't

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
or heroin withdrawal so cocaine wasn't
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.639
or heroin withdrawal so cocaine wasn't
addictive then crack came and we

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
addictive then crack came and we
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.979
addictive then crack came and we
realized that defining addiction in that

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989
realized that defining addiction in that
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.540
realized that defining addiction in that
way not only harms people by telling

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
way not only harms people by telling
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.610
way not only harms people by telling
them that cocaine is not addictive it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
them that cocaine is not addictive it
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.250
them that cocaine is not addictive it
also harms pain patients because people

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260
also harms pain patients because people
 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.220
also harms pain patients because people
who take opioids daily for pain will

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230
who take opioids daily for pain will
 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.500
who take opioids daily for pain will
develop physical dependence but they are

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
develop physical dependence but they are
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.350
develop physical dependence but they are
not addicted unless they have compulsive

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
not addicted unless they have compulsive
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.450
not addicted unless they have compulsive
behavior despite negative consequences I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
behavior despite negative consequences I
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.880
behavior despite negative consequences I
see addiction as a learning disorder and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
see addiction as a learning disorder and
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.160
see addiction as a learning disorder and
the reason that I see it that way is

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
the reason that I see it that way is
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.639
the reason that I see it that way is
because the biology of addiction unfolds

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649
because the biology of addiction unfolds
 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.709
because the biology of addiction unfolds
in the developmental context over time

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719
in the developmental context over time
 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.230
in the developmental context over time
and that means that a huge amount of

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
and that means that a huge amount of
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.480
and that means that a huge amount of
variables come into it not only genes

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
variables come into it not only genes
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.810
variables come into it not only genes
and you know early environment but also

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
and you know early environment but also
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.410
and you know early environment but also
culture your family the way you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
culture your family the way you
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.709
culture your family the way you
interpret your own experience so it yeah

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719
interpret your own experience so it yeah
 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.300
interpret your own experience so it yeah
it becomes very complicated pretty

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
it becomes very complicated pretty
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.889
it becomes very complicated pretty
quickly

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899
quickly
 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.090
quickly
addiction is a learning disorder because

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
addiction is a learning disorder because
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.429
addiction is a learning disorder because
it can't occur without learning you have

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
it can't occur without learning you have
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.240
it can't occur without learning you have
to learn to associate the drug with some

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
to learn to associate the drug with some
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.539
to learn to associate the drug with some
kind of relief or pleasure and you need

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
kind of relief or pleasure and you need
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.999
kind of relief or pleasure and you need
to do that repeatedly over time before

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
to do that repeatedly over time before
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.859
to do that repeatedly over time before
you can become addicted this is why a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
you can become addicted this is why a
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.399
you can become addicted this is why a
baby can't be addicted because a baby

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409
baby can't be addicted because a baby
 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.050
baby can't be addicted because a baby
who is born with physical dependence on

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
who is born with physical dependence on
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990
who is born with physical dependence on
something like heroin doesn't know

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
something like heroin doesn't know
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.630
something like heroin doesn't know
whether it needs a diaper change or just

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
whether it needs a diaper change or just
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.450
whether it needs a diaper change or just
wants mommy or wants heroin and it

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460
wants mommy or wants heroin and it
 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.700
wants mommy or wants heroin and it
certainly can't go out and score despite

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710
certainly can't go out and score despite
 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.850
certainly can't go out and score despite
negative consequences so while that's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
negative consequences so while that's
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.290
negative consequences so while that's
another reason that it's really

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300
another reason that it's really
 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.460
another reason that it's really
important to distinguish between

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470
important to distinguish between
 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.170
important to distinguish between
physical dependence and a dick

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
physical dependence and a dick
 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.930
physical dependence and a dick
so the learning is involved where you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940
so the learning is involved where you
 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.860
so the learning is involved where you
learn that this works to fix a problem

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
learn that this works to fix a problem
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.220
learn that this works to fix a problem
and you basically then fall in love with

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
and you basically then fall in love with
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.550
and you basically then fall in love with
the substance and once you've fallen in

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
the substance and once you've fallen in
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.800
the substance and once you've fallen in
love with somebody or something

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
love with somebody or something
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.450
love with somebody or something
you will persist despite negative

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460
you will persist despite negative
 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.910
you will persist despite negative
consequences in order to sustain that

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920
consequences in order to sustain that
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.490
consequences in order to sustain that
relationship because the biology is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500
relationship because the biology is
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.290
relationship because the biology is
going to tell you that your life depends

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300
going to tell you that your life depends
 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.680
going to tell you that your life depends
on this it basically acts in a brain

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
on this it basically acts in a brain
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.100
on this it basically acts in a brain
region that is involved in survival and

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110
region that is involved in survival and
 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.510
region that is involved in survival and
reproduction and those are the two

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520
reproduction and those are the two
 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.530
reproduction and those are the two
fundamental purposes of biology so that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
fundamental purposes of biology so that
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.900
fundamental purposes of biology so that
creates really really strong cravings

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
creates really really strong cravings
 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.670
creates really really strong cravings
and it changes your priorities

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680
and it changes your priorities
 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.190
and it changes your priorities
tremendously and we don't really think

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
tremendously and we don't really think
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.900
tremendously and we don't really think
about that when somebody falls in love

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910
about that when somebody falls in love
 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.450
about that when somebody falls in love
and gets married and has a kid we think

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460
and gets married and has a kid we think
 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.160
and gets married and has a kid we think
that's very normal and it is very normal

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
that's very normal and it is very normal
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.990
that's very normal and it is very normal
on but if you notice how people behave

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000
on but if you notice how people behave
 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.120
on but if you notice how people behave
around love affairs whether licit or

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130
around love affairs whether licit or
 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.020
around love affairs whether licit or
illicit they will tend to put that first

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030
illicit they will tend to put that first
 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.300
illicit they will tend to put that first
and they will do things that they might

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310
and they will do things that they might
 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.520
and they will do things that they might
not otherwise do in pursuit of that and

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530
not otherwise do in pursuit of that and
 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.780
not otherwise do in pursuit of that and
you can certainly see that when people

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790
you can certainly see that when people
 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.080
you can certainly see that when people
have affairs where they will lie etc in

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090
have affairs where they will lie etc in
 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.060
have affairs where they will lie etc in
order to overcome addiction you need to

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070
order to overcome addiction you need to
 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.670
order to overcome addiction you need to
figure out what purpose the addiction

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680
figure out what purpose the addiction
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.770
figure out what purpose the addiction
was serving in my case I had a lot of

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
was serving in my case I had a lot of
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.670
was serving in my case I had a lot of
depression and I was very I had a lot of

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680
depression and I was very I had a lot of
 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.470
depression and I was very I had a lot of
difficulties connecting with people I

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480
difficulties connecting with people I
 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.990
difficulties connecting with people I
was also sort of overwhelmed by my

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000
was also sort of overwhelmed by my
 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.150
was also sort of overwhelmed by my
senses and emotions a lot of the time

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
senses and emotions a lot of the time
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.350
senses and emotions a lot of the time
and opioids turned that down very nicely

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360
and opioids turned that down very nicely
 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.390
and opioids turned that down very nicely
so I needed to sort of figure out you

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400
so I needed to sort of figure out you
 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.240
so I needed to sort of figure out you
know what was up and deal with those

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250
know what was up and deal with those
 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.960
know what was up and deal with those
issues in order to you know be healthy

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970
issues in order to you know be healthy
 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.110
issues in order to you know be healthy
and comfortable in recovery and that's

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120
and comfortable in recovery and that's
 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.370
and comfortable in recovery and that's
going to be different for different

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380
going to be different for different
 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.010
going to be different for different
people because they are going to have

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020
people because they are going to have
 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.449
people because they are going to have
different issues that they are

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459
different issues that they are
 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.890
different issues that they are
medicating with the drugs

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900
medicating with the drugs
 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.420
medicating with the drugs
I think psychedelics may be very useful

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
I think psychedelics may be very useful
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.640
I think psychedelics may be very useful
in the treatment of addiction but they

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650
in the treatment of addiction but they
 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.400
in the treatment of addiction but they
are certainly not a cure I think it's

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410
are certainly not a cure I think it's
 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.080
are certainly not a cure I think it's
very important to keep in mind that

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090
very important to keep in mind that
 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.050
very important to keep in mind that
insight alone does not change behavior

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060
insight alone does not change behavior
 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.469
insight alone does not change behavior
and with drugs like I began which seems

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479
and with drugs like I began which seems
 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.129
and with drugs like I began which seems
to help relieve opioid withdrawal

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139
to help relieve opioid withdrawal
 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.159

it's all well and good if you you know

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169

physically dependent on the drug but if

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909
physically dependent on the drug but if
 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.850
physically dependent on the drug but if
you then go back to the same environment

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860
you then go back to the same environment
 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.640
you then go back to the same environment
and you haven't made changes that are

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650
and you haven't made changes that are
 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.640

it's really important for the people who

it's really important for the people who
 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.860
it's really important for the people who

are promoting the use of psychedelics in
 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.369
are promoting the use of psychedelics in

reality is that addiction and depression

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039
reality is that addiction and depression
 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.149

existential questions and so it is not
 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.890
existential questions and so it is not
going to be the case that you can just

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900
going to be the case that you can just
 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.499
going to be the case that you can just
put a brain implant in and addiction

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509
put a brain implant in and addiction
 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.439
put a brain implant in and addiction
will go away without a big chunk of

horrific brain surgery where they oblate
 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.379
horrific brain surgery where they oblate
ie burn out the nucleus accumbens which

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389
ie burn out the nucleus accumbens which
 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.790
ie burn out the nucleus accumbens which
is basically the brain region that

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800
is basically the brain region that
 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.649
is basically the brain region that
provides pleasure and motivation and

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659
provides pleasure and motivation and
 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.570

they think that this is actually going
 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.110
they think that this is actually going
to cure addiction of course what happens

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120
to cure addiction of course what happens
 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.540
to cure addiction of course what happens
is you get people who are just anhedonic

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550
is you get people who are just anhedonic
 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.230
is you get people who are just anhedonic
and who relapse because you know now

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240
and who relapse because you know now
 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.580
and who relapse because you know now
they have even less so you know this

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590
they have even less so you know this
 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.740
they have even less so you know this
idea that like we could use a drug that

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750
idea that like we could use a drug that
 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.170
idea that like we could use a drug that
will block the effects of the drug of

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180
will block the effects of the drug of
 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.200
will block the effects of the drug of
choice is generally misguided because

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210
choice is generally misguided because
 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.409
choice is generally misguided because
the problem isn't the drug of choice the

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419
the problem isn't the drug of choice the
 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.659
the problem isn't the drug of choice the
problem is why you need that drug and

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669
problem is why you need that drug and
 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.990
problem is why you need that drug and
why those drugs appeal to you and why

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000
why those drugs appeal to you and why
 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.600
why those drugs appeal to you and why
you are trying to get out why you were

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610
you are trying to get out why you were
 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.300
you are trying to get out why you were
trying to escape and what you need in

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310
trying to escape and what you need in
 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.439
trying to escape and what you need in
your life in order to feel comfortable

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449
your life in order to feel comfortable
 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.140
your life in order to feel comfortable
safe and productive so I don't think

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150
safe and productive so I don't think
 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.650
safe and productive so I don't think
that there will be future weird cures

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660
that there will be future weird cures
 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.659
that there will be future weird cures
like that but what I do think is

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669
like that but what I do think is
 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.480
like that but what I do think is
interesting about the future of drugs is

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490
interesting about the future of drugs is
 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.620
interesting about the future of drugs is
that we can make better drugs part of

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630
that we can make better drugs part of
 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.210
that we can make better drugs part of
the reason that prohibition is

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220
the reason that prohibition is
 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.939
the reason that prohibition is
collapsing at the moment is because of

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949
collapsing at the moment is because of
 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.140
collapsing at the moment is because of
what are called new psychoactive

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150
what are called new psychoactive
 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.409
what are called new psychoactive
substances or legal hides and basically

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:08.419
substances or legal hides and basically
 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.710
substances or legal hides and basically
you can make a new recreational drug by

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720
you can make a new recreational drug by
 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.230
you can make a new recreational drug by
sort of tweaking molecules of the other

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240
sort of tweaking molecules of the other
 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.950
sort of tweaking molecules of the other
ones and it will be technically legal

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960
ones and it will be technically legal
 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.650
ones and it will be technically legal
because it hasn't been made illegal and

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660
because it hasn't been made illegal and
 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.260
because it hasn't been made illegal and
what this reveals is that our system for

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.270
what this reveals is that our system for
 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.210
what this reveals is that our system for
making drugs illegal is completely

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220
making drugs illegal is completely
 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.520
making drugs illegal is completely
irrational and based on you know 19th

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530
irrational and based on you know 19th
 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.430
irrational and based on you know 19th
century prejudices has nothing to do

century prejudices has nothing to do
 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.520
century prejudices has nothing to do
with science and if we apply science to

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530
with science and if we apply science to
 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.120
with science and if we apply science to
this problem and look at well people are

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130
this problem and look at well people are
 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.260
this problem and look at well people are
always going to want to alter their

always going to want to alter their
 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.180
always going to want to alter their
consciousness in some ways how do we

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.190
consciousness in some ways how do we
 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.339
consciousness in some ways how do we
reduce the harm associated with this how

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:42.349
reduce the harm associated with this how
 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:45.279
reduce the harm associated with this how
do we create drugs or medications that

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:45.289
do we create drugs or medications that
 

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:47.620
do we create drugs or medications that
will allow people to feel safe and

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:47.630
will allow people to feel safe and
 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.270
will allow people to feel safe and
comfortable in the world but not be so

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280
comfortable in the world but not be so
 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.430

distracting or problematic that they
 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.909
distracting or problematic that they
will not be able to feel you know

00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919
will not be able to feel you know

connect with other people they won't be
 

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.439
connect with other people they won't be
so you know out of it so I think the

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:02.449
so you know out of it so I think the
 

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:05.830
so you know out of it so I think the
future of drugs is better drugs I don't

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840
future of drugs is better drugs I don't
 

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.770
future of drugs is better drugs I don't
think the future of drugs will be or you

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:08.780
think the future of drugs will be or you
 

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.870
think the future of drugs will be or you
know you could virtual reality these

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:10.880
know you could virtual reality these
 

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.100
know you could virtual reality these
kinds of things could all be very

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.110
kinds of things could all be very
 

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.950
kinds of things could all be very
interesting but I think that so long as

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960
interesting but I think that so long as
 

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.350
interesting but I think that so long as
people ask the question why am I here
