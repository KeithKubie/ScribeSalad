&gt;&gt; Announcer: Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.200
please welcome the
14th Librarian

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.880
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.180
[Applause]

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.480
&gt;&gt; C. Hayden: Hello!

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.780
I was reading a book.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.080
[ Laughter ]

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.640
Getting ready for tomorrow.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:53.270
Well, thank you and welcome to
the 18th National Book Festival,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.790
founded by first lady Laura
Bush almost 20 years ago,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.970
and it has become a
Washington based tradition.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.840
When the greatest writers
and illustrators come

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.520
to our nation's capitol

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.270
to celebrate the books
play in our lives.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.210
I know everyone is a book lover,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.090
so you know how it can
inspire and help us team.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.200
The library has been
working recently

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.140
with the renowned design firm
Pentagram on a new look -

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.810
one that reflects the
institution's move toward

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.110
the future.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.070
our goal is to make the
library more accessible

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.730
to the American public
coast to coast.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.780
We think it's a bold new look

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.700
that showcases the
library's collection resources

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:01.340
and services for
Congress and for you.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:20.880
And you're supposed to see it.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.180
[Applause]

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
&gt;&gt; C. Hayden: Tonight,
we would not be here

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:38.080
without the Library's chief
benefactor:And supporter,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.000
the U.S. Congress.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:03:24.680
I want to thank all
the members of Congress

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.960
for so generously supporting
this institution for more

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:48.380
than 200 years, making it the
world's greatest repository

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.480
of knowledge and creativity.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.750
National Book Festival is made
Only -- this is underlined --

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.710
only through the
generosities of its donors

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.360
and our most generous supporter

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.360
of the festival is the
co-chairman Mr. David

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.220
M. Rubenstein.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.390
[Applause] He is
truly the embodiment

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:33.850
of patriotic philanthropy.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.710
His generosity can be seen
and felt all over town,

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.950
the Kennedy Center, the National
Archives, the Smithsonian

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.920
and of course in his
funding the restoration

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.810
of the Washington Monument
following the 2011 earthquake.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.810
His giving to the Library
Extends beyond the National

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.110
Book Festival.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.160
He also supports the Literacy
Awards and many programs

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.200
and exhibits of the library.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:20.640
Mr. Rubenstein, David, on
behalf of the nation, thank you.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.940
[Applause]

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.240
&gt;&gt; C. Hayden: In addition
to Mr. Rubenstein,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.540
I would like to thank others

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.180
who make the Book
Festival a free event --

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.510
think about that -- a free
event for others to enjoy.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:39.610
The James Madison Council, the
National Endowment for the Arts

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.080
and the National Endowment
for the Humanities.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.480
And, of course, all our many
Friends and Media Partners.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.820
You make this, we think, the
best free event in Washington.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.070
I also want to acknowledge
the more than 1,000 volunteers

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.710
who come to us through the
junior league of Washington

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.060
and the general public.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.650
And, of course, the hard
working staff of the library,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.930
especially Jarrod MacNeil, our
signature program director,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.700
proud father of twins.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.360
Two or three days ago.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.750
Marie Arana, our festival
literary director.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.060
And library development office.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.830
The beautiful poster
this year was created

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.080
by Gaby D'Alessandro.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.560
I think it does a marvelous
job of conveying how we explore

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.390
and travel through books.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.990
[Applause] Gaby is here.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.070
Will you stand up
and take a bow?

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.010
It really is a beautiful,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.780
beautiful representation
of what books can do.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.830
We also have some young
writers here tonight

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.320
who are an inspiration to
young people everywhere:

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.030
The National Student Poets.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.330
These students...

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.630
[Applause]

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:10.910
&gt;&gt; C. Hayden: These
students from five regions

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.920
Across the country are really
emblematic of the spirit

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.610
of the National Book Festival.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.550
Will you please stand up so
we can acknowledge your work?

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.850
[Applause]

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:39.210
&gt;&gt; C. Hayden: For 18 years
the library has been fortunate

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.670
to host America's
greatest fiction writers

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.140
at this festival, from John
Grisham and Toni Morrison,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.420
to Philip Roth and
Louise Erdrich.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.720
And some have gone on to be
awarded our highest honor

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.630
in that category, the Library

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.340
of Congress Prize
for American Fiction.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.300
The recipient of the
library Congress prize

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.410
for fiction this year
is Ms. Annie Proulx.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:15.660
[Applause] She has given
us monumental sagas

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:22.210
and keen-eyed skillfully
written stories.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.620
She was the first woman to
win the PEN/Faulkner Award for

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.560
"Postcards" and her story
"Brokeback Mountain" was adapted

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.170
into an Academy Award
winning film.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.830
Her latest novel is bar skins.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.830
We'll be presenting
on the fiction stage.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.350
But you will hear
from her tonight.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:51.740
Please congratulate the 2018
Library of Congress prize winner

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.880
for American fiction,
Ms. Annie Proulx.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:11.240
[Applause] Now, for the next
day, we will celebrate books,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.730
but our underlying love
of reading is also coupled

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:22.610
with providing an opportunity
for people to learn how to read.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:27.420
There are far too many of
people throughout the world

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.840
who cannot read or
do so at a low level.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.690
So low that they are
functionally ill literal.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.110
That's where Mr.
Rubenstein comes in again.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.590
He is not only the
primary sponsor

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.250
of the National Book
Festival but he is the creator

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:48.130
and sole sponsor of the Library
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.420
He doesn't just give
the funding.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.090
He also personally promotes
the importance of literacy

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.620
and reading with passion.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.530
So please join me in
watching this brief video

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.720
about the Literacy Awards.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.020
[Applause]

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.320
&gt;&gt; Announcer: Ladies

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:15.960
and gentlemen please
welcome David M. Rubenstein,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.100
Co-Chairman of the National
Book Festival and the originator

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:27.980
and sponsor of the Library
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.280
&gt;&gt; D. Rubenstein:
Thank you very much.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.190
[Applause] Carla, thank you for
your very kind words and I want

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.590
to thank the Library
of Congress staff

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.890
for recognizing Literacy
Awards and those who were

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.910
on the committee, they've
done all the hard work.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.730
And I want to assure
you, I do have more

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:56.370
than one tie and one suit.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.940
I notice it's the same one.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.260
I have a few ties
and a couple suits.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.650
They look different,
but anyway...

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:15.540
How many people here have read
the newspaper today or online,

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.430
something related
to the newspaper?

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:29.870
How many people have read a
magazine in the last week?

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:40.610
Anybody? How many people read
one book in the last year?

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:41.910
[ Laughter ]

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.730
How many people read
ten books in last year?

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.050
Twenty books?

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.800
Thirty books?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.230
Forty? Be honest.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:55.530
How many read 50 books?

00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:03.450
The truth is, imagine your
life if you hadn't been able

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:13.260
to read any of those books and
what your life would be like,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.370
how much less rich it would be.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:31.140
In my own case, I came from
a family that was not college

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.560
or high school educated,
and the great pleasure

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.170
in my life was learning how
to read and learning the world

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.180
that was outside the
world that I grew up in,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.370
and I grew up in
Baltimore, and the head

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.440
of the library is now -- which
is the library in Baltimore --

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.710
is now our Librarian
of Congress.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.430
[Applause] The first woman
and the first African American

00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:04.130
to be Librarian of Congress, and
also I think the first librarian

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.670
to be Librarian of Congress

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.430
in almost a century,
so congratulations.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.650
[Applause] Sadly, and it's hard
to believe, it is very hard

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.360
to believe, but 45
million Americans,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.950
about 14% of our population
is functionally illiterate,

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.960
which means they can't read
past a fourth grade level.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.940
43 million Americans can't
read at all, stop sign,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.460
they can't read at all.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:40.100
This country purports to be
the wealthiest in the world,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.930
and in many ways we
complain about and think

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:50.060
about the terrible problem
we have income inequality

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.600
and social mobility, it
goes back in my view to one

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.540
of the major causes of literacy,
people's inability to read.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.420
If you cannot read,
you have limited chance

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.950
of getting a very good job.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:12.530
Those people cannot functionally
read or read at all are going

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.180
to make less than
two-thirds of what --

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.710
a third of what somebody who can
read will make during the course

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:27.260
of their lifetime.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.560
And that's sad.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.310
Not only will they not get the
pleasure of reading and the joy

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.850
of life you have from reading,

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.910
but they're going
to earn a lot less.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.790
In addition, you should
recognize that people

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.580
who cannot read have a much
greater chance of being

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.880
in our federal criminal system.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.200
In fact, roughly
65% of the people

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.260
in our federal prisons are
functionally illiterate.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.080
And roughly 80% of the people

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.860
in the juvenile delinquency
system are

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.030
functionally illiterate.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.110
So if you cannot read,
you're not likely

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.680
to make a good living.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.600
You may well be in need
of public assistance.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.060
In fact, 80% of people
in public assistance is

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.360
functionally illiterate.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:20.910
So this problem is not just
generation of adults I'm talking

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.950
about but also for children.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:28.420
Because as we all know, the best
way to teach a child to read is

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.070
by parental reading to them.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.250
But if you can't
read as a parent,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.350
how can you read
to your children?

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.470
So what happens very
often is the children --

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.090
the children of parents
who cannot read,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.390
they don't learn how to read.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.400
Therefore when the time comes
to measure them in third

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.880
or fourth grade they
fall way behind.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.220
The children of parents
who cannot read had

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.200
about a 20% chance
of being able to get

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.830
through the fourth grade
proficiency levels.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.310
And if you can't read at
the fourth grade level

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.800
by the time you're in the
fourth grade, in other words,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.400
you're not really
reading proficient,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.600
you have a much greater chance
of being a high school dropout.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.370
In fact, 75% of the people drop

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.370
out of high school are
functionally illiterate,

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.670
and by the time they're

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.990
in the fourth grade they
were already really behind.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:21.980
There's no one thing we can
do to solve the problem.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.700
The Literacy Awards are
designed to get attention to it.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.630
As Doris Kearns Goodwin
would say,

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.170
"the world will no
longer remember what we do

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.470
here tonight.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.320
" And the awards are
relatively modest.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.240
It's my goal to get
attention and the Library

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.650
of Congress being involved,
doing all the hard work,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.890
they make it more important than
it would be if I was doing it

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.470
by myself, so I thank
the Library

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.870
of Congress for doing this.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:17:00.290
Everybody involved in literacy
organizations deserves the

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:04.100
credit for actually helping
to solve this problem

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.200
and deal with this problem.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.430
But this problem is
much bigger than anybody

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.750
in this room can solve.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:22.460
We much more federal resources
and public attention and we need

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:29.440
to recognize that if we're
ever going to solve the income

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.360
and equality problem and
social mobility problem

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:40.580
of this country we have to begin
by teaching young children how

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.340
to read and enjoy reading.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:50.370
All of you would probably say
that if you didn't know how

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:56.150
to read your life would be less
fulfilling, that's for sure.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:03.330
You might have less money,
but less fulfilling a life.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.380
I just want you to
think tonight as you go

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.800
to the National Book Festival
tomorrow and enjoy hearing

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.560
and reading the authors
and seeing the people

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.860
and the young children
in particular

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.640
who are going there
-- who are reading

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.450
and getting books
autographed, how sad it is

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.290
that so many people
are shut out from this

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.740
because they don't
know how to read,

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.820
they don't know the pleasure
of reading and reading books

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.580
and don't have the chance of
living a life that we would

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.170
like our children
to lead and all

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.430
of us pretty much
lead ourselves.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.260
Thank you, LLC, for doing this
and I would like Carla to come

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.870
up and we can hand
out the awards.

[Applause] D. Rubenstein:

00:21:34.770 --> 00:22:07.170
Reading Is Fundamental is
something you've heard about,

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:11.670
started by Mrs. Robert McNamara,
and her daughter is here.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:29.210
I want to thank you for coming.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.350
Thank you.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:37.330
[Applause] C. Hayden: And you
should know there's a sign here

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.750
that says "do not touch
or move this microphone,"

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.330
and Mr. Rubenstein
wanted to make sure

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.530
that Ms. McNamara
was given her...

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:53.150
Because we want to give you
a special gift D. Rubenstein:

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.000
Huh-oh.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.850
C. Hayden: It was hard to think
of something to surprise him,

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.380
because you can see
it's quite something,

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.630
and we hope this fills the bill.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:09.490
Please accept this original
creation by Michael Cavna.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:17.050
He is the create tore of Comic
Riffs at The Washington Post

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.020
and a great friend of the
festival and he has given this

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.100
to the library to give to you.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:33.390
It is an interesting
representation of you.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:38.400
Michael, would you
please join us?

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:49.580
[Applause] C. Hayden: Cavna.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.500
Michael Cavna.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.800
I just want to say --

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.630
I did Google images and
I had only seen one type

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.270
of suit and one color tie.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.570
I apologize.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.430
All were immaculate but
when certain people talk

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.760
about rigged Google algorithms,
you might want to look

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.940
into that, but it
was a pleasure.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.190
And, you know, we...

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.610
I went to Gilbert
Stewart, because I went

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.940
through Jefferson, and I
felt like, to do you right,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.460
I needed to channel Gilbert
Stewart, who had a studio

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.590
in 1803 and died 190 years ago

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.980
and Gilbert Stewart's
spirit lives

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.070
on of his unfinished
Washington portrait.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.500
I was given a deadline and this
was almost an unfinished David

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.130
Rubenstein portrait.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.430
It was an honor.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:48.110
Gilbert Stewart did the first
six presidents and amazing,

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:58.860
generous of spirit and a
true book lover yourself.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.160
Thank you so much.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.670
[Applause] C. Hayden: And
now, ladies and gentlemen,

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.290
it is very hard to surprise him.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.470
Thank you, Michael.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.530
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, we are proud

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:18.680
to present our 2018 National
Book Festival Authors Program.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.160
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:26.790
please welcome Brian
Celsius Brian Selznick.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:43.940
B. Selznick: I wrote down every
single word I'm going to say.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.140
[ Laughter ]

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:51.290
B. Selznick: Dr. Hayden,
special guest, fellow authors,

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.620
young poets, award winners
and book lovers, it's an honor

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.900
to be speaking to you tonight.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.770
I want to say on Halloween
of last year, I got a call

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.460
from scholastic asking
me to draw new covers

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.730
to help celebrate the 20th
anniversary of Harry Potter.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.880
Twenty years.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.010
I found myself trying to
remember what was going

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.150
on in the world 20 years ago

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.650
when the Harry Potter books
were first published in America.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.140
Luckily my husband David
sterling is a historian

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.670
and has a better
memory than I do.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.820
He reminded me 20 years ago we
were living here in Washington,

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.730
D.C. about six blocks from
where we are right now,

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.550
while he had a fellowship at
the Smithsonian and I worked

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.120
on a book about amelia ear Hart

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.490
and Eleanor Roosevelt's
friendship.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.050
Movies like Armageddon,

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:45.980
saving private Ryan
were at the box office.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.130
Frank Sinatra died.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.730
Google became a company.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:56.670
Aretha stepped in for
Pavaratti at the awards,

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.910
and sang "none shall sleep,"

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:03.200
which sounds a little
like a warning.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.630
President in the White House
around much talk of impeachment

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:10.240
and a Republican senator
from Arizona had just died.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.990
The best thing that can
ever be said of anyone is

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.580
that they served
to a cause greater

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.500
than their self-interest.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.000
Those words were
spoken by John McCain

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.880
at Barry Goldwater's funeral.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.730
And those are being
spoken by so many others

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.730
as he lies across the street.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.740
Our lives history itself feel

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.060
like an obstacle course
we're navigating in the dark.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.080
We stumble from one unimaginable
moment to the next and only

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.190
when we look back we see a path.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.600
Hindsight is what turns
experience into stories.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.960
Sometimes the story
feels like a circle

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.960
but that's what human beings do.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.630
We turn everything into stories.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.810
As if we had storytelling
in our DNA.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.390
And sometimes the storyteller
comes along who seems able

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.450
to distill vast and
important ideas into something

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.400
that connects with their
culture and they offer back

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.460
to civilization a reflection
of ourselves, which speaks

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.430
to our needs as individuals
and as a society.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.560
That's what I think
J. K. Rowling did

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.780
with the Harry Potter books.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.340
I was a newcomer when
called last Halloween.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.210
I had only read them for the
first time two years earlier.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:31.930
If you haven't read them,
they're good by the way.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.450
Even though I hadn't
read them myself,

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.830
I loved the phenomenon of them.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.090
As a former independent
book seller --

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.490
I'm very proud of that fact --
I loved walking by book stores

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:46.710
at midnight and seeing the vast
lines of families in costume

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.870
and hearing a kind of
excitement for books and stories

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.460
that perhaps hadn't been
experienced by the culture

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.580
as a whole since 19th century
crowds gathered at the docks

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.350
in New York harbor waiting for
copies of the last installment

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.570
of Charles Dickens' "the
old curiosity shop" to find

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.040
out if Nell lived or died.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.200
I'm not going to spoil it here.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.140
At last, three years
ago I decided to jump in

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.830
and read the Harry
Potter series myself.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.330
I was overwhelmed and
became a huge fan.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:26.730
Wizards, magic, dragons, giants,
elves, orphans, evil, hypocrisy,

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:32.330
bravery, tragedy,
betrayal, hope and love.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.610
Somehow she had taken all the
elements and made something new.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.450
She put us all at the center of
the most extraordinary narrative

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.470
about someone's life
effects and affected

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.810
by earth shattering events.

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.720
She forced us to
ask big questions.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.580
What do we do when everything
around us seems hopeless?

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.480
When the people we
most trust die?

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.200
And when the institutions
we most love begin

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.590
to crumble around us?

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.390
In many ways these books remind
us that in the darkest of times,

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.670
it's books themselves
we can turn to for help.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:12.520
They remind us that we need
heroes and we can be heroes.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.570
And maybe unconsciously we
are aware that like books,

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:21.220
our own lives unfold in
chapters from our infancy

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:25.640
through our childhood and into
our adulthood and old age.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.880
Different chapters perhaps
but all the same story.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.870
I think that's why when I
was asked to draw new covers

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.080
for the books, I knew
right away I wanted

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.370
to do one long epic drawing
that would span all seven covers

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.020
when lined up, a visual
narrative that would try

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.320
to parallel what Rowling
does in the stories.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.880
I wanted the Dovers to
focus on the relationships

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.640
between the characters,
the queer idea of family,

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.110
non-biologically related people
who you find yourself related

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:58.820
to through shared interests,
ideas, love and dreams.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.450
The families that Harry Potter
himself creates are particularly

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:04.350
complex and beautiful.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.730
I wanted to draw
these relationships,

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.970
these families in my covers.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.960
Most of all, I wanted the
main theme of my covers

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.540
to be the battle
between good and evil.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.840
Since that was the element

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.490
of the books I found
most intriguing,

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.870
and the one I believe is
currently most important

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.170
and relevant.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.590
The books tell us with the
prospect that Voldemort,

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:30.140
the embodiment of evil
could win the battle.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.870
If he wins, what then?

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.910
We get glimpses when
evil gains power.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:40.550
One of the characters is
Doris, dresses in bright pink

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:44.300
and collects cats,
but uses bureaucracy

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.160
to torture those
weak and powerless.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.550
It's examination of
hypocrisy when people

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:55.610
in power say they are
helping but hurting others.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.770
Doris illuminates a corrupted
soul and shows why we must fight

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.900
against anyone like her.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.920
Up against all this evil
are Harry and his friends.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.280
They suffer.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.110
They lose people they love.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.930
They make mistakes.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.610
They are young and they fight
heroickicly and suffer greatly.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.950
But they are undon'ted
and they are together.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.860
Theirs is a story worth sharing.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.120
Those here tonight and
those coming this weekend

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.010
for the National Book Festival
understand that empathy,

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:33.800
love and understanding can be
gained through books as well

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.640
as through the act of reading.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.210
And children's books were
a lifelong love of reading

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.780
and where empathy begins.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.640
I think the Harry Potter books
were in their way prescient.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:49.060
20 years later, Rowling's
vision of children saving us,

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.210
children stepping up
and pointing the way

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:55.220
to the future is echoed in the
actions of young people today,

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.980
many of whom are taking to the
streets protesting injustice,

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.480
speaking out, confronting evil.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.970
These young people were raised
in the spirit of Harry Potter,

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.510
whose frame of reference
for most

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:10.010
of their lives was leadership
associated with decency

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.210
and intelligence and empathy.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.700
They are fighting back and
will continue to fight back.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.540
We must support them.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.470
J. K. Rowling knew
it was the children

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.480
who will help us win the battle.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.370
That's why I'm proud to be
here representing Harry Potter

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.980
at the National Book Festival,
where we are reminded now more

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.240
than ever what we
need to celebrate

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.050
and support are good stories,
the endless power of books,

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.160
and the vast bravery
of children.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.460
Thank you very much.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.210
[Applause] Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.980
please welcome the Library of
Congress's National Ambassador

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.040
for Young People's
Literature, Jacqueline Woodson.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:20.200
[Applause] J. Woodson:
Thank you.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.380
Can I touch it to adjust it?

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:34.390
Okay. I could have written
a speech like Brian's.

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:35.690
[ Laughter ]

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:43.630
J. Woodson: If Aretha
hadn't died.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:48.530
If her funeral hadn't lasted for
eight hours and was televised.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:52.300
But, Brian, thank you.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.310
Thank you for your
words and your work.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:59.260
And the first thing I want

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.750
to say is give literacy
all your money.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.050
All your money.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:15.390
[Applause] J. Woodson: I have
this poster in my office at home

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.490
and it says, "You have to
give it away to keep it.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:23.360
" And I think about that every
day, the fact that what we put

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.200
out into the world
comes back to us.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:32.280
And the idea that as
writers we can't have readers

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.400
if people can't read.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.460
And we have to support
our readers in that way.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.250
I've been national Ambassador
for Young People's Literature

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.830
since January and I've been
going around the country talking

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.160
about the importance of reading,

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.540
how reading equals
hope times change,

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.380
that when we read,
it changes us.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.820
It gives us hope, and for the
writers in the room you know,

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:59.140
since 2016, it has been
very hard to feel hopeful.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.510
And as a result, not only
is it hard to feel hopeful,

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:06.730
but it's hard to create art
when you're not feeling hopeful.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:10.850
And one at of the ways I
find hope is by talking

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:14.370
to the young people and talking
to the people who are engaging

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.470
in the literature, and
very often traveling

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.390
through the country I come
across lots of young people

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:24.120
who can't engage in the
literature to the extent that we

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:30.360
like them to because of their
inability to process it.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:36.500
I want to give a huge shout-out
to Reading Is Fundamental

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:41.750
and to East Side Community
School for the work

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:45.360
that you're doing to create
young people who are reading

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.440
and Reading Is Fundamental,
I know everyone who is

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.160
around my age remembers the
commercial with the little boy

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.390
"Reading Is Fundamental"
and even

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.780
as young people we didn't
know what "fundamental" meant,

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.030
but we knew that it
was something important

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.950
and that one day we
would understand it,

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.190
but in the meantime we had
something to do with books

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:09.750
and something to do with a
party we were invited to.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.290
Speaking of parties
we are invited to,

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.810
I want to thank Carla Hayden
for opening the Library

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.700
of Congress to all of us.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:23.760
I didn't even understand what
this place was before you became

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.340
a part of it, and I saw that it
was a place that I was welcome

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.560
to be a part of and to
be in and to explore.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.210
So getting back to
the literacy thing,

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:37.030
I'm going to tell a
story about my kids.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.330
So don't groan.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.630
It's quick.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.930
I have a ten-year-old
son, Jackson Leroy

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.020
and I have a 16-year-old
daughter.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:48.480
When my son was four years old
we realized he needed glasses.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.740
And when he was about
seven we realized

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.690
that he was reading
differently from other people.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:02.410
And then we got him tested and
we found out that he had a lot

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.780
of reading differences.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:10.510
And that he was having a lot
of stress about how he --

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.830
knowing he was reading
different.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.890
And I know there are a
lot of people in the room

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:18.310
who have encountered the young
people who read differently.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:23.230
And about two months ago we had
our 16-year-old daughter tested.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:27.960
I should stop and tell you,
my partner is Jew let Woodall,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.860
the most wonderful
person in the world

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.680
and does just world-changing
work.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.500
And because we're two women,
we can decide who gets

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.550
to have what kid when.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:43.210
So I gave birth to my daughter

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.030
and my partner gave
birth to our son Jackson.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:50.780
We have these two amazing
kids and love them very much,

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.080
and when they get on our nerves,
I get to go off as ambassador,

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.870
gets to go to the clinic.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:39:01.600
But I read differently
as a young person.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.210
I knew that I would have
been diagnosed as dyslexic

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.870
in this day and age, but I
grew up in a neighborhood

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.670
where parents weren't
spending lots of money

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:13.850
to get psych socials done
to see what was going

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.290
on with kids' reading.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:19.080
We did that and got our
kids tested and turned

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.740
out both had reading
differences,

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.560
and that there's a
whole industry out there

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.980
where you can pay lots of
money to get your kids on par,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.250
up to level, and there
are a lot of people

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.550
that don't have that money.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.220
Not only do they not
have the money to find

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.460
out what their young
people are struggling with,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.760
but they don't have the money

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.610
to then help them get
through the struggle.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.070
And there's so many
places where --

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.200
so many schools where
they don't have the tools

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.510
to help the young people
with those struggles.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.390
And it's hard.

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:56.110
And it's hard for me
as a mom to figure

00:39:56.110 --> 00:40:00.440
out what the playing field is
I'm choosing for my young people

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.550
and it's hard for me
as ambassador to go

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.820
around the country and see
how many young people are

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.370
struggling, either because
they don't have access to books

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:16.160
in their homes, because their
parents haven't had the tools

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.600
to learn to read so that
they could then go and read

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.950
to the young people, or because
they're undiagnosed in some way.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.680
And I think as writers,
as readers,

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.440
as people who have means,
as people who have access,

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.100
we can change the world.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:35.680
We can change this narrative
and we can end the school

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.710
to prison pipeline
that is coming

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.470
out of what Mr. Rubenstein said,

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:45.210
about kids who are weak
readers becoming the people

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.090
who are feeding the
prison industrial complex.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:56.070
So, I want to thank the universe
for giving me the gift to write.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.580
I want to thank the
writers who came before me.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.860
I know we all have writers who
came before us who taught us,

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.240
James Baldwin and Audrey
Lord and so many more.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.250
I want to thank the
Library of Congress

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.890
for giving us this space

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.580
to actually have
these conversations

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.270
about what it means to
create readers and learners

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:18.570
and thinkers, and I want to
thank you for really thinking

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.710
about giving all the money to --

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:25.340
you don't have to
give all of it.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.720
You can give the royalties
of a part of one book.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.030
You can give the royalties
of all of one book.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.680
You know, there are
ways to do this.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.810
I was watching Aretha's
funeral all day long.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:40.310
It was on all day long.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.780
And it was amazing.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.300
But I thought about
tithing in the black church

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.520
and in many churches
you tithe, right?

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.690
You give a percentage of
your income toward some kind

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:50.990
of greater good.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:52.710
And this is a greater
good we need

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.810
to put our finances
into right now.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:57.230
This is going to
change the world.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:01.280
This is going to level
the playing field,

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.930
if we're not thinking about
doing it for the adults,

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:22.010
Let's do it for the
young people.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:33.200
So that's all I've got to say.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.500
Thank you.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.800
[Applause] Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.220
please welcome Jon Meacham.

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.550
[Applause] J. Meacham: Okay,
ambassador Woodson got a medal,

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.130
Brian writes better
than Rowling...

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:43.770
thank y'all for coming.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:47.810
This may be the most significant
gathering of talent and skill

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:50.770
and literary ability in one room

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:54.810
since Doris Kearns
Goodwin dined alone.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:59.010
Thank you for having me.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.830
I love the National
Book Festival

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:06.010
because of its humbling
function for me.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:10.150
Ten years ago I was here, and
I was on my way to give my talk

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.870
at that point about
Andrew Jackson.

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:17.690
And a woman ran up to me,
which doesn't happen enough.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:18.990
[ Laughter ]

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.800
Or ever. Because if they
would, they would have to get

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.200
out of their medical device
if they wanted to see me.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.500
And she said "oh,
my God, it's you!

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.490
." I said, yes.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:33.070
Existentially speaking,
that's hard to argue with.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.810
She said I admire your work
so much, your books have meant

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.290
so much to me and my family.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.840
Will you wait right
here and I want

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.610
to get your new book
and have you sign it.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:42.910
I said, yes, ma'am.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.210
I was standing there thinking,

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.950
this is the way the
world is supposed to be.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:49.360
Women are supposed to admire
you and you to sign their books.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.720
This was perfect.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.850
She brought back John
Grisham's latest novel.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.230
It gets worse.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.890
At that point I was
writing a biography

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:02.700
of George Herbert Walker Bush.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.120
It was a Saturday.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.610
I went to Kennebunkport
the next day.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.310
I was at lunch with the
Bushes anded to this story,

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:15.760
expecting some motherly
reassurance from Mrs. Bush.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.090
She looked across
the table and said,

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.200
how do you think Mr.
John Grisham would feel?

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:28.880
He's a very handsome man.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.180
[ Laughter ]

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.100
And you put me after these
two, so I'm never coming back.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.080
Thank you all very much.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.550
No, I'm delighted to be
here, honored to be here.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.110
I'm going to tell you a
story about why I write

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:46.380
about what I write, and it
has to do with both the past

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.910
and the future for me.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.580
And I think that ultimately
that's the significance

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.840
of history, it is our past
but I firmly believe as much

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.540
as I believe anything that
it is absolutely essential

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:02.040
to shaping the present
and the future.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.930
I you up on missionary ridge,
a Civil War battlefield

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.750
in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:12.600
It was the place where
Braxton Bragg lost to Grant,

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.960
how Sherman got to Georgia.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.950
Some of my friends in
Atlanta never came to visit.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.250
I'll wait.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.310
It's kind of funny...

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.830
You get further north and you
have to let that simmer a bit.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:32.350
I grew up 600 yards from
Bragg's headquarters,

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.890
where the line was broken,

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:36.780
Douglas McArthur's
father won the medal

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.240
of honor at the age of 17.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.160
Two miles down the road the
other way was Chief John Ross'

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.220
house, the head of
the Cherokee nation.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.480
The Cherokee tribe which
did more than any other

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:55.640
to meet the demands of a
white majoritarian authority,

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.800
and yet still found itself
fundamentally betrayed

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.500
by that country.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:09.330
There for me I could find balls
in the yard where I grew up.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.150
History was a tactile thing.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:15.020
And it was also incredibly
complex,

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.830
because there were
two living monuments,

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:21.930
two of the great original
sins of American life.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:26.040
African American slavery
and Native American removal.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.120
And yet the house
in which I grew up,

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.970
the house between
those two places was my

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:34.160
grandfather's house.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.050
He was born in 1913
on June 22nd,

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:41.690
1941 as a practicing
lawyer he decided

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.360
to join the United States Navy

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.820
because Hitler had just
invaded the Soviet Union.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.710
My grandfather believed at
that point war was inevitable,

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:53.410
global war, and he wanted
to be first in line.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:56.250
And spent four years
in the Pacific.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:58.910
I'm one of those people
who would not be here

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:03.240
if Harry Truman had not made the
decision he made in late July

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.730
and August of 1945, because my
grandfather was set to be part

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:09.130
of the invasion of
the home islands

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:12.410
with unimaginable
casualty figures.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:15.110
Again, complexity.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:16.720
The general and the universal,

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:21.150
but with a discernible,
personal impact.

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:26.110
I believe that I was drawn
to history and to biography

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:29.850
because I grew up not in a land

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:33.610
of where there were absolute
moral certitudes of black

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:38.630
and white and good and evil,
but a kind of ambiguity.

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:42.150
And I was taught
because of the heroism

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:46.660
of that man whose house sat
between these two emblems

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.050
of our falling short, that
the important thing was

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.150
to stay in the fight.

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.710
Because the United States,
had it not been founded,

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.450
had we not come through
the cataclysm of the war,

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:00.880
had we not continued the
journey and the search,

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.400
not for a perfect union
but for a more perfect one,

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.070
we would never have been
able to project the force

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:11.110
across the seas to defeat
tyranny at Mid century

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:15.370
in the second world war.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:19.540
And so between these two
sins stood a man I revered,

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.370
who was not perfect.

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.380
But who did the right
thing and put his life

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.260
on the line for others.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:32.240
In that moral universe, in the
contradictory nature of that,

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:36.780
I began to see that the
human story was, in fact,

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.360
the most representative
one, the most enduring one.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:45.580
And I think we learn most from
the past, not when we look

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:50.110
down on it condescendingly
or up at it adoringly,

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.600
but when we look
at it in the eye.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.240
Take it for what it was and
realize that the damn miracle

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:01.390
of the United States is that
we've gotten this much right.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:05.740
We live in a fallen
sinful world,

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.800
the founders understood it.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.390
The constitution is one

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:11.950
of the most Calvinistic
documents you can imagine.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:16.200
It assumes we're driven
by appetite and ambition.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.800
It assumes that we're mostly
going to do the wrong thing.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.350
And they were right.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:25.670
But what did it give us?

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:31.540
It gave us the means by which
to seek our better angels.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.720
And I don't know about
you all, but in the course

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:39.010
of a given day, if I get
things right 51% of the time,

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:41.110
that's a helluva good day.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:45.550
And I think that's true in
the lives of nations as well.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:48.800
I've written about
very complicated men

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.810
and women, mostly men.

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:55.380
I've written about them because
-- not because they were perfect

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.020
but because they
were so imperfect and

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:01.140
yet at critical moments
rose to the occasion

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:06.440
and pushed us forward, pushed us
toward that more perfect union.

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.890
I've read about Thomas
Jefferson, a slave owner

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:13.310
who nevertheless wrote the most
important sentence ever written

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.510
in the English language as
our friend David likes to say.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:18.350
That all men are created equal.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:20.320
I get nervous when
I hear David say

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.350
that about the most
important sentence written

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.270
in the English language because
the phrase reminds me of a story

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:29.000
about the Texas school board
candidate who was running

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.200
and was against Spanish being
taught and went on the stump

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.010
and said "If English
was good enough

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:40.000
for our lord Jesus Christ,
it's good enough for Texas."

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.520
As a Tennessean, we have

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.980
to remind Texans they
would still be part

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.110
of Spain if it weren't for us.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:50.290
I made that joke once to
Governor George W. Bush

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:53.380
and he said, "heh,
that's funny asshole."

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.640
The miracle of the country is

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.730
that despite our flaws,
we stay in the fight.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.840
We get things right.

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.140
A final story about...

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.450
another man I wrote
about, Andrew Jackson,

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:14.680
who saved the union in
1832, Franklin Roosevelt

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.980
who saved democracy,
saved capitalism

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:22.580
and signed executive order
9906, Japanese Americans.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.530
George Herbert Walker Bush who
got a lot wrong in his life,

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:30.780
imperfect man but he did leave
us with a more perfect union.

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.870
I'll leave you with this.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:37.630
About a year ago, the incumbent
president -- Voldemort --

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:50.760
[Applause] -- was on his way
to Nashville where I live

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.930
to give -- to lay a wreath at
the tomb of Andrew Jackson.

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:56.530
I live in Nashville.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.830
And he was coming down
and I thought, well,

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:00.130
I should do something.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.400
And so I wrote an open letter
to the president that said

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.020
"If you're going to
embrace Andrew Jackson,

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.240
don't just embrace
the crazy parts."

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:11.340
There are plenty of
crazy parts to embrace.

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.500
He once said only two regrets in
life were he had not shot Clay

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:20.290
and hung Calhoun, his
own vice president.

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:21.860
We now know no one felt that way

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.900
about their running
mate until John McCain.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.450
But -- Senator McCain liked
that joke, I can report.

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:37.440
I cleared it with
him some years ago.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:42.780
I said, if you're going to
embrace Jackson, he was,

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.580
for all his faults, someone who
believed in the American union.

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.600
He was devoted to the
constitutional experiment

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.590
as flawed as it was, kept
us together through crises,

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:53.350
and was a great negotiator
and understood weaknesses

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:56.120
and knew how to use them.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.870
I wrote an open letter on
the front page of the paper,

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:00.450
only thing that greeted
the president

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:01.870
when he came to Nashville.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:06.600
Had no effect whatsoever.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.970
The next day, true
story, my phone rang,

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:14.470
my most recent subject, George
H.W. Bush in the hospital a lot

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.980
that winter and his staff was
giving him things to read.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.260
He read this.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.750
Get Meacham on the phone.

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:23.720
The key to doing his voice,

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.730
as Dana carver said is Mr.
Rogers trying to be John Wayne.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:31.620
How ya doing?

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.040
I'm fine, Mr. President.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:37.020
He said, I read your
letter to Jackson.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.270
I thought, oh, the
ole boy is losing it.

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:41.570
He thinks I'm writing
letters to dead people.

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:43.930
I said, thank you.

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:48.140
Actually, it was a letter
to Trump, not Jackson.

00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:51.760
He said, yeah, but Jackson
will pay more attention.

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.890
[Applause] Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.730
please welcome Amy Tan.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:35.470
[Applause] A. Tan: I've been
sitting here thinking what

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:40.350
excuse I could come up with
to say why I'm not prepared.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.650
I had deadlines.

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:42.950
They had three hours of sleep.

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:46.600
I was on an airplane before I
said, I really do have to think

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.330
about the fact I'm
going to be talking

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.130
in front of Annie Proulx.

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:54.640
I want to tell you a story about
reading, and that is my debt

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.240
of gratitude to the libraries

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.260
from the time I was
a young child.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.060
I was from an immigrant,
a frugal immigrant family,

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.060
in fact, an illegal
immigrant family.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.950
We didn't have a lot
of money for books.

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:08.550
We didn't have books
in the house.

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:11.700
By the time I was six years
old I would walk to the library

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:15.470
by myself and carry as many
books as I could home to read.

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:18.930
Now, I didn't learn how to read
before that because the powers

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:24.390
that be in the 1950s deemed
it irresponsible of parents

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:26.320
to teach their children
how to read,

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.880
because they would probably
do it by really dumb methods,

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.480
and their children would end up
with learning problems the rest

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.920
of their lives, probably
be chronic bed wetters

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.230
and criminals and
all kinds of things.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.630
So parents just didn't do that.

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:43.020
Hence no books in our house.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.380
I remember, though, in the
first grade there was a woman

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:50.050
who confirmed this, that you
shouldn't teach your children

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:51.390
to read early on.

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:52.690
She came and she pulled me

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:55.120
out of the classroom
and gave me a test.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.980
And later on she had -- did
an interview with my parents.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.320
I remember seeing
her, this young woman,

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.540
sitting in the living room.

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:06.830
And at the end of this,
my parents called me in

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.450
and they told me the good news.

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:13.200
They said that the woman had
done this test and she told them

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.590
that I had what it would
take to be a doctor.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:22.590
This is like heroine
to a Chinese parent.

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:26.640
So not only was I going to be a
concert pianist, it was already

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:29.060
in the works, I was
going to be a doctor.

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.550
They told me also my English
skills were not that great,

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:35.740
but doctors and pianists,
they really did not need

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.280
to have that, it
wasn't a problem.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.880
The woman came twice a
year, gave me these tests.

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:46.730
And the test became longer and
longer and I could never finish.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:48.870
I thought I was becoming
dumber and dumber,

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:51.030
maybe she was wrong
about the first test.

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:52.710
I wasn't inspired
enough to be a doctor,

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:55.580
but I had to keep
up the pre-tests.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:59.830
My self-esteem was
based on those tests.

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:03.110
I felt I was not
adequate to the task

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.810
of fulfilling my
immigrant parents' dreams.

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:07.400
But I had a secret dream myself

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.730
and that was to become
an artist.

00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.370
I love to draw.

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:14.910
But that dream kind of
went north when my teacher,

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:19.080
my art teacher, when I was
16, wrote in my report card

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.590
that I had no imagination,
which was necessary

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:26.170
to a deeper level of creativity.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.770
Okay... so out the
window goes that.

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:35.780
At about the same time I got
my SAT scores and I scored

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.770
in the 400s in English.

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:42.420
Not really encouraging for
somebody who might want

00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:48.230
to make their living out of the
artful arrangement of words.

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:51.960
Around that time my father and
brother died of brain tumors.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.780
Fortunately I became a
very rebellious girl.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:58.790
So, a year into being
a pre-med major,

00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:01.610
I quit and I became
an English major,

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:03.660
much to the horror of my mother.

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.680
But I love to read.

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.540
I finished that major
in about three years

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.650
and I became a linguistics
major and got a graduate degree

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:14.240
in that because I love words.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.380
I love the feel, the texture,

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:21.120
all the different ways
you could interpret words.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:24.370
I eventually became a
writer, business writer.

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:27.070
I wrote things like direct mail,
the things you get in the mail

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:31.540
that says "act now
and you get 20% off."

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.090
Very good at that.

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:36.200
I wrote business articles,
telecommunications.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.500
I hated it.

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:42.200
And it wasn't until I was
33 years old, 33 years ago,

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.450
that I started writing fiction.

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:46.570
And fast forward.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:52.150
A few years ago I was trying to
write -- finish my latest book,

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:53.620
which people call a memoir.

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:59.140
It's really my imaginings
about why I became a writer.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.500
And I wondered about that test.

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.150
What was the test really about?

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:06.090
Because no professional would
have been so irresponsible

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:09.140
to tell parents that
their child was going

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.490
to be a doctor based
on one set of scores.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:14.810
So I did a Google
search and I put

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:18.800
in 1958 first grade
Oakland School District,

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.600
IQ Longitudinal.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.850
And the first thing that
came up was an article

00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:26.550
by a woman named
Dr. Delores Durkin.

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:30.400
I thought, that was
the name of the woman.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.240
And it was a landmark
study she had done.

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.150
It involved 49 children.

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:43.700
Out of 5,003 first graders that
year, 49 of them were identified

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:47.530
as having been illegally
taught to read.

00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:49.190
I was one of those readers.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:56.140
[Applause] Now, I
found that article.

00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.870
Not only did I find the article

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:01.150
but through detective
work I found the book.

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:03.480
You have to imagine my
reading this thing is

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.540
like my self-esteem
was based on this test.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.510
I wasn't supposed
to be a doctor.

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:12.340
I felt so betrayed.

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:15.840
And I read this book and I had
all the charts and the layouts

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.970
of facts and figures,
the Oriental kid.

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:22.340
And there were five interviews.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.860
And I looked at them and
first I didn't recognize them

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.930
because the names were math.

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:31.160
And my mother said, I learn
you cannot teach children

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.110
to enjoy music.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.410
I thought...

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:35.710
that's my mother.

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:39.920
I started reading and I
found out that my parents,

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.250
they kept debating the question
that this woman, Dr. Durkin had,

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.130
which was how did
she learn to read.

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:49.980
My parents said, her
older brother, Peter,

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.800
he's so brilliant, he
didn't learn to read,

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.610
he waited until first grade,
and he skipped a grade

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:58.350
because he just learned so fast.

01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:00.260
We followed the rules.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:03.280
And finally they kind
of admitted, well,

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.380
I might have picked
it up from my brother,

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.370
who was teaching my cousins,
our cousins from China to read.

01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.170
They didn't speak any English.

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:15.880
And I had sat in on
these little lessons.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.690
And the others that my brother
brought home his textbooks

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:23.390
and I would actually copy
the words, these letters,

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:26.150
and then I would ask
him, what is this?

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.860
And he would tell me.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:32.130
My father then went on
to say something else.

01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:34.250
He said, you know,
before the age of --

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:40.460
even before the age of four, she
always loved to draw pictures

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.010
and tell stories about them.

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:48.590
And she said she had
an amazing imagination.

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:52.950
And I have there my confirmation
that that test and what

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:56.410
that woman had found
was indeed the reason

01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:57.880
that I became a writer.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.510
I did one more thing in
my search for the answer

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:05.650
to my self-esteem and
why I became a writer.

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:07.250
I found Ms. Durkin.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:12.240
I went searching for months
and I finally found a number

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.690
and she was still alive.

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.340
She didn't remember me.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.700
I said, I was the first
study, your landmark --

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.200
she said, I had so many
children I worked with.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.480
I told her what my
parents had said.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.150
She said, that was
very wrong of them.

01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:30.870
It had nothing to do with
what you would become.

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:34.670
And I said, I just want to
tell you, I became a writer.

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.320
And she said, of course you did.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.270
You loved to read.

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:40.110
That's why you became a writer.

01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:45.090
So I thank you, I thank
the library for providing

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:49.670
to kids the books they need,
because they love to read.

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:03.520
[Applause] Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.890
please welcome the
Library of Congress Prize

01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:09.280
for American Fiction
winner, Annie Proulx.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:27.960
[Applause] A. Proulx: I'm hoping
I don't go into a coughing fit.

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:42.220
I live in the Pacific northwest
and we have been inundated

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.720
with smoke from British
Columbia,

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.610
which seems to be burning
up its forests this summer.

01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:56.310
I'm a little uneasy standing
here because I do not think

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.980
of myself as a real writer.

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:06.270
What I am and what I have been
for most of my life is a reader.

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:09.290
For me books are everything.

01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:13.770
I learned to read by
osmosis around age 4.

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:16.960
My mother read picture
books to me from infancy,

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.080
and after a while I recognized
the letters on the page

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.580
as forming words that could be
understood by looking at them,

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:28.880
as well as speaking
or hearing them.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.210
In the extended family, I
was the one who liked to read

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:35.720
and well-meaning relatives
blissfully ignorant

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:40.640
of literary discrimination
gave me books of all kinds.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.420
A first edition of Uncle
Tom's Cabin inscribed

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:47.480
as a Christmas gift
for Daisy Crowell,

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:50.710
one of my great grandmother's
sisters.

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:56.100
Another gift was my Aunt
Pug's college psychology text.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.400
[ Laughter ]

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.220
It had a page of
about 10 photographs

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.640
of facial expressions
indicating various emotions

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.150
as anger and fear.

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:10.370
Around the time I entered
first grade my mother took me

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:14.390
to the local library in
Druid City Connecticut.

01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:19.040
I understood here was an
endless supply of books,

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:24.710
and I could take them home,
my life became immensely rich.

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:26.530
Katherine Elizabeth Docks,

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:30.450
books about early human
awakened a lifetime interest

01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:32.460
in prehistory.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:37.860
Howard V. Brown illustrations
inoculated my mind with images

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.070
of cave bears, saber
tooth tigers,

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:44.020
wild-eyed people wearing animal
skins and perched in trees

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.250
above flooding rivers.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:51.760
The first adult book I read
was Jack London's "before Adam.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.220
" Adult sexuality was strong
stuff for an eight-year-old.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:59.530
[ Laughter ]

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.820
As much as words and
stories meant to me,

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.610
book illustrations were
unfor getably important.

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:07.980
My vision of European
forests was formed

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.820
by Arthur Rackham's
fairy tail illustrations

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:15.210
of twisted choking trees
until I had occasion

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:20.240
to visit the ancient
forest in Poland this year.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.190
I happily mix children
and adult books.

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:27.060
In my early teens I
chose non-fiction books

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:30.040
by the color of binds.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:37.130
I had read "mutiny on the
bounty" with great pleasure.

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:40.470
I subconsciously thought beige
buckram books would be the

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:43.360
most interesting.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.380
But Dr. Harold Kratz
autobiographical account

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:56.360
of his life as a medical student
entitled Campus Shadows bound

01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:01.060
in midnight blue
disamused me of the notion.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:04.240
In high school I started
accumulating my own library

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.230
with many modern
library editions.

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:11.110
The poems of William Blake
joined the short stories

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:15.680
of Fitzgerald, Stevenson,
Melville, Thoreau,

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.950
Ernest Hemingway and I
was found of recallings.

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:22.960
Years later I could
only think what a thrill

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.200
if I had discovered Bartam's
travels at that time.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.670
Novels captivated
with people different

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:31.140
from my small New England world.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:37.770
More and more I was attracted
to books about distant places

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:42.910
and began to move away
from fiction to exploration

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:51.010
and see stories, mountain
climbing, wilderness travel,

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:55.170
sermons, oratory, and history.

01:07:55.170 --> 01:08:03.920
My love for history started then
and I later found the approach

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.010
to the past agreeable.

01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:10.710
I was anxious to get to high
school so I could learn Latin.

01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:14.440
Those were the days when
they still taught Latin

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.740
in high school.

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:19.480
But I found it difficult

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:25.640
and spent many frustrated
hours puzzling

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.300
over Cicero's sentences.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:32.900
I see now good training
for sentence construction.

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.270
Latin is such a tighten folded
language, it takes yards

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:42.040
of English words to tease
out the compressed meanings.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.950
The first foreign writer I read

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:48.510
in translation was Kafka's
Metaphor followed by others.

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:54.230
I read also Ladner, Hurst,
Conrad, Aiken, stories rather

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.530
than poems, and Irish
short story collections

01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:00.450
as I could find.

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:04.520
I was powerfully attracted to
short stories from Katherine

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:11.830
and porter's Noon Wine
made indelible impression.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:21.730
It would take many hours to name
the books I've read in my life,

01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:25.090
but after 50 or so years
of this omnivorous reading,

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:29.810
I began to sense an invisible
something behind all the stories

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:31.190
and texts.

01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:34.910
Something I could
not quite grasp.

01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:38.900
After falling into a
particularly beautiful passage

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:46.830
in anthropologist, I started to
read less for plot and character

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:50.610
and more for discovering
finally written passages

01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:53.140
and shapely paragraphs.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.990
I became aware of structure.

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:58.350
Aware of the human
minds and hands

01:09:58.350 --> 01:10:01.660
that arranged the
words on the page.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.930
And I came to believe
that fiction

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:07.760
and especially the short
story could be a way

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.960
for understanding how we fit

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.950
into constantly changing
societies and how the geography

01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:16.970
of where we live, the region

01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:21.570
and culture determine
the arcs of our lives.

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:26.090
So, 20 odd years or so ago,
I began to work out some

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:29.750
of these ideas myself.

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:35.300
Now I'm old, but reading more
than ever, and I am reading now

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:43.230
about genetics, human and animal
migration s,esturine tides,

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:49.680
seaweed, filmmakers,
wolves and wildfire.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.450
Ain't it great?

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:55.660
[Applause] C. Hayden:
Thank you all

01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:25.180
for this wonderful evening
and to our sponsors.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:29.270
I hope you have had a
wonderful time tonight.

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:33.670
And before we go into the Great
Hall for dinner, I have --

01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:37.230
and it says here
"breaking news."

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:39.030
It's okay.

01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:45.150
[ Laughter ]

01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:48.420
We are pleased to
announce the date

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:56.250
of the 2019 National
Book Festival!

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.950
It will be on Saturday,
August 31st,

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:01.870
also the Labor Day weekend.

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:04.870
So have a wonderful
evening upstairs.

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:09.690
And let's celebrate
books and reading!
