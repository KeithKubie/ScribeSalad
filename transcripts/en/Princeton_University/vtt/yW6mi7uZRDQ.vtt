00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.340 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
Plastic electronics are electronic devices in which the active components are made out

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.510 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
of carbon-based materials, so these are plastics, polymers or small molecules. The reason you

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.490 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
want to make plastic electronics is because you want to make use of the attributes of

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.670 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
these plastic materials. These include their mechanical flexibility, they're lightweight,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.750 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
they can be produced with tunable properties, and this is something you can't easily do

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.750 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
with inorganic materials. My name is Yueh-Lin Loo, and I work in the field of plastic electronics.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.470 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
In the field of plastic electronics, it all starts with chemistry. We need to make or

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.600 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
synthesize new materials that are conductive or semi-conductive, so they have the electrical

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.790 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
properties that we would like, so that when we incorporate them into electronic devices,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.800 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
they're active. In our group, some of the researchers make new materials, some of the

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.850 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
researchers characterize the structures of these materials, and some of them incorporate

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.590 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
these materials to understand their potential in applications like transistors and solar cells

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.740 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
Polyaniline is a conducting polymer that changes color. Here, this color change

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.009 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
is triggered by applying a voltage to the sample. The potential applications for polyaniline,

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.799 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
in addition to being electrodes, is that we can use it as electrochromic displays, as

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.759 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
well as sensors that change color when it's exposed to a specific chemical or reagent.

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.789 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
We use a process called spin coating to make thin layers of these compounds. The layers

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.789 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
end up to be about a hundred nanometers thick. That's about a thousand times thinner than my hair.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.599 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
Here, we examine the films we make under the microscope to see how the crystals grew during

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:59.599 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
spin coating. We try to control the size of the crystals in the film.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.079 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
The bigger the crystals, the better the devices will turn out.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.500 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
To make the devices, we have to make electrical contact to the film by evaporating gold.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.000 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
Gold is evaporated through a mask. The pattern of the mask determines where gold is coated.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.960 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
After the placement of the mask, we put the sample in the gold evaporator.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.700 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
Alternatively, we can evaporate gold electrodes on a clear silicone rubber stamp, and laminate the rubber

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.480 position:75%
Lynn Loo:
stamp onto the polymer film to make our devices.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.110 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
The structure of the devices depends on their function. In my opinion, their beauty derives

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.110 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
from their functionality. Compared to inorganics like silicon, plastics have unique attributes.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.420 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
These include their lightweightness, their mechanical flexibility, their potential low

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.530 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
cost, and their tunability in terms of their properties. So, to incorporate all these attributes

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.530 position:70%
Lynn Loo:
into electronic devices would be really nice.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.260 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
The field's really exciting because it's a young field, and it's growing, and it's directly

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.260 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
tied to applications that can have direct implications on the quality of our lives.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.950 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
Imagine electronic wallpaper that changes patterns from green stripes to pink polka

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.600 position:98%
Lynn Loo:
dots at a click of a switch. Imagine tinted windows that can also generate power during

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.510 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
the day. Imagine disposable sensors that would change color if the water source is contaminated.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.590 position:97%
Lynn Loo:
Or yet, think of smart plastic patches that can monitor your health and deliver medication

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.780 position:75%
Lynn Loo:
when you're sick. The possibilities are endless.
