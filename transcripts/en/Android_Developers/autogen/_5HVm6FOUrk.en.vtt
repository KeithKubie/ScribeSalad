then we can get started the first step
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.650
then we can get started the first step
is to download a kik QuickStart code

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
is to download a kik QuickStart code
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780
is to download a kik QuickStart code
which is available on github under the

Google Drive folder once you have
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.619
Google Drive folder once you have
downloaded this you should install it on

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
downloaded this you should install it on
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.170
downloaded this you should install it on
your computer then it's time to build

you do this by creating a project select

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
you do this by creating a project select
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.729
you do this by creating a project select
new other Android project from existing

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739

Android device now we're going to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
Android device now we're going to
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.510
Android device now we're going to
register the app with Google and the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
register the app with Google and the
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399
register the app with Google and the
first thing we need to do is to generate

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
first thing we need to do is to generate
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590
first thing we need to do is to generate
the app signature in the form of a sha-1

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
the app signature in the form of a sha-1
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.410
the app signature in the form of a sha-1
and this picture may look really really

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
and this picture may look really really
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780
and this picture may look really really
scary but it is actually very very easy

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
scary but it is actually very very easy
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.270
scary but it is actually very very easy

need that value shortly now that we have
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.859
need that value shortly now that we have
this value we can proceed to register

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
this value we can proceed to register
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.440
this value we can proceed to register
our app with Google and we use this we

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
our app with Google and we use this we
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450
our app with Google and we use this we
use the Google Cloud console to do so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

now we're ready to register our apps

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
now we're ready to register our apps
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.110
now we're ready to register our apps
which will have the drive API enables so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
which will have the drive API enables so
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.180
which will have the drive API enables so
select registered apps to the right and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190
select registered apps to the right and
 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.750
select registered apps to the right and
give the app a name then select Android

Android app and accessing our API is

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
Android app and accessing our API is
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.550
Android app and accessing our API is
directly from Android the last thing you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
directly from Android the last thing you
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.320
directly from Android the last thing you
need to do when registering your app is

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330
need to do when registering your app is
 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.479
need to do when registering your app is
to enter the Java package name of your

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489
to enter the Java package name of your
 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.670
to enter the Java package name of your
app and the sha-1 value that we

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
app and the sha-1 value that we
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.830
app and the sha-1 value that we
previously generated using key tool and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840
previously generated using key tool and
 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.449
previously generated using key tool and
with this we have successfully

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
with this we have successfully
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.220
with this we have successfully
registered that app with the Google

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
registered that app with the Google
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.620
registered that app with the Google
Cloud console and we are now ready to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630
Cloud console and we are now ready to
 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.400
Cloud console and we are now ready to
execute the app I will demo the app on a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
execute the app I will demo the app on a
 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.040
execute the app I will demo the app on a
real physical device so in order to do

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
real physical device so in order to do
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.800
real physical device so in order to do
this I must transfer the apk to just

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
this I must transfer the apk to just
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.140
this I must transfer the apk to just
actual device this can be performed by

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
actual device this can be performed by
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.300
actual device this can be performed by
connecting the device and then using the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310
connecting the device and then using the
 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.240
connecting the device and then using the
adb command from the Android SDK to

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
adb command from the Android SDK to
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.070
adb command from the Android SDK to
transfer the apk that we previously

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080
transfer the apk that we previously
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.699
transfer the apk that we previously
built all done let's run the app so now

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709
built all done let's run the app so now
 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.559
built all done let's run the app so now
the application has started and I can go

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569
the application has started and I can go
 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.729
the application has started and I can go
in here and take a picture with the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
in here and take a picture with the
 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.840
in here and take a picture with the
camera that's a great picture I'm taking

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850
camera that's a great picture I'm taking
 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.520
camera that's a great picture I'm taking
that it's asking me to upload it to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
that it's asking me to upload it to
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.970
that it's asking me to upload it to
drive so I'm accepting that then I can

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
drive so I'm accepting that then I can
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.780
drive so I'm accepting that then I can
go over to Drive and I can see the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
go over to Drive and I can see the
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.640
go over to Drive and I can see the
picture being uploaded here and there it

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650

is excellent so I took a picture and it
was uploaded to drive and that's it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829
was uploaded to drive and that's it
 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.440
was uploaded to drive and that's it
we have now installed a run the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
we have now installed a run the
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.880
