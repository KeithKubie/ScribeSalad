00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:02.404
- [Voiceover] So we're told that f of x

00:00:02.404 --> 00:00:07.063
is equal to x over one
minus cosine of x minus two,

00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:09.195
and they ask us to select
the correct description

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:13.312
of the one-sided limits
of f at x equals two.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.498
And we see that right at x equals two,

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:18.623
if we try to evaluate f of two,

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:22.018
we get two over one minus cosine

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:23.435
of two minus two,

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:28.478
which is the same thing as cosine of zero,

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:31.601
and cosine of zero is just one,

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.018
and so one minus one is zero,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.833
and so the function is not
defined at x equals two,

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.364
and that's why it might be
interesting to find the limit

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:44.177
as x approaches two, and
especially the one-sided limit.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:45.241
And the one-sided limit.

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.666
Well, we'll obviously leave it at that

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.568
so let's try to approach this.

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:50.872
So there's actually a couple
of ways you could do it.

00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:52.994
There is one way you could
do this without a calculator

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:55.618
by just inspecting what's going on here,

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:58.098
and thinking about the properties
of the cosine function,

00:00:58.098 --> 00:01:00.526
and if that inspires you,
pause the video and work it out,

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.503
and I will do that at
the end of this video.

00:01:02.503 --> 00:01:06.356
The other way, if you have a calculator

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:08.035
is to do it with a little bit of a table

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.824
like we've done in other example problems.

00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:13.235
So if we think about x approaching two

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.954
from the positive direction, well then.

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:18.778
We can make a little table here

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:22.587
where you have x, and
then you have f of x.

00:01:22.587 --> 00:01:26.478
And so for approaching two
from values greater than two,

00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:28.061
you could have 2.1,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.603
2.01.

00:01:32.312 --> 00:01:33.629
Now the reason why I said calculators,

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:35.662
these aren't trivial to evaluate

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:38.245
because this would be what, 2.1

00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:41.555
over 1 minus cosine of,

00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:44.178
2.1 minus two is 0.1.

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:50.083
I do not know what cosine of
0.1 is without a calculator.

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:53.083
I do know that cosine of zero is one

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:58.318
so this is very, very close
to one without getting to one,

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.023
and it's going to be less than one.

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:03.140
Cosine is never going
to be greater than one.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.616
The cosine function is
bounded between negative one

00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:07.699
is less than cosine of x.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.516
I'll just write the x, then
I don't need the parenthesis.

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:13.766
Which is less than one.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.760
The cosine function just
oscillates between these two values

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.880
so this, this thing is
gonna be approaching one

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.467
but it's going to be less than one.

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:25.081
It definitely cannot be greater than one,

00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:25.957
and that's actually a good hint

00:02:25.957 --> 00:02:28.154
for how you can just
explore the structure here,

00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:30.525
and then you could say, "All right, 2.01.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.373
"Well, that's going to be 2.01

00:02:32.373 --> 00:02:33.623
"over one minus

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.046
"cosine of 0.01."

00:02:39.874 --> 00:02:42.969
And this is going to even closer to one

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.314
without being one but it's
going to be less than one.

00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:48.873
No matter what, cosine of anything

00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:52.034
is going to be between
negative one and one,

00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:54.237
and it could even be
including those things

00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:56.817
but as we approach two,

00:02:56.817 --> 00:03:00.439
this thing is going to approach one,

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.208
I guess you could say
approach one from below.

00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:05.119
And so you can start to
make some intuitions here.

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:09.005
If it's approaching from
below, this thing over here,

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.642
this whole expression
is going to be positive,

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:15.346
and as we approach x equals two.

00:03:15.346 --> 00:03:16.555
Well, the numerator is positive.

00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:17.611
It's approaching two.

00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:20.539
The denominator is positive
so this whole thing

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.049
has to be approaching a positive value

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.387
or it could become unbounded

00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:26.008
in the positive direction as we'll see,

00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:29.008
this is unbounded because this thing

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:32.379
is even closer to one than this thing,

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.301
and you would see that
if you have a calculator

00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:36.715
but needless to say, this
is going to be unbounded

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:39.554
in the positive direction
so we're going to be going

00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:43.426
towards positive infinity so
these two choices have that,

00:03:43.426 --> 00:03:47.531
and we can make the exact
same argument as we approach x

00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:50.305
in the negative or from below,

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:53.126
as we approach two from
below, I should say.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:56.194
So that's x, and that is f of x,

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.354
and once again, I don't have
a calculator in front of me.

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:00.338
You could evaluate these
things at a calculator,

00:04:00.338 --> 00:04:02.287
and become very clear
that these are positive,

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:03.624
and as we get closer to,

00:04:03.624 --> 00:04:06.632
they become even larger
and larger positive values,

00:04:06.632 --> 00:04:10.549
and the same thing would
happen if you did 1.9,

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.569
and if you did 1.99

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.103
because here, you'd be
1.9 over one minus cosine.

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:23.500
Now here, you'd have 1.9 minus two

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.000
so this would be negative 0.1.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.215
Let me scroll over a little bit.

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:32.018
The second one would be 1.99

00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:33.768
over one minus cosine

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.097
of negative 0.01.

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.043
And cosine of negative 0.1

00:04:42.043 --> 00:04:44.088
is the same thing as cosine of 0.1.

00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:46.005
Cosine of negative 0.01

00:04:48.072 --> 00:04:51.111
is the same thing as cosine of 0.01.

00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:54.385
So these two things, this is
going to be equal to that.

00:04:54.385 --> 00:04:56.269
That is going to be equal to that.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:59.102
And once again, we're gonna be
approaching positive infinity

00:04:59.102 --> 00:05:01.227
so the only choice where
all of that is true

00:05:01.227 --> 00:05:03.517
is this first one.

00:05:03.517 --> 00:05:05.547
Whether we approach two
from the right-hand side

00:05:05.547 --> 00:05:08.510
or the left-hand side, we're
approaching positive infinity

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.132
but the other way you could
have deduced that is say,

00:05:10.132 --> 00:05:11.902
"Okay, as we approach two,

00:05:11.902 --> 00:05:13.800
the numerator is going to be positive

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.429
'cause two is positive,
and then over here,

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:18.612
as we approach two,

00:05:18.612 --> 00:05:21.843
cosine of anything can
never be greater than one.

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:24.617
It's going to approach
one but be less than one

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:28.534
so if this is less than
as x approaches two.

00:05:29.675 --> 00:05:32.410
It becomes one when x is equal to two.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.173
Well then, this right over here,

00:05:34.173 --> 00:05:37.633
one minus something less than
one is going to be positive

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:39.351
so you have a positive
divided by a positive

00:05:39.351 --> 00:05:41.857
so you're definitely going
to get positive values

00:05:41.857 --> 00:05:43.305
as you approach two.

00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:45.870
And we know, and they've already told us

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.477
that these are going to be
unbounded based on the choices

00:05:48.477 --> 00:05:50.481
so you would also pick that

00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:51.943
but you should also feel good about it,

00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:55.068
that the closer that we get to two,

00:05:55.068 --> 00:05:59.235
the closer that this value
right over here gets to zero.

00:06:00.618 --> 00:06:02.335
And the closer that
this value gets to zero,

00:06:02.335 --> 00:06:03.842
the closer we get to one.

00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:07.883
The closer we get to one, the
smaller the denominator gets.

00:06:07.883 --> 00:06:10.077
And then you divide by smaller
and smaller denominators,

00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:12.908
you're going to become
unbounded towards infinity,

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:15.857
which is exactly what we
see in that first choice.
