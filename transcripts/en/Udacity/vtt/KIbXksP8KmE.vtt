00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.940
So when we do this, we have, with the ViewPort,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.300
we have its height as a percept and we have its contents a, as a percept. For

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.660
the scroll bar, we have the position of the handle is a percept and

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.100
also the size is a percept. But we don't currently have any percepts for

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.580
the FileManager, and in fact the user doesn't directly see the file manager.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.790
However if we took our 40,000 foot view of the system, and, and

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.229
we said what is external to the system and

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:37.080
what is internal to the system. The user is external to the system. Users, is,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.410
is the one that's going to be taken advantage of the, of the system. But

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.860
also, the file system itself, the operating system is external to the system and

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.340
the operating system is the one with which the FileManager component has to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.587
deal. So we're going to treat the operating system as an external acto,r and

00:00:57.587 --> 00:01:03.500
the FileManager is going to interact with that external actor.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.740
And as far as the FileManager is concerned, it has an attribute which is

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.744
the document. Providing that as a, as a resource to the rest of the system, and

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:19.420
it's, it's, it's It also has an interface to this external actor,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.340
that is, the actor has to provide that, that document. So we have an attribute

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.930
there which is, the document which is a sequence of, a sequence of lines.
