00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here's the quiz question for you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to give you a little more practice with this sort of advanced testing and debugging.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We've got these 4 boxes here. Each one corresponds to a single line.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Which of these lines could I remove, comment out 1 at a time,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and still see the exception?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I know that if we remove all of them, we don't see the exception.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what I want to know is, which of these lines are essential to the bug?

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Which of these lines really show off the bug?
