00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.059
&gt;&gt; All right. Let's start off with an introduction
to--of yourselves, your company, and your

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.019
product.
&gt;&gt; JIMENEZ: Okay. My name is John Jimenez.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.109
I'm a senior manager for Web services for
Citrix. Our product that we're demoing here

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.359
at Google I/O is Citrix T.V. Website, which
is kind of an enterprise version of YouTube

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.279
for Citrix and its partners and its employees.
&gt;&gt; LIPTAY: And I'm Albert Liptay, principle

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.430
Web developer and I do a lot of the plumbing
on the back end and on the [INDISTINCT].

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.060
&gt;&gt; Okay. So you're using the Google Web Toolkit.
What were some of the reasons for you to choose

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.640
that platform?
&gt;&gt; JIMENEZ: We chose Google Web Toolkit for

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.500
a couple of different reasons. We've been
evaluating the technology for a little while.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
It was sort of in the back of our minds as
we were sort of evaluating new projects as

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.030
they were coming along. But like the keynote
from yesterday, the guy who was demoing the--actually,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.640
from this morning--the Wave project. He said,
you know, very publicly, he wouldn't have

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.530
been able to do the project without GWT. I
feel the same way. We had started sort of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.359
evaluating it. We thought it was a neat thing
and sort of put it on the shelf until Citrix

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:21.049
had to do a resizing and we lost a lot the
skill set that we would have needed to do

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.969
the project. So it allowed us to take a lot
of guys who are really talented, Java developers

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:34.249
and allowed them to become really talented
JavaScript and AJAX developers. So without

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:39.030
GWT, I don't think this project would have
gotten off the ground.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.689
&gt;&gt; All right. Any major check up for challenges
or cool war stories using the product?

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:50.039
&gt;&gt; LIPTAY: No, we sat down at the beginning
of the offset of the project and said, "Are

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.029
we committed?" And I think we both agreed
that we wanted to go the distance. So we basically

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:59.789
surmounted all the hurdles we had.
&gt;&gt; JIMENEZ: It was a--it was a different sort

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.539
of mindset going in to--to the developing
a GWT application. And I think once we got

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.290
our mind around how GWT works, I think, everything
worked well after that. And coming from Web

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.120
1.0 and a JavaScript development paradigm
into the GWT paradigm, once we got our minds

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.380
right, I think, it was all easy. But getting
there, it took a little bit.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.050
&gt;&gt; LIPTAY: And one thing to mention too is
that, you know, everyone here at the conference

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:33.310
ask me running the features, but reality is,
it really works and it works well.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.540
&gt;&gt; So speaking of features, what are some
of your favorite features of the Web Toolkit?

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.920
&gt;&gt; JIMENEZ: So I ended up rolling up my sleeves
and took off my manager hat and put on my

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.640
developer hat, and I became a UI developer,
you know. Like I said, we went through sort

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.120
of a re-org and we loss our two more--most
talented sort of UI JavaScript developers.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.480
So I ended up building widgets and doing all
those things. And for me, you know, the hosted

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:08.620
mode, being able to do the debugging the application
and my clips debugger, that was amazing. I

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.310
never, you know, my--in my career as a developer,
I've always hated the JavaScript tools, I've

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.310
always that, you know, I've never liked Venkman,
I've never liked some of the JavaScript debuggers.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.490
So being able to debug an application in my
native debugger, you know, which is my Eclipse

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.250
debugger, I think, that by itself was worth,
you know, whatever pains we had to go through

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.070
to sort of embrace it.
&gt;&gt; What about you Albert?

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.120
&gt;&gt; LIPTAY: And for me I would say that, you
know, we have Spring MVC on the back end and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:56.160
using the RPC out of this box makes it very,
very pleasant and it's great work.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.710
&gt;&gt; So an extension of the feature topic, what
are some features you would like to see in

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.980
GWT?
&gt;&gt; JIMENEZ: New feature for GWT, well, we're

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.370
pretty excited about the features that were
announced here, the code splitting. We've

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.650
already sort of moved to 1.6 but, you know,
we've been hearing the--a little bit of buzz

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.060
about what's going to happen in 2.0. The ability
to run your hosted mode in any browser, not

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.030
just a host of browser, I think that will
be big especially for guys who are pushing

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.820
pixels, right? The guys that are doing the
MVC stuff and the RPC stuff, I think, they're

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:32.470
not as affected by, you know, opening up the
hosted-mode browser and waiting and then compiling

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.750
it and then bringing up, you know, your, your
Firebug and all of that. And if you could

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.310
just do that directly in Firebug right away,
I think that would be huge. That would save

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.460
me a quarter of my day.
&gt;&gt; LIPTAY: And I would have to say better

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:54.460
Maven support. I don't think Google quite
embraces Maven. It's a level that we would

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.940
hope secondly on, I don't know.
&gt;&gt; JIMENEZ: I do have one suggestion or something

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.780
that sort of, is always in the back of my
mind when I'm working with GWT is that--how

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:13.669
am I doing? Oh, sorry. So a suggestion for
the GWT team is that, I feel that the way

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:21.990
that J2EE sort of didn't get a take off until
there was some structure around Web development,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.000
I really feel that the catalyst for J2EE to
take off was like Struts or Web works or these

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.240
frame works that really sprung up because
it was sort of the wild-wild west out there.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.300
I feel that that's sort of analogous to what's
going on right now with GWT. If there was

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.200
sort of a more structured way of implementing
your applications, I think, that would sort

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.050
of funnel people down the same path and I
think it would be more, more traction and

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.790
I think it would be embraced, you know.
&gt;&gt; So do you have any advice for people just

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.740
getting started in GWT?
&gt;&gt; JIMENEZ: Yeah. So some advice for some

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.970
folks starting out. For us we went from the,
from the Web 1.0 model, right, where we had

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.230
our wire frames, we had our high fidelity
mock ups, and then we had some guys coding

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.060
html pages. When we started with GWT, it was
such a different mindset for us so we just

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.060
started coding Java right away and figuring
out what the right widgets were and figuring

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.810
out the hierarchy of widgets and the call
models and all of that, I think, that was

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.600
sort of painful for us. So I think we would
want to--if we started over today, I think

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.120
we would start back to the low fidelity prototypes
into the high fidelity prototypes and then

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.510
actually creating html, looking at the html
and then abstracting out what really should

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:43.070
be a widget instead of coding in Java and
seeing how it renders into html, sort of going

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.210
back to, sort of the previous model and sort
of finding a common place, right?

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:56.220
&gt;&gt; LIPTAY: Yeah. And I think that's one thing
Google is, it's not really easy to know what

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.310
libraries, precision libraries are out there
for widgets, like, completing a special table,

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.930
like, you have to search and you're like,
well, does anyone else use this table, and

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.430
it's sort of, same thing goes with [INDISTINCT].
It turns out, a lot of people are using G.I.N.,

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.169
but just strolling the Web, you just don't
like that stuff after...

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:11.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, John and Albert, I want to thank
you for your time and sharing with us today.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.660
&gt;&gt; JIMENEZ: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; LIPTAY: Thank you.
