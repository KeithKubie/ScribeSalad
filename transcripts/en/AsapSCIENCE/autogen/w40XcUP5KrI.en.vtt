00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.240
 You may recognize the song as All Star, for Smash Mouth 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.300
 If you know it, something wonderful is about to happen 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.180
 Although only musical notes are played 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.720
 If you know the song, you'll hear the lead singer's voice 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.400
 And the words of the singers. 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.720
 I swear that what you hear is a digital piano sound 100% 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.580
 It simply matches the frequency of the original song 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.200
 It was not merged with real voices. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.240
 However, you can hear words. 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.860
 This piano speaker shows a similar phenomenon. 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.880
 It's hard to say what he's saying, but 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.340
 Once the words appear on the screen, you will start to hear the speaker. 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.760
 We emphasize 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.060
 We all 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.040
 Officials: 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 Educators 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.040
 Two politicians 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.880
 Social organizations 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.960
 The essence of hearing is perception 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.640
 After the acoustic wave reaches your ear, it turns into signals heading to your mind. 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.940
 But your brain has a lot of external signals that it can not process at once 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.880
 So context is used to formulate what you hear. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.140
 You hear the song's lyrics because the brain uses information it already owns 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.960
 To understand the world. 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.120
 That is why, if you have never heard the song, you will not understand what you hear. 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.700
 But even without words, sometimes, we hear things that do not exist. 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.700
 For example: jump tower. 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.820
 About 20% of people will hear the sound of a jingle every time they land 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.540
 A phenomenon known as 'audio response as a result of visual impact' 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.540
 Do you hear him? 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.380
 It is a kind of sensory accompaniment 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 Which occurs when the senses pass like hearing and sight in the brain. 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.760
 Also, expectation plays a role here. 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.380
 In a 2006 study, the participants' brains were medically painted 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.880
 Who were told they would hear a voice 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.620
 While they were expecting to hear something - without it happening - 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.340
 The auditory cortex activated in the same way 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.800
 As if you were actually listening to the sound. 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.900
 So, do you hear it now? 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.900
 Our brains are good at filling blanks 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.580
 For example in this audio track. 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.160
 Governors of the states meet with their own Legislative Council, which is held in the capital 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.200
 Now, listen to him after the cough has been removed. 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.640
 Governors of the states meet with their council .... which is held in the capital 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.000
 Literally, there is a missing clip 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 With coughing, people tend to hear the whole word. 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.880
 State governors meet with their own Legislative Council, which is held in the capital 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.840
 This is known as 'temporal induction'. 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.940
 Your brain complements information to understand the world. 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.760
 Now, listen to this rhythm. 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.920
 It seems to be getting faster, is not it? 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.160
 It will appear to be growing faster forever, if you let it continue to play. 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120
 Which is known as 'carved rhythm'. 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.800
 Where it starts to play relatively slowly and then accelerates 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.820
 However, when the first one plays, the second one starts at half speed 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.940
 They hurry together. 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.220
 In the end, faster playing fades with slower music 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.820
 The episode continues. 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.140
 But your brain can not tell the difference 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.660
 As a result, it sounds like it's speeding up forever. 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.860
 You like to know the amazing and interesting things in the world? 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.200
 In fact, we just started a new podcast called "Sidenote" 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.400
 Where we explore things that hinder us 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.840
 Or make us curious in life 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.040
 Then we list all the amazing science that causes it. 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.020
 We would like you to join it in iTunes, or any podcast application you use. 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.500
 Your support means a lot to us on our journey towards exploring more science in the new media. 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.300
 Again, the name of the podcast is "sidenote", and because it is new we are excited to know what you think. 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.520
 We'll leave some links below 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.360
 Subscribe to more weekly science videos every Thursday.
