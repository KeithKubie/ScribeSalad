00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.470
All right, well, the HTML is a critical resource. And the CSS style sheet

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.150
inside is also going to be render blocking.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.780
The image doesn't block, the critical rendering path.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.990
And this JavaScript file at the end is also asynchronous and it won't block

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.280
rendering. So in total, that's going to be

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.830
two critical resources, the HTML and the CSS.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.880
&gt;&gt; You nailed it.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.320
&gt;&gt; Now, I didn't ask you about the number

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.320
of critical bytes, but any idea how you would go

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.370
about figuring that out?

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.060
&gt;&gt; Simple. I just need to know the size of the HTML and the CSS files.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.210
&gt;&gt; Yup, exactly.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.530
&gt;&gt; Now, what about the critical path length?

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.180
&gt;&gt; So, let's see, the HTML file is 1. We have

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.340
another round trip to get to CSS. And then, because this

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.490
JavaScript file is async, it's not going to block rendering. So, the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.170
best case is going to be two, as our critical path length.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.510
&gt;&gt; That's right.
