00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.020
All right.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.980
It's time for you to start applying
the layout skills you just learned.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.190
And here's what it
looks like on desktop.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.960
Not that great.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.060
I think you can do a lot better.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.190
For this part in the project, pick a set
of breakpoints that you think look good.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.660
And then, use one of the patterns that
you just learned, to style the page, so

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.840
it looks great,
even on desktop and tablet.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.610
If you didn't finish the exercise from
the last time you worked on the project.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.750
Don't worry.
You can grab a working copy,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.020
linked in the instructor notes below.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.110
Make sure that you test on phones,
tablet's, and browser windows of all

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.960
different sizes, so that you get a sense
of what the page looks like everywhere.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.240
Adjust your breakpoints, until you
get something that you're happy with.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.020
And remember what might work on one
phone, might not work so well on others.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.400
And of course, if you can, make sure
that you test on real devices as well,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.710
because sometimes you'll
uncover unexpected behavior or

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.770
design elements that, well, you just
didn't expect, I'm going to show you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.820
what we came up with but
this is by no means the right answer.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.560
This is just what we like and you could
totally go in a different direction.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.530
And if you're happy with it,
then that's great.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.390
But this is what we did.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.940
We've got a breakpoint here, and
then another breakpoint there.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.780
The important part of this part of
the project is that you try out

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.040
different layout patterns,
and find out what you like.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.590
Good luck.
