and then you have to mix that up in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
and then you have to mix that up in
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.399
and then you have to mix that up in
proper proportions and that again is

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
proper proportions and that again is
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.140
proper proportions and that again is
gonna vary from individual to individual

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150

it's really the only way to have

it's really the only way to have
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.810
it's really the only way to have
significant weight loss

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820

everybody's metabolic rates a little
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380
everybody's metabolic rates a little
different but most people don't live on

much less than 2,000 calories a day for
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420
much less than 2,000 calories a day for
normal and therefore we have to cut back

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
normal and therefore we have to cut back
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.899
normal and therefore we have to cut back
by 500 or 800 calories a day in order to

can't keep doing that forever because

muscle mass men tend to have a little
 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.750
muscle mass men tend to have a little
bit more muscle mass but again it's

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
bit more muscle mass but again it's
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.270
bit more muscle mass but again it's
individual so a woman with the same

individual so a woman with the same
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.440
individual so a woman with the same
height and weight in the same muscle

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
height and weight in the same muscle
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.449

different but most women are a little

different but most women are a little
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.310
different but most women are a little
smaller height why is a little less

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320
smaller height why is a little less
 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.800
smaller height why is a little less
muscle mass per that same weight and

therefore their metabolic rate tends to

therefore their metabolic rate tends to
be a little lower they need a little bit

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990
be a little lower they need a little bit
 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.430

it's the same equation I think it the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820
it's the same equation I think it the
 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.250
it's the same equation I think it the
important thing about adolescents and

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260
important thing about adolescents and
 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.170
important thing about adolescents and
kids is they're at a time when they're

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
kids is they're at a time when they're
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.610
kids is they're at a time when they're
still developing their behaviors it's

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
still developing their behaviors it's
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.220
still developing their behaviors it's
much easier to change behaviors so that

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230
much easier to change behaviors so that
 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.740
much easier to change behaviors so that
you can encourage more activity get that
