00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.200
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.420
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Lahore, Pakistan,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.880
and today, I'm in the Walled City,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.090
which dates back to the year 1000.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.280
It's the ancient center of Lahore.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.300
Today we're gonna go on a full tour

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.770
of the Walled City of Lahore.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.560
We're gonna eat some of the
most amazing street food.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.390
We are gonna see some of the famous sites.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.580
I'm gonna meet up with
my friend Ali and Malik.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.600
And I'm gonna share everything

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.680
with you in this video, right now.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.430
(electronic chill out music)

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.590
We're starting off our this morning,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.660
at a place, it's called Phajja Siri Paye.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.230
They are one of the most legendary places

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.390
to eat the dish called Siri Paye,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.280
which is the goat trotters,
goat feet, stewed,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.760
this will be my first time to try it,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.260
but it smells incredibly good.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.000
Yeah, this is a place I'm
very excited to eat at.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.650
They're open 24 hours, are they making it.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.380
- They're open 24 hours, so
they're constantly making it,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.880
for example, that one is made,
now getting him making it.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.713
- [Mark] Never closes?

00:00:58.713 --> 00:00:59.800
- Never closes, exactly.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.600
- It's like a meter
and a half diameter pan

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.810
that's filled with this
bubbling, it looks thick,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.860
thick from the collagen and the fat,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.460
bubbles away like a pan of lava,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.570
and then he just continually,
kinda, like, stirs,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.150
and sort of, rehydrates those feet,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.090
which are sitting, which are
elevated on a little podium.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.500
They have two different
bowls you can order.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.600
One of them is with goat brains,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.940
and then, the other version is goat feet,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.270
he takes a couple of the goat feet,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.080
he puts them back them into
the swimming pool of boy,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.160
bubbling cauldron of broth,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.180
and then he adds those to your bowl,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.500
and then finally, again, sprinkles it

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.452
with some (speaks in
foreign language) powder

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:39.900
to finish it up.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.433
Oh, it smells incredible.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.120
Just coming upstairs because
there's nice light up here,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.680
and they have a whole family
dining section up here.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.513
(car honks

00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:51.040
- [Man] I want to say that thank you.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.093
- Sure, yes.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.773
- Thank you.

00:01:53.773 --> 00:01:54.606
- You're welcome.

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:56.160
How was the Siri, did you already eat?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.277
- Yes.
- The Siri Paye?

00:01:57.277 --> 00:01:58.110
- Yes.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.260
- Was it good?
- It is our cooking at best,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.093
and good taste.

00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:01.670
- We're not sure the story

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.360
behind the heart-shaped
(speaks in foreign language)

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.580
but they gave us

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.370
some heart-shaped (speaks
in foreign language).

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.933
Which one do you wanna start with?

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.770
- I will just go for the Paye first.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.617
- Okay.

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:11.450
- [Ali] Paye, it's the main dish.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.170
- You can just see how
thick that gravy is,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.970
and this is more like a stew,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.903
but then you see though, it's just like,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.490
kind of like gelatinous
chunks of the entire,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.970
the entire chunks on, you can kinda, whoa.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.370
That is jelly.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.102
That is jelly.

00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:30.685
(upbeat music)

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:34.666
Oh ho ho.

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.010
That thing is just like
straight-up melted,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.670
melted collagen and fat.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.691
- Fat lovers paradise, I would say.

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.690
(men laugh)

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.690
- Yeah, that's about right.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.350
The fat has been boiled for so
long that it's rendered down.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.360
So it's not like a layer
of fat but it's just like,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.120
kind of been rendered into the sauce.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.380
It's like, oozy.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.478
It's oozy, liquid ooze.

00:02:57.478 --> 00:03:00.061
(upbeat music)

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.680
Oh yeah, that looks
like a little toe bone.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.710
It's so soft like you would
not need teeth to chew that.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.980
Then let's move on over to the brain.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.470
And you can see that
chunks of brain in here.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.860
And then again, it's that same stew.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.692
Looks like a nice, little
nugget of cottage cheese.

00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:22.275
(upbeat music)

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.123
Brain is awesome.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.500
So creamy, it's so rich, but
then it's like the creaminess

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.890
is actually mellowed out by
the richness of the stew.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.690
So you taste the rich fattiness of it.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.500
On top of the rich fattiness of the brain.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.120
Richness on top of richness.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.703
(upbeat music)

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.990
Brain one is amazing.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.200
That was very comforting.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.490
A little on the fatty, oily
side to get the morning started.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.710
But I have to admit I really
enjoyed the brain stew one.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.810
Okay, we're moving on.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.900
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.790
Right outside of the restaurant,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.198
there's a man selling something called

00:04:11.198 --> 00:04:12.810
(speaks in foreign language)
and it just looks cool

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.800
so I just had to stop and get a piece.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.770
Made from jaggery and
made into a little toffee.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.543
And then there's sesame
seeds and peanuts on top.

00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:24.680
(car honks)

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.530
Yeah, that is like a toffee.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.333
It's like a, yeah, it sticks to your teeth

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:30.790
and you taste that
brown sugar taste to it.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.530
Like a burnt, caramelized sugar coat.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.384
Very good, thank you.

00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:37.301
(mysterious music)

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.240
We made it to the Delhi Gate and I believe

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.680
that there are 12 gates that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.520
you can enter within the Walled City.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.260
But the entire Walled City it
dates back to the year 1000.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.000
But then it was conquered
during the Mughal empire.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.200
And then it was really
developed during that time.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.590
So a lot of the buildings,
especially some of the mosques

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.393
and the fort were developed
and built during Mughal empire.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.250
Something I love about
the Walled City is that

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.580
it's just, I mean it's a living museum.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.900
There's businesses, there's
markets, there's restaurants,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.900
there's stalls, there's jewelry shops.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.060
It's just everybody
going about their lives

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.650
but within this old, ancient section

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.390
of the city surrounded by the wall.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.679
And we're gonna just walk
around and explore now.

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:25.679
(adventurous music)

00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:32.324
- [Man] Number one plate.

00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:33.157
- [Mark] Okay.

00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:38.429
(vendor speaks in foreign language)

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:39.262
Thank you.

00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:40.140
- [Ali] You can sit here.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.973
- Perfect.

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.690
Basically, just entered the Walled City

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.270
and we're just starting to walk around

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.030
but we had to stop for a quick snack

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.290
just because Ali saw it.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.510
It's a lentil stew with chicken in it

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.500
and it's served in this
giant, metal-rounded pan.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.470
He seasoned it with ginger, chilies,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.360
there's some mint on top of there.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.370
And then also a squeeze

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.844
of seasoning (speaks in foreign language).

00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:04.742
Oh nice.

00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:07.213
I think there's some fried
shallots or garlic on there too.

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.277
So good.

00:06:13.277 --> 00:06:14.223
That's like,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.070
way more flavorful and
better than I expected.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.730
Not only do you have the
yellow lentils in there

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.410
but also chicken and you got the ginger

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.590
in there, the chilies, oh,

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.640
it has that caramelized nuttiness to it.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.318
Oh man, that is good.

00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:30.821
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:06:30.821 --> 00:06:33.790
I'm seriously just pleasantly surprised.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.740
That's delicious.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.640
One more (laughs).

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.890
I couldn't resist.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.333
Can I see in it?

00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:46.889
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.010
(oil sizzles)

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.638
(Mark laughs)

00:06:51.638 --> 00:06:54.305
(playful music)

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.553
This time we're getting the super-sized.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.410
We were gonna stop at
that one small plate.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.060
But then he offered to give us a refill.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.200
I couldn't resist because it's so good.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.453
Normally, they have this,

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.760
this Tupperware of seasoning here

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.350
that you can season on
your own normally, right?

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.183
- Yeah.

00:07:18.183 --> 00:07:19.810
- But he seasoned it so
perfectly, I asked him

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.530
to season it again this bowl for us again

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.870
'cause he knows what he's doing.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.703
And the owner just brought

00:07:25.703 --> 00:07:26.773
over a (speaks in foreign language).

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.613
Oh man, he gave us a serious
dosage of butter in this plate.

00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:35.290
And just to show it all.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.580
I think what makes it for me
is the ginger and the chilies.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.413
- Oh man.

00:07:39.413 --> 00:07:41.600
- At first I thought
that there's (laughs).

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.200
- Could he just make it perfect.

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:46.620
- (laughs) At first, there's
just gonna be a little taste,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.500
a little taste test but
we may as well go all out.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.710
It's so good.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.445
(adventurous music)

00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:55.278
Oh.

00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:56.910
He seasoned this one even better.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.640
- [Ali] We just stop
here to take few bites

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.860
and then this is our second plate.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.823
- It's amazing.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.792
I'm like blown away how good that is.

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:08.460
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.533
This is the shop.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.110
Oh yeah, I mean, we wanted to pay.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.480
He would not accept payment.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.690
He's so nice.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.770
See the two giant cauldrons of the stew

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.000
and it's right across from
the Wazir Khan Mosque.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.810
Known to be one of the
most beautiful mosques

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.910
in the Walled City of Lahore.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.940
There's multiple sections of
yellow and orange and blue.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.472
And then contrasting with
the red-brown bricks.

00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:36.472
(adventurous music)

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:40.919
We might need to have this.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.370
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.490
We barely made it from
the last thing we ate.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.400
I just saw the overflowing cart

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.830
and he's serving (speaks
in foreign language).

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.750
It mainly consists of these
little fried doughnuts

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.210
which he's made from (speaks
in foreign language) flour.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.670
They sorta soak in a yogurt.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.740
He puts 'em onto your plate

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.620
and he adds on a number of chutneys.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.100
He adds on some onions
and shredded cabbage.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.180
He adds on some more yogurt,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.620
some of the

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.120
yogurt that has mint
and cilantro within it

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.040
and then you've got a
full chuck of full snack.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.950
These are the fritters
and they're very spongy,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.430
they're kind of like saturated
with the yogurt and juices.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.943
Oh yeah, nice.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.103
Oh onion.

00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:27.736
(person sings on megaphone)

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.940
It's so cool and refreshing.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.710
Like, almost like corn bready

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.970
but made from (speaks in
foreign language) flour,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.930
made from lentil flour.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.860
So it's kinda like, it's
not as dense as it looks.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.070
It's more airy and then
when it's soaked up

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.150
with the yogurt, it is definitely soggy

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.450
but that's what makes it good.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.630
And then on this side,
there's more of a chutney,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.139
which I believe would
might be a sweeter chutney.

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:55.056
(person sings on a megaphone)

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.940
Kinda tamarindy, or maybe
apricot, I'm not totally sure.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.046
That's more of a sweet and sour
kinda chutney, maybe mango.

00:10:03.046 --> 00:10:04.894
Oh that's gonna be your (mumbles).

00:10:04.894 --> 00:10:07.720
(men speak in foreign language)

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.360
We are not making it very far

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.120
on this tour of the Walled
City but that's okay.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.550
This is what we came to do.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.860
We came with no plans so
we can just walk around

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.360
and see what we found.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.197
But as we were eating that
(speaks in foreign language)

00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:22.303
which is actually right
over the fence, over there.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.070
They said we should come
check out this uncle,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.190
who is making,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.296
it's a lentil, chickpea soup.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.627
Lentil, chickpea soup?

00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:32.460
- [Ali] Yeah.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.463
- He dips you out a
little scoop of the curry

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.060
when you order and then he
pairs it with a little bit

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.722
of onions and cabbage and then some

00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:41.555
of the (speaks in foreign language)

00:10:41.555 --> 00:10:42.820
which is like a pickle and it's served

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.110
with a, it's like a (speaks
in foreign language)

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.048
but it's the bigger size called

00:10:46.048 --> 00:10:46.920
the (speaks in foreign language).

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.510
He twirls it in his finger
to release it into the oil.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.030
But that's strategic, that's
key so that it lands in the oil

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.070
and bobs in the oil perfectly.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.830
And then he just laps it with oil

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.054
until it's perfectly golden and puffs up.

00:11:01.054 --> 00:11:02.570
I really wanna get some of that
(speaks in foreign language)

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.210
that's what really looks
like it stands out to me

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.380
and some of those vegetables as well.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.693
Kinda pick some this up.

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.890
Oh that's delicious.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.830
Oh the (speaks in foreign language)

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.750
oh the (speaks in foreign language).

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.210
You have to eat it
while it's hot and fresh

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.910
so that it's crispy yet
like gooey on the inside.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.720
And then that stew is,
it is nicely creamy.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.500
You taste like the cinnamon
kinda like nutmeg flavor of that

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.530
with that (speaks in foreign
language) which is kinda

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.733
a little bit spicy and a little bit sour.

00:11:34.733 --> 00:11:37.650
(motorcycle honks)

00:11:39.808 --> 00:11:44.808
Oh that (speaks in foreign
language) is amazing.

00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.558
(motorcycles rev)

00:11:47.558 --> 00:11:48.870
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.813
- [Ali] If you want, we can hold the bag

00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:51.110
for you at the back.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.170
- From here we are jumping into a rickshaw

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.430
and we're gonna drive around

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.120
and I'm gonna get the front seat.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.490
So that I can see the view
and film from out here.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.490
- [Driver] Your bag.

00:12:01.384 --> 00:12:02.217
- Oh it's okay here?

00:12:02.217 --> 00:12:04.090
Or maybe in the back,
yeah, maybe in the back.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.320
You guys okay back there?

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.570
- Oh we perfect (laughs).

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:13.602
Just a big squeeze.

00:12:13.602 --> 00:12:14.964
- Let's go.

00:12:14.964 --> 00:12:17.547
(upbeat music)

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.410
Yeah, this is a great way to get

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.820
around the Walled City
of Lahore, old Lahore.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.470
We're just navigating these streets.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.740
They are literally just
like pedestrian lanes

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.000
and you just have to dodge

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.963
around motor bikes and push carts.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.620
Yeah, it's so great.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.617
I am loving this.

00:12:43.617 --> 00:12:45.070
The people are friendly.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.223
The streets are just so
vibrant and colorful.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.850
And there's so many fabrics.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.043
It's just like a never-ending market.

00:12:54.222 --> 00:12:56.740
(rickshaw bumps)

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.573
- [Ali] Is the camera okay, Mark?

00:12:57.573 --> 00:12:58.406
- Yeah, it's okay.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.663
We just had a slight, minor crash.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.040
Minor crash but all is okay.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.640
Hopefully the guy who got
hit by the mirror is okay.

00:13:10.365 --> 00:13:12.020
(Ali speaks in foreign language)

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.500
Quick stretch break.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.560
There's just an endless
stream of mysterious alleys

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.610
and lanes and just the
wires and the buildings

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.260
and just loads like this just going past.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.260
It really is just never-ending
fascination and excitement.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.650
You can just walk around.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.040
You can look and people are friendly.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.590
Smell the aroma of food.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.200
We have no idea what's down this alley.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.230
We just had to, it just looks enchanting

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.220
so we had to come down this alley.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.990
Again, just filled with, it's
just never-ending market.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.033
There's food.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.040
It's just bustling with people.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.850
There's probably homes
and a community down here.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.510
Market stall after market stall

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.260
of everything you could
possibly ever want.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.343
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.420
Next up, we've just stumbled

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.600
into fruit (speaks in foreign language).

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.030
And so (speaks in foreign
language) is a type of snack.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.500
And then this is all from fruit.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.460
When you order, he dishes you a bowl

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.530
and then he sprinkles on

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.230
some (speaks in foreign
language) powder again.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.833
This is a fruit snack Lahorey style.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.560
Oh that's so good.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.010
Oh that's like a fruit salad.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.710
You've got that pomegranate seeds in there

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.140
which you crunch on then you
got the banana which is creamy.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.170
Also the owner just mentioned
that it's apricot chutney,

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.260
which just makes the sauce,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.630
which holds the whole fruit salad

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.230
or the whole fruit (speaks in
foreign language) together.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.060
That is the secret,
that's what makes it good.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.400
As he sells, he just keeps on mixing it.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.800
So it stays fresh like that.

00:14:49.192 --> 00:14:52.080
And then just counter balance
with that just slight hinge

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.600
of the (speaks in
foreign language) powder.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.910
It's like fruit salad with the apricot jam

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.150
milkshake all together in one.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.643
Oh and I just noticed there's
chickpeas in here too.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.726
But they're crunchy chickpeas.

00:15:04.726 --> 00:15:06.550
(motorbikes honk)

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.657
Thank you.

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:08.552
- Thank you so much (speaks
in foreign language).

00:15:08.552 --> 00:15:09.552
- Thank you.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.170
Oh man, people are just
so, people are so amazing.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.270
Oh actually Ying is back in the (mumbles).

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.450
Oh hi Ying.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.160
And we're just walking
but they're following us.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.700
You feel like you're in a
totally different world.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.090
Walking around this Walled City in Lahore.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.003
It is, it's spectacular.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.210
Okay, we're jumping back into the rickshaw

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.335
and we're on our way to go eat lunch.

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:43.252
(mysterious music)

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.720
For lunch, we've stopped at a
(speaks in foreign language).

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.840
This is a local restaurant

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.340
which has a selection of different dishes.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.650
They have curries, they
have different rice dishes.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.530
They have an assortment of
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.050
and chickpeas so you
can come to the front.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.640
You order your different dishes

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.910
and then they have a seating section

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.230
but I just, we got the permission
to come into the kitchen

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.120
to watch him as he assembles
some of the dishes.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.700
And I think he actually
takes some of the dishes

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.500
that are already precooked
and then he heats them

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.590
in a (speaks in foreign
language) in a rounded pan

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.430
before you order them and
add some more like chili.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.297
Actually, I think that must be key.

00:16:30.893 --> 00:16:34.711
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:16:34.711 --> 00:16:36.817
Whoa look at those skills.

00:16:36.817 --> 00:16:38.567
Look at those skills.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.640
I was busy watching the
chef as he cook the curries

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.500
and prepare the curries
but right behind me

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.860
the (speaks in foreign
language) making station.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.090
The (speaks in foreign language) oven

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.140
and he is, he is flying.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.520
He literally hammers
it, like drum rolls it

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.650
with his fingers then he
flats it in his hands.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.270
Right onto the pillow in
literally like, three seconds,

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.990
it's within the (speaks
in foreign language) oven.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.903
Whoa that is some skill.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.333
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:29.960
I wanted to stand there and watch him make

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.400
the (speaks in foreign
language) all afternoon

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.250
but, okay, the food is almost coming.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.770
We chose four different items.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.090
And then he stewed them up.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.690
He cooked them up so he boils them again.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.670
So that makes them hot and fresh again.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.920
And then some of the baskets made.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.050
Some of the three-second
(speaks in foreign language).

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.993
I gotta scoop in for that liver first.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.530
That liver there, oh yes,

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.263
and then also I wanna
grab that chili if I can.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.153
Cheers.

00:18:07.983 --> 00:18:10.483
(Mark laughs)

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.570
So creamy and that sauce is so rich

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.570
and just the spices are
so mellowed out together.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.413
This is the type of (speaks
in foreign language),

00:18:20.413 --> 00:18:21.313
a type of lentil.

00:18:22.374 --> 00:18:24.707
(car honks)

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.530
Yum.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.857
Thick from that (speaks
in foreign language).

00:18:29.857 --> 00:18:31.210
You can feel the texture of that

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.460
in the (speaks in foreign language).

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.610
Gonna go in for some
of that chicken curry.

00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:39.190
Oh ho, that's so warm,

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.203
warm and fluffy.

00:18:42.374 --> 00:18:45.374
(adventurous music)

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.180
The chicken curry also.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.960
It's rich but it doesn't taste too oily.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.960
It does have that floating
layer of butter on top.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.380
But then the curry is
almost milky tasting,

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.500
like creamy tasting.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.240
Okay we got one more dish
which is a vegetable dish with,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.300
looks like there's some potatoes and peas.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.619
Oh actually it's turnip.

00:19:05.619 --> 00:19:06.452
- [Ali] Turnip.

00:19:06.452 --> 00:19:07.285
- It's turnip.

00:19:07.285 --> 00:19:10.050
Oh I thought it was potato but
it's actually turnip, okay.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.487
Oh yeah, that's delicious.

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:18.030
You taste that bitter
earthiness of the turnip

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.600
but it's cooked down, it's so soft.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.130
Kinda like a roasted
cinnamony taste to it.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.983
And finally some yogurt for cooling.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.735
With cucumber.

00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:31.210
(soft, adventurous music)

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:32.373
That turnip is amazing.

00:19:32.373 --> 00:19:34.255
Okay I gotta try that liver again.

00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:36.000
(soft, adventurous music)

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.250
Creaminess of that liver.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.713
(car honks)

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.650
This little restaurant has it all.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.610
The three-second (speaks
in foreign language) maker.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:05.610
All of the Pakistani curries
and then the tea at the front,

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.540
where he whips it up.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.030
He mixes the milk, he puts in the tea.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.660
He stirs it up and then the best part

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.320
is when he puts it into your glass

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.830
and he pours it from a high elevation

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.880
so it gets that bubbly, frothy layer,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.820
just creaminess on top.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.110
And this is actually not
(speaks in foreign language),

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.370
this is (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.470
which is just milk with tea in it.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.083
So just milk, no water.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.600
Oh yeah, oh that soothes.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.220
That's like creamy in a perfect kinda way.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.600
It is milky and then you just got

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.313
that dark, strong, black tea flavor.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.240
That's perfect actually, perfect.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.023
Nice to meet you.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.553
That was great.

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:56.870
This is a really local spot.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.170
Oh man, these curries were great.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.043
That tea.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.833
Thank you.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.660
Lunch was a success.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.693
This is our ride.

00:21:12.162 --> 00:21:13.078
(Mark laughs)

00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:13.911
Yes.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:15.983
And we're off.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:19.973
(upbeat music)

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.800
After lunch we drove over to Lahore Fort

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.200
and it dates back when Lahore
was the Mughal capital.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.560
The fort is now a UNESCO
World Heritage site.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.120
I think they are negotiating
for a horse carriage.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.836
We're gonna get on a
horse carriage, I think.

00:21:38.836 --> 00:21:40.480
(upbeat music)

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.330
Yeah.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.563
And I have the privilege
of riding shotgun.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.473
Excellent.

00:21:47.423 --> 00:21:49.923
(horse walks)

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.170
The breeze is cool.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.823
The ancient buildings,
look at all of the birds.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.740
So many birds, that's
something that you will notice,

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.850
being in Lahore but Ali
definitely has the right idea.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.080
His hop on, hop off style.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.630
- Say if you want the best solution,

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:08.930
ask the lazy guy (laughs).

00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:14.960
(adventurous music)

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.490
- Right at the entrance
of Lahore actually,

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:20.910
there is a, one of the
largest, oldest mosques.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.640
There's also a Sikh
temple and a Hindu temple

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.123
right all next to each other.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.670
(adventurous music)

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.600
We made it to Badshahi Mosque and this is

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.540
again built in the Mughal empire.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.120
It's one of the most iconic mosques.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.070
And right across that's
the fort over there.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.230
But we are gonna go into the,

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.430
the mosque here it's just,

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.180
the facade is in the front.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.580
We're gonna climb the steps.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.233
It's just this massive courtyard.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.060
And this is where you
enter in the front here

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.130
and then in the front, there's the,

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.510
the triple domes, the domes are huge

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.940
and right now as the sun is
going down in the afternoon,

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.800
the sun is right behind the dome.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.830
Yeah, the Mughal architecture.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.810
Oh what I really like
is just the contrast.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.270
Right now, the sun is
just shining off the red,

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.030
the red orange mud color
and then in the distance,

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.863
you got the

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.207
brown and colorful colors of Lahore

00:23:18.207 --> 00:23:21.250
and the, if the old city
of the old Walled City.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.065
Oh this is spectacular.

00:23:23.065 --> 00:23:26.065
(adventurous music)

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.250
So we've come to the end of the day.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.750
This has been an amazing
day in Lahore exploring,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.630
especially the old Walled City.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.920
I will have all the information
in the description box below

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.150
of everything that we did.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:44.370
I wanna say a massive thank you to Ali,

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.430
from Landmark Communications
and Pakistan Travel Mart.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.210
He's the one who invited us to Pakistan.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.550
So if it wasn't for Ali, we wouldn't,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.310
I wouldn't've been able
to make it to Pakistan

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.440
so thank you, Ali.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.780
That's it, I'm gonna end the video now.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.360
