is related to the secure element access

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359
is related to the secure element access
 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.819
is related to the secure element access
and selection in my case my phone has to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
and selection in my case my phone has to
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.279
and selection in my case my phone has to
secure elements and both are having the

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289
secure elements and both are having the
 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.789
secure elements and both are having the
same base IVs which one will be selected

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
same base IVs which one will be selected
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.980

over NFC so typically I haven't seen too

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
over NFC so typically I haven't seen too

many devices with more than one NFC
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.330
many devices with more than one NFC
device so it's pretty cool that you have

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
device so it's pretty cool that you have
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.160
device so it's pretty cool that you have
a fun with with two I should probably

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
a fun with with two I should probably
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.260
a fun with with two I should probably
clear up one thing there's the secure

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
clear up one thing there's the secure
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.319
clear up one thing there's the secure
element is something that we haven't got

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
element is something that we haven't got
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.690

a P is for yet it's a secular element

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700
a P is for yet it's a secular element
 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.099
a P is for yet it's a secular element
because we wanted to make sure that it

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109
because we wanted to make sure that it
 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.370
because we wanted to make sure that it
doesn't get abused and it is used so

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
doesn't get abused and it is used so
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.429
doesn't get abused and it is used so
there aren't any other Pacific yourself

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:10.439
there aren't any other Pacific yourself

by talking about how to access the NFC

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159
by talking about how to access the NFC

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670
the well distinguishing between those
 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.930
the well distinguishing between those
two NFC adapters again there's actually

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940
two NFC adapters again there's actually
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.180
two NFC adapters again there's actually
not a good API for that now if you look

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190
not a good API for that now if you look
 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.760
not a good API for that now if you look
at the NFC adapter class for the NFC

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770
at the NFC adapter class for the NFC
 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.230
at the NFC adapter class for the NFC
manager class you can say give me

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240
manager class you can say give me
 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.260
manager class you can say give me
default device but you can actually say

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270
default device but you can actually say
 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.800
default device but you can actually say
give me a specific device so right now

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810
give me a specific device so right now
 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.199
give me a specific device so right now
it's going to give you whichever one it

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209
it's going to give you whichever one it
 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.800
it's going to give you whichever one it
considers to be the default and it also

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810
considers to be the default and it also
 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.479
considers to be the default and it also
depends on what you're doing with NFC

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489
depends on what you're doing with NFC
 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.670
depends on what you're doing with NFC
because if you're integrating with sort

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680
because if you're integrating with sort
 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.790

of the Android Beam type technology you

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800
of the Android Beam type technology you
 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.360
of the Android Beam type technology you
need to do that just you I mean that's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370
need to do that just you I mean that's
 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.449
need to do that just you I mean that's
attractive for you so just override the

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459
attractive for you so just override the
 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.420
attractive for you so just override the
right methods there and implement beam

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430
right methods there and implement beam
 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.009
right methods there and implement beam
support that way so if you don't really

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019
support that way so if you don't really
 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.800
support that way so if you don't really
lower level NFC then it's going to be

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810
lower level NFC then it's going to be
 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.699
lower level NFC then it's going to be
different just a quick note I think we

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709

deploy these devices provision with
 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.690
deploy these devices provision with
those accounts so with google apps you

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:52.700
those accounts so with google apps you
 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.640
those accounts so with google apps you
have certainly have some filters

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:54.650
have certainly have some filters
 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.200

everyone so next question I have several

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:27.269
everyone so next question I have several
 

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:29.389
everyone so next question I have several
apps on Google Play but when I search

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399
apps on Google Play but when I search
 

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:32.599
apps on Google Play but when I search
for my apps on through a google search I

00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:32.609
for my apps on through a google search I
 

00:09:32.609 --> 00:09:35.419
for my apps on through a google search I
realized that other app other websites

00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:35.429
realized that other app other websites
 

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:37.489
realized that other app other websites
are also selling my apps on their sites

00:09:37.489 --> 00:09:37.499
are also selling my apps on their sites
 

00:09:37.499 --> 00:09:40.099
are also selling my apps on their sites
is there a way to protect my apps from

00:09:40.099 --> 00:09:40.109
is there a way to protect my apps from
 

00:09:40.109 --> 00:09:42.650
is there a way to protect my apps from
being sold on unauthorized sites and the

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660
being sold on unauthorized sites and the
 

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.019
being sold on unauthorized sites and the
answer is yes what you should be using

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:45.029
answer is yes what you should be using
 

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:47.179
answer is yes what you should be using
is what we have something that we have

00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:47.189
is what we have something that we have
 

00:09:47.189 --> 00:09:49.970
is what we have something that we have
called license verification library I

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980
called license verification library I
 

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.179
called license verification library I
brought up the the page here which is

00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:53.189
brought up the the page here which is
 

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:55.189
brought up the the page here which is
the relevant section but basically what

00:09:55.189 --> 00:09:55.199
the relevant section but basically what
 

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:57.769
the relevant section but basically what
you're doing is your app is is making a

00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779
you're doing is your app is is making a
 

00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:01.579
you're doing is your app is is making a
call to Google Play to confirm whether

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:01.589
call to Google Play to confirm whether
 

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:05.359
call to Google Play to confirm whether
the app has been purchased by that user

00:10:05.359 --> 00:10:05.369
the app has been purchased by that user
 

00:10:05.369 --> 00:10:07.789
the app has been purchased by that user
or not and and it's particularly

00:10:07.789 --> 00:10:07.799
or not and and it's particularly
 

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:09.679
or not and and it's particularly
important that I mean here we're talking

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:09.689
important that I mean here we're talking
 

00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:13.400
important that I mean here we're talking
about the issue where you know it's been

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:13.410
about the issue where you know it's been
 

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.289
about the issue where you know it's been
uploaded to other sites but in general

00:10:15.289 --> 00:10:15.299
uploaded to other sites but in general
 

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:18.949
uploaded to other sites but in general
to combat piracy the LVL is certainly

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959
to combat piracy the LVL is certainly
 

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.559
to combat piracy the LVL is certainly
one way to do it so I suggest you go

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:21.569
one way to do it so I suggest you go
 

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:23.299
one way to do it so I suggest you go
through this application licensing

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:23.309
through this application licensing
 

00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:26.989
through this application licensing

section on on the developer.android.com
site the other thing is I mean there's a

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:31.290
site the other thing is I mean there's a
 

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.220
site the other thing is I mean there's a
couple of things to keep in mind here

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:33.230
couple of things to keep in mind here
 

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.789
couple of things to keep in mind here
one is that you want to use LVL to

00:10:37.789 --> 00:10:37.799
one is that you want to use LVL to
 

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:39.590
one is that you want to use LVL to
detect whether you know the app has been

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600
detect whether you know the app has been
 

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.799
detect whether you know the app has been
pirated or being badly sold but it's

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:42.809
pirated or being badly sold but it's
 

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.539
pirated or being badly sold but it's
important that you don't just totally

00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:44.549
important that you don't just totally
 

00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:46.939
important that you don't just totally
destroy the users experience of your app

00:10:46.939 --> 00:10:46.949
destroy the users experience of your app
 

00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:48.590
destroy the users experience of your app
because if they've installed your app

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600
because if they've installed your app
 

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.650
because if they've installed your app
and they're actually you know using it

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660
and they're actually you know using it
 

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.629
and they're actually you know using it
then you can see this as an opportunity

00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639
then you can see this as an opportunity
 

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.029
then you can see this as an opportunity
to try and convince them to purchase it

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:56.039
to try and convince them to purchase it
 

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:58.759
to try and convince them to purchase it
at the right place so I linked it to the

00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:58.769
at the right place so I linked it to the
 

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:01.340
at the right place so I linked it to the
Play Store you may argue that there's

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.350
Play Store you may argue that there's
 

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.979
Play Store you may argue that there's
isn't it it may or may not you might not

00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:03.989
isn't it it may or may not you might not
 

00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:05.710
isn't it it may or may not you might not
get too many people that will do this

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720
get too many people that will do this
 

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.999
get too many people that will do this
that you know convert from being a

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:08.009
that you know convert from being a
 

00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:09.540
that you know convert from being a
pirate to being a legit

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:09.550
pirate to being a legit
 

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.840
pirate to being a legit
a paid user but in a way what the way

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:12.850
a paid user but in a way what the way
 

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.150
a paid user but in a way what the way
you should look at it is even if you

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.160
you should look at it is even if you
 

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.980
you should look at it is even if you
only convert a small percentage of them

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:16.990
only convert a small percentage of them
 

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.050
only convert a small percentage of them
those are a small percentage that you

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:19.060
those are a small percentage that you
 

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.960
those are a small percentage that you
wouldn't have otherwise been paid for

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:20.970
wouldn't have otherwise been paid for
 

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.150
wouldn't have otherwise been paid for
paid by so it's really important that

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160
paid by so it's really important that
 

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.090
paid by so it's really important that
you you look at this but make sure that

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.100
you you look at this but make sure that
 

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.680
you you look at this but make sure that
you don't implement it in a way that

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:28.690
you don't implement it in a way that
 

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.230
you don't implement it in a way that
degrades the experience for people that

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240
degrades the experience for people that
 

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.000
degrades the experience for people that
have already purchased it so make sure

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.010
have already purchased it so make sure
 

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.250
have already purchased it so make sure
you think about you know the offline

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:35.260
you think about you know the offline
 

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.410
you think about you know the offline
scenario when somebody hops onto a plane

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:37.420
scenario when somebody hops onto a plane
 

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.470
scenario when somebody hops onto a plane
and they're using your app if the LVL

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480
and they're using your app if the LVL
 

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.230
and they're using your app if the LVL
check is not able to succeed at at that

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240
check is not able to succeed at at that
 

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.500
check is not able to succeed at at that
point because the device is offline

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.510
point because the device is offline
 

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.120
point because the device is offline
don't block the user from from using

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.130
don't block the user from from using
 

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.400
don't block the user from from using
your app so there is a fine balance but

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:50.410
your app so there is a fine balance but
 

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.460
your app so there is a fine balance but
the service helps you the last thing I

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:53.470
the service helps you the last thing I
 

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.840
the service helps you the last thing I
really should add is that oh the elders

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:56.850
really should add is that oh the elders
 

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.449
really should add is that oh the elders

basically we provided as an open source

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:09.820
basically we provided as an open source
 

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.360
basically we provided as an open source
implementation so it's a library you can

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:12.370
implementation so it's a library you can
 

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.670
implementation so it's a library you can
grab it you can incorporate it into your

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:14.680
grab it you can incorporate it into your
 

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.319
grab it you can incorporate it into your
into your app you need to make sure that

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:19.329
into your app you need to make sure that
 

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:21.300
into your app you need to make sure that
you modify that source code don't just

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:21.310
you modify that source code don't just
 

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.730
you modify that source code don't just
implement it the way it is because there

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:23.740
implement it the way it is because there
 

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.470
implement it the way it is because there
are people that are you know writing

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.480
are people that are you know writing
 

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.180
are people that are you know writing
automated tools to try and crack

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:27.190
automated tools to try and crack
 

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.370
automated tools to try and crack
software so if you implement that source

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:29.380
software so if you implement that source
 

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.260
software so if you implement that source
code the same way that it is now that

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:31.270
code the same way that it is now that
 

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.660
code the same way that it is now that
that license checking people are going

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:33.670
that license checking people are going
 

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.370
that license checking people are going
to defeat it you need to come up with a

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.380
to defeat it you need to come up with a
 

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.960
to defeat it you need to come up with a
unique implementation and that's why it

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:36.970
unique implementation and that's why it
 

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.870
unique implementation and that's why it
is open source we've tried to be as

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880
is open source we've tried to be as
 

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.050
is open source we've tried to be as
transparent as possible there do you

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:43.060
transparent as possible there do you
 

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.730
transparent as possible there do you
guys want to add anything and on your

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:44.740
guys want to add anything and on your
 

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:50.610
guys want to add anything and on your
door Tony you know if things good does

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:50.620
door Tony you know if things good does
 

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.920
door Tony you know if things good does
that just one thing on that one does

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:52.930
that just one thing on that one does
 

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.960
that just one thing on that one does
that mean that then you have to include

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:54.970
that mean that then you have to include
 

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.660
that mean that then you have to include
extra permissions for using the Internet

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:57.670
extra permissions for using the Internet
 

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.150
extra permissions for using the Internet
so if you've got an app that would have

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160
so if you've got an app that would have
 

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.590
so if you've got an app that would have
maybe one or two permissions you didn't

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600
maybe one or two permissions you didn't
 

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.150
maybe one or two permissions you didn't
have to add extra permissions to just to

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160
have to add extra permissions to just to
 

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.199
have to add extra permissions to just to
use the the license and verification I

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:06.209
use the the license and verification I
 

00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:09.990
use the the license and verification I
think that is true so yes you'd probably

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000
think that is true so yes you'd probably
 

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.400
think that is true so yes you'd probably
need internet permission for that

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:11.410
need internet permission for that
 

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:17.069
need internet permission for that
Network permission yeah okay we have

00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079
Network permission yeah okay we have
 

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:18.600
Network permission yeah okay we have
another low-level media question from

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:18.610
another low-level media question from
 

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.889
another low-level media question from
Marcus is there or will there be any

i I'm not sure if there are any
high-level application api's but

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.370
high-level application api's but
 

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.090
high-level application api's but
suddenly possible I mean many apps do it

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:37.100
suddenly possible I mean many apps do it
 

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.740
suddenly possible I mean many apps do it
many video conferencing apps and

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:38.750
many video conferencing apps and
 

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.530
many video conferencing apps and
streaming videos and audio so I I don't

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:41.540
streaming videos and audio so I I don't
 

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.350
streaming videos and audio so I I don't
know of any particular high level API Oh

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360
know of any particular high level API Oh
 

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.820

in future versions so a crashed app

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.030
in future versions so a crashed app
 

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.090
in future versions so a crashed app
doesn't block the camera for every other

doesn't block the camera for every other
 

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.250
doesn't block the camera for every other
app until the phone is rebooted so I

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.260
app until the phone is rebooted so I
 

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.500

think Marcus is actually reporting an

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:11.510
think Marcus is actually reporting an
 

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.840

camera I haven't heard of this
 

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.690
camera I haven't heard of this
particular issue and so if it exists we

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:25.700
particular issue and so if it exists we
 

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.640
particular issue and so if it exists we
should certainly we will certainly

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:27.650
should certainly we will certainly
 

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:28.900
should certainly we will certainly
funnel it through to the engineering

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:28.910
funnel it through to the engineering
 

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.620
funnel it through to the engineering
team and you know it's something that we

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:32.630
team and you know it's something that we
 

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.750
team and you know it's something that we
should also include in our compatibility

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:34.760
should also include in our compatibility
 

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.910
should also include in our compatibility
testing suite to to make sure that it's

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920
testing suite to to make sure that it's
 

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.280
testing suite to to make sure that it's
it's generally reliable everywhere so

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:42.290
it's generally reliable everywhere so
 

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:48.730
it's generally reliable everywhere so

in jellybean we added rich notifications
 

00:24:52.049 --> 00:24:54.810
in jellybean we added rich notifications
so with these rich notifications you can

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:54.820
so with these rich notifications you can
 

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.720
so with these rich notifications you can
expand them and have all sorts of

expand them and have all sorts of
 

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.450
expand them and have all sorts of
beautiful images and so again the design

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:00.460
beautiful images and so again the design
 

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.519
beautiful images and so again the design

describing what that experience should
 

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:07.979
describing what that experience should
be like the design side is is more live

00:25:07.979 --> 00:25:07.989
be like the design side is is more live
 

00:25:07.989 --> 00:25:09.960
be like the design side is is more live
literally for designers so it's not

is flick from the design section to the
 

00:25:14.739 --> 00:25:17.999
is flick from the design section to the
develop section to jump to the relevant

code pieces and finally settings this is

00:25:22.049 --> 00:25:22.059
code pieces and finally settings this is
 

00:25:22.059 --> 00:25:23.430
code pieces and finally settings this is
actually a section i think we introduced

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440
actually a section i think we introduced
 

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.899
actually a section i think we introduced
a little while ago but it's still fairly

00:25:24.899 --> 00:25:24.909
a little while ago but it's still fairly
 

00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:29.039
a little while ago but it's still fairly

new and it just talks about how what
 

00:25:29.049 --> 00:25:31.139
new and it just talks about how what
things should be settings you know when

things should be settings you know when
 

00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:33.779
things should be settings you know when
is a right to offer a setting for for a

00:25:33.779 --> 00:25:33.789
is a right to offer a setting for for a
 

00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:36.239
is a right to offer a setting for for a
particular option and finally i'm going

00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:36.249
particular option and finally i'm going
 

00:25:36.249 --> 00:25:37.440
