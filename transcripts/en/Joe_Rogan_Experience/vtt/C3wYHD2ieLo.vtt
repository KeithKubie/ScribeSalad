1
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.570
Two one. Boom. Ms Pat, we're live. What's up? How are you? Hey,

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.060
great to see you again. Glad to be back, man.

3
00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:12.910
This studio is better than my house. Crap.

4
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:15.910
I'm gonna go home and tell eyes we need to move in. Joe Rogan's studio.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.850
There's not a lot of room for extra people. I know, I know. I know.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.080
I was just fantasizing, but he's still in Indianapolis. Um,

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.550
unfortunately you don't like it there. Hell No.

8
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.570
I like my fans, but I'm, I'm black and then you know,

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.510
as snow and snow and we've don't go together and you know,

10
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.910
I just don't like it.

11
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:41.910
It's the same or everybody that Applebee's and golden corral. I need culture,

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.660
Cultural Chicago. I'm cool. I want to go back to Atlanta. Atlanta.

13
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.320
That's where I want to be. I want to be in Atlanta. I love Atlanta. Yes man.

14
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.780
The food, the people. Oh, I just,

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.640
I want to walk up my Dole and smell Mexican Indian. All type of spices.

16
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.090
I'll ask the mail in my community is dog shit and ticket torches.

17
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.240
Cause why women do they laundry? Dryer sheets. I need some culture.

18
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.430
I need to walk outside and see all types of people.

19
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.910
This isn't a weird how places just never develop a lot of culture.

20
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.710
Some places just the spots just never get any more. Interesting. Yeah,

21
00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:24.240
it's just, it's so boring. Everybody goes to church, nobody curves.

22
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.130
And when I come on my door and if I'm talking to a neighbor and I use

23
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.690
professional, oh my God,

24
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:32.230
I said I'm not going to change my language because you decided to walk your dog

25
00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:36.430
today and stop and talk to me and you've tried to talk to me and everybody

26
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:40.780
picked up big dog shit in my community and well from, hey,

27
00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:41.920
that was fertilizer.

28
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.600
So you see your name on a big old pound of doll crap in his hand. I'm like,

29
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.270
dude, no, no, I don't think it works as fertilizer.

30
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.350
It was my dog pisses and shits on the lawn just leaves these big old like yellow

31
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.810
spans. But if you leave it long enough and it rains on,

32
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.810
they just go into the grave. That's true. They don't kill the gray.

33
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.980
Don't kill the grass. I did the pistis. The piss seems to kill the grass. Well,

34
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:06.160
I don't know. We didn't have no grass. Everybody walked through the grass.

35
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.540
I just didn't care about it. Loans until I bought came became a homeowner. Yeah.

36
00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:14.470
Homeowners care about lawns. Homeowners care about a lot of crap. You have to,

37
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.220
yeah, I have a rental property in Atlanta. If I can get rid of that,

38
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:22.330
I would never, ever black people come up with some of the strangest things.

39
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.030
What ain't got they rent like as opposed to care.

40
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.230
I tell them bank of America don't care that your Mama that y'all do your

41
00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:33.910
grandchild had a seizure. I need my rent money. Put a spoon in his mouth.

42
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.460
Tell them about seatbelt. Yeah, I mean I've had some,

43
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.210
oh, I just gotta be so glad when I can get rid of this property.

44
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.730
You own a place in Atlanta? Yes. Would you live there at the place he own?

45
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.920
Hell No. No, no. I wouldn't live there.

46
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.330
I'm a little too boozy for that bullshit.

47
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.370
No, not too much that says I'm going to look Booz. You didn't live back well,

48
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.770
but I rent it out. I ran out some nice place.

49
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:05.680
But you would live in Atlanta somewhere else. Oh yeah.

50
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.360
I want to go to Peachtree city. Kennesaw. Yeah. I want to live in Atlanta.

51
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.330
I love Atlanta. Why don't you make your way down there? What's,

52
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.900
what's your old new and then the Apple's health care. Jail. Health care.

53
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.070
My husband has a really good job that we pay nothing. His knee just went out.

54
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.630
His hands down, gone out and I can't pay for them. Types of things. What?

55
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.320
Damn. He tore his ACL run into the cafeteria at work. Oh yeah. I've done a,

56
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.200
I've done a tour. Both of them. You probably were exercising.

57
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.410
He was going to get food.

58
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.680
Don't watch his episode of Joe Rogan Baby. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.830
That's a rough one. Recover from it takes six months.

60
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.070
He was six months now he's, he got a cup of Tony in his hands.

61
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.560
So he's getting ready to have a hand surgeon type. What does he, uh,

62
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.150
he builds the Alison transmission for Alison. Oh,

63
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.550
General Motors and always constantly moving things with his hands.

64
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.420
So his hand is out. O'Connell's a bitch. My mom got that. That's a rough one.

65
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.810
Well, I've never had a job where I did that much repetition. You know,

66
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:12.760
I sold drugs and forge a few checks. It wasn't an everyday thing.

67
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:17.050
I had to do so many checks. You have to forge for your carpal tunnel. Oh yeah,

68
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:21.490
a lot. So once you burn 32 you don't have any mo to burn.

69
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.410
You got to wait till somebody steal the next book.

70
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.490
Plus I was really young back in the day. Yeah. Damn.

71
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:30.960
So that's what's keeping you in. Annapolis husband had a good job.

72
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.900
I needed a TV show so I can get some really good health care.

73
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.520
Your podcast is launched now. It is. It's called the pat down, the pat down.

74
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.220
And I have my own song too. Yes.

75
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.060
We're talking about Ra getting in trouble for putting other people's songs on

76
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:50.290
his podcast and demonetizing his podcast. Yeah, my nephew,

77
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:55.060
I'm a Riverdale shouted, made me my own little pat down son. Oh, nice.

78
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.700
So yeah. So somebody made a song for you that's, yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.250
I was just trying to do something different.

80
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.170
It's only 30 minutes of me talking crap about whatever's going on in my life.

81
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.320
You hit, you hit my kids in the background getting cussed out,

82
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.511
you hit a credit,

83
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:15.511
a calling me and my cohost is a little white boy named Chris who don't know

84
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:20.020
nothing about black America. And then I got my friend who just ah, AH,

85
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.770
he ready to go march if you, if you need him to. So I got,

86
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.320
I got this libertarian,

87
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.020
this crazy as Democrat together and I'm down the middle and say, hey,

88
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.680
we can all get along. And they hated each other. Then first,

89
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.290
how'd you get them together? Because they hated each other.

90
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.820
She did it on purpose. Yeah. My black friend thought Chris was racist.

91
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.720
I was like, no, I know racist. He's not racist. He just not eve to the fat.

92
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.670
And so I put them, not EAD. You've done tell him what I'm trying to say. Naive.

93
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.730
Oh, naive. Naive. Yeah. You got to translate. I was like, yeah, no,

94
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.430
like Adam and eve trying to go with this [inaudible] eat.

95
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.430
But it sounded Adam and eve. Yes. So it, he just didn't understand.

96
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.370
So we get them together. We have these conversation about race and uh,

97
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.210
we did an episode about a bullshit and Chris was like, he's really Christian.

98
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.381
And he was like, I was like,

99
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:11.360
do you believe a woman should have a right to have an abortion?

100
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:15.350
He just pitter patter all around. So it's Chris just say yes. A fucking no.

101
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.400
And finally said, I don't believe a woman should have an abortion. I said,

102
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.220
well that's fine, but this is my vagina and I can do what I want to do with,

103
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:26.630
if I want to stick five crackers in my vagina and turn it into the 4th of July,

104
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:31.460
Joe Rogan, this is my vagina. As long as I don't get no vaginal juice on you.

105
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.390
That makes sense. Yeah. Atlanta's got a problem now with that. Right.

106
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.060
There's nothing. Georgia just passed a new abortion law.

107
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.020
I don't think it's passed yet, but they say she just canceled her shows. Yeah.

108
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.110
Yeah. She's canceled her shows in Atlanta because I think it passed.

109
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.660
I think that was the idea. That's why she canceled it.

110
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.230
I don't think he passed Joe Cause the TV people haven't pulled out yet.

111
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.070
Oh yeah it would if it passed. I think they would.

112
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.310
I really think they got money that Atlanta got them in there because of tax

113
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:00.100
money. Yeah. And I think they're leaving it.

114
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.250
Get a lot of people lose their jobs. I don't think they're going to leave.

115
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.730
I don't think the money should be telling us what to do with our bodies.

116
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.020
I don't think so either. Yeah,

117
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:12.280
that mean that you know I been shot in the t that my one messed up.

118
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.050
So that's like you trying to tell me I should get my TD fixed.

119
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.260
If I don't want my titty fixed, it's my prerogative.

120
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.270
I shouldn't have to have my titty fix. Right. Joe,

121
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.630
how do you feel about late term abortions? That's where people get scared. They,

122
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.710
I don't think, yeah, I don't think you should be killing,

123
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:28.860
don't have an abortion and no,

124
00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:32.480
six and eight months now and I don't think it should be recreation either cause

125
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:36.410
I had an abortion. They just doing it for fun. Recreation.

126
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:40.130
I like that you translate. Oh, I've had a few friends.

127
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.730
What are you going to do today? I was thinking about riding a roller coaster,

128
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:44.960
but fuck it, I'll get an abortion.

129
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.010
I've had a few friends that had quite a few boys that I've had one myself.

130
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.730
I mean my, in my situation, I think everybody's situation is different.

131
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.350
My situation I was,

132
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.030
I already had my first baby at 14 my second child at 15 and it was by a married

133
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.920
man. Well, I got pregnant by his married man again and I just looked at myself,

134
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.380
I said, here I am 16 pray do with my third child.

135
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.230
I cannot take care of the two hour gap. And you know,

136
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:12.200
it wasn't all of this stuff like what they tell you about birth control and safe

137
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:14.140
sex that wasn't going on in the eighties you know,

138
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.760
people shutting their doors and talking wouldn't even talk about it.

139
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.390
Especially when you were a little kid. I'm 14 so I was a little kid.

140
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.430
I was a kid. So when I got pregnant with my third child, I w I became a master,

141
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.780
paid in minor in divorce.

142
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:31.781
My mom and I went and got an abortion because I knew he wasn't helping me with

143
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:34.310
the first two so crazy.

144
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:38.480
So I couldn't take it on the first part because still to this day,

145
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:41.070
sometimes I'll be doing something and I'll just think about your story in the

146
00:08:41.071 --> 00:08:41.904
scope.

147
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.060
So on drugs as a teenager,

148
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:52.061
pregnant with two kids by the time you're 16 [inaudible] crazy in jail.

149
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:55.440
I mean I dropped out of school in the eighth grade, you know, all this stuff.

150
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.274
And I just say, I

151
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.310
<v 2>said I don't want my kids eating them like me. So I was like,</v>

152
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.780
I can't keep having these babies.

153
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.660
And after that I got on birth control and I just prayed. I said, Lord,

154
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.470
I don't want no more kids by this bomb. And I never got pregnant.

155
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.580
So I got married. Well that's good. Yeah. So now I have those too. You know,

156
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.720
I used to tell a bit about,

157
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.710
I got a set of Medicaid kids and instead of blue cross blue shield kids,

158
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.770
so I waited till they got older. I mean I got older and I became,

159
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.110
I started to learn about life.

160
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:29.940
He taught me a lot and so I had those last two and I tied my tunes. Very,

161
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.350
very good move for is more than, that's a good number.

162
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.210
But you know Joe, I'm black.

163
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.330
So when my family smoked crack so they keep giving me their kids.

164
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.050
So I had to tie my tubes to make room for the crack baby.

165
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:47.740
They keep coming in and not my house. I'm raising for rent now. Yeah,

166
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.210
I have my niece, my niece, my,

167
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.270
I picked up my niece like five years ago to help her out. Oh,

168
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.520
she had a baby that was two weeks old and I have this thing like, oh,

169
00:09:56.521 --> 00:10:00.930
kids deserve off solid foundation because I didn't have one. So I picked,

170
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:05.370
this is my third set of kids I've raised and I'm just 47 so I picked my niece up

171
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.670
maybe two weeks old and she got three other kids. I said, okay,

172
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:12.270
I got this big house in Indianapolis, come live with me. I got three,

173
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:16.360
four extra bedrooms. Well this bitch ran off and left me with them kid.

174
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.050
Now I have a five or eight. Yeah.

175
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.370
On a 10 and 11 year old and I've had these kids for six years and I literally

176
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:29.730
have not seen my niece in almost four years. No phone call,

177
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.140
no nothing. And you know, I'm trying to build a career.

178
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.230
So I have a daughter who, my whole,

179
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.500
my kids who were at the house and they had to make a major sacrifice.

180
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.830
Like my daughter couldn't go off to college because she didn't want to leave my

181
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.180
husband with these four kids. So she went to college in Indianapolis,

182
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.610
but she stayed, she went mostly from, you know, home.

183
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.420
My son couldn't go off to college because they at home helping them raise the

184
00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:58.740
four kids that I called my crack babies but at home raising my crack babies

185
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.630
because you don't want to leave my husband all 14 crack babies by the sales.

186
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.100
So you know, where's the mother? You want to hear some crazy,

187
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.990
the bitch blocked me on Facebook joke.

188
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.030
She won't even let me be a friend on Facebook. You taking care of her children.

189
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.960
She blocked you on Facebook once she block you. Cause I kept saying,

190
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:19.920
I'm a kill you bitch. I,

191
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.990
I was ready to live my best life. I was like, well I'm making some money.

192
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:31.560
Me and my husband go to Hawaii getting naked, floating in the water, Bam,

193
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.660
full crack babies. You can't do that when you can't.

194
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.360
You know how much you're taking. The how, why you call. I can't take them crazy.

195
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.570
Oh my God, I love the phrase yell.

196
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:45.060
So I mean it changed. It's changed everything. And then, you know,

197
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.640
when she left and she didn't even give me custody,

198
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:51.120
I had to go and hire this lawyer and go and get custody because she just ran

199
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:54.250
off. And I asked the, you know, the welfare

200
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.570
<v 1>system in Indianapolis. I said,</v>

201
00:11:55.571 --> 00:12:00.430
can y'all just give me childcare because childcare was going to be like $800 a

202
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:04.570
week because my kids was in high school when she loved. And they was like, no,

203
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.500
we can't give you that,

204
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.240
but we will give you medicaid and $300 they get, they didn't,

205
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.040
they didn't give me shit. Jesus Christ. So I just, I just made away my,

206
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.290
and I said, you know what, I've had this baby since she was two weeks old.

207
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.220
How do you drop a baby that you've had since she was two weeks old?

208
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.540
Your baby now? Yeah. You can't, I can't give up. I love are

209
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.210
so fucking crazy. The mother blocked you? No.

210
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.870
Oh my God. No. But we did make a secret account. Right?

211
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.690
Have a nice fine man like yourself. Joe Rogan. Nice fine black man. And we, we,

212
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.990
we friended her so she accepted as a friend so she don't know that that's us.

213
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.860
And she only saw your podcast so I can tell. So we follow her like that.

214
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.860
So she's on the other side of town getting high. Oh, never hit me up.

215
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.790
Never talk about the kids. You know, I don't get a dime from nobody.

216
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.600
Nobody and don't ask for nothing. I mean, I'm just at this point,

217
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.150
I'm thankful that I can even take care of these kids.

218
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.020
Cause my sister was on drugs and I took care of her keys. My niece was on drugs.

219
00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:12.640
Now. I took care of them for 10 years with my husband and she's on drugs now.

220
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.750
The daughter is on drugs.

221
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.470
When my sister got them back and got them my own drugs, like her, Jesus Christ.

222
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.920
So I made sure that these kids can go back to that situation.

223
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.990
Now I call him my Bougie crack babies.

224
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:25.150
They won't even eat McDonald's only Chick-Filet.

225
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.930
They're like, oh, we don't eat McDonald's. We eat chick fillet. And I was like,

226
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.060
I remember when your ass and eat at all babies.

227
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.780
They give me great material, but it's not easy. But um, you know,

228
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.890
you call them crack babies? No, they don't.

229
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.430
My husband stop calling them kids crack. Bang.

230
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.540
They don't know. I call them crack babies. Only America know that.

231
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:03.100
I call them crack babies, but y'all can't call them crack babies. Oh my God.

232
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.070
Did they call your mom? Uh, they do and his count on weird.

233
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.030
So they just started calling me mom out of nowhere and I'm like,

234
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.750
don't come in fucking Mama Auntie. And, but then now I just let them go.

235
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.020
Beautiful. Well, they go to school and they see all the, you know,

236
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:19.960
I live in this white community. They see all these kids with a mom and Daddy.

237
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.700
And they was like, well, why don't we have,

238
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.280
and they just started calling me mom and so were mom and my daughter who um,

239
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.080
she just graduated from college, but she's, they got two moms and then my dad,

240
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:35.060
my husband is a their daddy. Yeah. Well thank you. Thank you.

241
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.090
Beautiful thing you're doing. It really is.

242
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:42.070
Even though the ladies know in the black woman, she's a bitch.

243
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.850
She, that's what she, those kids got lucky. They got lucky. They really did.

244
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:50.110
I took them on a Disney cruise last year, Joe and Oh my God,

245
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:52.940
they had the time of day lives and look at my Craig baby.

246
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.510
They don't know what, I don't say them from the cry. Oh my God,

247
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.670
what you saved this from. And they're on a Disney cruise.

248
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.500
I was looking at Craig bavel Indian cruise with matching outfits,

249
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.310
but I love him. I mean, raising that you're doing that. It really is. I mean,

250
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:13.550
I know it's hard, but it's amazing that you're doing that. Well, you know,

251
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:14.870
like I said earlier, every,

252
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.910
every child deserves a solid foundation to start off. Unfortunately for me,

253
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:21.320
I didn't have that solid foundation.

254
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:25.310
I didn't have nobody to step in my life and you know, snatch me from my mom.

255
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.480
But you know, whenever I see a child in need, especially a family member,

256
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.140
I always try to step in because I know,

257
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.070
I know when you don't have that solid foundation where you can end up and some

258
00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:40.070
kids in, you know, fucked up even with a solid foundation.

259
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.640
But if you can give them a good start, at least give them a good start.

260
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.470
And that's all I ever wanted to do. That's beautiful. Yeah.

261
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.340
And seven's learning center is killing me.

262
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.780
I put the black crack babies in this white community.

263
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.160
Kids been reading since they were two.

264
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:58.550
They were whooping my black ass as Joe Joe Rogan, the tutors.

265
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.180
I'm like, I'm thinking I'll come along. I'm like, Oh,

266
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:05.540
I be glad when you crack babies catch up. I'll be glad when y'all catch up.

267
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.650
We gotta get this podcast take off. Yes, yes, yes. Well,

268
00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:10.250
I don't lead a TV show these days.

269
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:15.140
You don't just need that podcast to keep going. I know. And I'm enjoying it too.

270
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.870
I didn't. You're perfect for it. Like that's what we were talking about,

271
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:20.600
the comedy story last time I saw him four o'clock in the morning, I was like,

272
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.250
you've got to, you have to write. You write. And I really like it too.

273
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.790
I knew you. I was like, this doesn't make any sense that you don't have one.

274
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.520
Yup. And I mean, I'm enjoying it. 30 minutes they'd go, Oh, Ms Pat,

275
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.400
give me more. I'm like, excuse me, I'm sitting here with no wig on. No Bra.

276
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.910
He took no bath and Chris might be smelling me after 35 minutes.

277
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.070
This is all you going to get. Plus, you know,

278
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.090
he come over at four three o'clock and then my baby's coming in the door at four

279
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:48.620
o'clock so I'm gonna sit gas down.

280
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:52.160
I'm screaming and hollered and I got to go fix food and I got a life.

281
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:55.880
I'm married. I can't sit there for, you know, drama, this is fine.

282
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.330
And I like it. As long as you're consistent, that's the whole thing.

283
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.830
It's like be consistent. Don't take weeks off. Like when,

284
00:17:02.831 --> 00:17:05.750
when people take like four weeks off, five weeks off, people forget.

285
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.630
And then they're not interested in your podcasts anymore. But if you,

286
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:12.020
if you're just consistent, you just keep doing it. People get,

287
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.560
it becomes a part of their routine and then they tell people you got to listen

288
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:18.350
to miss path's podcast and next thing you know by word of mouth,

289
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.400
it just spreads. Yeah. And I mean we have so many episodes in the bank.

290
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.920
How many of you have, I think we got probably 20 in the back. Yeah,

291
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.810
they wasn't as good as the ones that I put out regular. But you know,

292
00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:34.680
when I first started I was kind of shy and I'm like, oh, I'm southern.

293
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.890
You know, I look how many times you have to say,

294
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.710
what the fuck did you just say back? But you're not shy. I was Kinda a,

295
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.580
that's the last word I would ever use for you fight. But I'm kind of shy Joe.

296
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.060
I mean, you know, cause I'm country and people are like the book the Twos,

297
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.430
I I d I actually talked about you. Oh my first one.

298
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.680
So when I first did your podcast,

299
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.890
it was a story out that Joe Rogan has a bad ass and he choked out on mountain

300
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.040
line. And I was like,

301
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.370
I don't want to go talk to no white man and talk about a fucking mountain line.

302
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.810
That's a made up story. I don't know.

303
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:08.970
But I didn't know at first and I was so scared.

304
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.350
Joe and I gives a mountain lion killer. Like I was out there choking nine.

305
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.990
I'm used to black people doing dry by way.

306
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.100
I used to wipe him to choking on a mountain lot.

307
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.720
So I'm trying to figure out how to fucking get up on a mountain lion

308
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:29.130
huddle face nick up on a mountain lion from behind and took the shit out of him.

309
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.930
He gotta be strong as fuck.

310
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.490
So I kept digging and I realized the store wasn't Roger. Oh,

311
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.940
I didn't want to talk to no white dude to choke down Tony.

312
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.360
You know, I'll see you in that big old weight is shit. That big old horse.

313
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.720
It was killed that fucking mountain lot.

314
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.470
It took a while for me to realize that it took about two,

315
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.480
about a month before I realized this store was [inaudible] sister didn't think

316
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.720
my own sister thought it was real. Really texted me. She goes,

317
00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.960
you really choke out him out. Fuck is wrong with you.

318
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.970
You are bad as you. I mean only you can sneak up on a mountain lion.

319
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:07.800
[inaudible] I don't think so.

320
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.180
<v 3>I run with a knife when I run, I,</v>

321
00:19:10.181 --> 00:19:13.220
I carry a knife with me just in case cause there's mountain lions in my

322
00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:15.140
community. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

323
00:19:15.141 --> 00:19:19.730
They've seen him and I run with my dog and Mountain Lion tries to Jack me or my

324
00:19:19.731 --> 00:19:21.350
dog. I want to have something on me.

325
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.810
<v 1>So you, you heavy jacket, now you go stabbing. Fuck yeah.</v>

326
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.450
You know I was just telling the story about my, you know, I'm from the south,

327
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:30.930
right? So back in the day and no get offended people. But you know,

328
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:34.950
dog fighting is big in itself. So we didn't fight like no dangerous shit.

329
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.890
We just put some nanoliters on the ground who have a dog get the best they went.

330
00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:41.040
And now late when my dog was named pop pop now or later.

331
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:45.450
You mean like candy now and laters the candy. Yeah. Candy. So yeah,

332
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.690
we'll have the dogs fight over candy. Yeah it will.

333
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.050
We shared a memento used to split the cane or whatever.

334
00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.450
It's all good. Some kid, if it wins or black dogs just eat anything,

335
00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:00.450
make them color green pig feet, whatever. Black Book.

336
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:02.880
Black people didn't buy dog food. So we will, we will.

337
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.670
Me and my dog will fight a lot. But if you got the best of my daughter,

338
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:10.050
I would jump in and whip your dog and you wasn't that going with my old lad

339
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:10.884
German shepherd.

340
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.330
And then I'll be calling and be talking about I'm abused the dog cause all the,

341
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.550
oh no fucking dolls. I got four crack babies and I don't have an animal.

342
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.850
This was back in the day and I was a little girl, but that's what we used to do.

343
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.373
It is a

344
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.650
<v 3>thing in the south period. I knew a guy who had 30 pit bulls in his backyard.</v>

345
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.490
He had these, uh, boxes like that.

346
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.840
He had the dogs live in these little dog houses and they were chained to a post

347
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.930
and they were in his yard and I didn't see it.

348
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:40.620
My friend was telling me about it, but I knew the guy and yeah, he lived down.

349
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.140
I lived in Kentucky. Yeah, we lived in Kentucky and um,

350
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.280
they fought dogs. Well, we only did it with just kids.

351
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.040
<v 1>We only welcome, well, who have a dog get the best of who have a dog.</v>

352
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.200
That's the one now. Right? So if I thought,

353
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.120
but we're about to get go down on his back.

354
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.750
I would jump in and put your dog in a choke hold cause I like wrestling.

355
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.770
I will fix it. Fuck yeah, I will fucking photo shit out of your dog.

356
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.830
I was not losing them. Now Lady Joe, we didn't eat a lot.

357
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.420
I can lose my only meal that day. Your only meal was an hour later.

358
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.890
Some days it may pop up. Was that on the side while be like we whipped his head,

359
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.720
it will pop up and we'll split the now later. Wow.

360
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.080
There's a lot of people right now listen, like is this lady for real?

361
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.530
And I can assure you, assure them that you are. I'm for real.

362
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:26.050
Y'All got a crazy fucking life. You know?

363
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.690
I mean there's so many people that are insulated from the kind of life that

364
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:31.150
you've had. They don't know anybody like you, you know?

365
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.200
So I'm realizing that Chris, my producer, I scared the shit out and he's like,

366
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.540
while you're yelling at me, I'm like, Chris, I'm not yelling. You know,

367
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.930
when a black woman and yellow, when she going to twist and hug,

368
00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.860
they taken off well wig and I'm bucketing her bra. I'm yelling,

369
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.060
I'm just talking my voice. I have a deep voice in this. It carries. But I,

370
00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:53.090
you know, it was crazy cause like I said,

371
00:21:53.091 --> 00:21:55.510

373
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.760
You ever heard of that? Black Pussy incense? Yeah.

374
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.070
You know that you burned the black people used to buy it in the house.

375
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.530
I know about incense, but if nobody called Pussy, he slow me down.

376
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:10.780
It wasn't real. So we put out the podcast, everybody's like,

377

00:23:26.001 --> 00:23:30.710
don't have safe like black men who got a nine to five who can read the sex is

395

430
00:25:57.571 --> 00:26:01.090
getting the metro that split down the middle. You know the two matches separate.

431
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.300
That's just split down the middle and out there time I want,

441
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.640
Yeah. I didn't like that sleep number, but I tried the thing.

442
00:26:56.641 --> 00:27:00.900
I was too confusing. I didn't like it. Oh, he loves the Joe.

443
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.380
Every time I come home he got his feet in the air like he had a gynecologist

444
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.130
visits. He's one of those. He thought, I'm like,

445
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.280
this measure is only good for heating your balls or we could've gotten to a blow

446
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:16.200
dry your balls up. They sell mattresses now.

447
00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:19.170
That cool you Marc system was, yeah.

448
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.880
I'm want to get one that seems awesome. Yeah,

449
00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.570
system was just telling me about that. I'm going through menopause.

450
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:28.590
I might need to get that through. I'll be heating up Joe and he, oh my tea.

451
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:28.921
I'm like,

452
00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:31.860
I'm having a hot flash now and I don't want to drop my titties on your table,

453
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.640
but boy I see in here. I don't feel it. Joe,

454
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:39.990
when you get to turn the AC AC case, stop no high. She's like Fab, five minutes.

455
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:45.190
I'm heating up now, but yeah, it goes away. What does that cause by?

456
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.080
I don't know. You got to ask Mary. I don't know what Mary did in the beginning.

457
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.910
It was Mary with Jesus. No mayor with Jesus. When did Jesus Mama only the Bible.

458
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.420
What do you mean Mary? Mary, but who do you mean when you're saying marriage?

459
00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.370
No, I'm sorry. I'm talking about eve and then who stopped?

460
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.470
Who started to hear you? I'm sorry. I get that. Oh Damn Bitch.

461
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:08.760
She fucked everything up. Yeah, that talking snake. Yeah, that talk is Nate.

462
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.750
I mean I'm cramps ain't no joke and now I'm having a hot flash.

463
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.830
I'm because this bitch better after God.

464
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:16.410
Can you get me an opportunity by the apple? I won't bite the Apple.

465
00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.253
Take the half.

466
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.560
I'd be on a plane with TD heat up and wipe me and next to him.

467
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.450
You don't understand why I got my titty and my lap

468
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.380
faring yourself off? Yes, yes. Yeah.

469
00:28:29.381 --> 00:28:34.381
It comes and goes in like last five minutes and then the a few minutes and then

470
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.570
we'll go back to mom. Like I'm cooling down now.

471
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.670
So like out of nowhere you just get hot.

472
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.820
Yeah and they hit you in different places. Like Mas is good.

473
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:45.720
Between my titties on my neck, some people's is up under day arms.

474
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:50.160
You know in a spot like one smile hit me right here. My titties,

475
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.950
my titties heat up. Like if you touch them that about 95 degrees,

476
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.620
don't touch them because you married,

477
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:58.140
but I'm just saying I don't want you burn your fingers. There it goes.

478
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:01.980
More than two thirds of North American women who are headed into menopause have

479
00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:02.820
hot flashes.

480
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.700
They also affect women who start menopause after chemotherapy or surgery to move

481
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.630
them over. It doesn't say anything on why it's North American.

482
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:12.000
That's what I was wondering. It says, what is a hot flash?

483
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.570
It's a sudden feeling of heat. Sometimes a red flush face and sweating.

484
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.850
We don't know exactly what causes them,

485
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.830
but the may related to changes in circulation.

486
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.430
I guarantee you if they happen to men, they'd know exactly what caused them. Oh,

487
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:25.320
they'll fix that shit. They figured it out. Oh yeah.

488
00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.030
They'll fix that junk if they can fix a soft penis. Yeah,

489
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.340
they'll fix the mandate. But we can't do nothing with our body.

490
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.320
Not Fixing soft dicks and everything else to be solved. No,

491
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:40.770
I don't think that would work.

492
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.680
Is there any six that you can't say stop fixing soft?

493
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:49.330
You'd have to like unlearn that. I'd have to unlearn Viagara look,

494
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.470
just let the man Dick do what it do. When it dilated that,

495
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.240
then that's the point where the lady need to know what you need to put some

496
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:57.580
cocoa butter up on the hippest lot across it that

497
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.520
I don't think that's going to help either. When is always override, I guess.

498
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:07.960
Yeah. Yeah. People,

499
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:12.460
I think that they would be happy when it's over like good. Finally,

500
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.670
women are happy when they peers don't come on. Well,

501
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.690
why can't man be happy when a penis don't work?

502
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.620
Cause for men like your Dick not working as a sign of you don't,

503
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.450
you're not a man anymore. Yeah, for sure. Ooh. Hey,

504
00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:27.030
you feel like you're not a man anymore? Oh really? Yeah.

505
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:30.190
So I don't feel like I'm not a woman. I'm older. My parents stopped.

506
00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:32.050
We'd be happy. Yeah. But it's different.

507
00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:35.260
If you're pussy dried up and became useless, like sealed up

508
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.650
like nothing. You know, like maybe you meet a man,

509
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.920
maybe you and your husband get divorced. You met a man, he's beautiful.

510
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:46.090
Can read.

511
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:51.090
So he's got good Dick and don't put it in a mess down there.

512
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.360
Oh yeah, no, I'm black. He'd grow real thick.

513
00:30:55.361 --> 00:30:56.650
So it's always a mess down.

514
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.830
I call it nappy grit. Well I got a Jackson five and fro.

515
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.340
I mean for some women it matters. But I guess, cause I started really early,

516
00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:18.240
I don't want no dick. I want health care. Oh No.

517
00:31:18.241 --> 00:31:22.270
D you ain't gotta do that to me. Just take you on a trip. I put for men though,

518
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.100
it's like a sign of weakness. It's a weakness. Then. Yeah,

519
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.740
you don't feel like a man anymore. If you love that person, I think you ready.

520
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.170
Are you willing to deal with the softness? Yeah.

521
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.880
Especially if you don't want any dirt. Yeah.

522
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.920
You would want Dick and his Duke ice cream sticks around it.

523
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:47.170
Oh, like a brace with someone. A broken leg.

524
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.620
You break your leg in the forest and they have to fucking strap it to some twigs

525
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.830
. What else would they was doing before [inaudible] came along?

526
00:31:56.831 --> 00:32:00.460
I don't know what they were doing. Theresa do it too. Oh, that's what,

527
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.160
that's why they kill rhinos. You know Rhino Horn,

528
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:07.420
they think rhino horn gets your dick hard. It doesn't do shit. Do you eat it?

529
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.140
I guess they make a tea out of it. Oh really? It doesn't even work.

530
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.430
But guys been taken Rhino Horn forever to try to get their dick hard and so much

531
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.840
so that now that it's forbidden and it's expensive because it's forbidden.

532
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.370
It's like a sign of luxury. Like you're drinking rhino horn t it's a big thing.

533
00:32:24.371 --> 00:32:26.140
And apparently some Asian countries,

534
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.340
like with like wealthy people and we have decent Asian, they don't,

535
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.880
I mean I heard they was small. You heard,

536
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.100
well I have a girlfriend, six Asian babies. Right. But she don't have

537
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.370
<v 1>any scratch marks. Well, and I was just telling babies, you know,</v>

538
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:46.400
most women get stretch marks. Right. But I don't think that has to do with Dick.

539
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.160
But I'm saying Asian means make small babies,

540
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.540
<v 6>so. Hmm. I'm just assuming. Well, would've been, it's like go,</v>

541
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.200
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

542
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.350
I missed the basketball player was the the the giant dude. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

543
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.190
yeah. What about that guy? Oh, and if he has a normal size, he too tall.

544
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.300
He ain't got no Dickies to too,

545
00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.870
<v 1>I guarantee you he pissed on the top of his pants.</v>

546
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.100
It's so, it's a way a man Bron James is tall too. He got a lot of Dick.

547
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.210
I saw that nick on TV that day. I bet. Oh my God. When he went to go scratch,

548
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:24.660
I was like, I'm not into young Dick like that. But that was nice. And I

549
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.690
got, I'll tell you somebody else. You've got a nice,

550
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:34.660
oh Nikki Minaj is ex boyfriend safari. Yeah. He broke the animate, waited.

551
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.010
He broke down and got, he had a curve.

552
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.800
Any Joe fucking lip you can ask?

553
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.600
It could probably live a weight in his fucking weight room right here. Wow.

554
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.610
It was so big. He couldn't even fit on an iPhone. It was only iPad action.

555
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.200
I was sending it to everybody. Bitch, look, you blessed today. You blessed.

556
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.420
Oh my God. And he made a little five minute video.

557
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.270
That thing was swinging like the American flag on top of a building.

558
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.823
It was nice.

559
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.020
<v 6>That's a thing like you either have a big Dick or you do not.</v>

560
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.940
There's nothing you can do about it. Like there's operations at dudes get this.

561
00:34:08.941 --> 00:34:12.930
Somebody just died from that. Yeah. Billionaire diamond seller.

562
00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.840
A guy who was a thing. It was in Europe somewhere in Europe,

563
00:34:15.841 --> 00:34:19.710
some billionaire diamond trading Dafoe. I'm a Dick Implant.

564
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:23.250
While they were doing the operation and when they put him under due to

565
00:34:23.251 --> 00:34:27.990
complications of anesthesia, he died. He was like 65 years old too.

566
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:31.410
I mean when you're 65, wouldn't you think you're like, good luck.

567
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.250
<v 1>Have I ever had this small thing all my life?</v>

568
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.490
I'm a diamond dealer who's not going to turn this down.

569
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.650
<v 6>Probably have some young little floozies with and she's just as a few.</v>

570

<v 1>Bitch. You going to be happy in the way your diamond dealer? Maybe not.</v>

572
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:49.130
Maybe there's other diamonds.

573
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.470
<v 6>Dealers always want to give her a bigger dick. You know,</v>

574
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.070
it depends on how hot the girls, you know some, some girls get a lot of offers.

575
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:59.120
I get no offers. What's up Jamie? Sorry we looked this up but it's that,

576
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.420
I remember that thing. They slide in there. That piece of plastic.

577
00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:06.410
Oh that's right. It's the implant. Uh, it's like a mesh.

578
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.820
They is a website for it. Penn. Yeah. Penn Numa. Wow. Look at this shit.

579
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:14.330
Look they, they take like a look at that. It's like a webbing. Yeah.

580
00:35:14.331 --> 00:35:15.164
Put the glasses.

581
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.600
<v 1>I said, man, I'm a grown ass man. The</v>

582
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:21.740
<v 6>large extra large and extra, extra large.</v>

583
00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:26.210
Who the fuck is going to go with large? Just have large the fuck out of here.

584
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:28.460
You're going to get put under and they're going to stick a rod in your Dick.

585
00:35:28.461 --> 00:35:31.880
Get that extension. It's a it a pair. Well,

586
00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:35.780
let's play the video for you guys to see. Not The new muscle. Yeah,

587
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:38.670
the people online are not going to believe this. But see, look at that.

588
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.790
That's a dick. That's, that's a regular deck.

589
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:45.630
Now what they do is they do see if you have a dick like that, Jesus Christ,

590
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.340
don't get it cut. Just deal with it. Just deal with it. But some people,

591
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:54.180
there's never enough. You know, like some people want kinds of crazy shit.

592
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.280
So they take this [inaudible] they put a slice above the deck,

593
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:04.170
watch whoopsies like a c section out.

594
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.720
Exactly. The open that shit up. Like a change purse.

595
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:11.430
And then they slide this tube and Nagy.

596
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.600
<v 1>Yeah. And then the</v>

597
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:16.763
Kapow.

598
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.450
<v 6>So that's what that dude got. He didn't make it out of house. Bill. No,</v>

599
00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.150
he's dead now. He's dead. A big box of diamonds at home. No, he did.

600
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.600
What a big Dick. I did.

601
00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:32.610
They got to the big dick part so it makes you Dick Fatter and longer and the

602
00:36:32.621 --> 00:36:34.810
procedure takes approximately 45 minutes.

603
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:38.140
Sexual activity can typically be resumed in four to six weeks.

604
00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.500
Patients are ambulatory the next day. Oh my God.

605
00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:46.530
Ambulatory and was it say returned to routine daily activities in two to three

606
00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:51.220
days? Patients do not experience any issues with urination after the procedure.

607
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.860
Possible risks, complications,

608
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:58.240
alternatives and benefits will be discussed by the surgeon prior to the

609
00:36:58.241 --> 00:37:02.750
procedure. Oh and you could fucking die. Wow. Yeah, man.

610
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:06.400
Anytime you get put under, I mean that's is not how Connie's mom died.

611
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.640
Didn't she die from plastic surgery? I think she was getting a stomach, Don.

612
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.220
I think a lot of that is just,

613
00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.530
<v 1>I want my stone done once I finish losing weight, don't do it.</v>

614
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.510
I want my titties lifted. You don't know my titties.

615
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.330
Getting put under is what I worry about. Well, Shit.

616
00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.710
I mean I want my titties lifted.

617
00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:27.040
I understand this hall when you got big titties and they all in your lap and

618
00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:28.090
shit. When your bro come off.

619
00:37:28.091 --> 00:37:29.740
Do you want your wife to walk out the shower with her?

620
00:37:29.741 --> 00:37:32.170
TD looked like they'd been in a dry bar. I feel you.

621
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.510
I understand what you're saying. Yeah. So I want my titties lifted.

622
00:37:34.511 --> 00:37:38.310
I want my just my stomach done. I'm wanting you to stay alive in this pattern.

623
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:42.210
I'm gonna stay alive. I love you. I love you too. I'm going to get me a verge.

624
00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:46.510
Juven nation too. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't get a tightened up.

625
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.870
I thought he said you don't even want anymore Dick White hit the time.

626
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.760
Dawn through Penn and London's like pamphlets.

627
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:59.580
Oh my God. Rejuvenation. Fix that. I don't know, but I got to leak that upon.

628
00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.483
We can't fix

629
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.730
what's happening there. Just coffee. Huh? Chew. I'm wearing.

630
00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.580
He's my friend Y'all. That's the only reason I could tell him.

631
00:38:13.581 --> 00:38:18.250
Let me pissing on my cell. That's all right. I mean, I don't want no,

632
00:38:18.251 --> 00:38:21.140

633
00:38:21.141 --> 00:38:25.180
I'm okay with my black nose. Beautiful. Thank you. Oh, I'm a teach.

634
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.890
Pull it back. But I would like Joe.

635
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:29.890
I would like to get my stomach done so I can see my vagina.

636
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:33.160
It's been a long time. We've been disconnected for a long time.

637
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.580
Have you ever gone on a yeah. Didn't like it is the way he said it

638
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.570
was said you lost a hundred pounds and it just stopped. So I caught a dog,

639
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.660
but it's like it stopped and he was like, oh, you got to go to the gym.

640
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:54.310
I'm like, no. So you lost a hundred pounds, just dieting. No.

641
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:58.600
I would have weight loss surgery 10 years ago. And that was real juicy.

642
00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:03.250
I was almost 400 pounds. So you had the stomach staple thing?

643
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:08.740
Yeah, my stomach could. Yeah, it was. It was. It was easy as hell. Really?

644
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.440
Yeah. All I was, I was almost ready at four. Wow. And I lost like,

645
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.060

646
00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:20.740

647
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:24.880
I was a trainer. That could be another podcast. You complaining at the gym.

648
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:27.150
That shit would be hilarious. I would be complaining.

649
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.520
That would be hilarious or something crazy. My kids are fed cause you lived.

650
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:35.380
The parents is fat. The key is a fat. My son was 410 pounds.

651
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:39.810
Joe and I live in this white neighborhood and they couldn't get no pussy and

652
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.250
literally went on a diet joke.

653
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.960
When I tell you this boy is 220 pounds and every night when we go to bed,

654
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:50.040
he'd go in the Pantry, throw away the junk, and I said, you got one more time.

655
00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.870
Throw away my motherfucking food. He's like, y'all can eat that.

656
00:39:52.871 --> 00:39:56.940
He read everything. He just go to the gym. He was fat as fuck. That's amazing.

657
00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:01.780
Kiddies, his titties gone. His stomach flat air. The fruit day. What does he do?

658
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:04.700
What kind of exercise? I don't know. I can call him his name. June bug.

659
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.910
June bug. Yeah. Not his real name. He's, that's his nickname. Yeah. Nickname.

662
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.130
Chill ass. Why don't you do a podcast

663
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.620
and Momma at the gym? Oh God, funny.

664
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:31.710
A video of you at the gym would be just you complaining and talking shit or

665
00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:35.420
somebody gets you to work out. God Damn hilarious. Duma,

667
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.800
But if you just listened to him and did it and did a video,

668
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:45.640

And now he just did it. I know what it was. He couldn't get laid.

679
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.090
Well that'll be a motivator. Yeah. And I asked him, I said, son, be on him.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.320
Cause I remember being really small.

711
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.990
He's like, it's better mom. It's bad. When you're fat,

712
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:28.310
your Dick gets smaller. Hey,

713
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.730
your naval become your Dick when you real fat Joe. Oh my God,

714
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.600
you should do that. Like, look, I talked you into doing a podcast.

715
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:44.810
I'm going to talk you into doing this. You have to, okay, June bug.

716
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.160
I know you're going to see this moon bug please. You and your mom at the gym.

717
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:51.860
It'd be gigantic. I'll help you. I'll promote it.

718
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.590
I'll put it up on Twitter and Instagram. Please do this.

719
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.740
So Eagle Kiyomi you go,

720
00:43:57.741 --> 00:44:01.250
I got to go in there with a depend on if he gets you in crazy shape.

721
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.040
Imagine if you get to like bikini shape. Seriously,

722
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.810
I ain't been like that since the third grade.

723
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:15.290
I need a bikini shape. I'm telling you Joe, he could do that though.

724
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.210
He does that. Joe,

725
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:20.330
you don't know how happy I would be if I could just look straight down and see

726
00:44:20.331 --> 00:44:24.410
shit. A lot of times the food that you crave is the food that you eat,

727
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.450
so if you eat food that's not healthy for it.

728
00:44:26.451 --> 00:44:28.880
That's what you're craving all the time. Your stomach gets used to it.

729
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.390
The what they call your gut biome. Stomach bacteria wants sugar,

730
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.230
bread and pasta. As soon as you start eating healthy food,

731
00:44:37.231 --> 00:44:41.180
your body starts craving healthy food. Your body will start craving salads and

732
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:45.600
<v 2>lean meat and chicken and fish too. I don't know what else he started.</v>

733
00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:48.570
We don't drink water, but I do now. He makes me drink.

734
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.720
Well he literally call me Mama cause I can do one liter a day.

735
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:55.590
I'm up to one liter. That's the NOCCA. What do you drink besides water? Oh,

736
00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.780
I drink coffee in the morning and not that, that normal coffee.

737
00:44:57.781 --> 00:45:02.430
I have to have one cup. Coffee is fine. Yeah, I do. I do put sugar and cream in.

738
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:04.840
I got full Craig. Maybe I need something to call my down.

739
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.560
So I told my son I can't give up my car for right now.

740
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.600
So I drink coffee only in the morning and then I drink what hour day?

741
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:16.800
I work on a little water and he literally go to the House and tell us what we

742
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:17.634
can and can't eat,

743
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.840
which is I be want to punch him in the face but I am losing a few panels with

744
00:45:21.841 --> 00:45:23.100
him. Like you know I got an f,

745
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.160
I got the back whim arms like grandmama and he's like, mom,

746
00:45:26.161 --> 00:45:28.710
I'm going to get all of that off with you. Cause he were here.

747
00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:30.300
Pheromones two and big titties.

748
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:34.980
I mean he lost all of it and I'm so proud of it. You could do it too.

749
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.180
Yeah cause I was told him, I said,

750
00:45:36.181 --> 00:45:40.350
look you 19 you're on the insurance at 26 they will give you weight loss

751
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:42.590
surgery. I ain't like, I don't want that. That's the song.

752
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.690
Go get the weight loss or didn't I get your t taken off and your stomach.

753
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:48.090
Totally. He's like, mom, that don't sound like no manly thing

754
00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.060
<v 5>because I hate it.</v>

755
00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:52.410
<v 2>Play it out.</v>

756
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.810
I was going to get his Tommy Toe and his titties cut off and I'm going to get

757
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.560
them weight loss surgeon. I'm a fat daughter. She fat and I said,

758
00:45:58.561 --> 00:46:01.290
I'm going to get your Tommy Toe. I'm going to get your stomach cut.

759
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.440
And then [inaudible] Una is cause she had no A's. So,

760
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.220
and then I told my husband he don't have no A's. I was going to buy him my age.

761
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:11.580
<v 5>Jesus Christ in bite. Everybody asks,</v>

762
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.260
you know what? You know people getting cancer from that as is. Yeah.

763
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.900
When I take the fat from, you know, not only they take the fat,

764
00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:22.290
they get a lot of fat. They getting cancer from the implants. What?

765
00:46:22.291 --> 00:46:26.620
Titties ass implants. Oh, I ain't gonna do no ask. They play got bigger.

766
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:30.510
You do you, there's no issue. But some people who get ass implants,

767
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.980
they're starting to get cancer. Oh, real ass implants are only a few years old.

768
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.750
<v 2>Uh, you know what? I don't understand. I'm from the inner state of Atlanta.</v>

769
00:46:37.751 --> 00:46:38.770
When we was coming up, Joe,

770
00:46:38.771 --> 00:46:42.040
if you want it titties and A's and they had this thing going around and I did a

771
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:44.410
podcast on it. I said, we didn't people,

772
00:46:44.411 --> 00:46:46.120
black people didn't know where place the surgery work.

773
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.230
So the deal was you take that government butter and you rub it on your tds and

774
00:46:50.231 --> 00:46:54.610
your eggs and they said it'll make it grow. What? Yeah, I'm not allowed to you.

775
00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.830
That's what we used to do back in the day. What's up?

776
00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:01.560
<v 5>Look at me. Yeah, but I'm looking, look at me. Don't think it's from the butter.</v>

777
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.610
Uh, ever. Ever Bet. I know robot on there.

778
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.360
You don't know that government [inaudible] on. I want a job.

779
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:19.110
They sent to the ghetto to kill everybody. Joe,

780
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.010
I've got to tell you these stories.

781
00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:23.670
So once I was in the tub and Monday was like,

782
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.150
just put the bottle on your TDA is we put the bottle on my Mama.

783
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.130
We cause she's like, no, you bitches. They got my blood on y'all. You

784
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.420
<v 1>know that shit got to last me 28 mode day. She took this to Jakarta. She here.</v>

785
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:39.380
Doesn't that motherfucker stuck in that bottle? She gave us one on one. Who She,

786
00:47:39.381 --> 00:47:43.060
I sprayed my shit off. You bitches. We're not scraping her. Brought all of us.

787
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:45.370
She put that shit back in the frigerator. She beat the shit out.

788
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:50.590
She scraped the butter off your tits and put it back in the fridge.

789
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:56.470
We'll pull. We can waste on that good bottle, Joe. God, that is hilarious.

790
00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.790
She beat the shit out of those planning.

791
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.850
Her butter magic butter really did that.

792
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.880
All you had to do to get big tits and a big ass just [inaudible].

793
00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.780
This is the fourth grade, so that's when I didn't like it.

794
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:13.480
You just have good genetics now Joe. My Mama didn't have no titties. Yeah,

795
00:48:13.481 --> 00:48:16.600
but sometimes it doesn't get your mom, but it goes to, you know,

796
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:21.490
I'm trying to kill the government. Don't do that. Education and shit.

797
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:25.410
Joe, go break it all the way down for the lady. Let him try to bottle my phone.

798
00:48:25.411 --> 00:48:26.820
They try to pause it. Okay,

799
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.380
so go out and get you some good old government butter.

800
00:48:29.381 --> 00:48:32.240
They won't mail and just sat on it like a,

801
00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:36.170
like a fucking a bird trying to hit your aide. Just sit. All right. Yeah,

802
00:48:36.171 --> 00:48:41.171
I do rub it all your booty and stuff like and hopefully it'll make your booties

803
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:44.950
and titties grow and run for it. Didn't work. Imagine if that work.

804
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.120
There's a lot of questions on you,

805
00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.790
<v 6>Yahoo. People asking that does [inaudible] make your butt bigger?</v>

806
00:48:49.791 --> 00:48:52.910
And then I found a product on Amazon called butt butter

807
00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:03.030
cream for smoother, fuller, and firmer skin. I don't know if that's what I have.

808
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.460
Yeah, natural button enhanced cream for women and men.

809
00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:12.050
Plump booty enhancer lotion but firming and tightening cream.

810
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:17.210
Sexy. But was it, hold on. Sorry. It was sexy. But lifter cream button.

811
00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.260
Larger cream. This is horse shit. Most likely it's got four stars.

812
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.150
It's a bunch of people that are assholes that work for the company.

813
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:31.640
They're reviewing it 364 customer reviews. Hold on, click.

814
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:32.783
They're

815
00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.330
good. One or bad one. The good ones. Adding to my flat booty,

816
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.870
my family and I and my family.

817
00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:48.470
I inherited flat Butt Syndrome. It's embarrassing.

818
00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.210
It's embarrassing.

819
00:49:50.211 --> 00:49:55.211
Have your butt hurt because you have no padding when you sit and have no pants

820
00:49:56.181 --> 00:49:59.960
fall. Have your pants fall because there's nothing in the back to hold them up.

821
00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:04.610
After week I def notice something extra in the back. I'll keep using.

822
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:09.260
That's the people that you want to buy your butt cream cause they're morons.

823
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.010
That's like people that give money to preachers that flying private jet.

824
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.940
<v 1>Yeah. I think that's crazy. That don't work. But I,</v>

825
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.520
I'm telling you government butter work, Joe, I'm telling you,

826
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.320
<v 6>do this. Who would have known it works faster on your breasts and on your butt,</v>

827
00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:27.240
but it's work more. This is not real at me.

828
00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:28.430
I'm a 40

829
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.610
<v 4>Casey. She no</v>

830
00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:45.590
glasses on. So funny. I'm telling you God. But listen, these fucking,

831
00:50:45.591 --> 00:50:47.140
the people that are writing these reviews,

832
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:52.130
<v 3>not only does it works, that's it works. Not only does it works,</v>

833
00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:54.120
it increased my breast size.

834
00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:57.630
They probably should change the name to breast and button, hand spent butter.

835
00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:02.220
I know it for the, but I know it for the butt. So I figured, let me see,

836
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:06.600
will it do anything for my breast since it's in quotes, all natural.

837
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.680
So I did. So within a week,

838
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:14.220
my breast was fuller. Last time I seen them,

839
00:51:14.221 --> 00:51:18.180
this size was right before it was time to press feed and my baby is now nine

840
00:51:18.181 --> 00:51:19.014
years old.

841
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.070
<v 1>Oh. So I imagine what we was doing in the ghetto.</v>

842
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.320
I'm telling you at thick as butter, I'm 10 does work it out.

843
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:31.101
The Black Watch.

844
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:33.920
I made it people who knows what I'm talking about from the South St Joe.

845
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.550
We did that and it worked. I assume I grew tin isn't,

846
00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.990
but we should have done it on one titty. Did it just to see.

847
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.120
No, John wanted to know to be here.

848
00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.380
I know one way to find out what actually works. One cheek, one tick.

849
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.600
You bounce it out left cheek, right?

850
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:53.840
Well I'm going to find that but butter and rub it on my crack baby.

851
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.880
One of her titties and see if they grow in their head.

852
00:51:55.881 --> 00:51:59.780
Just don't even tell him what you're doing. Just put it on one titty. Okay.

853
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.810
I'm gonna have to get her to do it. I don't think I'll feel appropriate.

854
00:52:02.811 --> 00:52:06.760
How old is she now? She's nine. It's too late. No, no, she's a,

855
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.890
they're like four. You can do it. You have a five year. I can test it,

856
00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.070
but she already got a big ass booty. Oh yeah.

857
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:15.410
Then when I'm going come and get some of that and see if it work.

858
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.820
My husband would kill me. I was, I don't know if it's true,

859
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.860
but I don't think it is. It doesn't make sense. But then again,

860
00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:22.730
I'm not a scientist.

861
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.970
I'm telling you it's like that peanut butter that they used to send to the

862
00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:27.380
ghetto to choke negroes out.

863
00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:36.700
<v 4>Well I love you too.</v>

864
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:37.833
What did they do

865
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:39.920
<v 1>that they used to send to the gut?</v>

866
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:42.590
The government used to give black people peanut butter that show come out

867
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.720
because they didn't want to talk about peanut butter. You had to heat it.

868
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.590
You want your microwave to heat it on the stove. Like you buy the cookers,

869
00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.730
scrambled eggs for the thing now, so you just spread it on the sandwich. Really.

870
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.780
Then they find later on they were going to kill us. It was like a,

871
00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:01.640
it was thick as fuck. It came in a cane. The Goldman peanut butter.

872
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:05.150
Go Google it. It was some dude on Instagram who was in school,

873
00:53:05.151 --> 00:53:06.540
some kid in school and were

874
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:07.540
<v 3>they, you know,</v>

875
00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.960
they feed them cheese sandwiches for lunch and he was lighting the cheese

876
00:53:10.961 --> 00:53:13.420
sandwich. He was like, look at this cheese, look at this shit.

877
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:15.880
And he's lighting. He's got a lighter too. It would not melt.

878
00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.970
It was just turning black. It was just getting black from the smoke,

879
00:53:18.971 --> 00:53:21.190
from the lighter. It was not melting. It wasn't,

880
00:53:21.191 --> 00:53:23.080
what the fuck kind of cheese is this?

881
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.770
<v 1>Yeah. And it wasn't real cheese.</v>

882
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:31.520
<v 5>There's this parts of America that the government ignores, right? Yeah.</v>

883
00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:32.763
Me. Yeah.

884
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.870
You got through who made it through the net? Yeah.

885
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.800
But then they only come to you when they, when they need to vote,

886
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.110
they only come to the like black pastor. They like black pastors, you know?

887
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.130
That's why I don't go to church. I tell them all the time, I tied at churches.

888
00:53:49.131 --> 00:53:52.500
Chicken, you get more for your money. Churches, chickens better.

889
00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:57.400
$2 Tuesday, get your two piece chicken in a biscuit. What you're talking about

890
00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.400
the lead up Popeye's. A load on Tuesday and go to churches. Yeah,

891
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:06.840
but did they have the spicy spices now? Yeah. Yeah.

892
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:10.770
That's the thing. I'm like, I'm not getting over pastor my money.

893
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.010
Good for you and ride not there. I mean, Hey, the Bob is free.

894
00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:17.280
Then every hotel just did abide by the hotel like everybody else used to.

895
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:18.960
I'm not going to get you my mind.

896
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:22.560
Then you out here by buying jets and shit and I'm struggling.

897
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.890
Then you fucking holes in church. Rainy share sharing holes in church.

898
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:28.890
Nomo they're fucking nose in church. Oh yeah, they beat some. Fuck Yo.

899
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.500
I don't know. I don't go to church.

900
00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:35.370
Go to church with no underwhelm to get the pastor. Oh fuck the first lady.

901
00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:39.220
They don't can them back. The first lady goes,

902
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.990
wear no underwear in church to lure the pastor. Really? You ain't much.

903
00:54:43.991 --> 00:54:45.450
The pastors is sexy as fuck.

904
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.360
Remember back in the day when you might not remember cause you white,

905
00:54:48.361 --> 00:54:49.194
but Megan and

906
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.920
begging and date a pastor was ugly. Oh the possible ugly. Like TD Jakes.

907
00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.650
They was on fuckable but now they all sexy.

908
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:02.680
Then they all sexy me. Everybody want to fuck the pal seeker.

909
00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.030
That's what they said they meant when they made Catholic church preachers become

910
00:55:06.031 --> 00:55:06.810
celibate.

911
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.330
One of the reasons why the man would come celebrate is because the Catholic

912
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:12.020
preachers were banging all the ladies there.

913
00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.240
They were like rock stars because they were the ones who are the word of God.

914
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:19.290
And this was before anyone could read the Bible because it was all in Latin.

915
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.000
So they didn't know how to read Latin.

916
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.410
So they relied on these priests to read it. Look at Joe Austin.

917
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:29.520
He's fuckable. Oh yeah. I haven't known him at this little kid. Yeah.

918
00:55:29.521 --> 00:55:32.310
Do you think he got some getting him song

919
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.550
and not in Jesus' name?

920
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.930
No ones sexy Georgia state shit.

921
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:44.670
I don't even do white me Lauer. Do Joe Esteem in the pool pit.

922
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.390
Do you think he gets him? He got a wave. Yeah, but other than her,

923
00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.620
he got some on the side. Bitch

924
00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.720
fucking with me. Hey.

925
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:07.300
And I let him call me that too. Wow. Yeah. You pay the bill. Look at him.

926
00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:11.400
Look at him. He killed any ea aged at all.

927
00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:15.360
Look at that for here to hell. He's 60 he walked down

928
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.440
faithy I bet he does have a six pack, right? Yeah.

929
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.470
He got a six pack and problems and his wife in the upper right corner.

930
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:28.340
Go back 56 lose good for 56 let's go though.

931
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.320
Is that his wife? She's hot. Yeah. She hasn't played with their call.

932
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:36.190
Let's just say this. His wife Kapow. Yeah, he could take that.

933
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:40.200
Joel joy is good luck. I've got a guy named marina [inaudible].

934
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.050
She's got a date. They are the new drug though. They're the new pimps.

935
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:46.510
Pimps had holes and they go on a cone and slept.

936
00:56:46.511 --> 00:56:49.660
They hold and get their money or the church is like that now. That's all it is.

937
00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:52.930
He does it in Vegas at the same arena where the UFC plays.

938
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.830
I thought he was in Dallas. He goes all over the place.

939
00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:01.150
He goes on the road sometimes they go on the road and he said he's in Houston or

940
00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:04.510
Dallas somewhere in Texas. Houston does that,

941
00:57:04.511 --> 00:57:07.960
but he also does like giant arenas on the road. I'm like, he does.

942
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:12.490
He does the t mobile center, whether UFC place, look at that size,

943
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:14.850

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:18.910

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:30.680

947
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.680

948
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:41.860
Oh my God. Yeah. You Ain't noticed that.

949
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:44.830
I didn't know that they were banging on the front row.

950
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.760
Smell like an oyster bar. Yeah. It's smell like

You're going to be at home like Nah, this bitch Yo,

966
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:56.040
I'm telling you sometimes just the other podcasts we've done with,

967
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.570
I just stopped in the middle of the dangle. What the fuck?

968
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.750
Yes. Some of this shit. Well mostly about the tragedies.

969
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.310
Mostly about your childhood. It's funny now Joe. It's just that I took out. I,

970
00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:13.210
you know, I, I say on stage, I say it, um, ah, when you, when you,

971
00:59:13.211 --> 00:59:16.300
when you can laugh at what you've been through, then you got control of it.

972
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:20.980
Only the reason why I can laugh about being shot and I even my husband hate this

973
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:22.070
bit. I do. I do

974
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.670
<v 1>a bit about, uh, my first kid's father, you know, giving me crabs,</v>

975
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:26.833
gunnery in fleas,

976
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.700
fleas. She gave me a combo with no toy

977
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:40.850
fucking sleaze. I mean, people get crabs, I get it.

978
00:59:40.851 --> 00:59:43.370
But when someone gives you flees, like what the fuck?

979
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:46.820
But back in those days the health department would come and pick you up and say,

980
00:59:46.821 --> 00:59:51.580
Hey, you put c on five, we need to put it out. They pick you up, pick you up.

981
00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:55.210
And he beat him, gave somebody else crap.

982
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:58.670
I'm going gonna run Fleece on some bitch or report everybody. He was missing.

983
00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.340
We and I was always on the list. Oh Geez. I was like,

984
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.450
how can you tell people they,

985
01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.090
I think it's funny that they used to come get me and me and the health

986
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:08.720
department man had a relationship. Now we want sleeping together. He just say,

987
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:10.370
Hey, you post, it was on the list again.

988
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:23.120
Like how can you tell people that? I also think it's fucking hilarious.

989
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:26.650
I don't have a STD. When I was young, you know,

990
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.320
it was simple shit. Gunnery, you got to shout in. Yeas.

991
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:33.350
And I remember that they came one time, Joe and um,

992
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.990
they knocked on the door and I said, oh my God, you here.

993
01:00:35.991 --> 01:00:38.470
I thought you was gonna let me brought up. He's like, you put someone in.

994
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:42.090
Listen, I'm here to put it out. So,

995
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.353

997
01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.970
He said [inaudible] report it.

998
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.360
So my kid's father was there. I was like, let's go together and get cured.

999
01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:02.830
He's all, I don't want to go. Somebody might see me. So this is what he told me.

1000
01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.870
Say Look, it was going to run when you have gone to,

1001
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
you need to get a shot or you take pills for seven days. So he said, look,

1002
01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.610
go to the health department but don't get the shot.

1003
01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:13.970
Get the pills so we can split them. So I'm so stupid.

1004
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:17.450
I come back and split the seven day pills with them and we still both got half.

1005
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:25.220
Oh my God, we didn't take the medication all the way. So, oh my God,

1006
01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:25.880
that's stupid.

1007
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.590
I was like crazy while you tell people this shit and everybody always think he

1008
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:34.550
gave me gun and shot me and beat me like can you please tell the people I didn't

1009
01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:35.600
do this shit to you?

1010
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:39.800
How does he deal with you having this act like when you go on stage and talk

1011
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:42.330
about all this shit, how does he handle it? Does he cover his ears? He,

1012
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:47.540
he never, he only seen me once. What? He won't come see me, Joe, come on.

1013
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.870
He wouldn't, he came to see me with cat Williams,

1014
01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:52.970
asked him when I was opening up for Kat Williams and uh,

1015
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:57.350
but that's the only time. But he's, he's gotta know. Oh,

1016
01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.350
he didn't know funny as fuck. Like how did he not want to see that?

1017
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:01.760
He don't want to see a Joe.

1018
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:03.980
We'll tell him to come to the comedy store tonight cause you're gonna be there

1019
01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:07.910
for the 10 30 show. Hell yeah, he's, he's even Naplan.

1020
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.310
He don't watch your fucking podcast and tell my daughter,

1021
01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.760
oh she was so fucking funny. But he's not gonna direct it to say to me,

1022
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:16.670
he was so fucking funny. But he's my biggest cheerleader. I mean,

1023
01:02:16.671 --> 01:02:18.020
he's supportive. I mean, you know,

1024
01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.010
I've been doing this 17 you know how many times

1025
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.380
<v 2>I had to make that man credit card out to go and do it.</v>

1026
01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.690
So you know. Well, he would not come see me. He's like, look, I live with you.

1027
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.660
I hear that she ever debt,

1028
01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:36.210
but he gives me back like he's funny to me. Like I told you saying not today.

1029
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:38.490
I want to it a day at at all. Yeah, not at all.

1030
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.100
He's says some of the funniest shit. Oh, well he's a he, but you know,

1031
01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:47.980
he's only seen you do comedy once. The one time out of 17 years.

1032
01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.940
It's a good one though to open for cat Williams. He's still in touch with cat.

1033
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:54.000
No, but I love care. Cain about a damn. He shared about care. We all,

1034
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:58.800
my daddy died. Well my daddy died and I just got a job with cat Williams.

1035
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:00.510
He walked in there. He was like, what are you doing? I said,

1036
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:04.110
my daddy died like two days before. He called me on a tour and I said,

1037
01:03:04.111 --> 01:03:06.030
we trying to, I'm just trying to get this money together,

1038
01:03:06.031 --> 01:03:09.180
raising care wouldn't go to the bank, come at with a stack of money.

1039
01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:13.080
He gave me like four green to bare my dad and I was like you don't have to do

1040
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:17.040
this. And I was like I work for, he's like look no go Barea daddy.

1041
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:21.510
Cause before he did that Alba put my fucking dad in on potato sack and stick him

1042
01:03:21.511 --> 01:03:24.660
in the ground cause we had no money and I tried to do the fish fry in the black

1043
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:26.100
community. I mean the white neighborhood,

1044
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:27.690
they don't own them about no fucking face frown.

1045
01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:32.310
No Tuesday and cat wouldn't gave me the money to bury them. That's hot. Yeah.

1046
01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:34.290
Okay. Nobody tell me Shit about cat weed.

1047
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.560
<v 3>He's crazy. But he's funny as fuck. He's,</v>

1048
01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.250
he's one of my favorites all time and he tell the fucking truth too.

1049
01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:44.300
If you go to go back to like the pimp chronicles is in his prime, that is,

1050
01:03:44.301 --> 01:03:46.850
those are some of the best specials ever. Yes.

1051
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:51.590
He's a funny motherfucker and he's so original. Still original like that is him.

1052
01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.740
You know what I mean? Like his delivery, his style, everything.

1053
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:57.850
<v 2>I love him. Can't nobody tell me shit about no kit weed.</v>

1054
01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.240
I'm going to cause a cat, William.

1055
01:03:59.241 --> 01:04:01.310
I was able to finish my basement after their tour.

1056
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.740
<v 3>He, uh, he gave me some, not gave me,</v>

1057
01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:07.350
but he gave some great advice once about comedy.

1058
01:04:07.351 --> 01:04:10.470
One of the things he says don't eat before you go on stage. And I was like,

1059
01:04:10.471 --> 01:04:12.600
yeah, why would you, you don't eat before you fight.

1060
01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:14.400
Why did you eat before you go on stage?

1061
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:18.780
What does it causes your body that your body when you eat has to break down that

1062
01:04:18.781 --> 01:04:21.240
food? So it's, it's using up energy,

1063
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.650
like some of the energy that you would have to do stand up is now breaking down

1064
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:29.670
that food in your body. That is what I'm about to fall asleep on stage. Yes.

1065
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:34.350
Yes. Shit, I got to stop eating. Just don't eat right before you go on stage.

1066
01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:38.490
Does eat afterwards. Okay. Yeah, I mean I listen to him and I was like,

1067
01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:39.450
that makes so much sense.

1068
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:44.460
And also he has a playlist of music that he plays right before he goes on stage.

1069
01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:48.450
Like sets it up like it just like puts him in the mood to go on stage.

1070
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:52.280
<v 2>Yeah, I do that too. I do that. I do that too. I like a lot of 'em.</v>

1071
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:58.770
Um, I, I wanna say out. Okay, but that ain't what I'm going for.

1072
01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.870
Hulu fucking rap. I let's Carly B oh, deload nasty thing.

1073
01:05:03.871 --> 01:05:07.650
That's what I would be if I had a body like that. Oh my God,

1074
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:11.310
that girl got a tone, got a drag afloat. She might,

1075
01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:15.420
she that person in my head and I want to be, I listen to a lot of Kali B.

1076
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:17.860
I like her. Maybe you can get that body.

1077
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:22.960
<v 5>Uh, maybe, maybe Junebug bug you in that gym.</v>

1078
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.550
Get on that elliptical machine. Come on June Bob,

1079
01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.590
we're gonna need you to help your mom out June bug and stop your mom from peeing

1080
01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:34.210
on a sale. Just, just change up the Diet. I'm working,

1081
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:37.590
I sweat, and next time you see me near Sun, I'm going to look like you.

1082
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.340
If you do that, did they go too hard? I tell you,

1083
01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:46.960
go to a different doctor. I'm like, but if you,

1084
01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.910
if you did that, I'm telling you,

1085
01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.810
if you did a video with your son and your son getting you to the gym and did

1086
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:57.790
that regularly on, on Youtube, June bug and Miss Pat, just do that.

1087
01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:01.570
It would be hilarious. It'd be so funny. Cause I, I,

1088
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.820
cause you know I got lucky is out. I want,

1089
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.250
especially when they're making you do shit,

1090
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:08.980
you don't want to do like working out like doing sit ups and shit and squats and

1091
01:06:08.981 --> 01:06:10.910
all that spread my legs did.

1092
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:13.150
Ain't never been used at a waste since the eighties.

1093
01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:20.890
My butthole. Exactly. Yeah. Doing what we doing it. Do it,

1094
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:24.550
do it. Definitely do it. So, so you do you bring like, um,

1095
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:27.830
I bring like one of those um, um, uh, Mp3,

1096
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.690
no Bluetooth speaker things with me. You know,

1097
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.560
I have like one of those JPL extremes.

1098
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:36.170
I bring that with me and I put it in the green room. Play music. Oh,

1099
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:39.500
not usually. Listen to music on my, to my before performing. Yeah. No,

1100
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.050
I listen to music, um, on my phone. Yeah, but you get yourself in a mood.

1101
01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:45.730
Do you, do you have a drink before you go on stage?

1102
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.600
I don't drink alcohol at all. No, nothing. Oh, what about weed?

1103
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:54.760
I don't do any weed. You don't know nothing. I grew up in that environment.

1104
01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:58.180
I understand. As I say, I just don't, I mean, you don't need it.

1105
01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:02.180
<v 2>There was nothing for me. It makes me sleepy. And um,</v>

1106
01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:04.650
my mom was an alcoholic and I used to always say,

1107
01:07:04.651 --> 01:07:07.280
I'm going to be nothing like this bitch is hell.

1108
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.770
So mission accomplished. Yeah. So I don't, I don't do it at my,

1109
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.890
my whole family drink and I just don't do it. Yeah. I don't, I don't smoke weed.

1110
01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.690
I don't, you know, I was just telling them earlier,

1111
01:07:18.930 --> 01:07:22.560
like jumbo tried to smoke weed one time and it was his white friends,

1112
01:07:22.561 --> 01:07:25.190
but they were so stupid. Joe, they didn't know how to roll the wheat.

1113
01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:27.230
So they got the, they got the um, the,

1114
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.380
the copy of paper off the machine and rolled the weed in there. Oh God. Yeah.

1115
01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:35.610
And Tommy leading it is Burt and out a wheat fell in his chest and I beat the

1116
01:07:35.611 --> 01:07:38.730
dog shit out of jumbo. And I told them, oh,

1117
01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:42.960
I don't burn up grocery for you to create an appetite. You already fucking fat.

1118
01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:45.750
Oh my God. And I just told my kids when they was younger, I say, look,

1119
01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.640
I told my son I kill. I said, look,

1120
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.450
I get food stamps and I don't get enough food stamps for your weed habit.

1121
01:07:51.451 --> 01:07:54.300
So we not gone do drugs, we're not going to join gangs.

1122
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:58.560
We're not going to do drugs is awesome fucker. So we not gonna do it. So,

1123
01:07:58.561 --> 01:08:01.830
but Junebug is the only kid I ever had that really tried to dab into weed.

1124
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:07.230
That's a weird way to do it though. Copy paper. Whoa, this was terrible for you.

1125
01:08:07.290 --> 01:08:10.620
They will go to the ghetto and buy the wheat out of it. Out of where I live it,

1126
01:08:10.621 --> 01:08:13.290
they would go over to the ghetto. So I was like, Jumoke how much you eat?

1127
01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.010
How much wheat you buy? 1.5 grams. What the

1128
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:20.830
<v 1>hell is dead? I don't know. And I called the police on him. I said,</v>

1129
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:25.730
what are you d I called the police on the shake him up, right. And I,

1130
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:27.680
you know called the police. Yeah. But I said, hey,

1131
01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:31.110
we black so leave your guns in the car. So come over here and shake my son.

1132
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:34.700
The police get over there. The police and Junebug son go to school together.

1133
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:38.190
This motherfucker come on there and start crying. We love you June. But I said,

1134
01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.720
they call you with a fucking cry.

1135
01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:44.390
[inaudible] I was crying so that didn't help.

1136
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.770
But eventually I think he gonna stop smoking now. He's going to stop or start.

1137
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:53.300
I think he stopped. I ran off all his friends. I told him, I said, look, yo,

1138
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.580
your white son just lost his only black friend.

1139
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.190
I'm going to fuck your white baby up. Bring them back over here with the, we

1140
01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:05.360

1141
01:09:05.361 --> 01:09:06.650
I whooped him white boy, his ass.

1142
01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.460
Cause I called, I called on a pair, so I called all the parents.

1143
01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:16.550
I said they'll be smoking weed and looking at some little white girl puts it on

1144
01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:18.240
the phone. I said, Juma, you bless you mama.

1145
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:22.910
But his wife puts it floating on the phones. Oh look, a girl from the school.

1146
01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:27.680
Yes. Get in trouble for that. So I put the, I put the chrome cast,

1147
01:09:27.681 --> 01:09:31.390

1150
01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:43.070
real small redneck trying to kill my baby.

1151
01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:45.000
Trying to get my baby locked up for some white person.

1152
01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.090
You don't fuck with white plus you ain't got no Vicky,

1153
01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.280
you ain't got enough sense. Oh my God.

1154
01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:55.020
So you had the parents come over and I had asked who white man puts the decision

1155
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:59.090
. What the fuck did they say? I can't believe you did this,

1156
01:09:59.091 --> 01:10:02.090
but the fuck you mean it was on their phones. Y'all started looking at it.

1157
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:04.130
They stormed up.

1158
01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:11.210
They wouldn't speak to me and know no county, no friends. Oh my God.

1159
01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.610
I said don't you ever in Your Life Valet? No.

1160
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:15.050
Cause she gave to one of the football player.

1161
01:10:15.051 --> 01:10:17.870
He just passed it around everybody. Yeah. And I saw him,

1162
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:20.180
I said Junebug thinking about it dude was your sister Gary on him?

1163
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.600
He's like Mama [inaudible] ain't getting naked today d cause nobody see nothing.

1164
01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:25.813
Yeah,

1165
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:32.570
that's just the stuff I went through where he's the only one that ever really

1166
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.440
try me. Cause my other kids, you know I tell like I tell my crack baby, I say,

1167
01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:39.290
look, I'm gonna take y'all out in public but you got an option.

1168
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:42.050
Do you want to get on mom or do you want the soccer mom?

1169
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.270
And they don't like to get on mom cause you get on.

1170
01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.900
Mom would knock the shit out of them in public and I give them a option and we

1171
01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:50.930
get in public and white people always come to me like, oh my God,

1172
01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:53.150
your kids are so well disciplined. I said,

1173
01:10:53.151 --> 01:10:54.530
I told them I was going to fuck him up.

1174
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.790
He say when you said they just look like what? I said,

1175
01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:04.630
you should fuck your kids up too. I tell him, I said, hey,

1176
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:08.090
I said I will fuck you up. Don't play with me. I feed you.

1177
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:10.370
When we was coming back from the Disney cruise,

1178
01:11:10.371 --> 01:11:12.290
they was all playing with those little things that separate,

1179
01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:14.100
you know when you're in line. So I told him like

1180
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.341
<v 2>three,</v>

1181
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:17.880
four times stop isn't the my grand baby and it was the full Craig baby so they

1182
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.640
wouldn't stop Joe. I slept all of them at the same time.

1183
01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.970
[inaudible] white people are like, what the fuck? I said,

1184
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.800
what you're looking at me for? You all saw him too.

1185
01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.900
I asked him to stop by full time. Don't play with me. You know my nerves bad.

1186
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:30.871
I've been shot a couple of times.

1187
01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:34.890
Y'all going to fucking know him crazy and I just tell them that they good keys.

1188
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.560
The good kids now. Oh they know I fuck them up.

1189
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:43.470
I have a lot of bits about him because like the stuff like I do this bit about,

1190
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.870
I used to do this bit about the teacher's school calling me all the time.

1191
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.400
White schools call you for anything and anything, Joe. I mean, just dumb shit.

1192
01:11:50.401 --> 01:11:51.870
Black schools. We told them, look bitch,

1193
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:54.740
that's your child to two 30 don't you wake me up? So one of the,

1194
01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.280
one of the beats I used to tell, they call me by my niece Yolanda,

1195
01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:01.830
because she was sitting in the crayon table with her little white friends and

1196
01:12:01.831 --> 01:12:04.230
they're talking about their daddies. So Yolanda said, what?

1197
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:06.720
The next time I see my daddy, I'm going to stab him in the neck.

1198
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.080
And all the white kids started crying and they asked me to come up there and

1199
01:12:10.081 --> 01:12:13.350
emergency. They come up there to talk to them. I get up there, I'm like, ma'am,

1200
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.690
she can't stab her dead. And then nick, the N***a in jail,

1201
01:12:15.691 --> 01:12:17.100
somebody was going to stab him in the knee.

1202
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.310
Don't wake me up if I don't wake me up for this bullshit.

1203
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.800
So they don't know how to handle anything. And I had to set the school down.

1204
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.390
I said, look, these kids are from the hood.

1205
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.040
They only talked and do what they know.

1206
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.960
You gotta give me time to help them grow.

1207
01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.350
But then they wanted to put them on medication. I said what? We will, yeah,

1208
01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:37.440
because they didn't know how to deal with them. They had this so, so much like,

1209
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:40.830
hey mama was into horn and that was in drugs that they were beating on her mom

1210
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:43.410
and they, they, they didn't know how to handle them. And I say, look,

1211
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.370
we're going to help him grow together. I said, well what we not going to do,

1212
01:12:47.371 --> 01:12:49.170
we're not going to put these kids on medication.

1213
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:54.310
What we gonna do is surround them with love. They so good now out of five years,

1214
01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:58.770
this baby just now passing the ice step test. They took a minute to get there.

1215
01:12:58.771 --> 01:13:03.180
But he's finally there step those public,

1216
01:13:03.181 --> 01:13:07.950
those standardized tests they give kids and the kids just wasn't ready and you

1217
01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.420
know, I throw him in his neighborhood,

1218
01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.510
threw him in an environment that they wasn't used to and then you know,

1219
01:13:12.511 --> 01:13:13.410
they talk their language.

1220
01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:16.280
You see how a country I am when they talk straight streets.

1221
01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:18.600
Cause sometimes like what the fuck are y'all talking about?

1222
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.430
We bout it bout another fuck. You Ain't getting better set at five bucks.

1223
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.170
You Cross your head. Yeah, they ready to rumble.

1224
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.660
They ready to fight the little boy like I'm bout about,

1225
01:13:27.661 --> 01:13:29.460
I said put your fucking finger down, fire breaking.

1226
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.210
But I had to retrain him because what he saw in the hood,

1227
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:37.420
it wasn't going at my nice little white school. No, they're adapting.

1228
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.980
They're good now. They're good at it. Imagine all the kids that don't,

1229
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:44.820
and you can imagine because it was you and all the kids who don't have someone

1230
01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:47.490
like you. Well, my niece is 20 years old,

1231
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:51.740
21 and she's six kids and she in jail for 20 years for knocking on people's door

1232
01:13:51.741 --> 01:13:55.200
and robbing them so her kids is in a situation.

1233
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:58.260
So just imagine all the kids. I think about it all the time,

1234
01:13:58.261 --> 01:14:02.340
especially when it's my family member, but Joe, I had to realize this.

1235
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:04.690
I can't say the world. You can't save everybody.

1236
01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.120
I tried to save one at a time and that's all I can do. That's all you can do.

1237
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.160
Yeah, that is all you can do. I can't say it a world. I mean,

1238
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.290
I can't live if I keep trying to say the world.

1239
01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:18.130
<v 6>No. Well, you won't be able to do what you're doing. That's helping people too.</v>

1240
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:20.830
One of the things you're doing and it's helping people is you making people

1241
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:25.690
laugh. Yeah. I mean that, that helps a lot. Yeah.

1242
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.850
People fucking need that.

1243
01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.760
They need it so bad and so many people right now with their headphones on in

1244

1248
01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:43.550
<v 2>you know,</v>

1249
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:48.340
I was doing a show last night at the verge of here in La and a man came up to me

1250
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.900
, said, man, my dog died today and I've been crying all day,

1251
01:14:50.901 --> 01:14:54.970
but I want to tell you how much you helped me fucking relieve. I said, well,

1252
01:14:54.971 --> 01:14:56.780
I'm sorry about your dog. Did you burn him up?

1253
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:04.020
He actually started laughing, you know, after they die,

1254
01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:06.760
you got to them cremate or cream in them. Excellent.

1255
01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.150
We actually started laughing, but I'm,

1256
01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.740
I mean I get that all the time and you know, laughter is what he ought mean.

1257
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.630
When I was able, when I was able to write my book and you know,

1258
01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:18.710
started doing comedy,

1259
01:15:18.711 --> 01:15:23.600
especially like it was one story now about my mama boyfriend who molest me. And,

1260
01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.960
um, I had never told this door over 30 something years.

1261
01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:30.560
My husband and no only person knows me and my sister cause he's all,

1262
01:15:30.561 --> 01:15:34.910
we happen to us at the same time with him. And, um, I never told this door.

1263
01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.190
And I remember when I was writing my book, The lady who co-wrote my book,

1264
01:15:38.191 --> 01:15:42.080
she was like, uh, you gotta tell the store. And I said, well,

1265
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:45.770
I got to ask my sister and I get my sister on the phone, Joe. And I was like,

1266
01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:49.730
may pop devil's on, it's a name. I say, you ready to tell what Mr John did?

1267
01:15:50.450 --> 01:15:54.440
And we both did as Boohoo, Eh, we cheat.

1268
01:15:54.441 --> 01:15:55.460
We told some of the store,

1269
01:15:55.461 --> 01:15:59.330
we got off the phone and it took for me to tell his story. Took almost a week.

1270
01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.890
Me and the writer cries so much cause I had, I had all of that built up in me.

1271
01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.600
But I'm so happy I was able to tell that story now because that was the only

1272
01:16:08.601 --> 01:16:13.601
story I had never told public about how my mama boyfriend did.

1273
01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.770
Me and my sister from the age of probably six or eight ty was 11 years old cause

1274
01:16:18.771 --> 01:16:22.400
I started, my kid's father was 21 and I was 12 and I made him.

1275
01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:26.430
So I started having six at 12 so when he started touching me my,

1276
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:29.600
when I got a boyfriend, my momma, my momma boyfriend left us alone.

1277
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:33.620
Once you got a boyfriend? Yeah, once I got a boyfriend, Jesus Christ.

1278
01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:35.780
So that was the only store I had never told.

1279
01:16:35.781 --> 01:16:39.710
But when I told him I felt like I lost 20 I'm probably a hundred pounds.

1280
01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:43.550
I felt like it, but it didn't go anywhere. Right. But I just felt a relief.

1281
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:48.380
Yeah. So I know loud, I just know Lotta does a lot for me.

1282
01:16:48.381 --> 01:16:51.320
So I know it does the same for other people. God Damn,

1283
01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:55.940
you've had a crazy fucking life. And I laugh at every inch of it too.

1284
01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.650
<v 6>Well it's, that's the only way you can, I mean, what you've done is, I mean,</v>

1285
01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:05.080
you've done the ultimate take a negative and turn it into a positive. I try.

1286
01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:08.290
I try really hard. But you mean you really have because your,

1287
01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:10.100
your sense of humor is so fucked

1288
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.780
<v 3>up because of your life that it's so fun. I mean,</v>

1289
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:15.800
that's why it works.

1290
01:17:15.801 --> 01:17:18.590
If you had a cushy life and you were saying the shit that you say,

1291
01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:19.453
it wouldn't be funny.

1292
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:22.950
<v 2>So it wouldn't be. No, and that's one of the things with my husband,</v>

1293
01:17:22.951 --> 01:17:26.010
like when I was sharing with them, like my kid's father shot me and beat me.

1294
01:17:26.011 --> 01:17:30.030
You know, most of your listeners in Canada, who I am, they know my background.

1295
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:32.820
And one of the things when I started sharing my life,

1296
01:17:32.821 --> 01:17:37.530
my husband had their protective Mo. He didn't want me to, you know,

1297
01:17:37.531 --> 01:17:41.880
he knew how negative the world could be when I started to share these stories so

1298
01:17:41.881 --> 01:17:45.000
I could see what he wanted to step in and protect me. Right. You know,

1299
01:17:45.001 --> 01:17:46.530
when people would judge me. And you know,

1300
01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:48.840
like I dropped out of school in eighth grade when my husband went to the

1301
01:17:48.841 --> 01:17:52.440
military, went on off and he had a mommy and daddy are way better life than me.

1302
01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:57.120
So he would always be there to like be that protector, like, Oh,

1303
01:17:57.121 --> 01:18:00.690
they think I'm stupid. [inaudible] and I just, I just,

1304
01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.920
he helped me grow a backbone to, you'd say, fuck what people think about you.

1305
01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:08.700
Give me, cause it was so most screwed up stuff in my head. Like, uh, um,

1306
01:18:08.701 --> 01:18:10.620
one of the thing my Mama taught me about white people,

1307
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:12.780
like I didn't deal with white people. I mean, let's be honest,

1308
01:18:12.781 --> 01:18:16.110
I'm from the hood. There was a police on the fucking on the case worker.

1309
01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:17.580
My Mama told me, she said,

1310
01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:21.540
why people are better than you and they will look them in the fucking devil.

1311
01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:26.190
So my whole life, Joe Rogan, I was scared of white people. And when I,

1312
01:18:26.191 --> 01:18:30.300
when I wrote the book and I told The lady this, when I was see white people,

1313
01:18:30.301 --> 01:18:33.210
I immediately looked down, well that's what the slaves used to do.

1314
01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.580
And that's what the book lady taught me and I was like,

1315
01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.110
I can't look them in eye. And then she was like, why not?

1316
01:18:38.111 --> 01:18:41.110
I told her the story and I told my husband stories. He say, Pat,

1317
01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.850
he say we're all the same. Your fucking Mama is stupid.

1318
01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.170
I used to tell a bit, I said,

1319
01:18:52.171 --> 01:18:55.020
the only difference between me and you white woman is my titties is bigger than

1320
01:18:55.021 --> 01:18:56.810
yours. But I was in,

1321
01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:00.390
I was in my late twenties when I learned it because you like I,

1322
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:03.360
when I moved to Indianapolis I couldn't talk to you a fucking,

1323
01:19:03.361 --> 01:19:07.800
my words will stump and I will immediately say I'm stupid and I will look away.

1324
01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:11.760
And when I started doing coming in Indianapolis and my fan base turn white and I

1325
01:19:11.761 --> 01:19:15.780
was like, why the fuck y'all like me? Get away from me, cop the shit out of you.

1326
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:19.620
I say that to myself and my husband sent me down and was like,

1327
01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:22.890
pet we all the same. Your fucking mom is stupid. I'm like, we are.

1328
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:25.950
And I was in my late twenties I had never ever dealt with white people.

1329
01:19:25.951 --> 01:19:27.960
Like I dealt with them when I moved into that community.

1330
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:31.890
And I'm glad because it taught me a lot as a young girl out at it,

1331
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:34.860
out of the inner state of Atlanta, that we are all the same.

1332
01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:39.490
The problem with to problem with this country is we don't fucking talk. Yeah,

1333
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:41.630
no communication. Well

1334
01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:46.370
<v 3>there's that. And then there's the, these communities stay the way they are.</v>

1335
01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.880
Like whether it's Baltimore where they had it set up or black people literally

1336
01:19:49.881 --> 01:19:54.881
weren't allowed to buy homes outside of certain areas or any inner city like you

1337
01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:55.920
know,

1338
01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.230
in inner city in Houston or in New York or anywhere where the neighborhoods stay

1339
01:20:00.231 --> 01:20:05.120
the same, they stay the same [inaudible] generation. Yeah. Crime, poverty,

1340
01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:08.040
all the drugs, everything stays the same. And it does, you know,

1341
01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:12.270
<v 2>so my kids, my kids are fucking,</v>

1342
01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:14.520
they blessings and they don't realize how blessed they are.

1343
01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:17.060
And sometimes I get so pissed off at them.

1344
01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:21.600
Like they go to this really nice high school where I live in Indiana and they

1345
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:26.250
get they little laptops and you know, they get new books every fucking year.

1346
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:29.880
Joe, when I went to school, it was so many niggles, name Roland,

1347
01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:33.660
that same book where it had and checked it out every year you had to flip a page

1348
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:37.900
and you'll see Ramon Tyrone's. I got three pages of kids who had that book

1349
01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.780
and it pisses me off because you know, I look at it and I was like, well,

1350
01:20:42.781 --> 01:20:45.690
this is the old curriculum where you know,

1351
01:20:45.691 --> 01:20:49.560
these my kids are getting a new curriculum every year and it's still like that

1352
01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:53.500
in certain parts of America and it pisses me off. I'm like, yeah,

1353
01:20:53.501 --> 01:20:55.230
you guys don't realize how blessed you are.

1354
01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.050
You come in through a fucking this fucking thousand dollars,

1355
01:20:58.350 --> 01:21:00.900
pay it on a float at this school and gave you, take Schiff grand.

1356
01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:05.310
Like my daughter will literally hold up the school bus because she wanted to

1357
01:21:05.311 --> 01:21:09.270
walk slow because she was fat. So the lady called me and was like, Ms Pat,

1358
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:12.450
every day I gotta wait on Gary Ana to get on the bus.

1359
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:15.930
And I've asked her several times to be at the bus stop when I get there.

1360
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.700
And I said, ma'am, lead that bitch

1361
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:23.650
leaver you lead that motherfucker. She'll get down on time but you know you,

1362
01:21:23.651 --> 01:21:25.680
you did. They Pamper on me in my neighborhood.

1363
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.570
I said don't you dare pepper my black key lead that bitch cause I'll leave you

1364
01:21:30.571 --> 01:21:33.090
ain't you ain't in the car when I get in the car bitch buy

1365
01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:38.220
bag my kid. No you've got to get in the car phone momma cause she'll leave you.

1366
01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:40.140
I fuck you. You want to school.

1367
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:43.620
I mean my daughter would come in the house one time and say I need you to take

1368
01:21:43.621 --> 01:21:47.580
me to stop books. I'm like, why cool kids come to school with Starbucks. I said,

1369
01:21:47.581 --> 01:21:50.820
bitch, you buy golden school. You better. I said, it's night. I said, you crazy.

1370
01:21:50.821 --> 01:21:52.830
If you think I'm gonna get up at six o'clock in the morning to take you to

1371
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:55.470
Starbucks, you better take your feathers to Starbucks at night.

1372
01:21:55.471 --> 01:21:58.980
And get you a cup and put you some hot chocolate in the morning. I'm not going,

1373
01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:02.310
I'm not getting up at no six o'clock to make you cool. But they do that.

1374
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.300
Yes. The standard thing. Come bring me my lunch. I left my [inaudible].

1375
01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.270
I tell my kids if you leave something,

1376
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.910
you didn't fucking want it cause I'm in the bed with no wig and no broughten

1377

1378
01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.293
Well how's that work?

1379
01:22:19.730 --> 01:22:21.780
Because I went to bed last night and they ain't washed it before.

1380
01:22:21.781 --> 01:22:26.340
They called me yesterday pussy. So I'm not getting up you crazy as hell.

1381
01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:29.850
I'm not nobody. Nobody gave me nothing.

1382
01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.930
They understand that no one gave you anything like hell yeah, they get it.

1383
01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.750
They get it. Yeah, they get it. But they was like, no,

1384
01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:40.620
I don't want to hear y'all. You're poor stories. No listen

1385
01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:46.500
days, Ma, my cable. Thank you. My cable got cut off one day. Right.

1386

1388

Go turn the cable on before the kids get home. I was like, fuck these kids.

1389
01:22:55.531 --> 01:22:58.320
You know how many time I had to look at a father TV and thought it was snowing?

1392
01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:09.250

He never paid your phone bill. So how are you going to pay me back 3000 now.

1406
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:58.710

1408
01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.500

1414
01:24:22.931 --> 01:24:25.380
But it's all fucked up thing to ask someone when they tell you they were

1415
01:24:25.381 --> 01:24:29.800
molested by your mom's boyfriend and that, you know,

1416
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:30.610
you had a,

1417
01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:34.780
a baby with this guy when you were 14 and he's married and then another one and

1418
01:24:34.781 --> 01:24:38.640
by the time you're 16, you're pregnant with a third. Yeah, no, no problem.

1419
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:41.770
Whatever. Right? Selling crack and shot in the tet,

1420
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.940
no one would ever ask you to live that life again, but you,

1421
01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:45.820
you wouldn't change it.

1422
01:24:46.410 --> 01:24:51.110
<v 2>Ah, I don't know Joe. I mean it made me who I am, but I always,</v>

1423
01:24:51.111 --> 01:24:55.250
I look at life like this. Um, I think I would, you know,

1424
01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.950
everybody couldn't have dealt with the stuff that I dealt with it.

1425
01:24:58.070 --> 01:25:02.000
Like I dealt with it like some people commit suicide complaint when people

1426
01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:06.560
always depressed, you know, I kind of feel like I was the chosen one.

1427
01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:10.970
God take you through something so it can, you know, to make other people see,

1428
01:25:10.971 --> 01:25:11.804
maybe I was poor,

1429
01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.370
maybe I took burden that everybody else was going through in life and now I was

1430
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:19.550
the chosen one. Then I bring it out and make it funny.

1431
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:24.170
So I'm here to make people let, let people know it's okay. Yeah, it's okay.

1432
01:25:24.171 --> 01:25:26.900
It's not about how you start as about how you finish. Right.

1433
01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.010
I don't dwell on shit. I don't have control over. I can't change the pace.

1434
01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.080
But Liz left today and I tell people every night on stage when you can laugh

1435
01:25:36.081 --> 01:25:38.360
about it, you got control of it.

1436
01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.740
That's a powerful thing to be able to look at your life like that and just take

1437
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:46.520
ownership. Yeah. You know, like my first kid's father, he hates me.

1438
01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:48.950
He fucking hates me. You know why?

1439
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:52.430
Because I'm not that little girl rabbit anymore that he had control of that he

1440
01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:53.810
beat any, you know,

1441
01:25:53.811 --> 01:25:57.890
I was a little girl searching for love in this whole situation.

1442
01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:01.640
I learned to love myself. Joe, do you still in touch with him? Yeah.

1443
01:26:01.641 --> 01:26:05.170
Talk to him. He be cussing me. He's like, he's not in jail. Yeah,

1444
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:10.330
that's what I be telling him. I'm like, dude, I'm not a child molester.

1445
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:13.630
I remember when I needed closure and um, I was,

1446
01:26:13.631 --> 01:26:15.990
I was out here in La and I'm out.

1447
01:26:16.090 --> 01:26:19.160
I'm starting to tell these stories about my life and I just wanted him to

1448
01:26:19.161 --> 01:26:21.740
apologize for you. Only shot him in the back of the head.

1449
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.570
Fucking beat me crazy.

1450
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.740
So I wanted him to apologize and my, I was like,

1451
01:26:27.741 --> 01:26:30.410
why do you need him to apologize? I just want to hear it.

1452
01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:35.150
I just want to tell you rabbit. I'm sorry. So I call him up and I said, Daryl,

1453
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:39.080
we started talk. Oh Shit. I said his name. Oh, okay.

1454
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:47.180
So I call him and I ask him to apologize. And He, I said, I said,

1455
01:26:47.181 --> 01:26:49.880
how can you fuck a 12 year old and you grown and you mayor,

1456
01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.500
you know what he said? He said,

1457
01:26:51.501 --> 01:26:56.000
your mind and body wasn't 12 and that she kicked me in my fucking chest like a

1458
01:26:56.001 --> 01:26:59.840
horse and I boohoo and debt day Joe,

1459
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:04.520
I decided I was no longer going to ask him to ask for you took, you know,

1460
01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:09.140
to ask me to forgive him. I decided to forgive him. I forgave my momma.

1461
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.550
I forgave my mama boyfriend and everybody else that stepped on me.

1462
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:17.550
And I said, no longer am I'm ever gonna want to come gonna come.

1463
01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:20.300
I know I say from that day on,

1464
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.840
I'm never gonna ask Y'all for forget. I'm never gonna ask you again. Um,

1465
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:28.310
I decided to forgive you. And that day I forgave him,

1466
01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:32.180
my mom and her boyfriend and everybody else that ever violated me.

1467
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:35.210
Cause it was so many other people that I don't still don't talk about,

1468
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:38.570
but I forgave him. That's a very powerful thing and I'm happy.

1469
01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.570
It's a very powerful thing if you can forgive people who've done terrible things

1470
01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.910
to you and you haven't done shit to them. Yeah.

1471
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:48.640
The people that want them to apologize, they chased them, they checked the,

1472
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:50.630
you're eating yourself up, you eating yourself.

1473
01:27:50.631 --> 01:27:54.470
And I was eating myself up cause I just wanted him to say I'm sorry, rabbit.

1474
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:59.120
And he never said it. Well once he told you that when you were 12, your mind,

1475
01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:01.670
your body weren't young. You got to realize you're talking to them.

1476
01:28:01.671 --> 01:28:05.390
Fucking idiot. Idiot. And I called my husband and I was crying. He was like,

1477
01:28:05.391 --> 01:28:08.600
pat, why do you keep, I said, I just want him to ask me too.

1478
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:12.380
I just want him to say he, sorry. That's all I want him to say. And he was like,

1479
01:28:12.381 --> 01:28:13.214
Pat, why?

1480
01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.240
And I remember hanging out the phone and I got on my knees and I rarely get on

1481
01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:19.810
my knees. Joe and I got vertigo so I don't get on

1482
01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.440
and you know what I'm talking about. So I just, I asked for forgiveness. I mean,

1483
01:28:25.441 --> 01:28:29.330
I forgave him that day. I forgave him and my Mama, because of him,

1484
01:28:29.331 --> 01:28:31.130
my mom and her boyfriend, John,

1485
01:28:31.131 --> 01:28:35.000
is three of the people that I hated the most because she didn't protect me.

1486
01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.840
And when we once tried to tell her that her boyfriend was doing that to us,

1487
01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:40.550
you know, he wouldn't listen.

1488
01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:43.010
She wouldn't listen because this man was providing,

1489
01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:47.420
it was the only time in my life that we didn't get evicted because he was

1490
01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:49.370
touching me and my sister, he was always saying, well,

1491
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:51.770
if you tell your momma y'all gonna get pulled out,

1492
01:28:51.771 --> 01:28:54.760
y'all ain't gonna have no food. So we always thought we was happen.

1493
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:59.720
We always thought we was happen. So you know what?

1494
01:28:59.721 --> 01:29:02.340
I forgave him and then you know, they was day was already dead,

1495
01:29:02.341 --> 01:29:04.970
but he's still alive. He's still my kid.

1496
01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:07.480
His father is still alive or you want to know something crazy.

1497
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:09.810
And I never told anybody this. So people always like,

1498
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.400
why you don't go to your Mama grave site?

1499
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:13.860
You know a lot of people like I don't like fucking with the dead.

1500
01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:15.690
I figured they want to raise leaving the fuck alone.

1501
01:29:15.691 --> 01:29:18.280
They don't want to hear about the love legal, the lively shit.

1502
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.220
I don't go to her grave y'all,

1503
01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.980
because that motherfucker put herself next to her.

1504
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:25.363
<v 0>Wow.</v>

1505
01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.980
<v 2>Barrett himself next to my Mama. So I said, fuck both of you.</v>

1506
01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:32.520
I'm not going up there. He's laying right next to her.

1507
01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.270
<v 0>Wow.</v>

1508
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:36.130
<v 2>Last time I was there before he died,</v>

1509
01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.270
I was there cleaning off some ants on top of a gray. And you know, I'm young,

1510
01:29:40.271 --> 01:29:41.104
I'm probably,

1511
01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:45.490
she died when I was 16 probably 1617 I go out there with a gas can pull it on

1512
01:29:45.491 --> 01:29:47.800
top of the light it on fire to get the NBN. I'm finally sitting home.

1513
01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:53.120
<v 4>It's a curry. The ants.</v>

1514
01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:57.270
You bought jazz on it, lit it on fire. Jesus. Fuck.

1515
01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:03.060
<v 1>Oh my God, I haven't been back. Jealous.</v>

1516
01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.130
I haven't been back. No need to go back. I won't go back. He's next door,

1517
01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:11.530
so he wanted their controls or he got it. Fuck them. I'm never going back.

1518
01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.230
<v 0>God Damn has pad everything. Every time I talk to you,</v>

1519
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:21.610
I think I've heard it all.

1520
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:26.480
<v 1>Oh Shit. Joe, we needed, give me the mom some olive oil and wine.</v>

1521
01:30:26.481 --> 01:30:30.940
I can tell you a hundred another fucking store. What one? Olive. God,

1522
01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.130
God. Oh yes. I love that shit.

1523
01:30:34.131 --> 01:30:37.110
I drink a glass a day and I tell you a million fucking stuff.

1524
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:38.990
I was telling a story.

1525
01:30:38.991 --> 01:30:42.830
I just started writing a bit about how my Mama used to was a crap shooter and

1526
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:43.911
propose she shoot a dice.

1527
01:30:43.911 --> 01:30:47.480
She was locked up for five kids and she would rub them on our vagina upon our

1528
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:49.040
tea. That was good. Look for her.

1529
01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.720
She would rub the dice on your vagina and your titties probably dies.

1530
01:30:55.830 --> 01:31:00.530
All you post it for good luck. How old were you? Probably at fat.

1531
01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.490
Oh my God. What the fuck?

1532
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.290
I don't want to tell the whole story cause I just wrote a Viet about it so yo,

1533
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.860
wake up. It's the fucking bitch. It's fucking hilarious.

1534
01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.750
You're not going to do it tonight? No, I'm not going to do it at night.

1535
01:31:14.751 --> 01:31:16.270
It's not all the way down. But boy,

1536
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:20.240
when I got my friends like pay you gotta be like I said, I call my brother.

1537
01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:22.820
I said both. That's my oldest brother. He biracial, right?

1538
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.220
We say my mom say we got same day but didn't move a got good hails. Well,

1539
01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:31.130
we know. We know that. They ain't know Jerry Carolyn.

1540
01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:35.570
So I said, bow your loan. Do you remember when Mama used to shoot dice?

1541
01:31:35.571 --> 01:31:37.800
She's like, yeah, she's [inaudible] my mother fucking no, sorry.

1542
01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:42.973
<v 4>Okay.</v>

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.040
Fuck what a life you had. God dammit.

1552
01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:32.260
<v 5>It's so hard to listen to as a person who has kids. You know,</v>

1553
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:36.160
it's so hard to think about you being a little girl having to go through that

1554
01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:39.760
and you know it used to people say, Oh pat, you should get counseling.

1555
01:32:39.761 --> 01:32:43.720
But honestly comedy has been my counseling. It is a bit,

1556
01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:47.320
is a form of counseling for sure. I was able to share with shit that I had.

1557
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:51.820
I was anger about, I'm no longer angry and making people laugh. I'm naked. Look,

1558
01:32:51.850 --> 01:32:56.170
I'm fucking crying. I'm literally crying.

1559
01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:59.980
Yeah. And you know,

1560
01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:03.650
<v 2>then you meet so many people who can have a story like you people.</v>

1561
01:33:03.651 --> 01:33:06.610
I was always pet. You're telling my story. Thank you so much.

1562
01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:08.380
I had a black lady tell me one time, she was like,

1563
01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.850
I had my baby at 13 how can you talk about that? I said, cause bitch,

1564
01:33:13.090 --> 01:33:17.610
I'm happy and my child didn't have the life that I hate you,

1565
01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:20.950
so I'm happy. You know what I only thing I asked when my keys, I said,

1566
01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:24.850
I asked you college ain't for everybody so I'm not going to force college on

1567
01:33:24.851 --> 01:33:29.740
you, but what you do owe me is a high school diploma or you do owe me the prom

1568
01:33:29.741 --> 01:33:32.070
because I didn't have an opportunity to do none of that shit.

1569
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.670
So all of them go to the pro. Alan went to the Prom,

1570
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:38.050
I pick that outfit and everyone of them graduated from high school,

1571
01:33:38.110 --> 01:33:41.410
you know out my daughter was the first one in three generations to graduate high

1572
01:33:41.411 --> 01:33:44.380
school and the first one to ever go to college. Then she didn't finish.

1573
01:33:44.381 --> 01:33:48.390
But Hey man did my, my youngest daughter just finished criminal justice.

1574
01:33:48.490 --> 01:33:51.850
You have associate's degree and you know every time they do it they lot,

1575
01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.580
I'm going to the prom for you. They can graduate high school.

1576
01:33:54.581 --> 01:33:57.340
They gave me the high school diploma. My daughter was like, oh,

1577
01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.190
well I just graduated from college. Your Hago your degree.

1578
01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:03.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1579
01:34:03.190 --> 01:34:06.860
<v 5>I was like, bitch, you Kolodny or whatever. Fuck it is.</v>

1580
01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:10.780
You know what I'm talking about? Straight A's. Yes. Gulati. Yeah,

1581
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:14.050
that's what she was, you was good Laurie. So I mean she didn't,

1582
01:34:14.051 --> 01:34:14.630
she didn't go to her well

1583
01:34:14.630 --> 01:34:17.350
<v 2>graduation, she's, she, she didn't want to go on to graduation.</v>

1584
01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.880
So she booked it. She, she had two options. So she booked it on a day.

1585
01:34:20.881 --> 01:34:23.280
I was out of town, but she grew up, she's my first child.

1586
01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:24.990
He graduated college and I look back,

1587
01:34:25.230 --> 01:34:30.230
here I am with the eighth grade education or the GED and I was able to keep my

1588
01:34:30.301 --> 01:34:34.980
keys from going on the road that I went down. And you know, most, most,

1589
01:34:35.010 --> 01:34:37.800
most kids try to make their parents proud.

1590
01:34:38.370 --> 01:34:43.140
I try to make my kids proud to let them know it's not about how you start,

1591
01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:45.360
it's about how you finish. You know, I had to,

1592
01:34:46.230 --> 01:34:48.480
I had to meet to my oldest daughter and I said,

1593
01:34:48.481 --> 01:34:50.640
George will front house school and I in, you know,

1594
01:34:50.641 --> 01:34:52.230
I had to wake her up at one time and I said,

1595
01:34:52.410 --> 01:34:57.150
I want to apologize for being such a horrible mom in the beginning,

1596
01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:02.330
but I was fucking 14 you know, she was in housing. What a hit. [inaudible].

1597
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.550
She saw me sell drugs in front of her school. I said,

1598
01:35:05.551 --> 01:35:09.050
I made a lot of fucking mistakes, but I'm sorry,

1599
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:14.350
because I did what everybody else was doing in my community trying to survive.

1600
01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.800
And that was one of the hardest thing as a parent because a lot of parents high,

1601
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:23.480
you know, their past when they kid. But I literally went to my daughter and I,

1602
01:35:23.481 --> 01:35:27.290
you know, cause she hated me. Joe, she fucking hated me. She's like,

1603
01:35:27.291 --> 01:35:29.650
why do you have to sell drugs in front of my school? I said,

1604
01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:30.950
cause I was here first bitch.

1605
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.940
But you know, I think, you know, we, we have, we have a relationship now,

1606
01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:48.380
you know, and then I went off to jail and I missed her going to kindergarten.

1607
01:35:48.381 --> 01:35:51.470
And then I grew up in a community where if he was gay,

1608
01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:53.900
something was wrong with you. You know, my daughter, she gets fuck,

1609
01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:58.580
he eat everything in Atlanta. She packed man with the Pussy.

1610
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:05.780
So, you know, I had to,

1611
01:36:05.781 --> 01:36:08.970
I had to deal with that too because she ran off for a while when she,

1612
01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.750
when she wouldn't, you know, when I, she didn't want to tell me she was gay.

1613
01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:14.540
Cause I mean I had this thing where if you gave with some roach,

1614
01:36:14.541 --> 01:36:16.900
I fucking hated gay women. And I, I,

1615
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:20.810
I used to say this on stage when I say white men, when you, when you,

1616
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:22.790
when you hate N****s as a good chance,

1617
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.640
your white daughter gonna come home with a big dig Nagel

1618
01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:29.870
and open your foot.

1619
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:34.070
My daughter came home and she was gate and it opened my fucking world to the gay

1620
01:36:34.071 --> 01:36:37.270
community. And now like I remember when my daughter came out and some,

1621
01:36:37.271 --> 01:36:37.790
I was like,

1622
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:40.640
you must be ashamed that your daughter's guessed [inaudible] your daughter's a

1623
01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.910
whole. So your daughter going to take way more dicks than my daughter do. Okay.

1624
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:49.790
Immediately. I love my daughter, I love all of my kids and in,

1625
01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:53.270
and I told Ashley, that's her name. I said, it's not about, I had to learn,

1626
01:36:53.271 --> 01:36:56.480
it's not about your sexuality, do what make you happy.

1627
01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:00.890
And I will support you to the end as long as you happy because you saw your

1628
01:37:00.891 --> 01:37:03.920
daddy stopped my face and shoot me and ms treat me.

1629
01:37:04.130 --> 01:37:07.430
So if we were to do what makes you happy, just don't do drugs, bitch,

1630
01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.560
but do what? Make you happy. What? What made you not like gay women before that?

1631
01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:15.230
Cause I was raised in the black community. If you was gay, you know,

1632
01:37:15.231 --> 01:37:19.030
we're the biggest motherfucker. Black people who would throw up a gay child.

1633
01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.070
I'll tell you something wrong, which we talked to hate, you know,

1634
01:37:22.071 --> 01:37:25.910
especially that old school, black community. That's why. So you know people,

1635
01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:29.510
you know, I don't know Joe. That's just how we was raised.

1636
01:37:29.511 --> 01:37:33.620
The black church drilling in your head, you know, if you gay,

1637
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:35.720
you're going to hell. And you know your mom.

1638
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.360
What happens with gay people in the Bar Community?

1639
01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:41.630
A lot of them leave and never come back back in the day.

1640
01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:46.130
A lot of them wait til they, you know, they fucking mental problems.

1641
01:37:46.131 --> 01:37:50.810
I don't know. Like I didn't, I don't remember gay uncle anybody.

1642
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:55.410
So, but you know, I know we as a black community, you have to hide.

1643
01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.120
You had to hide making those days.

1644
01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.950
So I was taught if he was gay it was you was, it was something wrong with you.

1645
01:38:02.730 --> 01:38:04.620
And when my daughter came out to be gay,

1646
01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.590
it opened my fucking world up and I was like,

1647
01:38:07.591 --> 01:38:12.180
do I judge my daughter over sexuality or do I love my child because this is my

1648
01:38:12.181 --> 01:38:16.280
fucking child. And I remember not seeing her for three years. She just running,

1649
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:18.660
she had dropped out of college and she has gone from state to state them,

1650
01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:21.690
they're homeless, a lot of them be homeless. And I said, look Ashley,

1651
01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:27.930
I said, are you gay? I just want to hear it for myself. She was like, yes ma'am.

1652
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:30.170
I said well come on home you he puts it in Atlanta. Yeah.

1653
01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.370
<v 1>And my child came home</v>

1654
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:37.560
<v 2>and we built a relationship and I hadn't, you know,</v>

1655
01:38:37.561 --> 01:38:41.370
I was wrong out cause she her how I talked about gay people and how it's almost

1656
01:38:41.371 --> 01:38:44.280
like when you hear your boy, if you, if you want to hear your parents,

1657
01:38:44.281 --> 01:38:47.190
I wasn't N***a, N***a, N***a, N***a, N***a. Then you want to know wisely.

1658
01:38:47.210 --> 01:38:51.060
We talking about N***a you get curious and you go outside and like it ain't what

1659
01:38:51.061 --> 01:38:54.630
you think it is. So when she came out and you know she,

1660
01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:57.510
when she came out he opened my world and I'm happy.

1661
01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:00.850
I'm happy for my baby and I tell her about my daughter will eat the shit out of

1662
01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:02.460
you. She would dick you down once grandpa.

1663
01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:09.270
But she happy Joe and this what is all about,

1664
01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.170
you know that's all we lock in that all I asked is that she get a bitch.

1665
01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:15.630
They treat her right that she's a whole rent now.

1666
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.500
But you know new girl every six months. What is new girl she got,

1667
01:39:19.501 --> 01:39:21.030
she had been sticking with her for a long ago.

1668
01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.580
I liked the last girlfriend we saw big bigfoot,

1669
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:27.270
but she got rid of big foot foot. If she was a boy,

1670
01:39:27.271 --> 01:39:28.380
she would play professional baseball.

1671
01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:31.150
<v 1>Oh, bigger feet, big old beach,</v>

1672
01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:36.680
big beach run. Oh, he's taller than Lebron James,

1673
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:39.450
but I liked her aligned with new girls.

1674
01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:43.160
<v 2>Fringy growing. Oh me. So what is all about being happy</v>

1675
01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:47.980
<v 3>all about being happy you, you've, you've done an amazing thing with your life.</v>

1676
01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:53.560
Thank you. You took terrible beginning and turns it into an amazing present.

1677
01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:56.710
You know, you're one of the funniest people. I swear to God,

1678
01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:58.210

1679
01:39:58.630 --> 01:40:03.220
You're a a like a big time professional comedian. People love you. I mean,

1680
01:40:03.250 --> 01:40:05.510
I think what you've done is amazing to,

1681
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.180
to come where you started from and to be who you are now. That's, it's amazing.

1682
01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.500
<v 2>Thank you. I mean, and I tell people, I tell them I'm a convicted felon.</v>

1683
01:40:13.501 --> 01:40:16.470
They ain't shit does. I can do either you laugh or rob, you did not.

1684
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:22.850
<v 3>It's not just that you had a hard life,</v>

1685
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:26.840
you had a hard life and you worked hard to become a great comment.

1686
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:31.120
<v 2>Well, I had a hard life and I wanted to say my kids in the beginning,</v>

1687
01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:34.810
I just didn't want my kids to go through what I went through.

1688
01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:36.400
So that was the biggest fire. I was like,

1689
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:40.300
y'all ain't sticking your thumb and my Babe ass hole that I'm sorry y'all ain't

1690
01:40:40.301 --> 01:40:42.670
gonna do that to my children. Why do you not going to jail?

1691
01:40:42.671 --> 01:40:45.220
You're not going to drop out. You know? I just,

1692
01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.250
I just wanted my kids to have shit did I never had,

1693
01:40:48.850 --> 01:40:52.000
which was a life, you know? And then my, and then, you know,

1694
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:56.320
one thing in my book is about, I, I was searching for something.

1695
01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:00.880
I wanted a family. I never had a family. I never felt love. Like I feel today,

1696
01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:04.570
you know, I got a family. I go home to a husband and see me two times a week,

1697
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.570
but he's still fucking love me even though he say not at all.

1698
01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:12.690
He's being funny. Yeah. He being funny, but I know him loved Joe. Yeah,

1699
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:17.770
I him him. I never had that as a child. I knew I, when my, I planned vacation,

1700
01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:20.690
they'd be like, oh, we gotta do that. Fuck hell, we got to do this. Do you know?

1701
01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:23.450
You want to know what it is to be without a family fucking Mama we going,

1702
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:26.020
which we won't. He won't. We don't want to hear these horrible stories.

1703
01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.500
When I booked that Disney crew,

1704
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:33.310
they was all pissed off and they had a fucking ball and it was 22 of us when we

1705
01:41:33.311 --> 01:41:35.050
was there as a family and that's all.

1706
01:41:35.051 --> 01:41:38.050
I don't care to go when I go take him to the lake or take him.

1707
01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:41.980
I don't care to participate. I just want to know. I just look at him and say,

1708
01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:46.280
Oh my God, I got what I fought for my whole fucking life.

1709
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:50.980
A family to be loved and I'm love Joe. That's beautiful.

1710
01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:54.730
Then that's all I ever wanted. I don't give a fuck about the fancy call.

1711
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:56.710
I care about the nice weeks. But

1712
01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:04.210
listen, you and Junebug, you're going to start this youtube series, I promise,

1713
01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.470

1714
01:42:08.471 --> 01:42:11.890
available everywhere. Your book, it's still out there.

1715
01:42:11.891 --> 01:42:13.020
It's doing really well yet.

1716

1717
