ROB JAGNOW: Good
afternoon, Google I/O!

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:05.020
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.768
ROB JAGNOW: Woo!

00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:10.250
I did not expect that
a talk on process

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.540
would fill a room
with a capacity of 300

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.600
with a line of people
waiting outside.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.630
I am Rob.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.470
I hope you've been enjoying
the VR sessions at Google

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.950
I/O. Together with
Michael and Anshuman,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.630
we're going to be talking
about VR design process.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.297
I know it sounds
so exciting, right?

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.880
We hope that this
is a talk with a lot

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.659
of practical advice for
turning dreams into reality.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.542
So the talk is broken into
three different sections, each

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:37.500
focusing on a different
set of practical advice

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.560
that we hope will be useful for
anyone who is doing VR design.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.870
Within the Daydream
team, we use two

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.995
separate but complementary
design processes.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.270
Each one takes a
different approach

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.037
but helps us serve
different needs.

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:53.870
And the first one that
I'll be talking about

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.950
is our rapid
prototyping process.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.040
It helps us explore
terrain quickly,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.640
finding promising use cases,
and testing a lot of ideas

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.129
without wasting too much time
on a highly structured process.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.000
We refer to the projects
that fall into this category

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.100
as Daydream Labs.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.460
After that, Michael's
going to come to the stage,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.090
and he's going to be talking
about our second process,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.250
a robust iterative
design flow that we

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.240
use for building mature apps.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.990
He'll walk through
the specific process

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.140
that his team used in building
our Daydream Home world.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.752
And to conclude
the talk, Anshuman

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:29.210
is going to come up and talk
about an even more fundamental

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.668
challenge that
you're going to face

00:01:30.668 --> 00:01:35.710
when making VR app's, which
is building your design team.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.880
So to give you an idea of
where I'm going today--

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.639
oh, oh, before I talk
about rapid prototyping,

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:43.180
I want to take a
little bit of a step

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.560
back to consider
where VR is today

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.470
and why we chose to
put this talk together

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.960
in the first place.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.040
So to give you an idea of
where VR design is today,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.840
let's talk about
platforms that most of us

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.980
are more familiar
with, mobile and web.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.250
In terms of things
like hardware design

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.270
patterns in the computational
power that's available to us,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.960
virtual reality
feels a little bit

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.650
like designing for
the web in the '90s.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.300
So to target the
mid-range hardware,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.320
we had to design web pages
for monitors that had

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.840
no more than 800 pixels across.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.520
Design patterns
were just emerging.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.940
So we used things
like the table element

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.750
to outline everything
on our page.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.430
Because it was really
all that we had.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.380
And keep load time
short, we had to worry

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.560
about really simple
things like image sizes.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.300
Like even something
like a transparent

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.060
PNG could just totally
waste your download times.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.849
So with VR in its
nascent stage, we're

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.140
again having to pay very
close attention to these three

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.630
aspects.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.230
But unlike web or mobile,
which took decades to mature,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.010
we really do believe that VR
is set to mature much faster.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.950
For one thing, VR is
a very open platform.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.930
And basically from day one it's
open to third-party developers.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.360
Also, it already has this
huge generous community.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.056
And, in fact, I
recognize some faces

00:02:56.056 --> 00:02:57.680
in this audience from
community members

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.010
who have already been
very generous with VR.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.670
And also, the underlying
technology and workloads

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.770
are rapidly maturing.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.894
I think that this conference
is an example of that.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.450
We're doing several talks
on VR design process.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.535
So this is really
promising as a designer.

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:15.040
But there are still going
to be a lot of challenges

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.760
for VR design.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.750
Basically it's like
everything is new.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.117
So first of all, UI
standards and design patterns

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.450
are just starting to take shape.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.324
And like I said, this
is one of several talks

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:26.424
we're going to be sharing
our best practices.

00:03:26.424 --> 00:03:28.840
And without the help of these
established design patterns,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.660
we need a lot more explorations
to find ideas worth pursuing.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.460
And once we've
isolated a good idea,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.400
we need a lot more iteration
to turn that idea, that gem,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.390
into a finished product.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.160
So due both to the
number of iterations

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.170
required and the number
of disciplines and tools

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.730
involved, we take more
time and more iterations

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.550
to create a great VR
experience, compared

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.800
with other digital media.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.390
So number two, head
mounted displays, or HMDs,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.310
these have their own
unique design concerns

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.310
that we've never really
had to deal with before.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.200
So for one thing,
VR devices they

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.100
obviously occlude the
real world from us.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.780
And this forces us
to pay attention

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.570
to things like user safety
as well as physical comfort

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.540
and also psychological
comfort of the space

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.240
that we've created for you.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.420
Next, we have to consider
totally new methods

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.370
of interacting with
our digital worlds.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.260
Now even with the
early stages of VR,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.720
we've seen a lot
of different ways

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.510
to use controllers
to track your hands,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.310
or to use something like
vision to track our hands,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.210
to make our worlds interactive.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.520
So with all of
this put together,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.300
the new hardware
and design patterns

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.030
mean that anyone
working in VR is

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.140
going to need to become familiar
with a whole new set of skills,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.400
a whole new set of tools, a
whole new set of workflows.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.950
For instance, game design
engines, or game engines,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.880
have become an invaluable
part of our toolkit.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.070
Right?

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.270
Who would have guessed this?

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.061
And later in the talk,
Micheal and Anshuman

00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:51.810
are going to dig into the
specifics of the skills that

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.010
are used for VR design.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.050
Now since we're working with
all these new tools, and skills,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.524
and workflows,
sometimes this means

00:04:58.524 --> 00:04:59.690
we need to build a new team.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.540
Sometimes the skills
that we're looking for

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.880
aren't satisfied by the
people on our current team.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.580
So we need all these
members who can

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.600
fill the multitude of niches
used to create a successful VR

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.940
product.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.210
So all of this combined forced
us to develop a new design

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.840
process that allows
us to move quickly

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.820
to develop magical
experiences for users

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.602
and keep them safe
and comfortable.

00:05:23.602 --> 00:05:25.810
So now that you have a better
feel for the challenges

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.300
that we face as designers,
let's kind of launch

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.440
into our first big topic.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.190
So this is the rapid
prototyping framework

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.102
that we're using
for Daydream Labs.

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:37.310
This was talked a little
bit about more this morning.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.768
There was a 10:00
talk this morning

00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:41.060
about the findings
in Daydream Labs.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.202
So for decades,
science fiction has

00:05:43.202 --> 00:05:44.660
fed us these ideas
about what might

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.257
be possible in a future in VR.

00:05:47.257 --> 00:05:48.840
Some of these ideas
hold real promise.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.850
But others, as it turns
out, when we actually

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.540
code them up and
experience them,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.550
either they're a little
underwhelming or the hardware

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.550
just isn't there yet.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.580
So the nice thing is that
with rapid prototyping

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.090
we can cover a huge amount
of unexplored territory

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.060
in a very short time, finding
unexpected gems, and just

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.770
as importantly, taking
these ideas that just aren't

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.820
compelling or where the
hardware isn't ready,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.240
and setting those
aside for later.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.276
So the process that I'm
going to talk about today

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.900
has been refined by
a small team that's

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.890
built more than 60 VR prototypes
in less than a year's time.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.060
We work in teams of two.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.980
And we generally aim to release
about one prototype per week.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.410
That's the goal.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.120
The teams are, broadly speaking,
composed of one designer

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.086
and one programmer.

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:32.460
Although we're
really generalists

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.212
with quite a broad array of
kind of light skill sets.

00:06:35.212 --> 00:06:36.670
And Anshuman is
going to be talking

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.630
about more of that in his
section about building a team.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.360
The projects that we choose span
a huge breadth of categories.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.070
Some are really small
and self-contained

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.710
like figuring out what makes
for a comfortable reading

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.524
experience.

00:06:50.524 --> 00:06:51.940
What size of text
you should have.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.680
How bright should
the background be?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.259
How much contrast do you need?

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:56.800
Others are bigger
and more futureful,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.980
like creating a system
for authoring and editing

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.910
layered animations
on a timeline.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.040
So to help describe this
rapid prototyping process

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.790
that we're using within
the Daydream team,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.420
I'm going to break it down into
these five different steps,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.790
brainstorming ideas,
ranking those ideas,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.260
implementing them,
sharing the results,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.502
and documenting the findings.

00:07:16.502 --> 00:07:17.960
So let's start with
our first step,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.162
brainstorming these ideas.

00:07:20.162 --> 00:07:21.620
So let's say you
and your team have

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.440
decided you want to make
a gajillion VR prototypes.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.350
Where do you even
go for those ideas?

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.930
Good news here,
everyone has an opinion

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.402
on what would be awesome in VR.

00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:32.860
Go to that relative
of yours who is

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.000
like super bad with computers.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.180
They have an opinion on
what they want to see in VR.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.420
I promise you.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.254
Getting input from a diverse
team is a really huge help.

00:07:41.254 --> 00:07:43.170
If you have a team with
a breadth of interests

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.440
and a breadth of
experiences, that's

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.470
going to yield a breadth of
interesting concepts for you

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.399
to work on.

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:51.940
So as you're thinking
of these ideas,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.906
here are some creative
exercises to go through.

00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:57.135
When possible, don't
be incremental.

00:07:57.135 --> 00:07:59.510
There's no need to do that
for these kinds of prototypes.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.950
Throw away all the assumptions
and start from the ground up.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.825
The best new VR experiences
aren't going to be derivatives.

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:07.200
They're not going
to be something

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.970
that you've seen in another
media platform just transferred

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.590
over to VR.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.160
They're going to rethink
everything and be cognizant

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.070
of the strengths and weaknesses
of VR in its current form.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.596
Next it's really
easy to be literal.

00:08:20.596 --> 00:08:21.970
People love playing
with kittens.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.620
Let's make a VR space where
you play with kittens.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.700
Like this is virtual
reality, people.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.700
We don't need to be
constrained by the familiar.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.480
So let's make a world where
you use your trebuchet

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.370
to launch giant stuffed animals
that are fetched by your t-Rex.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.299
Right?

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.480
Prototypes are a really
great place to crank it to 11

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.870
and just see what happens.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.420
You don't know how far you can
go until you've gone too far.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.019
Next, constraints are good.

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:48.310
Now this is a really weird one.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.160
And I want to dig into
this a little bit.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.790
You don't want to over
specify the implementation

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.790
details for a team that's
working on a project.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.810
But you do want to work with
challenging constraints.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.830
So I think this quote
from Russian composer Igor

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.710
Stravinsky is useful.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.320
He said, the more
constraints one imposes,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.260
the more one frees oneself.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.520
And the arbitrariness
of the constraint

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.080
serves only to obtain
precision of execution.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.367
So this seems really strange.

00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:16.950
To kind of frame
this, let me give you

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.670
an example of a bad constraint
vs. A good constraint.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.760
A bad constraint
might be something

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.950
like, you have a
team of 50 designers,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.160
and you put this task
out to them and you say.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.230
create a classic
board game in VR

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.156
that feels exactly
like the original.

00:09:30.156 --> 00:09:32.280
The problem with this is
that it doesn't leave room

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.446
for creative interpretation.

00:09:33.446 --> 00:09:35.950
So if you give this
task to 50 designers,

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.881
you end up with 50
versions of checkers in VR.

00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:40.630
So let's turn this
into a good constraint.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.879
Let's say you understand
the strength of VR.

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:45.670
You want a game for
two players that really

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.490
leverages those strengths.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.090
So let's say, the players
have to face each other.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.000
That it shouldn't just
be a tabletop game.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
That you want the
playing space to exist

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.160
between the players
in such a way

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.890
that both players can
interact with that space.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.000
And finally, it
should be a game space

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.590
that would be impossible
to create in real life.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.924
Now these are constraints
where there's an enormous room

00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:10.090
for creative interpretation.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.280
And I promise you that if
you give this task to 50

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.696
different developers,
you're going

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:18.010
to get 50 different totally
awesome and unique games.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.690
Step two is ranking those ideas.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.980
So just because you're
pursuing a lot of ideas

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.980
doesn't mean you can just skip
the process of filtering them.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.480
And to give you an
example of this,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.813
even though my team has created
more than 60 prototypes,

00:10:28.813 --> 00:10:32.340
we've got way more than 100 in
the queue waiting to be done.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.800
And at this point,
in fact, ideas

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.460
are coming in to
us from other teams

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.640
faster than we can process them.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.340
So you need some
way of choosing what

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.090
the most promising ideas are.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.110
To do this, we pick
a set of criteria

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.060
that helps us evaluate and
stack rank all of those ideas.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.260
Now your team might have
a totally different set

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:49.899
of criteria.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.690
But these are some
examples of ones that we

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.240
found have been useful for us.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.680
First of all, try to think of
ideas that are better or maybe

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.680
even only possible
in virtual reality,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.100
ideally something that's
never been done before,

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.921
something that has potential
for real wow factor,

00:11:05.921 --> 00:11:07.670
something that's a
good fit for your team.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.128
And what's a good
fit for your team

00:11:09.128 --> 00:11:11.540
isn't necessarily a good
fit for every other team.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.050
What are you passionate about?

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.240
What are your skills
that you can leverage

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.530
to make a great VR experience?

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.730
Pick something you can
scope for a one week sprint.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.385
And if the idea seems too
big, think really strongly

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:24.510
about what's your hypothesis
that you want to test?

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.040
How can you pare that big
idea down into something

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.804
a little bit more atomic?

00:11:28.804 --> 00:11:30.720
Finally, this isn't going
to be for everybody.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.680
But for us, we're
looking at ideas

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.690
that are more than just
pure entertainment.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.492
We know-- for those of you
who are in the game industry,

00:11:37.492 --> 00:11:39.200
you guys are going to
make awesome stuff.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.150
We know that for sure.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.180
But we are kind of interested
in education and productivity.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.360
We think that there are
a lot of areas in VR

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.210
that are just not
even touched yet,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.890
lots of room for opportunity.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.920
So this takes us to step
three, implementation.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.797
This is kind of the meat
of the product here.

00:11:55.797 --> 00:11:58.005
And as I mentioned before
aim is for each team of two

00:11:58.005 --> 00:11:59.470
to finish a prototype in a week.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.060
But those prototypes
aren't going

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.810
to be useful if we don't go on
to steps four and five, which

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.540
are sharing in documentation.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.740
And that takes time too.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.560
So realistically we've got
like three to four days at most

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.370
to spend on implementation.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.150
And we're doing this
week after week.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.190
So we hear this a lot and I am
going to be perfectly honest.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.140
I was the guy who is really
pushing for these one week

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.410
turnaround things partly
because I love game jams.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.650
But I was worried.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.560
I knew that this was
going to be a problem.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.640
So let's put this
in perspective.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.900
Who here has ever attended a
game jam or a hackathon before?

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.590
That is a really good
number, more than I expected.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.494
So an on site game jam
usually last 48 hours.

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:43.910
And if you're not familiar
with them, if you haven't been,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.010
they are a totally
amazing experience.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.400
They let you take a break
from your regular work

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.570
and create a playable,
complete game in a weekend.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.080
And this is super empowering.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.870
It's like a total
palate cleanser.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.280
So I have attended
about a dozen game jams.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.390
And I'm often teamed up
with people who have never

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.000
made games before, of
varying levels of experience,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.260
and I have always had a working
game at the end of two days.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.246
So for prototyping,
you need to think

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:12.620
about targeting the same scope
that you would think about

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.620
for a game jam, something
that you could do in two days.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.740
When you take that scope
and you stretch it out

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.760
over five days, all of a sudden
it doesn't feel so daunting

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.260
anymore.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.330
It seems a little
bit more realistic.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.290
Now the other thing is
that, in the old days,

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.145
like three five years ago,
we didn't have amazing game

00:13:28.145 --> 00:13:30.270
engines that are super
accessible, and easy to use,

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:30.896
and cheap.

00:13:30.896 --> 00:13:32.520
So it was really hard
to get your hands

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.080
on something that would let
you get a good head start.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.510
So when I would go to game
jams, I had to make games from

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.720
scratch like from C++ or C#.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.870
We had a scope much smaller.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.866
So today, we have these
amazing game engines that

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:46.990
accelerate the development.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.910
We can do a lot more
in a lot less time.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.810
Also, each of these game
engines has an asset store,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.460
which is an amazing place
for quick placeholder art.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.220
And some of the
stuff is really good.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.290
So like, let's say I
need my dinosaur model

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.210
for my trebuchet
stuffed animal fetching

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.990
game, boom, like $2,
five-starred, modeled,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.410
textured, skinned,
animated, everything.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.690
You still have to be careful.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.072
Knowing that you have all
these things at your hands

00:14:15.072 --> 00:14:17.030
doesn't mean that you
can get overly ambitious.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.130
You still need to keep it small.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.440
Think about what the absolute
minimum is that you need

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.680
to do to test your hypothesis.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.550
So some of you, especially who
are from around Silicon Valley,

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.990
are thinking, OK I got it.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.750
MVP, minimum viable product,
I know what I need to create.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.900
Smaller, like way smaller, than
your minimum viable product,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.760
you want an experience
that's just enough that you

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.710
can walk another user through
them while you're escorting

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.605
them and say, don't
press that button

00:14:43.605 --> 00:14:45.230
because it's going
to break everything.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.030
That's OK.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.280
It's enough to test
your hypothesis.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.450
So another thing to be
wary of is nerd sniping.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.770
I borrowed this term, nerd
sniping from an xkcd comic.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.980
If you don't know it, I
recommend you look it up.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.521
It's what happens when you're
presented with a problem that's

00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:04.490
just too fun and interesting
for your brain to say no.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.220
On one hand, your desire
to tackle these problems

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.810
is what makes you a great
designer or engineer.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.470
On the other hand,
the problem comes

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.380
when these fun interesting
sub-problems that

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.700
aren't really essential pull you
away from your core objective.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.200
So if you've already
been completely

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.491
distracted by this slide up
here, then congratulations.

00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:24.299
You've been nerds sniped.

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:26.840
And if you're thinking about
how you might design a framework

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.670
to solve general problems
of this category,

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:35.070
Google.com/careers.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.775
So let me give you a realistic
example of nerd sniping.

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:39.900
Let's say you're filling
a world with a huge number

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.710
of random objects.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.320
And so what you're doing is
you're randomly coloring them

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.510
just by picking like a
random red, a random green,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.470
a random blue.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.960
Got your RGB color.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.550
And then you think, you know,
this is kind of ugly actually.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.000
And by applying just a
little bit of color theory,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.472
I can make colors that
are visually distinct,

00:15:56.472 --> 00:15:58.180
but that look good in
a palette together.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.560
You know, how much time
could that possibly take?

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.820
And the answer is,
it doesn't matter.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.560
This is just distraction from
your core objective, which

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.810
is testing some other
hypothesis that has nothing

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.630
to do with color theory.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.670
When you graduate that idea
from your one-week prototype

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.100
into a full fledged
product, then you

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.000
can talk about those
sorts of features.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.458
And Michael's going to talk
about that process a little bit

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.190
later.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.440
And if you're still wondering
about this nerd sniping,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.564
and you've been obsessing
over this the whole time.

00:16:24.564 --> 00:16:27.340
The answer is 14 seconds.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.680
So the next step is sharing.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.565
There is no sense in
building prototypes

00:16:31.565 --> 00:16:32.940
that nobody else
is going to see,

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.606
which is why we're
so excited to finally

00:16:34.606 --> 00:16:37.260
be sharing so many of
these prototypes with you

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.180
here at Google I/O.
And what you need

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.570
to do is have sharing
built into your schedule.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.550
So what we do is have what we
call a demo party every Monday

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.950
afternoon, where we invite
our team members to come by

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:49.230
and check out what we've done.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.530
We also invite everyone
who attends these demo

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.530
parties to leave at
least one sticky note

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.794
that says something they
hate, something they love,

00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:58.210
some feature that this makes
them think of that they would

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.060
like to see in the future.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.601
Doesn't really matter
as long as they

00:17:00.601 --> 00:17:01.950
give some piece of feedback.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.690
Also, these live
demos have really

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.980
helped validate the whole
prototyping process.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.339
Having these small prototypes
doesn't just ease development.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.040
These little
bite-size prototypes

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.210
also seem to get the most
useful feedback, which

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.540
has been interesting.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.430
So this is a quote from one
of the members of my team.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.339
He said, you build the
tip of the iceberg,

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.300
and people will come to
you and describe the rest.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.240
And here's what we're finding
is that, if you show users

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.060
a polished product, the
feedback on that product

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.930
focuses on things
like subtleties

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.390
of an animation or the color
palette that you've used.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.630
They focus on the polish
of the product itself.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.860
Whereas, when you give them
something that's clearly

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.940
a prototype, a work in
progress, or a vertical slice,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.940
users tend to give
high level feedback.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.360
They talk to you about features.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.240
It seems like something that's
more malleable in their minds.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.090
And so they give
feedback related to that.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.847
You can also think
of these prototypes

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:55.680
from the perspective
of diminishing returns.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.510
Maybe in a week you
can create something

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.464
that feels like it's
maybe like 80% complete.

00:18:00.464 --> 00:18:02.130
If you spent another
week on that thing,

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.610
it might feel more
like 90% complete.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.580
And we find that having twice
as many 80% complete prototypes

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.640
gives us a lot more
information than those 90%

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.620
complete prototypes.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.180
All right, documentation--
I know it's not a fun word

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.380
to see on a slide.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.810
But it's a really important
step in the process.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.720
Because if you don't
document what you've learned,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.120
again, it's really hard
for you to have an impact

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.330
with these prototypes.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.080
Now, you don't want to get
bogged down with documentation

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.454
at the very start
of the process,

00:18:31.454 --> 00:18:33.410
like with a heavy
handed design document.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.812
But if you're not
documenting at the end,

00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:37.770
all these things are just
going into the ether.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.940
You need for these projects
to have impact and results.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.230
So for each prototype, we
capture a 30 second video.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.880
We make a short animated GIF.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.117
We summarize our
findings that came to us

00:18:48.117 --> 00:18:49.200
on all these sticky notes.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.752
We send that out on email.

00:18:50.752 --> 00:18:53.210
And some of these prototypes
are more fruitful than others.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.680
But we have never
had a prototype

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.000
where we didn't learn anything.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.480
In fact, sometimes
our findings are

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.200
completely unrelated
to the thing

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.680
that we thought we were testing.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.120
So I've got to admit it.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.110
I lied a little bit.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.230
I gave you this really nice
clean five step process

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.540
that you can follow,
which looks nothing

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.390
like the reality of what we do.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.270
What we do is way messier.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.560
So while we do, in fact, try to
have a demo party every Monday.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.040
There's no real clear boundary
from where one process ends

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.410
and the next process begins.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.647
At any given time we're wrapping
up ideas on a previous project.

00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:26.980
We're working on a next project.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.680
And we're thinking about
ideas for future projects.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.930
So I want to give you a
little bit more realistic peek

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.810
into what the process
actually looks like.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.850
So this is a week in
the life of the Daydream

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.600
team making Daydream Labs.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.070
So we start on Monday.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.899
For the previous week's party,
or previous weeks project,

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:46.440
we're having our demo party to
show off the prototype of what

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.220
we've made.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.990
We're capturing
the video of that,

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.280
maybe with some users
interacting with it,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.440
zipping up the project
for sharing the code

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.801
or sharing the build.

00:19:54.801 --> 00:19:56.300
For the current
week's project then,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.780
we're selecting a new idea.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.160
We're restricting its scope.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.510
We're looking at our various
tech options, implementation

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.127
options, what hardware
we're going to implement on.

00:20:05.127 --> 00:20:06.960
For the three days in
the middle of our work

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.380
week, we are still
summarizing and sharing

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.600
the findings from
the previous project.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.837
For this week's project we get
our first prototype working.

00:20:14.837 --> 00:20:15.670
And then we rethink.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.220
Like maybe we're going
about it the wrong way.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.510
Maybe we're testing
the wrong thing.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.650
Maybe we need to be asking
different questions.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.700
So we recalibrate.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.410
We rescope.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.826
We look at our
different features.

00:20:23.826 --> 00:20:25.212
We iterate on our core design.

00:20:25.212 --> 00:20:27.170
We're also spending this
time during the middle

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.680
of the week reaching out to
members from other teams.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.170
Because that's where a lot
of our ideas are coming from.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.760
Friday we're wrapping up the
project for the current week,

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.870
applying as much polish
as we have time for,

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.930
and narrowing down our list of
ideas for the following week.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.500
So with this schedule,
that basically

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.041
looks and feels like
a permanent game

00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:46.787
jam, which I think is awesome.

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:49.120
But you really have to think,
how do you prevent burnout

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.890
with this constantly jamming?

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.342
The first thing I've already
said, scope for two days

00:20:54.342 --> 00:20:55.550
and stretch that out to five.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.341
Remember that you're
not just implementing.

00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:00.200
You Also need to save time
for sharing, documenting,

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.350
and preparing for
future prototypes.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.930
But burnout can be caused by
other things like bureaucracy,

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.590
or fighting an uphill battle,
or having too many meetings.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.874
As much as possible, try
to structure your process

00:21:09.874 --> 00:21:11.540
so that these just
don't get in the way.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.550
And I'm not going to
pretend that this is easy.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:16.076
It will help if you can
block time in your calendar,

00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:17.450
thinking about
each of those five

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.770
distinct steps of the process.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.290
Some tips for
management, if you're

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.900
managing a team that's doing
this kind of prototyping,

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.150
there's a place for passion.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.750
And if your team is
really passionate

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.610
about a particular idea, even
if it seems like that idea

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:33.630
might not be the perfect fit for
the agenda that your after, let

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.860
them go with it.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.150
Passion can go a long way.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.900
Now there are other
dimensions of burnout,

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.000
like creative drought.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.180
We were really
worried about this.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.360
We thought we'd pick
all the low hanging

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.396
fruit in the first
month, and we'd be done.

00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:46.270
This totally hasn't
happened as it turns out.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.780
There are so many
ideas to pursue in VR.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.666
There is so much
unexplored territory.

00:21:51.666 --> 00:21:53.290
We started with a
lot of our own ideas.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.920
But like I mentioned,
other teams

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.310
keep coming to us with
new ideas all the time.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.130
And if this does
become a problem,

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.400
revisit those creative
exercises that I listed earlier.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.900
Ask other people for ideas.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.440
Try to constrain yourself
to think up ideas,

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.410
particularly in
unexplored spaces in VR.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.450
OK, so wow, 60 prototypes,
you probably want to know

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.480
when are you going to
see all these prototypes?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.570
I'm not going to tell you,
but only because there

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.650
was a talk earlier this morning
that showed the findings

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.566
from these prototypes.

00:22:21.566 --> 00:22:23.387
I've been told it's
already on YouTube.

00:22:23.387 --> 00:22:24.470
So go and search for that.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.300
The topic is called
"Daydream Labs, Lessons

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.532
Learned from VR Prototyping."

00:22:29.532 --> 00:22:31.240
And hopefully, just
looking through those

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.280
will really help
spark some big ideas.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.430
But for now, rather than
talking about findings,

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.790
were going to go back and
focus on the design process.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.310
I'd like to introduce
Michael to the stage.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.268
He's going to talk about
a completely different

00:22:41.268 --> 00:22:42.850
but parallel design process.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.095
So while my team is looking
at finding these gems

00:22:45.095 --> 00:22:46.800
and seeing what's
interesting in VR,

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.000
it's up to Michael's
team to take these ideas

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.830
and polish them into a robust,
beautiful, safe products.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:53.822
Michael.

00:22:53.822 --> 00:22:58.586
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:58.586 --> 00:22:59.960
MICHAEL ISHIGAKI:
Thank you, Rob.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.790
Hi, I'm Michael.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.111
I'm a designer and prototyper
on the Daydream team.

00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:06.610
As you might have learned in
earlier talks, designing for VR

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.140
is unlike designing
for any other platform.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.210
For starters, user
behavior is very different.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.100
For example, your smartphone
is largely an auxiliary device.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.147
It's best for short,
frequent user sessions.

00:23:19.147 --> 00:23:21.230
But for VR, we have been
observing session lengths

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.940
of more than 30 minutes,
with users spending even more

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.410
time in higher quality content.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.210
Furthermore, since
VR is immersive,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.975
use cases are very different.

00:23:30.975 --> 00:23:34.010
Snackable experiences are
much less attractive in VR.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.070
Premium experiences are king.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.690
The process Rob shared is
a great way of exploring

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.055
the strengths of
VR as a platform

00:23:42.055 --> 00:23:44.430
and will give you insights
into the users for whom you're

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.290
designing and the use
cases you're fulfilling.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.350
Using the gems and insights
gained from the Daydream Labs

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.490
process, how do we move forward
with designing a product

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.470
from sketches to launch?

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.960
I'll be giving
you an inside look

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.650
at how this process
worked for us as we

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.570
designed Daydream Home.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.890
Part of what makes designing
for VR so difficult

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.200
is that there are a multitude
of new job functions.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.850
And within each function,
there are many new skills.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.456
There are also a ton of
new design considerations.

00:24:12.456 --> 00:24:14.080
With all of these
factors and unknowns,

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.366
how do we progress forward
without getting stuck?

00:24:17.366 --> 00:24:18.990
While we were working
on Daydream Home,

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.570
we quickly realized
that the process

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.700
we were accustomed to following
simply wouldn't work for us.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.740
And like many others,
we first started out

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.570
trying to use the tools that
were familiar to us, Photoshop,

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.960
Sketch.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.160
However, when we finally
got our designs into VR,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.250
we realized that they
simply didn't work.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.240
They were flat.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.670
The scale was off.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.130
And the whole thing was a
little bit underwhelming.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.390
The new VR specific
design considerations

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.290
were much more impactful than
we had previously thought.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.510
And so we developed this
new process with a focus

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.040
on getting into VR as
quickly as possible.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.520
This new process
helped us design

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.730
VR first 3D user interfaces that
felt native for the platform.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.210
They were immediately more
inspiring than the UIs

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.300
that we are designing
with our past approach.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.750
And by getting into VR
sooner during the process,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.330
we were able to avoid
false positives.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.230
Issues with scale,
abstraction, and comfort

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.820
were easily avoided.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.730
For example, we
briefly considered

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.580
the idea of annotating
virtual objects with captions.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.420
If you mock this out in
2D, it works perfectly.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.120
But the second you
get it into VR,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.920
the whole idea
completely falls apart.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.550
So what do we mean by getting
into VR as quickly as possible?

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.230
Since VR project needs will
differ greatly from project

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.400
to project, I'll be sharing how
the process worked for our team

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.550
as we designed Daydream Home.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:40.630
Here's a rough diagram of the
Daydream Home design flow.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.860
This is in no way prescriptive.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.740
This process
unraveled organically

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.620
as needs changed from one
iteration to the next.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.480
And as you can see,
the process was flowing

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.920
from interaction design.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.480
When I say interaction
design, I include prototyping.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.750
The two are inseparable in VR.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.010
For other apps it
might not be the case

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.130
that interaction design
leads the design process.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.510
For example, some games
might be entirely driven

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.930
by environment design.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:07.540
But for us, the
different project

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.390
needs branched out
from the progress

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.850
that the interaction
design team was making.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.670
The process helped
us also develop

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.220
a really healthy,
positive feedback loop.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.980
Before we started jumping into
VR as quickly as possible,

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.360
we often found ourselves
stuck in meeting rooms arguing

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.220
about what is the
best design solution.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.090
We quickly found that you
cannot validate a design one way

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.240
or the other without
first prototyping it.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.710
So let's begin with the first
iteration of interaction

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.660
design.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.770
Knowing what users
we were designing for

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.680
and what use cases
we were targeting,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.390
we began our design
process much as we

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.000
would on web or mobile, with
information architecture

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.200
design.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.690
This gave us a
framework on which

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.350
to build, ensuring that our
work would meet product goals

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.580
and enable the end-to-end
flows that our users would

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.760
hope to accomplish.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.440
Next, we dive into the
lowest fidelity of our design

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.880
process, hand sketching.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.540
Hand sketching is the only 2D
stage of our UI design process.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.030
We first tried creating
mock ups with applications

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.050
like Photoshop.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.590
But we found it simply wasn't
worth the time and effort.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.780
Hand sketching is the easiest
way to draw out your 3D ideas.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.030
It's also the easiest way
to share with your teammates

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.300
what's in your imagination
and to add on and build off

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.400
of each other sketches.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.692
Our next stage is what we
call volumetric layouting.

00:27:21.692 --> 00:27:23.400
In this stage we pull
up our game engine,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.840
and we start placing and scaling
primitive objects like cubes

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.770
to roughly match our
favorite hand sketches.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:31.460
While we do this,
we repeatedly check

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.660
to see what it looks like in VR.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.050
During this stage,
we get a sense

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.150
of how our design
plays out spatially.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.430
We can score, validate, and
build off of our sketches

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.510
with a better sense of scale,
eye travel, head movement

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.720
and more.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.500
We instantly start
getting more ideas

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.610
about how we can design in more
exciting ways that are only

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.830
possible in VR.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.580
With a very rough layout, we
start adding in UI objects

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.680
like text, images, and
interactive elements.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.030
We're careful to keep
viewing our work in VR

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.360
so that we can properly
validate our design.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.000
For example, this image
is just a flat render

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.530
of the volumetric layout.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.590
In VR the layout has a
very nice looking depth.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.730
But VR also has a
much smaller field

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.990
of view and
significant distortion.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.880
It looks something a
little bit more like this.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.490
In this case, we find that we
have overestimated the screen

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.660
capabilities of the device.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.920
These discovery posters
don't afford enough space

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.180
for legible text.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.830
If we designed this
in 2D, we would

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.187
have never caught these issues.

00:28:30.187 --> 00:28:32.020
Attempting to solve
this, we experiment more

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.030
with positioning in zSpace.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.340
Orienting the contents of
the UI around a cylinder

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.700
help keep text legible,
reduce distortion,

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.730
and add interest to the design.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.010
While this wasn't enough
to fix our text issues,

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.680
it's a great example of how
a VR-first design process can

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.940
be a valuable asset.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.370
So in our next iteration
of volumetric layouting,

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.040
we increased legibility
and decreased the size

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.060
of the UI significantly.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.110
Large UIs in VR can feel
uncomfortably claustrophobic.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.760
And if a UI takes up too
much of your field of view,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.900
your eyes and head have
to travel too much to see

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.597
the various components of it.

00:29:07.597 --> 00:29:09.430
These are all issues
that can only be caught

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.630
when seeing your UI in VR.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.664
Volumetric layouting is a
quick way of catching these.

00:29:14.664 --> 00:29:16.580
And as we progress through
our design process,

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.539
we begin adding in higher
fidelity filler content.

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:22.080
Things look good to
us at this point,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.538
but we have questions
that can only

00:29:23.538 --> 00:29:25.580
be answered with user testing.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.290
Meanwhile, our
environment designer

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.490
begins his work in parallel
while we do user studies.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.080
Will users understand what
the discovery windows are?

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.244
Will they understand
what the app icons are?

00:29:36.244 --> 00:29:38.410
Do they expect to be able
to scroll either of these?

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.920
And if so, how do
they think they

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.770
can scroll with the controller?

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.810
We do a user study to
answer these questions.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:47.340
The first round of
research goes positively.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.180
Users understand what
discovery posters are

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.280
and what app icons are.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.250
But there is a little bit of
confusion about scrolling.

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:54.444
We've validated our layout.

00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:56.610
And we've become more aware
of the design challenges

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.590
that we have ahead of us.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.820
Our environment designer
then gives us a first draft

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.790
of the environment.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.706
We incorporate this draft into
our UI as quickly as possible.

00:30:06.706 --> 00:30:08.580
This way we can be
intentional when designing

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.620
our UI within the environment.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.932
Our team feels comfortable
moving forward.

00:30:13.932 --> 00:30:15.640
Now that we know the
dimensions that we'd

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.610
like for our discovery
posters and icons,

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.070
we deep dive into them.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:22.790
In parallel, we start
engaging with 3D modeling.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.290
Now that the basics
are locked down,

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:27.130
we begin looking for
moments of user delight.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.670
One of these moments is
the discovery posters.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.660
What if these posters
were less like posters

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.770
and more like Windows
into different worlds?

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:38.000
It could be a magical way of
discovering new VR content.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.110
To dive into this
area we branch it off

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.890
and we prototype it using what's
called a stencil shader, which

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.950
is like a revealing mask in an
omnidirectional stereo image.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.770
An omnidirectional stereo
image, or ODS for short,

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.340
is a stereo panorama that's
mapped onto a sphere.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.120
It is one of a
few different ways

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.670
of representing a 360
degree three photo in VR.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.290
Now it's very important to
carry all of your design ideas

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.780
through to the prototyping
stage for accurate validation.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.410
When we prototyped this
idea, we were underwhelmed.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:13.060
The stereo was actually very
hard to detect in the ODS

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.250
through the discovery window.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.660
And worst of all, it used up
a tremendous amount of memory.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.320
Viewing the windows
side by side also

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.440
gave the strange effect
of three deep tunnels

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.340
into three different worlds.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.190
And to add onto all
of that, these images

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.090
are a significant investment
for developers to create.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.490
So we took another
look at this idea.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.940
This time designing with
performance as a primary design

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.330
goal and adding in the
additional requirement

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.930
of elegantly flattening the
world within the window when

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.260
the window wasn't in use.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.840
We then investigated ways
of achieving this design

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.800
goal without an ODS.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.960
We decided to prototype a system
of layers of flat textures

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.437
that could easily be created
by developers in Photoshop.

00:31:53.437 --> 00:31:55.020
These layers were
much more performant

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.580
than the huge ODS images
we were using before.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.170
And the depth effect could both
be exaggerated and completely

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.660
flattened when not in use.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.930
After we prototyped this
idea we really liked it.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:08.700
We improved the prototype by
conservatively exaggerating

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.180
the parallax effect.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.990
Parallax is one of the
cues that the brain

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:13.790
uses to perceive depth.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.880
The result is a truly magical
experience to see in VR.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.880
We found a great solution
that people seem to love.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.120
If we didn't consider
prototyping a first class

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.830
tool in our toolkit,
this feature

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:27.427
would have never
been made a reality.

00:32:27.427 --> 00:32:29.510
Along the way we've continued
to make improvements

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.477
in our environment, transitions,
interactivity, and 3D models.

00:32:33.477 --> 00:32:35.060
At this point in the
process, we begin

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.929
supporting the engineering
team with assets

00:32:36.929 --> 00:32:38.970
and working with them to
find the minimum texture

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:43.100
sizes we can use while still
retaining a good looking UI.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.050
We begin engaging
our motion designer,

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.610
as we start iterating
on our animations.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.430
Working collaboratively
with the desire

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.310
to tie our UI to
our environment,

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.640
we develop a wind
metaphor for motion

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.720
that touches our UI environment
and animation together

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.360
with a common theme.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.090
By working in parallel, we're
able to improve collaboration

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.020
across different
skill categories.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.730
And as we continue to polish,
we progress through our UI,

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.020
doing deep dives in
these various elements.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.070
We push ourselves to
utilize the benefits

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.130
of having a rich 3D UI
and a rich 3D system

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.300
with lighting and materials.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.720
This is especially apparent
as we design the hover effect

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.110
for icons.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:22.600
And as the motion design and
interactivity come to life,

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.762
sound design begins in parallel.

00:33:24.762 --> 00:33:26.220
And while we can't
emphasize enough

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.197
how important sound
design is for VR,

00:33:28.197 --> 00:33:29.780
it began toward the
end of our process

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.029
so that our sound designer
could have accurate timings

00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:33.340
for our animations.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.250
To learn more about sound in VR,
check out the talk on spatial

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.210
audio tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:42.880
And surely enough, we come
toward our refined design.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.290
This VR firs process enabled
us to progress quickly.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.980
The process was
very collaborative

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.420
and used every single skill
set that we mentioned earlier

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.670
along the way.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:55.160
By making progress across
multiple fronts per iteration,

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.020
we were able to march
toward refinement

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.710
without getting stuck.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.760
We understand our
specific workflow won't

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.450
be applicable to all apps.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.340
But we hope you find
the process we've shared

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.620
serves as a powerful
tool to design

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.400
in this new field
of many unknowns.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.840
I hope that the two processes
that Rob and I shared

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.520
will be useful for your team.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.920
But a more fundamental
challenge still remains.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.664
How do you build that team?

00:34:18.664 --> 00:34:20.830
To talk more about that,
I'd like to invite Anshuman

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:21.419
to the stage.

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:22.562
Anshuman.

00:34:22.562 --> 00:34:24.020
ANSHUMAN KUMAR:
Thank you, Michael.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:28.199
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:31.130
You know, designing the Daydream
Home experience with Michael

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.280
and several other really
talented designers

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.380
was an intense
collaborative effort.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.870
And I'm really happy that
we could share our design

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.991
process with you.

00:34:39.991 --> 00:34:41.699
And you could see how
different designers

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.440
came together and
worked together

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.780
to create that experience.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.159
Now as you start building
your own VR experiences

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.739
from your rough ideas
to finished products,

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:55.480
one thing you will need for
sure is a strong design team.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.130
My name is Anshuman Kumar,
and I'm a design lead

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.040
on the Daydream team.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.320
And I'm going to be talking
about building VR design teams.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.330
And for the designers
in the audience

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.500
and those watching
it online, if you

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.507
want to start designing for VR,
towards the end of my session,

00:35:10.507 --> 00:35:12.090
I'm going to be
sharing some tips that

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.490
will help you get started.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.080
So with that, let's get rolling.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.310
Building a team is not very
different from building

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.880
a product.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.430
You have to start with
a thoughtful intention.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.170
What kind of team do I want?

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.020
What do I want my
team to achieve?

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.610
And when it comes to
building VR design teams,

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:31.185
we often struggle with these
basic fundamental questions.

00:35:31.185 --> 00:35:34.330
Partially, because a
lot of us are new to VR.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.630
But primarily because
designing for VR

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:40.650
is significantly different from
designing for other mediums.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.680
Unlike web or mobile, where
we used to spend a lot of time

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.370
designing flat
UIs, for VR we have

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.160
to design a world with
environments, lights,

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.950
and sound, shadows, and motion.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:55.760
UI is just one a
component of that world.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.650
Designing this world
requires new design skills,

00:35:58.650 --> 00:35:59.440
different tools.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.870
It needs more time.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.760
And then we have to adapt
our processes and workflows

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.540
as a technology rapidly evolves.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.890
All the factors combined
demand a VR design team

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.670
that's different and unique,

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.220
Well successful VR design teams
have three unique attributes.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:20.000
Number one, designers
wear multiple hats.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.020
No one in such teams is just
an interaction designer or just

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.470
a 3D artist.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.530
Instead you will find
an interaction designer

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:30.270
who is also good at
3D, or a prototyper

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.590
but who has a keen
eye for motion.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.880
Personally as a
designer, even though it

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.670
might sound intimidating,
wearing multiple hats

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:42.090
is what makes designing
for VR so much fun.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.260
Then VR design teams a
highly collaborative.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.890
Every advancement
in VR technology

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.010
is opening doors to
endless possibilities

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.210
of new interactions
and experiences.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:57.060
And the only way to explore
them at speed and scale

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.630
is to work together, by sharing
and learning from each other.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.100
And as Rob mentioned
earlier, his team

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.370
explored new ideas every
week by working together

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.560
in small teams,
focusing on the problem,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.250
and then sharing their learnings
with the rest of the team

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.900
in their demo parties.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.430
And finally, successful
VR design teams,

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:19.010
even though they celebrate
diversity amongst their team

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:23.070
members, they somehow
don't let the roles

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.690
get in the way of
getting things done.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.070
It's very rare to hear
that, I don't this.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.940
This is someone else's job.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.050
Designers are very willing to
get out of their comfort zone

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.300
and take on new challenges.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.710
But what are these skills
that I'm talking about?

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.390
What kind of skills are actually
needed in a VR design team?

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:45.280
A VR design team
requires diverse skills.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.370
And depending on the product
that you are building,

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.430
these skills might
change a little bit.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.870
But typically a
design team, which

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:56.760
is building VR interfaces,
require these skills.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.970
Now a word of caution,
some of these skills

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.750
might look very familiar,
but the applications

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:02.980
are quite different.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.590
For example, while
designing interactions,

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.520
one has to additionally
consider spatial organization

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.980
and hierarchy and
use game engines

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.680
to create volumetric layouts.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.960
For visual design, the
concepts of grid and typography

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.000
completely change as things are
layered in different z-depths.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.090
Now I do understand
that, if you're

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.060
starting to build
a new team, this

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.520
might seem like a lot
of skills to find.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.080
So in that case, I would
suggest you to start

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.520
with at least two designers.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.010
This will help them collaborate,
bounce ideas off of each other,

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.960
providing each other feedback
and solve problem faster

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.304
when one of them gets stuck.

00:38:39.304 --> 00:38:40.970
Between these designers,
you should have

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.020
at least these three skills.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.760
If you recall the process
diagram that Michael shared,

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.170
3D design prototyping
and interaction design

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.920
were the fundamental skills.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.950
And frankly, you
can't accomplish much

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.350
without these
fundamental skills.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.410
Other skills can be included at
different phases of the project

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.510
as the need arises.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.650
Now you might be
wondering where are

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.730
these are designers who
have multiple skills

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.900
and could juggle
with different hats.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.304
Well, they're around you.

00:39:09.304 --> 00:39:11.720
There's a good chance that you
might find a designer who's

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.430
already designing VR experiences
and has these multiple skills.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.270
If that happens, that's awesome.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.580
But if it doesn't, then
you have to branch out

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:24.150
and look our and scout
other design industries.

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:26.870
We have noticed that
designers building games

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:28.470
have great previous skills.

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:31.390
They also have the experience
of finding creative solutions

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:34.410
to the strict performance
requirements of VR.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.680
VFX designers are awesome
at making things feel larger

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.830
than life.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.450
If they have experience
with realtime graphics

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.030
and some exposure
to VR, they can be

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.460
of great value for your team.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.580
For designers from
web and mobile,

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.660
designing information
and creating

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.790
fine and meaningful interaction
is their bread and butter.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:58.000
If they additionally have
3D skills or VR prototyping

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.840
skills, they can be great
assets for your team.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.230
And don't forget,
there are a lot

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.480
of students who are working on
VR projects and design programs

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.140
across the world.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.060
A thorough VR project
done at school

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.220
can give a student
enough domain experience

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.200
to start working
on a real product.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.140
So if you can guide
them, they can be

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.820
a great addition to your team.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.590
But these are all industries.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.690
Where do you actually go
to find these designers?

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.340
Well, I would say start with
maker events like game jams

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.250
and VR jams.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:33.020
There is nothing better
than seeing the designers

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.202
in their element.

00:40:34.202 --> 00:40:35.910
And if you get a chance
to jam with them,

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.490
work with them on an idea.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:42.370
You can think of it like
speed dating in certain ways.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.120
In this process, you
will learn a lot more

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.290
about these designers
than you will ever

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:50.000
learn through regular
formal interviews.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.930
There is also a good chance
that you can find such talent

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.550
at conferences like this one
and other tech events that

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.300
happen all around the globe.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.200
The fact that you're
here, all of you,

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.070
means that you share a common
passion and common interest.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.870
And who knows, someone sitting
under this geodesic dome

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:10.840
could be a future colleague.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.570
And lastly, social media can
be surprisingly effective.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:17.480
But you need to go beyond
the obvious mediums.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.770
Imagine watching someone on
YouTube who is passionately

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.660
presenting their VR demos.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.330
Or Twitch, a lot
of designers have

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.480
started using Twitch
to live broadcast

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.860
their creative process.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.200
Watching a designer walk
you through their process

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.960
of creating beautiful
VR environments,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.170
it will not only inform
you about the subject,

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.720
but will also help you find a
great designer for your team.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.950
And of course,
following people's work

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:46.380
and honest opinions
on Reddit and Twitter

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.850
can definitely reveal a lot
about their passion and domain

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.580
knowledge.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:56.000
So for those of you who
are building design teams,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.140
here are some tips of
finding promising candidates.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.570
And those of you
who are designers

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:03.940
who want to join this team,
this is a good example

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.570
of what these design leaders
would be looking for.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.910
So as a design
leader, you would come

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:11.390
across stunning portfolios,
beautiful renderings,

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:13.040
and impressive language.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.480
And all that is important.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.510
But you will additionally need
to look for a few other things.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:22.390
One, has the person
made anything in VR?

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.370
And I'm not talking about
a major project or years

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.970
of industry experience.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.830
I'm talking about are
they tinkering in VR?

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.640
Are making fun little small
demos in their free time

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.170
after their day job?

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.300
This is very important.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:39.090
Because if the answer is
no, then for a designer,

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.260
learning new tools and
working with new technology

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.150
can be very stressful.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:50.210
And even as the team leader, it
will become difficult for you

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:55.790
to be helpful in transitioning
this designer as a VR designer.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:58.850
And then diverse skill
sets, we have already

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.950
talked about the importance of
having multiple design skills,

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:05.980
as a designer can wear multiple
hats when the need arises.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.800
And it requires true
passion to continue

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.390
learning new things every
day and taking initiatives

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.760
to explore new possibilities
that are created.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.160
Now, if you find a
designer with these skills,

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.730
I'll say act fast
and be flexible.

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:25.240
And in a few days from now, if
you forget everything I said,

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.250
just remember these four things.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:31.130
Build a culture where skills
are valued more than roles.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.300
Build a culture which
encourages teams to share

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.010
and learn from each other.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.910
Keep an open mind
for fresh talent,

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:40.000
and you will be
pleasantly surprised.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.040
And cast a wide net so
that you can get new talent

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.700
and build a more diverse team.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.530
And then, for some
reason, if you

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.730
don't want to build
a full blown team,

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.122
then consider involving
a design studio.

00:43:53.122 --> 00:43:55.330
There are several design
studios across the world who

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:56.935
are making great VR content.

00:43:56.935 --> 00:43:58.560
And if you want to
know more about this

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.080
you can find me after this talk.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.270
And I really hope that
this information helps

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:06.000
you answer the question that we
started with, what kind of team

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.400
do I want to build?

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.370
I also hope that this
information helps you

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:13.210
build that strong design team.

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:16.520
Now this brings me to the
last part of my presentation

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.660
where I promise to share some
advice for designers who are

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.480
interested in designing for VR.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.120
So I have two tips
and won advice.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.700
Tip number one, learn
from your own experiences.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.620
If you are new to
VR, get a cardboard,

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.380
throw your phone in, try out
as many VR apps as you can.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.420
Keep a journal of
your observations.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.370
Gradually you'll start
developing an eye

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.290
for the nuances of VR.

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:43.150
You'll start identifying what
works, what doesn't work.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:45.540
And if you start feeling
that urge to make things,

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.550
then follow the second tip,
which is learn the tools.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.120
As a VR designer you might
need to learn these three

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.090
categories of tools.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.790
And if you're a designer, you
only already know one of these.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:56.760
You need to focus on
the remaining two.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.100
I would recommend you to
start with a gaming engine.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.240
Both Unity and Unreal are free.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.090
And they are tons
of online material

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:05.891
that can help you get started.

00:45:05.891 --> 00:45:07.890
You know, it's very
important to get comfortable

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.760
with these tools,
because this will

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.570
let you focus your mind space
on what to create and not on

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.940
how to create.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.580
And lastly I'll be honest.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.660
You know the learning
curve is steep.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.010
You will need to be really
passionate about VR are

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.730
and persistent to get
over this learning. curve.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:28.250
One thing that helps is being
part of the VR community.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.830
It can give you enough
support and inspiration

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.350
to help you keep climbing
up this learning curve.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.320
And, hey, it might look
like a tough climb.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.930
But the rewards come
very early and they are

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.120
very satisfying and fulfilling.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.190
So don't give up.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:45.300
With this, I'd like to
conclude this session where we

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.820
talked about process and team.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:51.080
And everyone, I
feel, in this room

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.180
is going to be a pioneer
in VR as we start working

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.010
and continue contributing
to this domain.

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:02.580
And we are really glad that you
have joined us on this journey.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.100
Thank you so much.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.550
