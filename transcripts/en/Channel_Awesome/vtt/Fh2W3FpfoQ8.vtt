00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.059
Hellooo, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to! I don't know if you've noticed,

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.788
but Hollywood has been out of ideas for a while.

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:14.540
(Sarcastically) Noooooooooo!

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.980
Okay. You've all noticed, but this can be a good thing and a bad thing.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.260
I did a whole editorial about this before, but that's not exactly what I'm gonna focus on here today.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.240
Today I'm going to focus on a subject matter that for the most part has still been making a fair amount of money. The remake.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.508
Remakes are nothing new. Literally. Since the dawn of cinema, remakes have been very constant- particularly when movies went from silent to sound.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.489
Hell, some of the same directors came back to redirect a timeless classic to create another

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.720
timeless classic. Good thing internet blogs weren't around back then. "Remake '10 Commandments'? HA!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.280
Next you'll want to do an animated version with Jeff Goldblum!"

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400
And somehow it'll actually work...

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.840
So I'm certainly not going to be a purist and say a remake should never happen.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.399
Some of the best films ever made are remakes, improving on the original while still staying faithful, and yet also keeping a unique identity.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.560
But needless to say, this is often difficult and very rare- hence a lot of the crap we've been getting.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.749
Disney, once the imagineers of bringing classic stories to life, are trying to make classic stories out of their classic stories out of classic stories!

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.970
It's getting a little carried away.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.020
So we naturally need to ask ourselves, "When should remakes stop?"

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.100
Well, I guess the best way to answer that is to figure out when remakes should happen.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.920
(Cha-ching) Okay, we all know what Hollywood thinks, but for the sake of good storytelling, I think we can break it down to three factors.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.349
Number one, the most obvious, is if it can be made better. A film can be good, even

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.149
groundbreaking, but still be either dated or not fully explored. Some remakes have become so classic that many people don't even realize they're remakes.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.859
"Scarface", "Fistful of Dollars", "True Lies"; all based on movies that existed,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.090
but the remakes did it so much better that they don't even realize there's an original.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.479
I'm honestly surprised there aren't more remakes of bad films.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.349
It's been rumored for a while that "Drop Dead Fred" was gonna get a remake.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.380
Good! The original sucks!

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.019
The idea of an imaginary friend taking over your mind as an adult, though, is actually kind of a cool idea.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.350
I'd love to see this concept explored and done a lot better than this.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.399
People ask me if I'm against the idea of "Garbage Pail Kids" being remade.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.190
Why the hell would I?

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.820
The original is the WORST film I have seen in my life. The cards deserve better! Remake the shit out of it!

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.169
Hell, it can't get any worse. Heck. Is there a "Batman and Robin" remake in the near future?

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.800
It'd be nice to see Mr. Freeze done right. Though if he's anything like what they're doing with the Joker...

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.959
Oh, don't make me choose which one is worse!

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.810
But okay, we get the idea. If something could be improved on, improve on it. If it's broke,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.350
don't fix it. Make another one from scratch. It's safe to say as long as the original still exists (*cough* LUCAS) another version

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.680
is not an unwelcomed idea, which brings me to the second reason to do a remake;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.980
expanding on a concept.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.529
Now this is different than just making something better.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.380
It's taking one element of the original idea and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.540
exploring it more. In fact, a franchise that did this both a good way and a bad way is "Planet of the Apes".

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.360
Tim Burton is one of the most famous directors that coined the phrase,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.340
"reimagining". He said he didn't want to improve on the original film, he just wanted to take in a different direction.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.349
It just so happened that direction sucked.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.969
Years later, another "Planet of the Apes" film would come along with a similar thought.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.419
Apes ruling the planet. However, this focused more on how it

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.820
happened, similar to how some of the later Apes films went, and now it seems to be going in a new direction

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.660
that seems entirely its own. "King Kong" has been remade tons of times. In the Peter Jackson version,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.680
it's still the same story,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.530
but more time is dedicated to giving Kong and our heroine more time together, creating a stronger connection.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.239
"12 Monkeys" was originally a half hour Sci-Fi film shown only in still pictures,

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.578
but that blossomed into a motion filled,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.860
apocalyptic future that took elements from the film and expanded on it, and some of these tie-in to the number three reason to do a remake;

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.380
creating a whole new experience.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.389
Whether it's a different point of view, a new culture, or even a new time period, as long as the identity of the film seems

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.689
unique despite it having origins from another source, it can work.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.919
"Magnificent 7" is famously a remake of "Seven Samurai". Both have the same plot, but are set in different time periods and locations.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.610
Films like"The Ring",

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:38.039
"Birdcage", and "The Departed" are all remakes of foreign classics, telling these great stories in different cultures shows both the differences and the similarities

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.288
between the two, making it interesting what they have to change and what they have to keep the same.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.889
Okay, so we have three reasons when remakes should be done,

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.609
I guess when they shouldn't be done is the opposite reasons.

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.889
If a remake needs to stand out,

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.989
then logically the first sign not to do a remake is when people can't separate it from the original.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.840
I get a feeling a lot of the Ghostbusters reboot

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.700
"controversy", yeah, I'm still putting "controversy" in quotes,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.139
is because the original was so unique and one-of-a-kind that no one could separate it.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.719
If it was a sequel, then they'd have had a better shot, or even a spin-off, but when people hear the word "reboot",

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.830
it's like saying, "Now

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.139
THIS is what you're going to think of when you hear

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.110
'Ghostbusters'."

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.819
Even though everyone will clearly think of this first. A lot of Universal monster movies are trying to get remade, and despite most of them

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.199
being based on classic works,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.560
it's hard to not think of Karloff as

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.380
Frankenstein or Lugosi as Dracula or Chaney as the Wolfman, and according to the American box office neither can anyone else.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.199
Oddly enough, the ones that seemed the most

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.569
ridiculous like "The Mummy" with Brendan Fraser,

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.299
at least went in such a different direction that we can kind of say, "That was uniquely their own thing".

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.020
But how is anyone gonna say, "Yeah. Johnny Depp. That's the first thing I think of when I hear, 'Willy Wonka'. Gene Who?"

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.460
Some movies leave such an impact that it makes it harder to do a version that can survive on its own without

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.119
constantly coming back to the original. If you don't have something super good or

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.069
incredibly unique in mind when remaking an icon, you're not going to be the definitive version,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.579
but it can also backfire the other way. Like the number two reason not to do a remake; When you just do the exact same thing!

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.019
"Beauty and the Beast" had this bad. So many of the lines,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.699
visuals and songs were all seen before and done better in the animated version.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.000
It was so unique and awe inspiring when they first did it, so why would we want to see non-singers and

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.120
non-expressive actors do the same thing?!

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:39.239
Gus van Sant tried a very strange experiment with the movie Psycho.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:41.469
Doing a shot-for-shot

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:47.639
reenactment. That's LITERALLY doing the exact same thing, except now all the freshness is sucked out of it

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.639
and we can notice the flaws even more!

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.530
What would this accomplish? Rob Zombie's remake of "Halloween" at first looked like it was going to be something different-

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:02.969
diving deeper into Mike Myers' childhood and devoting more time to him, but even that's done pretty generically, and when that's passed,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.440
it's just the same story of Halloween again, except with no real surprises,

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.859
but what's even worse than doing the exact same thing is the number of three reason not to do a remake;

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.120
doing less.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.709
"Ben-Hur" is one of the biggest films to exist in

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:25.889
every meaning of the word. The stunts, the story, the sets, it is the definition of epic.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.550
So the idea of seeing a CGI remake where so much less is obviously not there seems

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:40.739
degrading. "Nightmare on Elm Street" is known for its creative depths and original ideas, but with the remake it's either repeated or scaled-down.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.950
Even the makeup just looks like an unimaginative rehash. It's not different. It's not unique.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:53.579
It's just the same thing except so much less. It's a guy who controls dreams that's burned alive!

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.919
You can do something cooler with this design! The original "Wicker Man" was a surreal and bizarre

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:03.779
experience, and while the remake is certainly bizarre and entertaining

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.369
in how bad the choices they made are, so much of the creative environment is lost,

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.179
resulting in what most people can agree is a God-awful movie.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.649
Sometimes the opposite can be true too when you take too much out and replace it with

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.320
too much explanation.

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:26.309
"The Shining" and "Alice in Wonderland" remakes go WAY overboard in trying to make a super detailed and complicated story,

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.669
but that's not what we loved about the originals!

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.409
We didn't know what everything meant. We didn't need a reason for all the strange visuals.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.540
That's what was part of making it such a unique experience. By trying to add more

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:45.300
explanation, it took away the imagination. They say the devil is in the detail- in this situation

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:52.660
they're definitely right. Whether for better or worse, all of these elements represent the most important thing in making a remake;

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.040
it's heart.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.279
It's passion. It's reason for being.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.160
Everything that almost can't be explained. The best remakes, even the most different ones

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.609
managed to capture the heart of the original source material.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:15.250
Whether they improve on it or take it in a different direction, the connection is always there, and the worst remakes always don't

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:21.790
capture it. They either try too hard, not hard enough, or just focus on the wrong thing. In a time

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.099
where very little is original, it's hard to figure out what's gonna capture the heart of something and what isn't.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.880
I never would have imagined an "Evil Dead" remake would be of any worth.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.900
Who the hell would a thought a musical of a B-movie would surprisingly work?

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.639
What we do know is a lot more remakes are coming whether we want them to or not.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.699
Some surprise us with how good they are, some surprise us with how bad they are, but the ones we'll remember the most

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.679
surprisingly don't give us something old, they always give us something uniquely new.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.240
I'm the Nostalgia Critic! I remember it so you don't have to.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:32.460
(The Review Must Go On)

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.300
Hey, everybody. Doug Walker here doing the charity shout out, and if you're driving on the road

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.969
and you see some fire men going up and down the street carrying a boot and you give money you probably got one of these.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.420
This is MDA. The muscular dystrophy association.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.860
Early diagnosis, highly specialized care, and access to

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:04.289
promising clinical trials help ensure the best possible outcomes for individuals and

00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:10.559
families facing muscular dystrophy as well as ALS and any other related muscle diseases.

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:14.188
Their MDA care centers offer families best-in-class

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.399
comprehensive care from a wide variety of health care specialists at one location on the same day.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:26.039
MDA has more than 150 care centers across the United States and in Puerto Rico,

00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:29.609
located at top hospitals and health care facilities.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:38.549
Individuals can see knowledgeable health care specialists from a variety of backgrounds all at one location. The MDA family care

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.719
specialist is a center figure at the center visits. If you go to their site and especially their Youtube page, with so many

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.339
inspiring videos you too can see how you can make a huge difference.
