00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:02.325
Adam Grant: What's your favorite movie?

00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:04.865
Kid 1: One of them is "Wreck-It Ralph."

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.126
AG: And another?

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.063
Kid 1: "Mr. Peabody and Sherman."

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:10.291
AG: My kids have seen a lot of cartoons.

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:11.537
Kids: A lot.

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.355
(Laughter)

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.704
Kid 2: On the TV and in the movie theater.

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.529
AG: My wife and I
love animated films, too.

00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:19.712
When we were growing up,

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.053
there was only one name
in animated movies --

00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:23.838
(Music)

00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:25.012
Disney.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.681
For about six decades, they were
pretty much the only game in town.

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:33.601
By the mid-90s, Disney films
had started to follow a formula.

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:38.291
They would take an old story,
add a few musical numbers and -- voilà! --

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:40.894
"Pocahontas," "Hercules," "Mulan."

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:44.869
But then, something new
happened in animation.

00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:48.099
(Audio clip, "Toy Story")
To infinity and beyond!

00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:53.871
AG: Pixar reinvented how you make
an animated movie.

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:57.061
Instead of drawing characters,
you code them on a computer,

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:01.139
which makes them come alive in 3-D
instead of being flat and two-dimensional.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.875
I'm sure you remember Pixar's
first computer-animated movie,

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.050
"Toy Story."

00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:08.290
(Clip, "Toy Story")
There's a snake in my boot!

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:09.466
AG: It was a smash.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.969
Not just because the tech was cool,
but also because the story was fresh.

00:01:12.993 --> 00:01:17.754
Brad Bird: It was just so vivid and funny,
and the characters were original.

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.325
AG: This is Brad Bird.

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:21.441
He's a writer, animator and director.

00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:24.188
BB: They weren't doing the 10 songs

00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:28.569
and all that stuff that was getting
very standard in animation at the time.

00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:32.244
AG: Pixar's first three films
got multiple Oscar nominations.

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:34.545
They grossed over a billion dollars.

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.174
The studio was a perfectly
calibrated hit machine.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.875
And that's when they made
a strange decision:

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.049
they hired Brad.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.049
He was coming off
a big project that tanked.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:49.294
BB: "Don't make me go back there, man!
Don't make me go back!"

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.056
AG: And it wasn't his first failure.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.754
BB: I got fired from Disney,

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:57.181
and I was actually fired from two
of the first three jobs I held.

00:01:57.612 --> 00:01:59.933
AG: But Pixar saw promise in Brad.

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:02.846
He came to the studio
with a bold vision for a new film.

00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:06.815
And he didn't recruit the star teams
who had created their earlier hits.

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:11.934
Instead, he deliberately assembled
a band of Pixar's biggest misfits.

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.109
BB: Black sheep.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.355
John Walker: Disgruntled.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.311
Nicole Paradis Grindle: I say, "pirate."

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:18.408
AG: Doesn't exactly sound
like a dream team.

00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:22.659
But somehow, the movie they made together
grossed over 600 million dollars,

00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:24.176
won two Oscars

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.467
and was Pixar's biggest hit yet.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.950
It was ... incredible.

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:31.707
(Multiple voices) Incredible.
Incredible. Incredible.

00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:35.008
AG: The critics loved it
almost as much as my kids did.

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:36.958
(Screaming) Kids: Awesome!

00:02:36.982 --> 00:02:38.428
Kid 2: I want to see it again!

00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:39.603
Kid 1: Me, too.

00:02:39.627 --> 00:02:40.894
Kids: Again! Again! Again!

00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:44.417
(Theme music)

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.219
AG: I'm Adam Grant, and this is WorkLife,
my podcast with TED.

00:02:50.683 --> 00:02:52.684
I'm an organizational psychologist.

00:02:52.708 --> 00:02:55.652
I study how to make work not suck.

00:02:56.088 --> 00:02:57.239
In this show,

00:02:57.263 --> 00:03:00.644
I'm inviting myself inside the minds
of some truly unusual people,

00:03:00.668 --> 00:03:03.834
because they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.323
Today: shake-ups, and the value
of the outsiders inside your workplace.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.109
Thanks to Bonobos
for sponsoring this episode.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.783
What's the best time to shake things up?

00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:28.283
In most workplaces, it happens
when you're struggling.

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.314
When the chips are down, you're desperate,

00:03:30.338 --> 00:03:33.180
and you have nothing to lose
by taking some risks.

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:35.985
But by then, it's often too late.

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.949
You don't have the resources
to run bold experiments.

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.279
The evidence suggests
that the best time to shake things up

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:44.158
is actually when you're doing well.

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:47.553
That's when you have the time,
energy and freedom to innovate.

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:52.374
But sadly, research shows
that success often makes us complacent.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.285
Experts call it the "fat cat syndrome."

00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.390
Think about a time when you've been
at the top of your game.

00:03:59.414 --> 00:04:02.279
Did you really want to embrace
something radically different?

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:04.229
Of course not.

00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:07.357
You probably became
overconfident in your recipe

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:09.514
and resistant to try new things.

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:11.419
Take Blockbuster Video.

00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:15.911
At one point, they were apparently
opening a new store every 17 hours.

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:19.562
So they didn't see any reason to buy
a little mail-order company

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.163
called "Netflix."

00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:22.337
Oops!

00:04:23.124 --> 00:04:27.086
One day, the CEO of a successful company
gave me that line I hate:

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.213
"But that's the way we've always done it."

00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:31.022
My answer?

00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:35.023
"Blockbuster. BlackBerry.
Polaroid. Toys 'R' Us.

00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:36.513
Do you want me to keep going?"

00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:40.348
So how do you shake things up
before it's too late?

00:04:40.992 --> 00:04:44.395
For that, we're going to the movies.

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.228
(Music)

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:50.658
In 1999, Warner Brothers
released the first animated movie

00:04:50.682 --> 00:04:52.521
directed by Brad Bird:

00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:53.881
"Iron Giant."

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:56.484
John Walker: I remember being
so excited about it.

00:04:56.508 --> 00:04:59.024
AG: This is Brad's producer, John Walker.

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:02.000
It was the first big project
for both Brad and John.

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.988
On opening day, John went to see it
in a big theater in Times Square.

00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:08.318
JW: And there were three people in there.

00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:12.060
And I went, "What the heck is going on?"

00:05:12.084 --> 00:05:16.054
So I spent the rest of the day just
hanging around in front of the marquee

00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:18.799
and whenever anybody would come by
and look at the poster,

00:05:18.823 --> 00:05:21.823
I'd go, "It's a really good movie.
I'll buy your tickets."

00:05:21.847 --> 00:05:23.029
(Laughs)

00:05:23.053 --> 00:05:26.768
I probably bought, like,
10 people tickets to see it,

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:29.744
because there was no one
in the theaters, it was empty.

00:05:29.768 --> 00:05:30.918
Empty.

00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:32.529
It was just sad.

00:05:32.553 --> 00:05:33.726
AG: Ouch.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.219
JW: So I thought, that's it,
that's the end of me,

00:05:36.243 --> 00:05:39.653
I'll have "The Iron Giant"
on my resume and nothing more.

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:42.149
AG: The film failed commercially.

00:05:42.173 --> 00:05:43.982
But it was wildly original.

00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:46.585
And the leaders at Pixar
saw potential there.

00:05:46.609 --> 00:05:51.260
So Brad Bird and John Walker got the call
from two of the studio's cofounders,

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.609
Ed Catmull and Steve Jobs.

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:54.823
JW: They go, you know,

00:05:54.847 --> 00:05:57.067
"We'll bring this bacteria in
from the outside

00:05:57.091 --> 00:05:59.447
and see if it grows
in the petri dish," you know.

00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:04.034
BB: They were actively choosing
a guy to come up

00:06:04.058 --> 00:06:06.244
who had just made a big flop.

00:06:06.268 --> 00:06:08.696
AG: Pixar was founded
on a disruptive vision.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.350
Their leaders fervently believed
it was never too early

00:06:11.374 --> 00:06:13.631
to throw your own recipe out the window.

00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:16.299
Steve Jobs wanted to keep raising the bar:

00:06:16.323 --> 00:06:18.521
bigger hits, longer run times.

00:06:18.942 --> 00:06:21.874
So he picked a couple of outsiders
to drive a shake-up.

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:27.898
BB: They were feeling like, "We're
in danger of falling into certain habits,

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:30.450
because we have the same group
that are doing things.

00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:34.181
And we're very proud of this group,
and this group is very talented.

00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:37.077
But we want to shake things up."

00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.813
And they felt like
whatever I was going to do,

00:06:40.837 --> 00:06:42.245
it was going to be different.

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:45.022
JW: And so they said, "OK, well, here.
Can you guys do it?

00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:47.316
Can you do it in half the time,
half the money?"

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.445
AG: They gave the answer
you'd probably give

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.485
if Steve Jobs had asked you that question.

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:52.817
JW: Well, sure we can!

00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:54.379
(Laughter)

00:06:54.403 --> 00:06:56.411
You know? You just say you can, right?

00:06:56.435 --> 00:06:58.664
And then you try to go
figure out how to do it.

00:06:58.966 --> 00:07:01.634
AG: So Pixar hired
John Walker and Brad Bird.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.506
Brad had been working on a new story
for an animated film.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.780
It would be called "The Incredibles."

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.236
And it was different
than anything Pixar had ever done.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.966
BB: Everything that the film was,

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.990
was all the things that CG animation
was then terrible at.

00:07:17.014 --> 00:07:19.067
It was full of humans, which,

00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:21.811
they were the weakest thing
in CG animation,

00:07:21.835 --> 00:07:25.045
if you look at humans circa that time.

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.051
AG: Pixar films had only had humans
as minor characters.

00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:30.426
And they didn't look very convincing.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.237
To date, Pixar's movies
were mostly filled with toys,

00:07:33.261 --> 00:07:35.213
monsters and talking bugs.

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.517
Now, Brad was pitching a movie

00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:41.625
that would require animating
a whole family of not just humans,

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:43.926
humans with superpowers.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.040
BB: It was full of water and fire and wind

00:07:48.064 --> 00:07:52.305
and all this stuff that CG animation
was no good at doing.

00:07:52.329 --> 00:07:53.599
Hair.

00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:55.972
AG: It turns out, hair was a real problem.

00:07:55.996 --> 00:07:59.499
Prior to "The Incredibles," no one had
even bothered to code long hair,

00:07:59.523 --> 00:08:01.975
because it was just impossible
in CG animation.

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:06.364
BB: It's almost like everybody used a ton
of hair spray before they got filmed,

00:08:06.388 --> 00:08:08.656
because the hair doesn't move much.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.450
And, you know, we were doing a film
where it was part of Violet's character.

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:17.997
AG: Violet is a member
of the Incredibles family --

00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:19.919
a shy, moody teenager.

00:08:19.943 --> 00:08:23.343
(Clip, "The Incredibles") Violet: Normal?
What do you know about normal?

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:25.719
What does anyone in this family
know about normal?

00:08:25.743 --> 00:08:28.254
AG: She was supposed to spend
a huge part of the film

00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:30.355
covering her face
with her long, black hair.

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:32.602
JW: We'd seen these beautiful tests.

00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:33.818
AG: Producer John Walker.

00:08:33.842 --> 00:08:34.994
JW: And it was like,

00:08:35.018 --> 00:08:38.523
wow, she's shaking her head,
and the hair is flowing,

00:08:38.547 --> 00:08:41.794
and it's gorgeous,
and it's going to be beautiful.

00:08:42.196 --> 00:08:44.291
AG: But the tests were oversimplified.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.715
The hair moved right,
but kind of looked like strips of rubber.

00:08:48.117 --> 00:08:50.680
When it was time to do
the full computer animation,

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:52.504
Violet's hair looked awful.

00:08:53.014 --> 00:08:55.395
So John asked what it would take
to get it right.

00:08:55.419 --> 00:08:57.577
And he was shocked at the answer.

00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.783
JW: "We can't actually
do the movie like that.

00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:02.323
That would take 10 years
and 10 million dollars."

00:09:02.347 --> 00:09:04.598
I was like, "Then why
did you show us that?"

00:09:05.353 --> 00:09:06.863
I'm trying to get myself ready

00:09:06.887 --> 00:09:09.434
to go tell Brad that we're
going to cut Violet's hair.

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:10.776
BB: "You can't do it!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.791
That's the character.
She's got to have the hair!"

00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:18.252
As the film goes on, she feels enough
growing self-assurance

00:09:18.276 --> 00:09:20.713
that she pulls the hair out of her face.

00:09:21.157 --> 00:09:22.891
Her hair had a story arc.

00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:24.188
(Laughter)

00:09:24.212 --> 00:09:27.731
AG: To do hair and water
and all these other new images correctly,

00:09:27.755 --> 00:09:31.085
Pixar execs guessed that the film
could cost half a billion dollars

00:09:31.109 --> 00:09:32.842
and take a decade to make.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.426
Brad needed some original thinking.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.341
So this unconventional director
went looking for a team

00:09:38.365 --> 00:09:40.410
of unconventional recruits --

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:43.034
the outsiders among Pixar's insiders.

00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:44.752
The black sheep.

00:09:44.776 --> 00:09:46.974
BB: They are not always the, um,

00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:52.022
smiling-est, easiest people to work with.

00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:53.958
Sometimes, they’re a little grumpy.

00:09:53.982 --> 00:09:56.418
AG: Brad, have you ever been
a black sheep yourself?

00:09:56.982 --> 00:09:58.697
BB: Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:58.721 --> 00:10:00.285
Yes. Yeah.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.942
My family was kind of like
the family in "The Incredibles."

00:10:03.966 --> 00:10:06.033
We had these dinners
where everybody vented

00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:07.990
and said what they thought.

00:10:08.014 --> 00:10:10.720
That's the attitude
that I kind of grew up in.

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:14.108
And I found very quickly,
the world doesn't work that way.

00:10:14.617 --> 00:10:16.213
AG: Brad searched Pixar's ranks

00:10:16.237 --> 00:10:19.180
for people who were frustrated
with the status quo,

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:23.046
people who had risky ideas
that had been dismissed or overlooked.

00:10:23.736 --> 00:10:26.164
You might have one
of those people on your team.

00:10:26.188 --> 00:10:27.855
Or maybe you're the black sheep.

00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:31.744
BB: There's a big impetus,
especially with success,

00:10:31.768 --> 00:10:34.339
to repeat whatever has worked before.

00:10:34.363 --> 00:10:36.942
You know? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:39.880
But I was looking for a bunch of people

00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:43.746
that were kind of dissatisfied
with the way things were.

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:46.581
AG: Turns out, Brad was onto something.

00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:49.292
Research shows that the kind
of frustration he harnessed

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.649
can fuel creativity.

00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:53.477
In other words,
the curmudgeons on your team

00:10:53.501 --> 00:10:55.768
could be great untapped resources.

00:10:56.284 --> 00:10:59.941
I'm sure you've seen companies
hire external consultants or executives

00:10:59.965 --> 00:11:01.413
to shake things up.

00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:05.158
But there's evidence that you
don't have to turn to outside hires.

00:11:05.182 --> 00:11:08.435
You can go to the black sheep
already working within the company.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:09.610
Consider one study

00:11:09.634 --> 00:11:12.618
that was done at a company
that makes oil drilling equipment.

00:11:12.642 --> 00:11:16.693
Supervisors evaluated how often employees
brought new and innovative ideas

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:17.868
to the table.

00:11:18.395 --> 00:11:20.569
The employees who were rated
the most creative

00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:23.660
were the ones who felt
dissatisfied with their jobs.

00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:28.429
Their frustration with problems
motivated them to develop fresh solutions.

00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:32.363
But dissatisfaction
didn't always lead to creativity.

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:35.466
It only helped when people felt
committed to the company

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.076
and had access to the feedback
and support they needed.

00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:41.951
When you ignore them, disgruntled
people channel their frustration

00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:45.189
in unproductive or even
counterproductive directions.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.403
If you're aware they're out there, though,
and you really listen to them,

00:11:49.427 --> 00:11:51.034
they can become your allies.

00:11:52.688 --> 00:11:54.102
Lisa Bodell: They always say,

00:11:54.126 --> 00:11:57.113
"Innovation is the pirate ship
that sails into the yacht club."

00:11:57.137 --> 00:11:59.288
Nobody likes it, but
they appreciate it later.

00:11:59.312 --> 00:12:00.463
AG: This is Lisa Bodell.

00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:03.429
She spent part of her career
in advertising and start-ups.

00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:06.725
LB: I came there to do really great,
motivating and inspiring things,

00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:10.403
and I was spending my day just managing
processes and procedures and crap.

00:12:10.427 --> 00:12:13.109
AG: Lisa got fed up with the dozens
of meaningless tasks

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:15.688
that define so many work environments.

00:12:15.712 --> 00:12:18.276
So she started a company
called FutureThink

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.029
to help organizations
shake up the status quo.

00:12:21.053 --> 00:12:23.379
(Clip) LB: ... and ideally,
walk away with things

00:12:23.403 --> 00:12:26.150
that will help you simplify
your work and your life

00:12:26.174 --> 00:12:27.910
to get you moving forward.

00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:31.248
And what I thought we could do
is go through about -- I don't know,

00:12:31.272 --> 00:12:33.123
500 PowerPoint slides.

00:12:33.147 --> 00:12:34.998
Does that work for you all? (Laughter)

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:36.201
No?

00:12:36.225 --> 00:12:37.636
AG: Her big breakthrough came

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.127
when she was giving a talk
to a few dozen executives

00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:41.450
at a manufacturing company.

00:12:41.474 --> 00:12:44.273
LB: I realized quickly that
these people didn't give a crap

00:12:44.297 --> 00:12:45.870
about what I was talking about.

00:12:45.894 --> 00:12:47.680
And so I called a break,

00:12:47.704 --> 00:12:50.101
and I said, "Listen,
I'm going to shake things up."

00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:52.228
AG: She looked at all these
bored executives,

00:12:52.252 --> 00:12:54.919
and told them to kill their own company.

00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:57.037
LB: I challenged each of those groups

00:12:57.061 --> 00:12:59.799
to identify who their number one
competitor was.

00:12:59.823 --> 00:13:02.434
And then I said, "Pretend
you're that competition.

00:13:02.458 --> 00:13:03.903
Pretend you have that hat on.

00:13:03.927 --> 00:13:06.256
I want you to put yourself
out of business."

00:13:06.831 --> 00:13:08.410
I mean -- the room lit on fire.

00:13:08.434 --> 00:13:10.924
They were so excited,
because I gave them permission

00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:13.488
to talk about the things
that were literally verboten.

00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:16.537
It was a mindset shift
as well as a business strategy shift.

00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:18.775
AG: When I heard about the exercise,

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:21.384
I was expecting a roomful
of complaints and cynicism.

00:13:21.974 --> 00:13:23.340
Then I watched it happen.

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:27.950
And I have never seen a more energized
group of leaders in my life.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:31.030
LB: Really what it does is give people
a framework and permission

00:13:31.054 --> 00:13:33.220
to start attacking things
that aren't working.

00:13:33.244 --> 00:13:35.388
And that's what's energizing to people.

00:13:35.412 --> 00:13:37.237
They don't know the difference, Adam,

00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:39.410
between being in a groove
and being in a rut.

00:13:39.434 --> 00:13:42.458
And most people, when you talk about
complacency, are in a rut.

00:13:42.482 --> 00:13:44.114
And until you talk to them about,

00:13:44.138 --> 00:13:47.082
"What do you wish you could change?
Why are you frustrated?"

00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:48.410
they get pumped up.

00:13:48.434 --> 00:13:51.324
AG: One thing that's always
fascinated me about this exercise

00:13:51.348 --> 00:13:54.589
is how different it would be
if you ran it as "save the company."

00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:57.458
And I was interested in hearing

00:13:57.482 --> 00:13:59.949
what led you to the boldness
of killing the company

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:01.862
rather than saving the company.

00:14:02.418 --> 00:14:05.385
LB: Save means "safe" and "preserve."

00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:07.506
You know? I think of a life preserver.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.728
"How can we keep what we have safe?"

00:14:09.752 --> 00:14:13.496
versus "How can we get rid
of what we have and do things better?"

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.932
It's permission to admit
that things might not be right,

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:20.551
so you can look at what's not working
and make space for things that are.

00:14:20.575 --> 00:14:22.591
AG: If you were asked
to kill your company,

00:14:22.615 --> 00:14:23.831
where would you start?

00:14:23.855 --> 00:14:25.910
You might begin the way Lisa does:

00:14:25.934 --> 00:14:29.021
gather some people together
to give their frustration a voice.

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:31.617
Put them on offense, not defense,

00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:34.172
by asking them to attack
the problems they see.

00:14:34.553 --> 00:14:37.608
And then invite them to run
with their best ideas.

00:14:37.632 --> 00:14:40.719
Lisa's approach has worked
in all kinds of environments:

00:14:40.743 --> 00:14:44.721
banks, tech companies,
city governments, schools.

00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:48.926
And Brad Bird did his own
version of it at Pixar.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.065
BB: Pixar kind of invented
a lot of the stuff

00:14:53.089 --> 00:14:55.553
that now everyone takes for granted.

00:14:55.577 --> 00:14:58.382
I mean, they were the best
in the world at it.

00:14:58.871 --> 00:15:02.717
Those methods weren't
going to work for our film.

00:15:03.177 --> 00:15:06.115
AG: Brad challenged the black sheep
to try different solutions

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:07.935
to their toughest animation problems,

00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:09.392
like Violet's hair.

00:15:09.416 --> 00:15:13.205
BB: They don't want to do something
the way that it's always been done.

00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:16.268
For every 20 people that say,
"This is how you do it,"

00:15:16.292 --> 00:15:18.435
there's usually one person going,

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:22.593
"Uh, you don't have to do it that way.
There's another way that you could do it."

00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:26.624
AG: But there was one problem that neither
Brad nor John Walker had anticipated.

00:15:26.648 --> 00:15:29.855
JW: They were in different rooms,
they were doing different things.

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:33.752
AG: The technical people had been
unleashed to build all these new tools.

00:15:33.776 --> 00:15:37.077
But the creative people
didn't really understand how to use them.

00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:38.918
JW: Something would go wrong,

00:15:38.942 --> 00:15:41.450
an email would come from one side, going,

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:43.593
"Hey, your simulator is broken,"

00:15:43.617 --> 00:15:46.062
over to the people
that were building the simulator.

00:15:46.086 --> 00:15:48.009
And the simulator guys would write back,

00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:49.958
"No, no, no, no -- it's operator error."

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:51.999
And they would go
back and forth like that.

00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:54.276
And we'd go, "Oh, gosh.
This is not working."

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.680
AG: Brad and John started listening
to the people on the front lines.

00:15:57.704 --> 00:16:00.267
And they suddenly realized
there was a simple solution

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:01.726
to their complex problem:

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.736
put the technical people together
with the animators in the same rooms.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.521
JW: As soon as that started
to happen, it was like magic,

00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:11.100
because somebody would
show them the problem and say,

00:16:11.124 --> 00:16:14.395
"Look what happens -- I do this,
and the hair flies around the room."

00:16:14.419 --> 00:16:16.372
And the guy building the simulator goes,

00:16:16.396 --> 00:16:21.028
"Well, you've got to hit F3-7 and put
this little bit of the code in there.

00:16:21.052 --> 00:16:22.218
Didn't you know that?"

00:16:22.242 --> 00:16:24.258
And they go, "No, we didn't know that!"

00:16:24.282 --> 00:16:27.660
Beautiful thing when you go
after black sheep, you say,

00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:30.450
"Hey, I'll give your crazy idea a try."

00:16:30.474 --> 00:16:32.260
That's kind of where they want to go.

00:16:32.284 --> 00:16:33.441
AG: So wait, Brad --

00:16:33.465 --> 00:16:36.545
does that mean you're just trying
to surround yourself constantly

00:16:36.569 --> 00:16:37.720
with angry people?

00:16:37.744 --> 00:16:40.249
BB: No, I mean, I don't want
just disgruntled people.

00:16:40.273 --> 00:16:41.424
There's plenty of those,

00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:43.587
and they don't do
a damn thing for anybody.

00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:46.252
I want people who are disgruntled

00:16:46.276 --> 00:16:48.672
because they have
a better way of doing things

00:16:48.696 --> 00:16:51.879
and they are having trouble
finding an avenue --

00:16:52.276 --> 00:16:56.915
racing cars that are just
spinning their wheels in a garage

00:16:56.939 --> 00:16:58.434
rather than racing.

00:16:58.458 --> 00:17:02.379
You open that garage, and man,
those people will take you somewhere.

00:17:02.403 --> 00:17:06.497
(Theme music)

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.763
AG: So you've got your team
of dissatisfied people.

00:17:11.787 --> 00:17:13.921
You're ready for them to shake things up.

00:17:13.945 --> 00:17:16.859
Now, how do you get them all
innovating in the same direction?

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:19.766
More on that after the break.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.910
(Theme music)

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.034
OK, this is going to be
a different kind of ad.

00:17:28.419 --> 00:17:32.069
I've played a personal role in selecting
the sponsors for this podcast,

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.807
because they all have
interesting cultures of their own.

00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:37.466
Today, we're going inside
the workplace at Bonobos.

00:17:44.993 --> 00:17:49.140
A few years ago, Sam Gonzalez
was on an all-staff call at Bonobos,

00:17:49.164 --> 00:17:52.030
when the top boss said something
that took his breath away.

00:17:52.054 --> 00:17:53.347
Sam Gonzalez: She had said,

00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:56.966
one of the things in that conference call
was that we were going to embrace,

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.871
in our marketing campaigns, we were going
to start to think about gender identity.

00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:03.100
AG: For Sam, a guide
in one of Bonobos's shops,

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.608
the idea that a men's clothing brand
was going to focus on gender identity

00:18:06.632 --> 00:18:07.799
wasn't just exciting;

00:18:07.823 --> 00:18:09.037
it was personal.

00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:11.418
SG: I'd worked at Bonobos
for a little over a year

00:18:11.442 --> 00:18:14.379
before I figured out that I am trans
and I want to transition.

00:18:14.403 --> 00:18:16.597
And that will include for me

00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:20.755
letting everyone that I work with know
and everyone who comes into my life know

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:22.537
that this is a part of who I am.

00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:24.969
AG: Sam had prepared for the worst.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.847
SG: What does it mean
to transition at work?

00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.863
Because I had only heard horror stories.

00:18:29.887 --> 00:18:33.348
But then, once I did,
I was proved 100 percent wrong.

00:18:33.372 --> 00:18:35.302
People were super open,

00:18:35.326 --> 00:18:38.776
they were incredibly caring
and respectful.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.616
AG: And then, just a few months later,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.519
Sam found himself on this
all-hands phone call.

00:18:43.543 --> 00:18:47.393
Micky Onvural, then the copresident
and now Bonobos CEO,

00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:50.116
said the company was going to start
a public conversation

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.631
about gender identity.

00:18:51.655 --> 00:18:54.167
As soon as the call finished,
Sam sent her an email.

00:18:54.489 --> 00:18:57.267
SG: I said, "I don't know
if you know this, but I am trans,

00:18:57.291 --> 00:19:00.455
and I have transitioned at Bonobos,
and I've been here for a while.

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:01.632
And you have no idea

00:19:01.656 --> 00:19:04.465
what this type of representation
means to someone like me."

00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:06.547
Micky Onvural: When I first
got Sam's email,

00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:08.640
I was, to be honest,
completely overwhelmed.

00:19:08.664 --> 00:19:10.514
I think I probably shed a tear or two.

00:19:10.538 --> 00:19:13.792
I'm Micky Onvural,
I am the CEO of Bonobos.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.339
For me, it was very touching
that someone felt comfortable enough

00:19:17.363 --> 00:19:20.260
to be able to tell me that personal story.

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:21.934
AG: Think about how rare that is,

00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:26.029
for a junior employee to feel comfortable
emailing someone that high up.

00:19:26.053 --> 00:19:27.482
I almost never see it,

00:19:27.506 --> 00:19:31.254
even though I spend a lot of time
encouraging senior leaders to be open.

00:19:31.278 --> 00:19:34.635
At Bonobos, Micky wasn't just receptive
to new ideas from below,

00:19:34.659 --> 00:19:36.524
she actively encouraged them.

00:19:36.548 --> 00:19:39.238
SG: ... and I had talked
a little bit about, in my email,

00:19:39.262 --> 00:19:40.704
that I had met Chris Mosier,

00:19:40.728 --> 00:19:44.458
and I think that he would be
a fantastic person for us to highlight.

00:19:44.482 --> 00:19:48.206
MO: The first thing I did,
I forwarded it on to our production team,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.340
and I said, "Sam's just had
this amazing idea

00:19:50.364 --> 00:19:54.133
of us bringing Chris Mosier in
and shooting him in our clothes.

00:19:54.157 --> 00:19:55.307
Let's do it."

00:19:55.641 --> 00:19:59.754
AG: Chris Mosier was part of the American
men's duathlon team in 2016.

00:20:00.086 --> 00:20:04.094
That made him the first openly transgender
athlete to compete for Team USA.

00:20:04.118 --> 00:20:06.531
SG: Chris was one
of the first people that I saw

00:20:06.555 --> 00:20:10.251
that made me feel like
being trans is a thing,

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:13.245
and you can do it, and you can
transition and you can be happy.

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:16.802
AG: So Sam made a pitch for Bonobos
to feature Chris in a commercial.

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:20.603
Chris Mosier: For a men's
clothing company to say,

00:20:20.627 --> 00:20:24.348
trans men are men
and can be a part of our campaign,

00:20:24.372 --> 00:20:26.596
to me, personally, was a big deal.

00:20:26.952 --> 00:20:28.126
AG: That's Chris.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.483
A few months later, Bonobos launched
a commercial that featured him.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.950
CM: It was sort of what
I was searching for when I was younger.

00:20:34.974 --> 00:20:39.066
Like, if I would have seen out trans men
being a part of men's campaigns,

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.523
being a part of men's fashion magazines
or commercials on TV,

00:20:43.547 --> 00:20:45.848
that are talking about
men and masculinity,

00:20:45.872 --> 00:20:50.206
I think that my trajectory would have been
drastically different as a person.

00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:53.238
AG: So, Sam, as you reflect
on this whole experience

00:20:53.262 --> 00:20:57.347
of first transitioning at work and then
bringing on Chris as a spokesperson,

00:20:57.371 --> 00:20:58.752
how does that make you feel?

00:20:58.776 --> 00:21:00.918
SG: There's not really
a word to describe it.

00:21:00.942 --> 00:21:03.434
I think "awesome" is too small of a word.

00:21:03.458 --> 00:21:05.323
AG: Awesome is too small a word.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:06.522
I like that.

00:21:06.546 --> 00:21:10.055
And I like the idea that big ideas
can come from anywhere in a company,

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:12.236
as long as there's support at the top.

00:21:12.969 --> 00:21:15.520
Bonobos makes great clothes
that can fit every guy.

00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:18.220
Ordering on their website
is easy, they ship fast,

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:20.213
and if it doesn't fit, they want to know.

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:23.803

00:21:36.387 --> 00:21:39.546
(Music)

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:46.358
When you're gathering a group of people
for a major shake-up,

00:21:46.382 --> 00:21:48.045
how do you motivate them?

00:21:48.069 --> 00:21:51.450
Your first instinct is probably
to inspire them.

00:21:51.474 --> 00:21:54.075
(Clip, "Apollo 13") We never lost
an American in space,

00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:56.465
we're sure as hell not gonna lose
one on my watch.

00:21:56.489 --> 00:21:57.688
Failure is not an option!

00:21:57.712 --> 00:22:00.700
(Clip, "The Golden Age")
Let them come with the armies of hell!

00:22:00.724 --> 00:22:03.011
They will not pass! (Cheers)

00:22:03.035 --> 00:22:04.895
(Clip, "The Waterboy") You can do it!

00:22:05.323 --> 00:22:08.244
AG: If you're working with a bunch
of disgruntled black sheep,

00:22:08.268 --> 00:22:10.847
you'll feel especially compelled
to convey confidence,

00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.323
show enthusiasm

00:22:12.347 --> 00:22:16.140
and make sure they don't get discouraged
by the sheer difficulty of the task.

00:22:16.856 --> 00:22:19.690
But if you're Brad Bird
and you're making "The Incredibles,"

00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:21.671
you do the exact opposite.

00:22:22.348 --> 00:22:25.581
Brad told his team no one thought
they could pull it off.

00:22:25.912 --> 00:22:30.016
Nicole Paradis Grindle: That's the kind
of challenge that lights a fuse in Brad.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.829
And that's how he leads our teams.

00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:35.048
AG: This is Nicole Paradis Grindle.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.313
She's been a producer
at Pixar since the mid-90s.

00:22:38.703 --> 00:22:40.783
When Nicole joined "The Incredibles" team,

00:22:40.807 --> 00:22:43.585
they'd been struggling
with the animation for about a year.

00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:45.777
NPG: I was working with the engineers

00:22:45.801 --> 00:22:48.990
who were trying to figure out
how to do the hair and the cloth.

00:22:49.014 --> 00:22:52.792
And they were saying it was impossible,
Brad was asking for too much ...

00:22:52.816 --> 00:22:55.747
And they just kept saying,
"Nope, nope, nope, we can't do it."

00:22:55.771 --> 00:22:59.480
They were trying, and the stuff
they were producing looked terrible.

00:22:59.855 --> 00:23:02.569
We have these crew meetings once a week,

00:23:02.593 --> 00:23:06.836
so everyone's wandering in first thing
in the morning with their coffee,

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.201
piling into this big theater that we have.

00:23:10.225 --> 00:23:13.304
And he gets up in front
of this room of people,

00:23:13.328 --> 00:23:17.882
and he just starts yelling
and telling them,

00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:19.934
"They think we can't do this!

00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:23.101
They think we're too slow,
they think we're not good enough!

00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:25.133
I'm telling you, we're going to do this!"

00:23:25.157 --> 00:23:28.590
You know? And people love it --
I mean, it's this pep rally.

00:23:29.331 --> 00:23:32.259
AG: What Brad did by instinct
is actually backed by evidence.

00:23:32.601 --> 00:23:35.929
If you want to motivate black sheep,
give them a battle to fight,

00:23:35.953 --> 00:23:37.820
a particular kind of battle.

00:23:38.255 --> 00:23:43.585
BB: One thing that is very effective
is to find a common enemy.

00:23:43.609 --> 00:23:46.299
But the enemy doesn't have to be a person.

00:23:46.323 --> 00:23:47.657
It can be a mindset.

00:23:48.165 --> 00:23:50.672
It can be a presumption.

00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:54.283
It can be a system
that doesn't want to change.

00:23:54.704 --> 00:23:57.864
It can even be something
like a trend in movies

00:23:57.888 --> 00:24:00.940
that is just making movies stupider.

00:24:00.964 --> 00:24:02.892
You can make that the enemy.

00:24:02.916 --> 00:24:05.852
And you can put it up
in front of people and say,

00:24:05.876 --> 00:24:09.265
"You know what I don't like?
I don't like X.

00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:15.068
And here's how I think we can
not do this thing that everyone is doing

00:24:15.092 --> 00:24:17.981
and really dazzle the audience."

00:24:18.402 --> 00:24:19.651
And people like that,

00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:22.637
because you're putting them
on the pirate ship.

00:24:23.133 --> 00:24:26.720
You're not going with
the well-funded, safe routes.

00:24:26.744 --> 00:24:29.990
You're kind of striking
your sails in a storm.

00:24:30.014 --> 00:24:31.480
And you're OK with it.

00:24:31.834 --> 00:24:34.159
That fires people up, you know?

00:24:34.183 --> 00:24:35.431
It fires me up.

00:24:35.937 --> 00:24:38.260
Samir Nurmohamed:
It sounds like in that moment,

00:24:38.284 --> 00:24:41.537
Brad was shaping how his team
perceived those outside of their team

00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:44.593
and basically framed those individuals
as critics or naysayers.

00:24:44.617 --> 00:24:47.357
AG: This is Samir Nurmohamed,
my colleague at Wharton.

00:24:47.915 --> 00:24:51.447
He studies what happens
when we're cast in the role of underdog.

00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:54.749
SN: Stories of underdogs and favorites
permeate societies:

00:24:54.773 --> 00:24:57.458
David versus Goliath, Horatio Alger,

00:24:57.482 --> 00:24:59.942
Ivan the Fool in Russian literature.

00:24:59.966 --> 00:25:03.783
You see these examples of underdogs
going from rags to riches

00:25:03.807 --> 00:25:06.105
or performing against
others' low expectations,

00:25:06.129 --> 00:25:07.345
across the world.

00:25:07.887 --> 00:25:10.155
AG: An underdog isn't a kind of person.

00:25:10.522 --> 00:25:12.869
It's a mindset that can help
you approach problems

00:25:12.893 --> 00:25:14.299
the way black sheep do.

00:25:14.658 --> 00:25:16.396
You can position people as underdogs

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.022
by telling them they're not
expected to succeed.

00:25:19.046 --> 00:25:20.283
And surprisingly,

00:25:20.307 --> 00:25:23.975
the uphill battle is often the one
that people are most excited to fight.

00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:28.601
In a study with job seekers who had
faced discrimination in their careers,

00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:31.121
Samir randomly assigned
some of them to tell a story

00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:33.852
about how they had been underdogs
against the odds.

00:25:34.236 --> 00:25:38.108
It almost doubled their chances
of landing a job in the following month.

00:25:38.132 --> 00:25:42.101
SN: You actually experience more efficacy
and more confidence to do well,

00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:44.136
and it leads to higher performance.

00:25:45.553 --> 00:25:46.720
AG: In another study,

00:25:46.744 --> 00:25:49.926
Samir had people fill out a survey
about their negotiating style.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.194
Then he told them that,
based on their results,

00:25:52.218 --> 00:25:55.688
he had calculated the probability
of their success in a negotiation.

00:25:55.712 --> 00:25:58.367
He told some participants
they were the favorites;

00:25:58.391 --> 00:26:00.125
some, they were evenly matched;

00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:03.021
and told others
that they were the underdogs.

00:26:03.585 --> 00:26:07.069
SN: The underdog actually ended up
reaching the more creative solution.

00:26:07.093 --> 00:26:09.910
People who were told
that they couldn't succeed

00:26:09.934 --> 00:26:11.910
actually ended up performing better.

00:26:11.934 --> 00:26:13.157
And the reason for this

00:26:13.181 --> 00:26:16.211
is that they essentially wanted
to prove the researchers wrong.

00:26:16.235 --> 00:26:19.276
AG: The favorites had nothing
to prove. They got complacent.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.784
The underdogs were driven to show
they had been misjudged,

00:26:22.808 --> 00:26:25.220
which happens in all kinds of jobs.

00:26:25.244 --> 00:26:28.045
Even Michael Jordan
motivated himself this way.

00:26:28.069 --> 00:26:30.482
SN: Even in his Hall of Fame
induction speech,

00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.680
when the world came out
to celebrate with him,

00:26:32.704 --> 00:26:36.506
he was calling out his school coach
who chose another player over him

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.617
and how this fueled his motivation
to prove them wrong.

00:26:39.641 --> 00:26:43.212
What's remarkable is that Jordan
was talking about being underestimated

00:26:43.236 --> 00:26:47.252
after being universally recognized as not
only the greatest basketball player ever,

00:26:47.276 --> 00:26:50.014
but as one of the greatest
athletes of all time.

00:26:50.038 --> 00:26:54.204
Jordan was still constructing
that perception of being underestimated

00:26:54.228 --> 00:26:56.919
and using that as motivation
to prove others wrong.

00:26:57.276 --> 00:26:59.974
AG: But before you start
cutting down all your colleagues

00:26:59.998 --> 00:27:01.426
in the name of motivation,

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.776
keep in mind that there's
a wrong way to do it.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.157
SN: This doesn't mean
you go around the workplace

00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:08.180
telling everyone that they can't succeed.

00:27:08.204 --> 00:27:10.372
That's not the way
to instill this motivation.

00:27:10.396 --> 00:27:12.998
As a person in this position
who's seen as an underdog,

00:27:13.022 --> 00:27:16.270
you have to feel like
you have the capabilities to succeed.

00:27:16.294 --> 00:27:18.120
AG: For the underdog approach to work,

00:27:18.144 --> 00:27:20.993
the low expectations need to come
from the right messenger,

00:27:21.017 --> 00:27:22.556
a natural adversary.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.728
SN: When a really credible person
tells you you can't succeed,

00:27:26.752 --> 00:27:31.220
in some sense, you basically internalize
those expectations, your confidence drops,

00:27:31.244 --> 00:27:34.768
you actually believe them,
and you don't perform as successfully.

00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:35.990
On the other hand,

00:27:36.014 --> 00:27:39.680
when you receive low expectations
from someone who's not seen as credible,

00:27:39.704 --> 00:27:42.990
you perceive them as really incompetent
or not knowledgeable

00:27:43.014 --> 00:27:45.442
about either the domain
that you're performing in

00:27:45.466 --> 00:27:47.680
or your own abilities.

00:27:47.704 --> 00:27:50.879
This is what sparks that desire
to prove others wrong.

00:27:50.903 --> 00:27:53.061
AG: So if you're rallying salespeople,

00:27:53.085 --> 00:27:57.114
you can emphasize that R&amp;D doesn't think
they can hit their targets.

00:27:57.529 --> 00:28:00.458
And if you're trying to motivate
technical or creative people,

00:28:00.482 --> 00:28:03.632
you can tell them they're being
doubted by a bunch of suits.

00:28:03.656 --> 00:28:06.554
NPG: That's what those black sheep
probably are looking for,

00:28:06.578 --> 00:28:08.760
is an opportunity to show
what they can do.

00:28:08.784 --> 00:28:13.107
AG: Pixar producer Nicole Grindle
saw Brad's underdog gambit pay off.

00:28:13.131 --> 00:28:16.282
The black sheep at the studio felt
the naysayers had no business

00:28:16.306 --> 00:28:17.980
judging their abilities --

00:28:18.004 --> 00:28:20.813
or the new animation techniques
they were about to invent.

00:28:20.837 --> 00:28:23.314
NPG: The idea that
we're proving folks wrong,

00:28:23.338 --> 00:28:26.093
I think, is the prime motivator.

00:28:26.117 --> 00:28:29.228
I mean, of course, we want to make
a great film and a great story,

00:28:29.252 --> 00:28:30.408
and that's a given.

00:28:30.432 --> 00:28:33.537
But proving that, you know,

00:28:33.561 --> 00:28:38.783
proving to the man that we're better
than they think we are --

00:28:38.807 --> 00:28:40.482
that's exciting.

00:28:40.506 --> 00:28:43.364
And that's what folks
in this industry live to do,

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:45.990
is, you know, act in that kind of a story.

00:28:46.014 --> 00:28:47.164
(Laughs)

00:28:47.673 --> 00:28:50.157
AG: The last step
for energizing your shake-up team

00:28:50.181 --> 00:28:52.596
is to calibrate the degree of difficulty.

00:28:53.085 --> 00:28:55.493
How challenging should the goal be?

00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:58.323
BB: I think you always have
the impossible task,

00:28:58.347 --> 00:29:03.458
because basically,
to do really good work is hard.

00:29:03.482 --> 00:29:07.895
And if you're doing it right,
you are kind of an underdog.

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:11.268
You should be shooting
for something that's out of reach.

00:29:11.292 --> 00:29:15.061
And maybe you don't hit it,

00:29:15.085 --> 00:29:16.680
but at the end of it,

00:29:16.704 --> 00:29:19.982
if you are reaching for something
that's beyond your reach,

00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:24.069
you're probably going to extend
your reach from your previous work.

00:29:24.458 --> 00:29:26.561
AG: In psychology,
we call that kind of reach

00:29:26.585 --> 00:29:28.569
a "just-manageable difficulty."

00:29:28.593 --> 00:29:31.075
It's a challenge that tests
and stretches your skills

00:29:31.099 --> 00:29:33.493
to the very edge
of what you think is possible.

00:29:34.284 --> 00:29:35.720
It has to be tough,

00:29:35.744 --> 00:29:38.602
but it can't set you up
for certain failure, either.

00:29:38.934 --> 00:29:41.355
As Pixar producer John Walker puts it:

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:43.354
JW: Sometimes you have to swim upstream.

00:29:43.378 --> 00:29:45.434
Sometimes, you have to swim upstream.

00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:49.895
But if you swim upstream too long,

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:52.768
something is probably wrong.

00:29:52.792 --> 00:29:57.156
(Music)

00:29:57.518 --> 00:30:01.216
AG: OK, I came away from Pixar
convinced that to shake things up,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.458
it can help to recruit the people
you'd least expect -- frustrated people --

00:30:05.482 --> 00:30:06.749
and listen to them.

00:30:07.165 --> 00:30:09.522
Then motivate them
by making them into underdogs,

00:30:09.546 --> 00:30:12.079
against the odds or a difficult enemy.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:15.190
But I was curious about
whether this could all work

00:30:15.214 --> 00:30:17.861
in a place that's
the total opposite of Pixar:

00:30:18.325 --> 00:30:19.992
the ultimate bureaucracy,

00:30:20.532 --> 00:30:22.966
an environment where
strict orders are followed,

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.545
old traditions crush new technologies,

00:30:25.569 --> 00:30:27.996
and creativity isn't just not rewarded,

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.093
it's sometimes actively punished.

00:30:30.117 --> 00:30:31.688
(Clip) Recruit training,

00:30:31.712 --> 00:30:34.688
where a man is taught
the basic skills for the sea.

00:30:34.712 --> 00:30:36.436
AG: The US Navy.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.310
(Clip, old recruitment ad)
He learns to be part of the team.

00:30:39.334 --> 00:30:41.252
He learns where he might fit in.

00:30:41.276 --> 00:30:43.585
AG: A few years ago,
a military general told me

00:30:43.609 --> 00:30:47.054
that if I wanted to understand
innovation in the armed forces,

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:50.602
I had to talk to a junior naval officer
named Ben Kohlmann.

00:30:50.626 --> 00:30:53.252
Ben Kohlmann: My grandfather
was a World War II aviator,

00:30:53.276 --> 00:30:58.903
and my great uncle was an Air Force pilot
who was shot down over Vietnam

00:30:58.927 --> 00:31:03.994
and spent five years in the Hanoi Hilton
with John McCain and Jim Stockdale.

00:31:04.018 --> 00:31:06.887
And those stories infused my upbringing.

00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:09.276
And I wanted to be leading
carrier battle fleets

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.323
against whoever was attacking
the United States.

00:31:12.347 --> 00:31:16.107
AG: So I was surprised to hear
Ben's colleagues call him a black sheep,

00:31:16.131 --> 00:31:17.663
a rabble-rouser,

00:31:17.687 --> 00:31:18.909
a troublemaker.

00:31:18.933 --> 00:31:21.060
BK: "Troublemaker"
is an amusing term for me,

00:31:21.084 --> 00:31:23.541
and I think my parents
would get a kick out of that.

00:31:23.565 --> 00:31:26.780
AG: Do you think you are one, though?
Or you became one in the Navy?

00:31:26.804 --> 00:31:28.502
BK: I think I became a troublemaker

00:31:28.526 --> 00:31:31.892
in the sense of challenging
established wisdom.

00:31:32.235 --> 00:31:35.481
AG: Ben may have been a sailor,
but he didn't start out as a pirate.

00:31:35.911 --> 00:31:38.609
BK: I was in a fraternity
that was known for its parties

00:31:38.633 --> 00:31:41.125
but was the guy doing
risk management on the outside,

00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:43.101
making sure nothing too crazy went down.

00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:46.770
AG: Ben became a naval aviator,
just like the pilots in "Top Gun."

00:31:46.794 --> 00:31:49.196
(Music from "Top Gun")

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.360
Their call signs were
"Maverick" and "Iceman."

00:31:54.021 --> 00:31:55.981
BK: My call sign was "Professor,"

00:31:56.005 --> 00:31:58.418
because I had this habit
of reading long books

00:31:58.442 --> 00:32:00.290
like "The American History of Law"

00:32:00.314 --> 00:32:02.125
and listening to classical music.

00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:04.228
AG: When Ben flew missions
as a naval pilot,

00:32:04.252 --> 00:32:06.355
he had a huge amount of autonomy.

00:32:06.379 --> 00:32:11.075
BK: Being a 27-year-old who's leading
two $65 million jets

00:32:11.099 --> 00:32:13.337
with, you know, 400- or 500-pound bombs,

00:32:13.361 --> 00:32:18.174
this is an incredible amount
of responsibility on a daily basis.

00:32:18.198 --> 00:32:20.188
You were the on-scene commander.

00:32:20.212 --> 00:32:22.672
AG: But when Ben came back
from overseas deployment,

00:32:22.696 --> 00:32:24.577
he started getting frustrated --

00:32:24.601 --> 00:32:26.704
frustrated that people
were getting rewarded

00:32:26.728 --> 00:32:29.226
based on seniority instead of performance,

00:32:29.616 --> 00:32:32.719
frustrated that people
were getting promoted for conformity

00:32:32.743 --> 00:32:34.695
instead of original thinking,

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:37.362
frustrated that
a field-tested combat pilot

00:32:37.386 --> 00:32:39.410
couldn't even have
a beer on a Friday night

00:32:39.434 --> 00:32:42.125
without seeking approval
from a senior commander.

00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:44.672
BK: You know, there's
five or six levels of approval.

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:47.485
Even if the first four people say yes,

00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:49.649
it only takes one veto to kill an idea.

00:32:49.673 --> 00:32:52.220
And so that becomes very discouraging,

00:32:52.244 --> 00:32:54.878
and you stop caring to some extent.

00:32:54.902 --> 00:32:57.593
AG: So Ben wrote an essay
for a military news site.

00:32:57.617 --> 00:32:59.074
He explained his frustration

00:32:59.098 --> 00:33:02.459
and challenged the Navy to start
supporting and promoting junior people

00:33:02.483 --> 00:33:04.188
with disruptive ideas.

00:33:04.212 --> 00:33:07.902
Piping up like that
is sort of not done in the military.

00:33:08.441 --> 00:33:10.594
BK: And I said some pretty
intemperate things,

00:33:10.618 --> 00:33:11.815
if I'm reflecting on it.

00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:14.371
But it got the attention
of a lot of senior officials

00:33:14.395 --> 00:33:16.982
who were aghast that I would write
something like this.

00:33:17.006 --> 00:33:19.966
AG: But some leaders
were open to Ben's perspective.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.934
A Navy admiral was setting up something
called a "rapid innovation cell."

00:33:23.958 --> 00:33:25.688
And he asked Ben to direct it.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.617
Now, to give you a sense for how slowly
the Navy adopts new technologies,

00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:34.994
some of their computers
are still running Windows 95.

00:33:35.018 --> 00:33:36.403
(Windows 95 "Ta-da!" sound)

00:33:36.427 --> 00:33:38.104
Yet, over the next year,

00:33:38.128 --> 00:33:41.644
Ben's rapid innovation cell
succeeded in getting 3-D printers

00:33:41.668 --> 00:33:42.889
installed on ships.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:45.514
They also tested a robot fish,

00:33:45.538 --> 00:33:49.693
affectionately named "Silent Nemo,"
for stealth underwater missions.

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:53.053
It looks like a tuna,
in case you were wondering.

00:33:54.244 --> 00:33:57.815
Ben fueled these advances with
the same strategies we saw at Pixar.

00:33:58.554 --> 00:34:00.905
His first step was to recruit black sheep.

00:34:01.577 --> 00:34:04.680
Many of them had been disciplined
for insubordination,

00:34:04.704 --> 00:34:07.427
like one guy who was fired
from a nuclear submarine

00:34:07.451 --> 00:34:08.896
for disobeying an order.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.640
BK: It ended up being one of the key
innovation catalysts.

00:34:12.664 --> 00:34:14.193
AG: How did you find them?

00:34:14.217 --> 00:34:16.950
Was that a signal that you were
deliberately looking for?

00:34:16.974 --> 00:34:19.625
"Let me just find a bunch of people
who are pissed off."

00:34:19.649 --> 00:34:20.807
BK: Yeah. (Laughs)

00:34:20.831 --> 00:34:26.711
If you had the guts and the willingness
to put your name onto an idea

00:34:26.735 --> 00:34:27.888
and publish it,

00:34:27.912 --> 00:34:30.133
that already set you apart from the crowd.

00:34:30.157 --> 00:34:34.704
And disruptors, while they're
lone wolves to some extent,

00:34:34.728 --> 00:34:36.461
they also find each other,

00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:40.287
whether it's in the cubicle next door
or the building across the way

00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:41.608
or even across the country.

00:34:41.632 --> 00:34:45.331
AG: Second, Ben gathered them together
to really listen to their frustrations,

00:34:45.355 --> 00:34:46.955
rather than squash them.

00:34:47.616 --> 00:34:50.088
BK: One of the phrases
that really makes me angry

00:34:50.112 --> 00:34:52.010
is when senior leaders say,

00:34:52.034 --> 00:34:53.387
"If you have a problem,

00:34:53.411 --> 00:34:55.788
don't tell it to me
unless you have a solution."

00:34:55.812 --> 00:34:58.457
Oftentimes, junior people
have lots of problems

00:34:58.481 --> 00:35:00.072
they don't know the solutions to,

00:35:00.096 --> 00:35:01.254
and they need guidance.

00:35:01.278 --> 00:35:05.084
This is untapped energy
that's just waiting to be unleashed.

00:35:05.108 --> 00:35:08.180
AG: Third, Ben rallied them
around a common enemy,

00:35:08.204 --> 00:35:10.192
in this case, middle managers.

00:35:10.593 --> 00:35:12.895
BK: We had this mismatch
between senior officers,

00:35:12.919 --> 00:35:16.276
who really and truly wanted
the crazy ideas,

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.544
with those below them who had a mandate
to slow those things down.

00:35:21.266 --> 00:35:23.402
And if we didn't get their approval,

00:35:23.426 --> 00:35:26.614
then we just jumped ahead of them
to their senior,

00:35:26.638 --> 00:35:28.441
who usually was in our favor.

00:35:28.465 --> 00:35:31.815
And you can use the bureaucracy
against itself in this sense,

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:34.378
because people will always fall in line.

00:35:36.204 --> 00:35:39.746
AG: In Ben's view, the lasting impact
of his work was in demonstrating

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.291
that this kind of innovation
could be fueled from the bottom up,

00:35:43.315 --> 00:35:45.381
by black sheep inside the Navy.

00:35:46.172 --> 00:35:49.226
They planted seeds for dozens of other
rapid innovation cells

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.680
across the military.

00:35:50.704 --> 00:35:55.166
BK: And so for me, the greatest success
is the mindset that it created

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.704
within a very bureaucratic organization:

00:35:57.728 --> 00:36:02.570
to take charge, to empower people
to run with an idea

00:36:02.594 --> 00:36:05.561
and build a community
of support around that

00:36:05.585 --> 00:36:09.960
and do it regardless of whether
or not you had official support.

00:36:14.132 --> 00:36:16.891
AG: Alright, as much as I love
this whole recipe,

00:36:16.915 --> 00:36:18.926
I have one little problem with it.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.617
You can only use it once.

00:36:21.274 --> 00:36:24.053
If you succeed, people
aren't underdogs anymore.

00:36:24.898 --> 00:36:26.558
That was Brad Bird's big challenge

00:36:26.582 --> 00:36:29.771
when it came time to make
a sequel to "The Incredibles."

00:36:29.795 --> 00:36:32.509
This time, the team was stacked
with hit makers.

00:36:32.533 --> 00:36:34.263
There was no common enemy.

00:36:34.287 --> 00:36:37.437
And they had three and a half
years to make the film.

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:40.810
It seems like it would have been harder
to frame the crew as underdogs,

00:36:40.834 --> 00:36:43.485
given how remarkably successful
the original movie was.

00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:46.462
BB: Except that they took a year
off of our schedule.

00:36:46.486 --> 00:36:48.518
And suddenly, we're the underdogs again.

00:36:48.542 --> 00:36:51.127
We had a hell of a mountain to climb

00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:54.331
that in many ways was taller
than our first one.

00:36:54.355 --> 00:36:58.055
NPG: The studio asked us
to release the film a year earlier

00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:00.260
than what we had originally planned.

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:01.720
A year is a lot.

00:37:01.744 --> 00:37:05.226
We tried to reestablish
that underdog theme.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.547
And taking a year off
the schedule sure helped.

00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:12.162
AG: That's one way to turn superstars
into underdogs again.

00:37:12.646 --> 00:37:16.678
But to make it work, the new challenge
has to be meaningful or exciting,

00:37:16.702 --> 00:37:18.852
not just an arbitrary burden.

00:37:19.448 --> 00:37:21.527
BB: You know,
there's an attitude out there,

00:37:21.551 --> 00:37:24.051
a bunch of people
with their arms folded, like,

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.934
"This better be good."

00:37:25.958 --> 00:37:27.109
You know?

00:37:27.133 --> 00:37:30.971
Which doesn't help inspire
you to do anything good.

00:37:30.995 --> 00:37:32.158
You know?

00:37:32.182 --> 00:37:36.526
But what is challenging is,
can you take a year off the schedule

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:39.661
and still come out with a great movie

00:37:39.685 --> 00:37:45.691
and come in on or under budget
and, you know, drop the mic?

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.212
AG: The team had the fuel they needed.

00:37:48.236 --> 00:37:50.836
It became a just-manageable difficulty.

00:37:51.228 --> 00:37:53.577
"Incredibles 2" grossed
over a billion dollars

00:37:53.601 --> 00:37:55.355
in its first two months alone,

00:37:55.379 --> 00:37:59.252
eclipsing the original film's
total theatrical revenues.

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:01.011
It was nominated for an Oscar

00:38:01.035 --> 00:38:04.125
and won the People's Choice Award
for Favorite Family Movie.

00:38:04.149 --> 00:38:07.386
BB: Yes, it's cool for adults and kids.

00:38:07.744 --> 00:38:10.014
AG: That's what a bunch
of black sheep can do.

00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:12.807
(Theme music)

00:38:17.044 --> 00:38:18.487
And, oh yeah --

00:38:18.511 --> 00:38:21.928
it's now the highest grossing
animated film in American history.

00:38:22.631 --> 00:38:26.132
Most importantly, it got six thumbs up
from my favorite experts.

00:38:26.606 --> 00:38:28.956
(Clip with kids) What
was the first thing you said

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.507
when we came out of the theater?

00:38:30.531 --> 00:38:32.465
Kid 2: I want to see it again and again.

00:38:32.489 --> 00:38:34.236
AG: How many times have you seen it?

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.412
Kid 1: Uh ... four?

00:38:35.436 --> 00:38:38.426
AG: You've seen it four times? Why?

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.704
Kid 1: Because I like it.

00:38:39.728 --> 00:38:41.847
Kid 2: I think it was twice
in the same week.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.966
AG: WorkLife is hosted by me, Adam Grant.

Next time on WorkLife.

00:39:45.565 --> 00:39:48.629
(Clip) Amy Cragg: We finished,
and I hear Shalane go,

00:39:48.653 --> 00:39:50.776
"That was hard. I taste blood."

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.180
And then she goes, "That's so awesome."

00:39:53.204 --> 00:39:54.506
I was like, "You know what?

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:57.035
I'm going to find out
exactly what I'm made of here."

00:39:57.059 --> 00:39:59.990
AG: Olympic rivals
and pretty good friends, too.

00:40:00.014 --> 00:40:02.880
We'll explore how to get
the best of both worlds.

00:40:05.998 --> 00:40:09.054

Daddy, I'm in your studio!

00:40:09.078 --> 00:40:10.633

00:40:10.657 --> 00:40:12.762
Kid 1: Is that a microphone?

00:40:12.786 --> 00:40:17.505

and my podcast is great!
