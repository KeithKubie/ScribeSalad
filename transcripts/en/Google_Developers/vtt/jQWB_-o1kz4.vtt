RICH HYNDMAN: Hello.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.060
I'm here to raise
awareness of the problem

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.430
of double-stacked phones in the
workplace, one for work data

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.750
and one for personal.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.660
Now, some occurrences
simply can't be avoided.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.240
But others can,
and they are just

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.810
instances of technology
getting in the way of life.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.600
Now, I'm going to get into
something more comfortable.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.580
That's better.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.440
Always nice to be in
something tailor made.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.350
At Google I/O last
year, we spoke

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.210
about enabling new features
for Android in the workplace.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.360
We also included some
new profile management

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.110
and Launcher APIs in Lollipop.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.030
It's all been
building up to this.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.850
I'm Rich Hyndman,
and I'm going to run

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.490
through the features
of Android for Work

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.410
and what it means
for developers,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.530
and how you can help
users avoid the curse

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.030
of the double-stacked phone.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.920
Android for Work transforms
workplace mobility

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.010
with enhanced security,
consistent management,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.290
and an open framework
for innovation.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.750
It supports corporate-owned
devices and the use

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.120
of personal devices at work.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.470
The latter's a bit more in-depth
for dev, so I'll focus on that.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.625
In either situation, it
is important for a company

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:06.210
to be able to install Enterprise
apps for their employees

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.540
and ensure their corporate
data is totally secure.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.030
But it's equally
important to remove access

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.542
to the information when
the employee leaves.

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:16.500
At the same time,
the user still wants

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.020
control over their device,
and Android for Work

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.850
solves it by allowing IT admins
to add a second user profile

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.880
owned by them onto the device.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.745
They manage it with
device policies.

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:30.240
And we call that profile
the Work profile or Managed

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.870
profile.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.220
For an improved user
experience, Android for Work

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.930
combines those two profiles
into a unified view

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.765
of both personal and work apps,
notifications, and recents.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.690
The work-related items are all
bunched up with the Android

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.670
for Work logo for
instant recognition.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.280
For developers, this opens up
some great new opportunities,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.270
like benefiting
from bulk orders,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.830
which easily enable installation
of your applications

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.690
across an entire enterprise.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.880
So what does it take
for your application

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.400
to be compatible with
Android for Work?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.770
Fortunately, not much.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.020
There's just a couple of things
that you need to be aware of.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.259
Firstly, as always
with device policies,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.850
they may restrict use
of some device features,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.772
like the camera.

00:02:11.772 --> 00:02:13.980
So please always ensure you
follow the best practices

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.000
and code defensively.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.880
Use the package manager to check
if a system feature exists.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.840
And if it does, then
just catch exceptions

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.130
when trying to use it.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.740
On a device with Managed
or Work profiles,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.530
IT admins can also
restrict specific intents

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.100
from passing from one
profile to another.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.510
In most cases, when an
intent is fired off,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.620
it's handled in
the same profile.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.890
If there's no handler for
the intent on that profile

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.170
and the IT admin has
blocked it, then the intent

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.220
is not going to be handled, and
the app may close unexpectedly.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.985
The profile
administrator can choose

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:48.110
which intents are allowed
to cross from one profile

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.940
to the other.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.150
And since the administrator
makes this decision,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.135
there's no way for you to know
in advance which intents are

00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:55.820
allowed and which aren't.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.470
The administrator
sets this policy

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.730
and is free to change
it at any time.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.130
The advice, same as before.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.094
Code defensively.

00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:04.510
Always check that
your intents can

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.320
resolve before firing them off.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.930
Otherwise, let the user know.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.744
The Managed profile
is sandboxed off.

00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:13.160
This means it doesn't have
access to the files in the User

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.750
profile and vice versa.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.170
It also means that you can
have the same app, your app,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.930
installed in both profiles,
like Gmail, with totally

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.342
separate accounts and data.

00:03:22.342 --> 00:03:24.930
Apps sometimes need to
provide other apps with access

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.170
to their files.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.210
For example, an image
gallery will share images

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.581
with social media
or an image editor.

00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.080
Now, there's two
ways you'd normally

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.200
share a file, with a file
URI or a content URI.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.940
And, of course,
the file URI isn't

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.490
going to work if you're
sharing to a Managed profile,

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.690
as the file space isn't shared.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.400
You should always
use content URIs

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.350
for sharing files between apps.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.350
It's also a recommended
method for sharing files

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.430
anyway, as it gives you
control over the access

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.970
rights and period, and
you don't potentially

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.880
leak access to other files.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.320
If your app is
sharing files, then

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.500
please check out our sharing
files training class.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.740
Finally, the same applies
when requesting files

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.130
from an intent, like
taking a picture.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.050
You specify content URI for the
camera to store the image in.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.472
So please don't
double-stack your phones,

00:04:10.472 --> 00:04:11.930
and don't make
others do it either.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.140
Follow these hints and
make sure your apps are

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.060
ready for Android Work.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.089
That's all for now.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.660
Just some best practices.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.390
But in the next Android
for Work DevByte,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.560
we're going to cover launches,
app restrictions, and testing.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.470
In the meantime, let's get busy.
