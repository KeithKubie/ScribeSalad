expression about that that I like to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
expression about that that I like to
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.330
expression about that that I like to
make which is that if we protect the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
make which is that if we protect the
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.400
make which is that if we protect the
living environment that's the rest of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
living environment that's the rest of
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.880
living environment that's the rest of
life you know a variety of it then we

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
life you know a variety of it then we
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250
life you know a variety of it then we
will automatically protect the physical

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
will automatically protect the physical
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.590
will automatically protect the physical
environment has a you know the base the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
environment has a you know the base the
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.770
environment has a you know the base the
physical and chemical material based on

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
physical and chemical material based on
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.620
physical and chemical material based on
which it exists because we have to do

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
which it exists because we have to do
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570
which it exists because we have to do
that in order to save the living

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
that in order to save the living
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.179
that in order to save the living
environment but if we only say the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
environment but if we only say the
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.640
environment but if we only say the
physical environment purify our water

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650
physical environment purify our water
 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.300
physical environment purify our water
control our use of irreplaceable

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
control our use of irreplaceable
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.170
control our use of irreplaceable
resources and so on fine enough food to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
resources and so on fine enough food to
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.830
resources and so on fine enough food to
feed everybody if we only do that then

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
feed everybody if we only do that then
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.530
feed everybody if we only do that then
and we don't pay attention to the living

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
and we don't pay attention to the living
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030
and we don't pay attention to the living
environment then eventually we're going

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
environment then eventually we're going
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910
environment then eventually we're going
to lose both

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.979
