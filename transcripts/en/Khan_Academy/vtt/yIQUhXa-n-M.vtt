00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.010
What I would like to explore in this
video, is to see if

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.480
we could figure out the derivative of Y is
with respect to X.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.090
If Y is equal to the inverse sine, the
inverse sine of X.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.280
And like always, I encourage you to pause
this

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.250
video and try to figure this out on your
own.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.670
And I will give you two hints.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.170
First hint is, well, we don't know what
the derivative of sine inverse of x is,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.950
but we do know what the si-, what the
derivative of the sine of something is.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.190
And so if you, maybe if you rearrange this
and use

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.360
some implicit differentiation, maybe you
can figure out what dy, dx is.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.140
Remember, this is right over here.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.100
This right over here is our goal.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.060
But, since you want to figure our the
derivative of this with respect to x.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.830
So, assuming you've had a go at it, so
let's work through this together.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.242
So, if y is the inverse sine of x, that's
just

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:58.750
like saying that, that's equivalent to
saying that sine of y.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.140
Sine of Y is equal to X.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.580
Sine of Y is equal to X.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.070
So now we have things that we're a little
bit more familiar

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.130
with, and now we can do a little bit of
implicit differentiation.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.665
We can take the derivative of both sides
with respect to X.

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:18.550
So, derivative of the left-hand side with
respect to X

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.570
and the derivative of the right-hand side
with respect to X.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.410
But what's the derivative of the left-hand
side with respect to X going to be?

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.480
And here we just apply the chain rule.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.020
It's going to be the derivative of sine of
Y with respect to Y.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.808
Which is going to be, which is going to be
cosine

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:41.950
of Y times the derivative of Y with
respect to X.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.140
So times dy, dx, times dy,dx.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.302
And the right-hand side, what's the
derivate of X with respect

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:55.190
to X, well that's obviously just going to
be equal to one.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.670
And so we could solve for dy,dx, divide
both sides by cosine of Y.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.419
And we get the derivative of Y with
respect

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:10.509
to X is equal to one over cosine of Y.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.490
Now this still isn't that satisfying cuz I
have the derivative in terms of Y.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.130
So let's see if we can re-express it in
terms of X.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.780
So, how could we do that?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.150
Well, we already know that X is equal to
sine of Y.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.950
Let me rewrite it.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.190
We already know that X is equal to sine of
Y.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.876
So, if we could rewrite this bottom

00:02:28.876 --> 00:02:31.080
expression in terms, instead of cosine of
Y.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.784
If we could use our trigonometric
identities

00:02:33.784 --> 00:02:35.633
to rewrite it in terms of sine of

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:40.260
Y, then we'll be in good shape because X
is equal to sine of Y.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.010
Well, how can we do that?

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.160
Well, we know from our trigonometric
identities, we know

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.520
that sine squared of Y plus cosine squared
of Y is equal to one.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.664
Or, if we want to solve for cosine of

00:02:54.664 --> 00:02:58.060
Y, subtract sine squared of Y from both
sides.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.400
We know that cosine squared of Y is equal
to one minus sine squared of Y.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.154
Or that cosine of Y, just take the
principal root of both sides,

00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:16.570
is equal to the principal root of one
minus sine squared of Y.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.097
So, we could rewrite this as being equal
to one over, one over, instead

00:03:23.097 --> 00:03:29.700
of cosine of Y, we could rewrite it as one
minus sine squared of Y.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.080
Now why is this useful?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.340
Well, sine of Y is just X.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.840
So this is the same if we just substitute
back in, let

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.220
me just write it that way so it's a little
bit clear.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.740
I could write it as sine Y squared.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.730
We know that this thing right over here is
X.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.670
So this is going to be equal to, and we
deserve a little bit of a drumroll.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.710
One over the square root of one minus,
instead of sin

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.610
of Y, we know that X is equal to sin of Y.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.184
So, one minus X squared.

00:03:56.184 --> 00:03:58.250
And so, there you have it.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.929
The derivative with respect to X of the
inverse sine of X is equal to one over

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:12.130
the square root of one minus X squared, so
let me just make that very clear.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.040
If you were to take the derivative with
respect to X of both sides of

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.746
this, you get dy,dx is equal to this on
the right-hand side.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:29.892
Or we could say the derivative with
respect to X of the inverse sine

00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:36.260
of X is equal to one over the square root
of one minus X squared.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.450
Now you could always reprove this if your
memory starts to fail

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.860
you, and actually, that is the best way to
really internalize this.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.433
But this is also just a good thing to
know, especially as we

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:48.319
start, as we go into more and more
calculus and you see, you might

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.521
see this in expression and you might say,
oh, okay, you know, that's

00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:54.750
the derivative of the inverse sine of X,
which might prove to be useful.
