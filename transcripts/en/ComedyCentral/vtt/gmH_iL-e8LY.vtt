00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.874
"I HAVE A DREAM"?
THIS IS TOTAL COMMUNIST STUFF.

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.910
IT ALL MAKES
SO MUCH SENSE

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.113
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:16.016
J. EDGAR HOOVER
CALLED A PRESS CONFERENCE,

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.486
AND HOOVER TELLS THESE REPORTERS
THAT HE'S INVITED,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.321
WHO ARE ALL WOMEN
FOR SOME REASON,

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.658
MARTIN LUTHER KING
IS THE MOST DISHONEST MAN

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.792
IN AMERICA.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.794
ONE OF HOOVER'S UNDERLINGS
IS SAYING,

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:29.263
[whispering]
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:31.965
TALK [bleep]
ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.867
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE NICE.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.037
AND HOOVER'S LIKE, [bleep] YOU,
I'M GONNA TELL THE TRUTH.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.174
THEY MEET
IN J. EDGAR HOOVER'S OFFICE.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.410
MARTIN LUTHER KING SAYS,
HEY, J. EDGAR HOOVER,

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.879
I LOVE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE EVER DONE.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:50.184
MAYBE WE COULD
JUST BE BETTER TEAMMATES

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.854
SO WE CAN ACHIEVE PEACE
THROUGHOUT AMERICA.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.658
AFTER THOSE FIRST TWO MINUTES,
J. EDGAR HOOVER DECIDED,

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:59.826
DUDE,
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.696
IT'S MY TURN TO SAY
WHAT'S ON MY MIND.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.300
THE FBI DOES THIS.
THE FBI DOES THAT.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.736
THE FBI IS HELPING YOU HERE.
THE FBI IS HELPING YOU THERE.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.075
AND HE JUST GOES ON AND ON
AND ON AND ON

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.945
ABOUT HOW AWESOME THE FBI IS.

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:20.480
AND AFTERWARDS, ONE OF
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S FRIENDS

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:21.748
CALLS HIM AND SAYS,

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:24.852
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE,
MEETING WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING?

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.253
[laughs]
I'M SORRY.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.288
THAT'S HOW DRUNK I AM.

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:29.990
OKAY.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.092
MEETING
WITH J. EDGAR HOOVER?

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.429
AND MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS LIKE,
DUDE, I'LL TELL YOU.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:39.900
J. EDGAR HOOVER, HE'S JUST
A OLD MAN WHO TALKS TOO MUCH.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.935
HE'S CRAZY.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.106
J. EDGAR HOOVER WAS LISTENING
TO EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:49.109
HE WAS LIKE,
WHAT THE [bleep]?
