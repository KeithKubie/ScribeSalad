particular development challenges I mean

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230
particular development challenges I mean
 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.430

Africa the reason it's in the problem in

Africa the reason it's in the problem in
the difficulty that is is because it's

the difficulty that is is because it's
 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.140
the difficulty that is is because it's
really a number of these countries are

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150
really a number of these countries are
 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.290
really a number of these countries are
really stuck in a poverty trap some of

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300
really stuck in a poverty trap some of
 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.229
really stuck in a poverty trap some of
that is due to the very you know

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239
that is due to the very you know
 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.360
that is due to the very you know
difficult environment they're working in

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370
difficult environment they're working in
 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.330
difficult environment they're working in
whether that's a physical environment

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
whether that's a physical environment
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.000
whether that's a physical environment
but which has a you know a burden of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010
but which has a you know a burden of
 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.040
but which has a you know a burden of
disease like malaria and and other

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050
disease like malaria and and other
 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.160
disease like malaria and and other
problems but there's other problems of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170
problems but there's other problems of
 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.200
problems but there's other problems of
sheer economic underdevelopment very

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210
sheer economic underdevelopment very
 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.729

poor infrastructure in many parts of

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739
poor infrastructure in many parts of
 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.450
poor infrastructure in many parts of
Africa so again it's a matter of trying

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460
Africa so again it's a matter of trying
 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.389
Africa so again it's a matter of trying
to you know find ways of getting people

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399
to you know find ways of getting people
 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.040
to you know find ways of getting people
out of this poverty trap and onto the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050
out of this poverty trap and onto the
 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.020
out of this poverty trap and onto the
development ladder and that has been

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030
development ladder and that has been
 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.359
development ladder and that has been
happening increasingly I mean it's wrong

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369
happening increasingly I mean it's wrong
 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.490
happening increasingly I mean it's wrong

Africa is is a basket pace case there

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990
Africa is is a basket pace case there
 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.780
Africa is is a basket pace case there
are many countries in Africa over the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790
are many countries in Africa over the
 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.969
are many countries in Africa over the
past ten years that have been growing at

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979
past ten years that have been growing at
 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.740
past ten years that have been growing at
quite respectable rates five six seven

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750
quite respectable rates five six seven
 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.800
quite respectable rates five six seven
percent per annum and it's trying to

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810
percent per annum and it's trying to
 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.140
percent per annum and it's trying to
build on that while recognizing that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150
build on that while recognizing that
 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.020
build on that while recognizing that
there are certain countries certain

there are certain countries certain
problem areas where you know unless you

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909
problem areas where you know unless you
 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.530
problem areas where you know unless you
tackle issues like governance and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
tackle issues like governance and
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.060
tackle issues like governance and
dealing with the conflict problem you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070
dealing with the conflict problem you
 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.920
dealing with the conflict problem you
can't even start out on the road to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930
can't even start out on the road to
 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.410
can't even start out on the road to
development and that is for example in

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420
development and that is for example in
 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.929
development and that is for example in
the case of the likes of Darfur and Chad

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939
the case of the likes of Darfur and Chad
 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.950
the case of the likes of Darfur and Chad
and at another level I mean particularly

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
and at another level I mean particularly
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.969
and at another level I mean particularly
particularly bad cases obviously

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979
particularly bad cases obviously
 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.810

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.030
 
well clearly there needs to be political

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040
well clearly there needs to be political
 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.890
well clearly there needs to be political
change I mean that's the first and i

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900
change I mean that's the first and i
 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.090
change I mean that's the first and i
would say fundamental fundamental

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
would say fundamental fundamental
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.580
would say fundamental fundamental
requirement and i note that in recent

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590
requirement and i note that in recent
 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.920
requirement and i note that in recent
days President Bush is called for mr.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930

Mugabe to resign a number of other

Mugabe to resign a number of other

Mugabe to resign a number of other
leaders who have done the same and I

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459
leaders who have done the same and I
 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.240
leaders who have done the same and I
think that's an indispensable first step

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
think that's an indispensable first step
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.210
think that's an indispensable first step
if and hopefully when that happens then

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220
if and hopefully when that happens then
 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.060
if and hopefully when that happens then
there is a question of can be ghetto a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070
there is a question of can be ghetto a
 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.130
there is a question of can be ghetto a
serious political settlement within the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140
serious political settlement within the
 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.810
serious political settlement within the
country of people agreeing to work

country of people agreeing to work
 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.900
country of people agreeing to work
together and then what needs to be done

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910
together and then what needs to be done
 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.030
together and then what needs to be done
is that you know a program of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
is that you know a program of
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.940
is that you know a program of
rehabilitation to be put in place with

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
rehabilitation to be put in place with
 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.360
rehabilitation to be put in place with
substantial international assistance but

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370
substantial international assistance but
 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.190
substantial international assistance but
you know I do think an indispensable

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200
you know I do think an indispensable
 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.710
you know I do think an indispensable
first step is for President Mugabe to

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720
first step is for President Mugabe to
 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.080
first step is for President Mugabe to
step down
