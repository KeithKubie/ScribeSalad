00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Love is an intense and life-changing experience.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
Some of them believe in true love,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.965
while others claim that it's a deep, unconditional feeling.

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:10.600
Sounds over the top, right?

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:11.600
Either way,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.000
people go "gaga" over it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.700
After all,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.175
what's life without love?

00:00:16.205 --> 00:00:18.725
Here are 5 interesting facts about love.

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:22.175
1. It only takes 4 minutes to

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:24.945
decide whether you like someone or not.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.985
This actually has very little to do with smooth talking

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:30.600
and other conventional flirting techniques.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.800
In fact, it's mostly dependent on body language,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.300
the tone and speed of our voice.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.985
Only 7% of what we say actually matters.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.265
2. Your nerve cells work better during the first year

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:45.300
of being in a loving relationship.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.200
Everyone's bodies contain a protein called

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.700
"Nerve Growth Factor,"

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.795
which is responsible for the functioning of some of our sensory nerves.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.300
This protein tends to work more effectively during

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.125
the first year that you're in love with someone.

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:02.635
When we're in love, our senses are heightened,

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:05.700
and our "Fight or Flight" response system is on-guard.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.200
It's the most optimal during the early stages of love,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200
which is why couples in love feel

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.800
more happy and optimistic.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Falling in love can be as addictive as nicotine.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.600
Have you heard of dopamine?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
Most people who've heard of it knows that it involves good feelings.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.000
They're exactly right.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.100
Dopamine is a chemical that's released during

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700
the initial stage of the relationships.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.985
It's responsible for the rush of pleasure

00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:33.575
and excitement we often experience.

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:37.100
Since dopamine's also activated when you use nicotine,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.500
you can imagine how addictive love can be.

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:44.600
4. Many adolescents who experience puppy crushes,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.265
also experience a lot of anxiety.

00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:50.335
Teenagers often get a bad rep from popular culture,

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:53.155
for being rebellious and over idealistic

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:54.200
about their future.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.600
But parents, and adults should be more considerate

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.400
when teenagers experience puppy crushes.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.295
According to Dr. Carl Pickhardt from Psychology Today,

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:06.800
the awakening of romantic feelings can cause

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.475
significant anxiety

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:11.755
and those who are still trying to figure out their own identity.

00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:15.205
If you're sensitive about the way others perceive you,

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:18.195
and want to have a strong desire to belong,

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:20.255
your desire for intimate attachment

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:23.000
and bonding could lead to anxiety about

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.500
potentially losing it.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.000
5. True love is friendship set on fire.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.595
Thanks to Hollywood, people mistake fighting and make-up sex

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.500
for true, passionate love.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.105
But, according to research, true love manifests

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:39.625
as supporting one another's interests,

00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:40.800
growing together,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.300
and being considerate of each other's feelings.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.200
In other words, you're besties!

00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:49.000
Despite all the research done on love,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.195
to this day, it still remains an enigma.

00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:54.955
