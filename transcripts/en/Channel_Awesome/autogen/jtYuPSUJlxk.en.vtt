at that moment she felt it was worth
 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.920
at that moment she felt it was worth
fighting for and going to prison and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930
fighting for and going to prison and
 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.050

but they showed so much I mean they
 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.400
but they showed so much I mean they
showed his friggin dreams of what he was

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410
showed his friggin dreams of what he was
 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.570

at that spot so you know to me I could
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.030
at that spot so you know to me I could
use just a little bit more and it seemed

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040
use just a little bit more and it seemed
 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.800
use just a little bit more and it seemed
more like they're going for the shock of

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810
more like they're going for the shock of
 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.170
more like they're going for the shock of
it uh and I think for care do you

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180
it uh and I think for care do you
 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.130
it uh and I think for care do you
develop so much the shock isn't as

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140
develop so much the shock isn't as
 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.900
develop so much the shock isn't as
powerful or at least not for me because

and for me I could kind of see it coming
mostly because of that reason that they

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810
mostly because of that reason that they
 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.390
mostly because of that reason that they
didn't dive into what he was thinking

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400
didn't dive into what he was thinking
 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.740
