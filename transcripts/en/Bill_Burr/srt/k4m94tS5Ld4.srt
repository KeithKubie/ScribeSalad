1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,440
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:07,010
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and ahhh.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,770
Just checking in on you. I'm just
checking in on you. How are Ya?

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,760
How's it going? I'm actually doing great
despite the, uh, that cough I just did.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,220
There wasn't a real cough. I
just, you know, I've, I've,

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,430
I've run out of unique ways to
say I'm just checking in on you.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,670
I try to do it a little bit
differently and I, I got nothing left.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,160
I don't know what you want from
me. Um, anyway, so let's get on.

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,550
Let's get on with the podcast here.
You know, this is just a quick one.

10
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:39,320
This isn't even an official podcast,

11
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,480
despite the fact that I have
fucking advertising on it.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,600
It's not an official one.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,340
That's just me just poking my head
into a little office into your little

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,450
cubicle, any living room, if
you're unemployed or maybe a,

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,160
you're living off a trust.
Yeah,

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,590
it's a great big shout out to anybody
just sitting around living off a trust,

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,290
you know, when are you going to do
today? I go down to the art store,

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,620
get yourself an Easel, you know,
little canvas, dark painting.

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,790
That's what people do. You know
when you're like super fucking rich,

20
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:15,330
there's no reason for you to go outside
the business. No fucking reason. And I,

21
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:20,000
I really can't stand when people judge,
you know,

22
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,910
trust fund babies.
I feel that's like one of the,

23
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:25,850
one of the biggest issues that this
country is dealing with right now.

24
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:30,650
We see harsh judgment of
trust fund babies, you know,

25
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,500
I mean anybody can be
fucking broke and be like,

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,680
look at that rich conscious sitting
over there doing nothing. What a waste.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,040
What a waste of a fucking life.
You know? Let me tell you this.

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,900
She was subway sandwich, eating
judgmental. Fuck. Let me ask you this.

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,660
If you were in that situation,
what would you be doing?

30
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,040
Cause I could tell you what I would be
doing the exact same fucking thing and

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,020
all you fucking people on your high horse.

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,190
No Dude, I could do it. You know
I one of those people, you know,

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,710
people know that people know me.

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,720
I have to wake up with a purpose.
If I don't have a purpose in life,

35
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:07,450
shut the fuck up your bills.
All right?

36
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,270
That's what you're doing and you're
walking out the door and you chasing the

37
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:13,690
fucking Keratin. Someday you're
dreaming it. Dream that that care,

38
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:18,400
it's not going to be there. You want
to be that easeful guy. You know?

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,260
Look at George Bush,
man.

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,740
Do you ever see a guy enjoying not
being president more than that guy?

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,770
He's actually good at what he does. He's
not a trust fund baby either, by the way.

42
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,980
I'm just saying,
you know he's actually good at it.

43
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,180
Just sits there.
I wonder what he thinks about just,

44
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,890
there's no way to be present
when you leave as president,

45
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,250
you have dead bodies on your conscience
or the you made the right decision or

46
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:45,340
the wrong decision.

47
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:49,270
At some point you add to shoot off
some missiles because who's kidding?

48
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,990
Who America is the world's babysitter.

49
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,730
Okay.
We know what we know what's best for you.

50
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,663
Okay,

51
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,580
and what is best for you is to do what
we say and give us your natural resources

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,080
as we pretend to care about your people.

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,820
Okay?
It's like a lifetime movie.

54
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,540
Everybody's acting like
something special's happening
at the end of the day was

55
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,890
wasn't that really just a bunch of
shit so you could fucking make money?

56
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,530
Isn't that what it was?
I have no idea what I'm talking about.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,410
I'm talking about trust fund babies
and I'm sick of the judgment of a boot

58
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,500
judges a baby, first of all,
kind of a fucking person.

59
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:37,350
You maybe that's why God didn't give
you money. You have to think about that.

60
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's called Karma.

61
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,560
Isn't that the most overused
working expression Karma?

62
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,640
This is my theory on Karma.
Karma gets you. Unless you,

63
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,180
unless you don't give a fuck.
If you don't give a fuck and you don't,

64
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,920
if you truly don't give a shit,

65
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,940
you got to have like a level of guilt
for common to come back and bite you in

66
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:03,630
the ass. But if you just some fucking
entitled con you, those people,

67
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:08,580
they'd skate through life.
You know, you ever see him,

68
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,310
you ever seen entitled can
just walk across the room.

69
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,220
It's like he has those little kids
shoes on and have the wheels on them.

70
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,250
You know, I take two steps.
They just glide across the room.

71
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,960
They don't care about breaking hearts.
They don't care about evicting people.

72
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,043
All right?

73
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,490
They don't give a shit who fucking
sewed their shirt together that out.

74
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,170
What does that endangered species
throw it on the grill. They don't care.

75
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,540
You know, there's a genius to that. Just
not giving a shit. You know what I mean?

76
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,250
I'd love to see one of those people,
you know,

77
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,600
in the afterlife if you have to get,

78
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,170
if you actually get judged just to
see the fucking look in the face,

79
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:46,830
you know what I mean?

80
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,340
And then God at some point would have
to feel some sort of shame being like,

81
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:54,060
well, you know, at the end of the day
I assembled that. You know what I mean?

82
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,750
That's why I've never understood about
the judgment. It's just like, you know,

83
00:04:57,751 --> 00:05:02,751
especially with these fucking sociopath's
as opposed to the levelheaded saint

84
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,380
that I am, these fucking, these
fucking sociopath's out there.

85
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,490
Like, where does, you
know, shouldn't you know,

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,350
shouldn't you be judging God on that one?
Gingy be looking up like really,

87
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,380
you know,
what are you doing blow last night?

88
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,360
Yeah.

89
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,200
You forgot to put the A, I give a shit
about other people assembly into this one

90
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,500
just fucking senate out there.
I don't know. The more I,

91
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:35,070
I vaguely pay attention to
all that space shit. You know,

92
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,530
I hate people who are in
this space by the way.

93
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,410
There was talking about do you
understand and you can keep looking.

94
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,590
It's like, yes. Yeah, I
get it. I get it. You don't
understand. Is We fucking, we've,

95
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:50,220
we've, we've seen how gigantic it
is yet. We haven't found anything.

96
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:52,320
So I still think this
place is pretty amazing.

97
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,940
Is Fascinating as Mars is.
There's this nothing to do.

98
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,850
I don't understand these fucking people
that want to go to Mars and live there

99
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,170
and it's like,
and do what?

100
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,663
Huh?

101
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,470
Living some fucking strip mall
for the rest of your life.

102
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,510
Some star trek looking strip mall.

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,640
Yeah.

104
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,530
Fucking drinking Tang just so
you can say, Oh yeah, you know,

105
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,410
that's your big fucking move that,
you know, people want to live on Mars.

106
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,390
That means they suck at everything else
in life. Right? They got enough of that.

107
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,350
You know? You know what it
is. You graduate high school,

108
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:31,170
you want to come back someday,
right? Smoking a big cigar going,

109
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:36,070
hey, you know, yeah, I was at guy
used to push around the playground,

110
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:38,860
but you know what I did
right? I went, I did things,

111
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,750
I did digs and now I smoke this and
I drive that and see that over there.

112
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:48,120
That's fucking me admitted. I matter.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,950
So usually in this day and age, that means
you're going to try to create an APP,

114
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,330
right? You've got no Fuckin, I
don't know, get some sort of,

115
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:02,950
you start a website,

116
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,810
will you curate videos and fucking news?

117
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,570
I don't know what these fucking
millennials do, but I think if you,

118
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:14,090
if you suck at that, right?
You can't play an instrument

119
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,300
and you ego cannot just handle just
being happy with what you have.

120
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,070
I think at that point it's like I can't
just go back to my high school reunion,

121
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,130
just being in some regular Joe

122
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,540
Waking up in the morning,
putting my coffee in, my thermos,

123
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,730
going into the shower and quietly crying
was the water cascades over my face and

124
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,390
my wife comes walking and going to Uri
just be like, yeah, it just, I was,

125
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,640
I just sneezed. I'm fine.
Just washing my face.

126
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,070
All right.
I think at some point,

127
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,520
either you just fucking given
and just say, hey man, you
know, being a regular guy,

128
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,260
he's kind of fucking cool, you
know, or you can't handle it.

129
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,820
Right. They should mind me.
I'd never seen a few good men.

130
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,530
You get hurdle the truth,
you know, there's too many,

131
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,540
too much gritten a teeth in that
movie. That's right. Ice Man.

132
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,100
I am dangerous. Right. Too much of that
shit. So I never watched it. You know,

133
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,790
which people walking around
dressed in fucking then

134
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,830
little navy suits. Um, anyways,

135
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,640
he can't fucking handle it and you
got to go back to your high school,

136
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,500
you and you're got to do something.
And I think at that point,

137
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,280
that's when you just say, listen,
I, I, I got to live on Mars.

138
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,930
I mean, I can't go back with nothing.
I got to have something to say.

139
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,050
That's like Lance Bass,
he couldn't handle that.

140
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:43,910
Justin Timberlake walked away from,
from in sync.

141
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,470
Right.
Ah,

142
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,400
want it that way or whatever
the fuck they sing that song.

143
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,760
They all acted like puppets.
Right. He just fucking walked away,

144
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,970
you know, and got the
one guy, the goatee guy,

145
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,810
he's got a sense of humor about himself.
He makes all these funny commercials.

146
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:05,010
He'll do a thing. He doesn't give a fuck.
Right. You've got the dreadlock guy.

147
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,640
Then he used to bang Jennifer Aniston.
Or was that the other guy who,

148
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:13,350
some white guy with dreadlocks used to
go out with Jennifer Aniston, you know,

149
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,430
every be one of those beautiful
celebrities always dates a guy.

150
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,310
And he always have that, that, that
really, you got that moment like, wow,

151
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,870
why didn't I learn how to right fucking
play the Ukulele and wear flip flops?

152
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:29,400
That's what I had to do. Fucking walking
around with your goddamn man tits. Um,

153
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,900
anyway, sorry. And I think Lance
Gonadal, he's just like, what the fuck,

154
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,210
you know, so then annexing, you know,

155
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:41,030
he's signing up to go out and
space to somehow try and outdo, oh,

156
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,850
what'd you put you put out
future sexy songs? Huh? Wait,

157
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,610
wait, wait. Right, wait,
wait, wait, wait man.

158
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm going to outer space.
What?

159
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,980
Oh, what is it about wearing your pajamas
in the middle of the day? That just,

160
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:07,570
it just fucking opens your mind up.
You know what I mean? I swear to God

161
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,570
there is no free of feeling
that being a white male,

162
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:16,470
heterosexual still in your pajamas at
11 o'clock in the morning on a weekday,

163
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,210
on a weekday. And you know what,
cause I'm a liberal country,

164
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,410
I want everyone to experience that,
you know,

165
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,580
all the people in the Philippines.
Um,

166
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,420
anyways, uh, I'm actually,

167
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm in a giddy mood cause I did something
yesterday that scared the living shit

168
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:37,440
out of me and I didn't die,
which is all, you know,

169
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:41,310
obviously cause I'm doing
this podcast. So, you know,

170
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,420
I hadn't flown a helicopter, uh,
since like October until this month.

171
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,810
And I flew for the first time and I could
not believe how fucking rusty I was.

172
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:52,230
How much? Just Shit. You forget.
You're like, what? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

173
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,960
Oh yeah, that's right. You know,

174
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,120
turn a bass tournament final.
I didn't even slow down.

175
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,770
I was so busy trying to keep the fucking
pad between the compass, you know?

176
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,060
And the dashboard day I came out with
the fuck called the control panel that I

177
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:14,650
forgot I was still doing like 65
knots and I fucking went right by it.

178
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,130
I had to slam on the brakes. Right.
So, but you know, I flew around,

179
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,800
she'll kick off the Russia, he's coming
around, it's coming around, you know.

180
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,570
So I went,
I went again yesterday and uh,

181
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,540
went up with my instructor and he was
like, so what do you want to do? I said,

182
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,060
all right, let's do the pattern.
Let's fly the traffic pattern.

183
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:38,170
Let's do some auto sets where they
simulate a main road of failure.

184
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,120
That's the big fan above your head.
Like,

185
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:43,900
what if all of a sudden the
engine cuts up, you know, um,

186
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,490
and then those kicks left. What do you
do? You slammed the collective down ad,

187
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,820
right pedal, right trim, air speed,
rpm. Here come the rpms coming up,

188
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:54,070
you pull the collective up, he
catch fucking things, you pick

189
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,750
up your spot. So we were doing those and
at some point I was just like, all right,

190
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,760
fuck this. Okay. Um, I,

191
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,440
I have to fly this thing by myself
or solo is they saying the business,

192
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:09,130
but I'm just a novice. So I said,
all right. He goes, well, okay,

193
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,560
we did a couple of those. He goes, what
do you want to do now? I said, all right,

194
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,453
can,
uh,

195
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,840
can you just step out and let me just
fly this thing around one time by myself

196
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,360
just to do it again? And
he goes, yeah, absolutely.

197
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,620
So he steps out and up to that point,
it's been a great day. You know,

198
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,280
not a lot of traffic over there.
Everything's fucking fine. So he gets out,

199
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,030
roll it back up. You know, lights are out,

200
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:35,030
our PM's are in the green gauges.
Roe, green cabaret heats up.

201
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:40,010
I fucking lift up light on the skids,
bring it up, bump, holding a hover.

202
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:43,770
Here we go. Here we go. Cyclic.
Wait for it. Wait for it.
Less weight in the fucking,

203
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,620
yeah, thank you. No
fucking palms are sweating.

204
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,340
You know there's always said done.

205
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:52,740
I can't believe I actually fucking
know how to do this thing right.

206
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,500
So immediately there's a
fucking crosswind. So I'm
looking at the wind sock. Oh,

207
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,810
you fucking content. Fight it. Left
pedal. Now I'm facing the winds.

208
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,780
Everything's fine.
And next thing you know,

209
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:08,830
like fucking like three jet blue's
are taken off at southwest is landing.

210
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,070
You know, I made my call and the
guy's like, you know, whatever,

211
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:16,870
fucking six Victor Hotel, stand by,
stand by means shut the fuck up.

212
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:17,830
I always forget that.

213
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,230
Cause then I would go six tricks
through hotels standing by.

214
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,370
So I'm fucking sitting there. I felt
like I was in a harbor for 20 minutes.

215
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,430
What I really wanted to have happen.

216
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,380
It was just like one of those things
where it's like, all right, fuck this up,

217
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,930
fill in this rolled out, have him
step out. I fucking roll back up,

218
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,240
lifted off.
As for clarity,

219
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,640
gives it to me and I just take
it for a lap around the airport.

220
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:46,820
That's all I wanted to do.
So now I'm fucking sitting
in this Harvard just going,

221
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:50,130
Jesus Christ.
Now I'm thinking,

222
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,250
what the fuck am I doing?

223
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,740
So finally he called, yeah, go fuck go.

224
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:04,200
Six Victor Hotel. I left closed
traffic. I've cleared for takeoff cliff,

225
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,000
take off six Victor Hotel. And
then I uh, I fucking took off,

226
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,760
brought it around and when I was
turning across, when you know,

227
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,740
I'm looking for traffic,
did join the downwind,

228
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,210
make sure I don't have any problems. I
was actually thinking like, you know,

229
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:22,950
last night I did stand up dressed is
Steven Adler at the goddamn comedy jam.

230
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,340
I tried out a new fucking bit about
blow up dolls that was killing so hard.

231
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:29,570
I looked over and Josh,

232
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:33,620
Adam Meyers was fucking die in laughing
on the side of the stage. It's so,

233
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:35,000
as much as you make people laugh,

234
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:37,420
when you look over and you see a
fellow comedian dying laughing,

235
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,510
you know you're onto something. So then
I went back and I got to play rhinos,

236
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,320
sore dressed as Steven Adler sound,
the sound guy.

237
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,720
Now I would have dressed up as Matt
camera, but he's just, you know,

238
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,100
he doesn't have any unique facial hair.
He's got that sorted out. Luke haircut.

239
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,420
I just want to look like me with
this stupid wig on, you know? Um,

240
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,950
and then I got to play the encore
paradise city and I was thinking,

241
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:04,250
I fucking did that. I did stand
up and play drums live last night.

242
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,940
It right now I'm flying
a helicopter by myself

243
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,350
and I flunked so much shit in high school,
terrible at math,

244
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,950
fucking flood French,
all of that shit

245
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,680
was a great feeling. And I was
like, Oh yeah, that's right.
I'm flying a helicopter.

246
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:29,150
So I get to the downwind, you know,
red, you go across three zero,

247
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,450
you bring your fucking carburetor heat up.
See if you're fucking carburetor.

248
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:36,680
Doesn't freeze over in the engine,
doesn't cut out as you slowing down.

249
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,210
Came around,
still pulling power kit,

250
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:41,510
my 60 knots as I turned the
fucking base in the file.

251
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,160
K right in layette.
Set that thing down nicely.

252
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,090
And uh, they're, my instructor
came back in and just, you know,

253
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:54,440
plugs his headphones in. He goes,
he goes, uh, how did that feel?

254
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,700
I said, hey, you know, I said it was like
riding a bike except you could kill you

255
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,993
self.

256
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,860
I started laughing.

257
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,430
And what I've found with instructors
is they're all bad ass guys.

258
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,000
Every one of them chicks, they're
all fucking bad assets, you know.

259
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
But the second you admit that you're
actually scared, they always laugh.

260
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,560
And then they usually tell you a story
how fucking nervous that they weren't.

261
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:19,020
But if you have some fucking cocky cunt,
um,

262
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,580
you don't want to do that.

263
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,130
Cause then what they're
gonna do is they're going to
chop throttle on you as you

264
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:24,990
fucking doing some stuff here.
And I don't need that,

265
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,180
even though it's good training. I've
never had anybody do that to me. Um,

266
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,701
but anyways,

267
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:34,230
so I did it and it made me
feel a fucking amazing man,

268
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,200
just like the sickest goddamn feeling.
And I swear to God,

269
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,380
all I need to do is make
like another $40 million.

270
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:43,680
And I think I could actually afford
to truly engage in that hobby.

271
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,930
I in La,
it's just super expensive.

272
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:50,630
I think if you live more
in the middle of nowhere,

273
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,660
the big fucking thing is like just
storing the goddamn whatever you get the

274
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,720
plane or the helicopter.
Um,

275
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,570
I don't know if anybody knows like a
cheap way to do it. I would absolutely,

276
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,240
uh, absolutely do it. But until then,

277
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:11,750
I'm just treating it like the way I
treat cars. Like I just go on the road,

278
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,470
you know, I go to budget
and then that's it. I just,

279
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:19,740
whatever fucking car they give me, I get
it. And I gotta be honest with you. I,

280
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,310
that's the one thing that bugs
me about renting helicopters.

281
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:25,490
And every time you fucking go in there,
eh, something's a little different.

282
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,290
You know, just be nice to
know you fucking tail number.

283
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,930
Not have to fucking constantly
be looking on the control panel.

284
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,000
Know where everything is,
know how everything works.

285
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:38,240
Every radio seems to be a little bit
different. It's just like a fucking,

286
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,150
it's just that extra thing.
You got to like deal with it.

287
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:46,070
I wish I didn't and I'd love to just
buy one of those fucking are 20 twos.

288
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,420
You know, they're funny as hell. They
just a little to cdot, right? Any,

289
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:52,520
you're really flying it.

290
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,890
It's like if you had a car that just
had drum brakes and no power steering,

291
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,410
like you really fucking,
you know, are holding up.

292
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,100
This is just what I've heard from other
pilots cause I've never flown anything

293
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:04,690
fancy, nothing fancy. Like, um,

294
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,560
but I really fucking enjoyed it.
And, uh, just even doing that,

295
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:11,020
I mean that how long it
takes to fly the pattern.

296
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,513
MMM.

297
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,300
I mean that couldn't have been more than
like felt like 90 seconds who probably,

298
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:21,480
maybe it was a little bit
longer. I don't know. But, uh,

299
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,000
yeah,

300
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,950
I dunno. It's just fucking definitely
left the place yesterday. You know,

301
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,020
that's one of those things where you'd
get did something great and you're

302
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,260
driving away and he got the window
down just driving right. Gone.

303
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,020
So anyways, you guys been
watching the playoffs? Yeah,

304
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,010
I'd say for first round playoffs.

305
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,430
I'll tell you the series I'm
watching obviously, and I'll say,

306
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,740
I'll tell you again, I'm just going
to keep saying, I'll tell you,

307
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,190
I'll tell you I'm watching
those Celtics and the bowls, um,

308
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,260
Celtics are now up three games
to two after being down. Oh, too.

309
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,010
After looking like we had
no fucking answers. Right.

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,571
And,
uh,

311
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:07,571
which is why my nod for MVP of the
series is Rondo without a doubt.

312
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,790
Because the second he went down the
series just completely changed. Yeah.

313
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,143
MMM.

314
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,500
And I thought all of the Bulls had,
is figured out,

315
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,680
but evidently it was rando he
knew what the fuck was going on.

316
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm giving them full fucking
credit because it's just,

317
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,460
it's been a tale of two cities.

318
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,803
You know,

319
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,620
they looked like they were going to sweep
us and now it looks like we're going

320
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,200
to run the table on them. However,
however, I think Rondo is coming back.

321
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,090
He took his cast off,
his suits,

322
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:42,540
have long sleeves again and um,

323
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,110
I can't wait to watch games.
Six I want to see like,

324
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:49,320
is this guy is good is it appears in this,

325
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,020
in this series at last night,

326
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:56,130
admittedly the officiating was a little
subpar and it definitely went in the

327
00:19:56,131 --> 00:20:00,620
Celtics favor and I loved with Lopez
was applauding the fucking refs.

328
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:04,500
Sometimes it's worth getting a fucking
technical. I love that guy, man.

329
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,030
That guy comes out every night, wants
to play. He's a little fucking weird.

330
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,910
He's on his own vibe. He just,
I, I really liked that guy.

331
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,610
I love when he fucking started clapping.

332
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,350
It's like my favorite thing.
And then they go to,

333
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,260
I think it actually works
because then we went down,

334
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,580
they called the ticky tack fall on the
other end and you saw Dwayne Wade was

335
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:30,210
whatever the Celtic said to him. I
think it might've been, uh, Isaiah,

336
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,780
he just started smiling and
laughing. I swear to God, man,

337
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,470
I just think the NBA is
so fucking controlled.

338
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,330
Okay.

339
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,670
I really do. Just for the
simple fact that you can do it.

340
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:43,870
I've said this a zillion times,

341
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,950
there is no easier game to
control or fix than basketball

342
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,310
cause it's the only fucking game
where you can sit down as a ref.

343
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,340
You can take people out of
the game, you know? I mean,

344
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,970
I guess all the games you can object
somebody, but they, you know in baseball,

345
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,370
football, hockey, you
really have to do something.

346
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,370
You just can't point at a guy and be like,
hey go sit on the fucking bench.

347
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,230
Well I guess you can in hockey.
Right.

348
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,640
I Dunno.
You know what?

349
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,560
That's one of those things where you
think you have a good theory and then you

350
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,090
fucking explore all the options. You like,
oh well maybe it doesn't work. Whatever.

351
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:22,301
Nope.

352
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,970
You only sit them down for like fucking
two minutes and they come back out and

353
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:25,361
it's not like,

354
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:28,990
well fucking Wayne Gretzky's got three
penalties to more and he's out of the

355
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:33,370
game right there. You got back on
track with my theory. There you go.

356
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,960
You can't sit Tom Brady down.

357
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,230
All you gotta like this is
what kills me about basketball.

358
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:42,780
I don't give a fuck how many points
you're up. You're up like 20 points.

359
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:47,420
You just like, yeah, this game's a
rep is one quarter ago. You don't,

360
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,990
most teams are lucky if they
score like 27 and a quarter,

361
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,520
that's like a fucking great quarter.

362
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,420
We're up by 20 all we really need to do
is score eight points and we're fine and

363
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,950
the next thing you know it's just like a
little fucking jerk offs are on a 27 to

364
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,040
run every fucking time.

365
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,700
That whole thing. It's a game
of runs. I don't think it is.

366
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:12,110
I think it's a game of fucking ratings in.
If a team gets up too high,

367
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,740
they just start fucking call Colin
files together to Ah, that's stupid.

368
00:22:15,741 --> 00:22:18,950
That's a stupid fucking theory. But
it does. It just appears that way.

369
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:23,030
Maybe it is the nature of the game
that nobody can just blow somebody out.

370
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,940
They always come back. Like, I
would say like 85% of the time.

371
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,310
Of course I didn't do any research,

372
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,240
but you seem to be 85% of
the time you fucking go.

373
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,590
You go up by 30 points in the first half,
you know,

374
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,560
somehow by the end of the game,
that one away. What else? Sex.

375
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,280
One of the most unbelievable
and probable come back

376
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,240
since last night's fucking slew of
NBA Games into the exact same thing.

377
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,280
Um, anyways, I don't want to talk about
it. All I'm saying is that I think a

378
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,733
Rondo really showed,

379
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,660
I mean just, I mean it's
fucking unbelievable. Like
how much the series changed.

380
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,050
One guy is gone and the
whole thing turns around. Um,

381
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,670
so I'm excited to watch games six,

382
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,240
even if they win,
that'd mean I'd like seeing greatness.

383
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:14,390
I don't give a shit. I mean, I hope it's
on my team, but if it isn't the, I can't,

384
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:16,500
and then like I can't just sit
back and appreciate it. Right.

385
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,600
I try to be a good guy for right now.
I don't know why I have this fucking,

386
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:25,040
this pillow that wraps around you,
this little half circle pillow.

387
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,760
You know when you have a baby abuse,
it's perfectly set them down.

388
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,710
You give them the bottle of Jack, you
know, and then that's it. You know,

389
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,780
but if you try to do it with
regular pills, it doesn't work.

390
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,400
But for some reason I have it
around me right now. I don't know.

391
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,970
It feels right.

392
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,060
Like I don't wait to have a kid that buy
one of these fucking semicircle pillows.

393
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,010
Um, all right, what else did I

394
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,620
want to talk about? I've been watching,
you know, I've been watching the hockey.

395
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,870
Okay.

396
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,030
Gotten over the fact that my Bruins had
been knocked out by the quietest fan

397
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:59,180
based team in the league.
Right.

398
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,520
The team that cheering forgot until April.

399
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:08,070
Then all of a sudden they all show
up like they give a shit. Oh man,

400
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,650
that was fucking hard watching
that. Anyways, um, the
prejudice are looking great,

401
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,720
but I still think, I don't know
if I already talked about this.

402
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:18,200
I started this podcast twice. I forget
if I brought this shit up. I still,

403
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm still going with the penguins. I
think the penguins repeat. Um, and I miss,

404
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,290
uh, Anaheim. Edmonton. I bet
that's a great fucking series too.

405
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,010
It's so crazy. They're already down
to just two series in each conference.

406
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,680
So I have to make sure that I'm watching,
um,

407
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,150
for those people last week you're like,
hey,

408
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:38,660
how come you didn't talk about Moto
GP, the race in Austin? You know what?

409
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:41,400
I didn't see it. And uh, then I,

410
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:44,300
I realized I recorded it
and this is what you learn.

411
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:48,860
If you're new to moto GP and you go to
record the race and you've got to fucking

412
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:50,780
do it.
It might,

413
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,070
it might be better than Formula One
just because of the sheer amount of like

414
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:58,850
passing in lead changes in all that.
It's fucking insane.

415
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,140
And then the fact he just watched
these guys falling off motorcycles.

416
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,220
I wrote one of the races. Um,
well let me explain it first.

417
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,170
You're going to go to record it.
If you're novice like me,

418
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:13,460
you go to record it and you'll be watching
like the first race and it will say

419
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,490
Moto too when they're on these little
skinny bicycle tires and you're like,

420
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,270
those don't look like the fucking,
you know,

421
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,480
those Badass bikes that I saw.
What's going on here?

422
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:28,200
Then there's moto three and you're like,
what is the real one? Was that Ross,

423
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,600
Valentino, Rossi guy? Whatever
the fuck his name is. Uh,

424
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,730
Mike and the mechanics,
whatever the other guy's name is.

425
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:38,750
I don't know any of the fucking name shed.
So there's three different classes.

426
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:40,910
This is what I learnt.
All right.

427
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
On Moto GP as they say.
And um,

428
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,370
there's Modo too.

429
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,520
There's moto three and there's moto GP
and that's basically like being in Aa Aaa

430
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:53,990
and then being in the majors.
Now for whatever reason,

431
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,850
Moto three is the lowest level. So
I guess they go in three, two, one.

432
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,210
I guess that's how they do it. And
they don't say one, they just say GP,

433
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,400
which I believe stands for Grand Prix.
I don't fucking know.

434
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:08,370
So motor three is 250
cc according to this,

435
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:12,770
this thing on reddit air to 250 cc bike,
you know,

436
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,760
so that's basically a cubic centimeters.
So it's a smaller engine.

437
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,440
It's not as fast, you know, it's still
fast as shit the way they're doing it.

438
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:25,160
But you know, that's the one like, okay,
all right, the grasshopper, we'll, we'll,

439
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,840
you know, we'll see how you do it
this level. And then if you, uh,

440
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,620
succeed at that level, then they move
you up to moto two, which is 600 CC's.

441
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,740
Evidentaly four strokes and all
the engines are made by Honda,

442
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,380
which I find interesting. Um, so hot,

443
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,220
they're all Honda base.
Everybody's working the exact same shit.

444
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,930
That's probably so they can
truly get an idea of who,

445
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,910
um, who is the best writer, who's going
to get called up to the show, Moto GP.

446
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,820
And according to this person,
a lot of times in Modo,

447
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,680
Modo to the race is better because they
all just have basically the exact same

448
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:04,380
engine.
So this guy was saying you could throw,

449
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:09,330
you can usually can throw a blanket over
the top three people in that race. Um,

450
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,460
and then the big show is moto
GP, which is a thousand CC's. Um,

451
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,890
and those things are just fucking rockets.

452
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:19,380
And I watched this whole thing on how
they build them. They're hand built,

453
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,590
gets how much those motorcycles
cost a piece. Take a wild guess.

454
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,530
Like if for some reason you
went down, they said, hey,

455
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:28,080
you want to take it for a lap?
But if you fucking trashed this thing,

456
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,340
you got to pay for it. Okay. And they give
you that fucking suit with the airbag.

457
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,190
And unfortunately you don't,
high site,

458
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,500
you slide off the bike and you get up
and be like, uh, shit, what's that?

459
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,030
Gonna cost me? I would've thought
anywhere between 102 hundred 50 grand,

460
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,673
you know,
and I

461
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,370
stand that it's a fucking racing
bike and all that, but you know,

462
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,410
they're a little less things.
Do you know what I mean?

463
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,550
You go to to do a build on a car,
this is like fucking people working on it.

464
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:57,930
On the other side. He can't even
see him a motorcycle. I mean it's,

465
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,880
it's right there.
Everything is right fucking there.

466
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,970
You want another guy can lift up
the engine and the shit is small.

467
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,840
If that was like a hundred,

468
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,640
a hundred to 250 grand is when I
would've guessed three 75 tops.

469
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,080
Right. This is like, I'm at the
showcase showdown on the prices, right.

470
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,090
And I horrifically
underbid is what happens.

471
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,200
Um,
those bikes cost $2 million each,

472
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,940
$2 million each. They're handmade. Um,

473
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,410
all this space age stuff. I watched
this whole thing on how they build them.

474
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,670
The gas tank is actually
underneath the seat.

475
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,660
What's where the gas tank usually is,
is the fuel injector.

476
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,260
There's an airport right in front of that,
right with the fucking front light.

477
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,070
Usually.
I just want to,

478
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:46,090
I watched the whole goddamn thing
was absolutely fascinating and a,

479
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:49,270
I'm totally in on that sport watching
that sport and I'm watching the F one.

480
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,800
I don't know when the next races, but,
uh, if you want to watch, do well,

481
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,810
I think it was a motto to race.
The last one,

482
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:59,570
this fucking guy came out of a turn
is backend started. Fishtailing yeah.

483
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,710
Like right up and over the handlebars
doing, I don't know how fast, I don't,

484
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,570
I don't get how they get up
because he,

485
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:10,070
he landed on like his foot.

486
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:13,780
He limped for a second and then he just
kinda just shakes it off. They're like,

487
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,350
hey, you said foot problems
said foot problems in the past.

488
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,590
I'd imagine you that everything
problems you fall off a bike.

489
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,680
You know, it's funny when I was thinking
about getting a motorcycle out here,

490
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:28,910
the stupidest thing you
could ever do. Um, you know,

491
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,190
riding a fucking motorcycle.
I know a lot of guys who will,

492
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:34,910
you just fucking flew a helicopter.
It's with way safer, way safer.

493
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,250
There's nobody up there. I was
actually driving back. I was did, um,

494
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,010
Mark Marin's podcast promoting
season two of F is for family.

495
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,110
I don't know when that's coming out.

496
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,520
MMM.

497
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,070
And thank you to mark Marin. Forget
me on his podcast. I had a great time.

498
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:52,570
We talked about anger, meditation, we
talked music and we help promote any,

499
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,680
help me promote the show.
And um, I was on my way back.

500
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,110
It was the middle of the day and all
of a sudden there was just all this

501
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:03,020
horrific traffic. And uh,
this big fucking accent is,

502
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,820
this truck had jumped at medium strip.
I don't have to guide median strip.

503
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:10,240
I don't if the guy fucking
fell asleep or whatever,

504
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,600
but 10 people went to the hospital,
one person died in a dog died,

505
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,580
you know, so I don't know.
I just think the highway is
way, way, way more dangerous.

506
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,460
I've said it before,
you're flying in formation,

507
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,640
the secure in the fucking blue angels,
everybody's still 80 miles an hour.

508
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,580
There's no radio contact. Nobody
knows where anybody is fucking going.

509
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,800
These people texting these people on meds,

510
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,710
you have no idea and they forget a bit.
And then right on the other side

511
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,450
is another group of fucking people.
You know,

512
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,280
there's never ending parade of fucking
people flying on the other side.

513
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,650
You don't know what they're going to do.
That fucking guy was driving a truck,

514
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:51,120
fell asleep, had a heart attack, whatever
the fuck he did jump the meetings,

515
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,270
strip went right up and over into
oncoming fucking traffic at like,

516
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,580
it was like 12 in the afternoon.
Did you look it up?

517
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:00,070
It's on was on the five right?
In your Colorado Boulevard.

518
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,503
MMM.

519
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,870
So anyways, so I was thinking about
getting a motorcycle when I was,

520
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:08,410
I was looking up those moto GP suits.

521
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,150
Yeah.

522
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,020
What's your like 2,500 bucks a whack,
but they got a little air bag in them.

523
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,990
And I'm like, well that's what
the fuck I would want. Yeah.

524
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,420
It'd be hilarious to buy one of those.

525
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,470
And then by like a fucking Harley
Davidson and just look like the biggest

526
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:28,200
fucking asshole ever. You just ride that
thing. If somebody cuts in front of you,

527
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:31,750
you just let it. But there's another thing
too, he's on those when they're racing,

528
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,610
you can lay it down and slide and fucking
all that stuff and you find, you find,

529
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,030
it's not like you can slide into oncoming
traffic and there's a good God damn

530
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,210
garbage truck coming at Ya.

531
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,413
MMM.

532
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,050
I Dunno, but I miss ride
motorcycle, so I'm taking a, ah,

533
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,100
it's just nothing safe about
them. I was thinking, all right,

534
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:54,850
well I'll just get a dirt bike.
I won't go over jumps or anything.

535
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:58,240
I'll just ride some trails. But then
every of ever like fucking, I don't know,

536
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,830
it seems like every six weeks you hear
a story about somebody riding on a trail

537
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:03,880
choosing a mountain bike though.

538
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:08,560
But if you run like a dirt bike at some
mountain line ends up like pouncing on

539
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:13,220
your back, which got the
helmet on. I Dunno. I Dunno.

540
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,261
I, I, you know what,

541
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:16,480
this podcast is going great and he
just went off the rails somewhere.

542
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:19,390
I don't really know where. Let's,
let's do a little bit of, uh,

543
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,000
advertising Indochino in Chino.

544
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,920
Yeah,

545
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,180
the sting wreath,
the Gordon Sumner read it.

546
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,080
Don't shy to talk about how
every man looks better in a suit.

547
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:37,750
You know, when I'm checking out guys
at the, at the outdoor mall, I'm like,

548
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:41,780
you know, I'm really attracted to that
guy, but he's just wearing an Izod,

549
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,340
you know, with some quarter
Roy's, that's not my all.

550
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:48,260
Now look at that fellow wearing this suit.

551
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,160
Now there's something I could take home
to my parents that said, everybody,

552
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,080
if you're sick of gay men not giving you
the fucking once over or maybe rolling

553
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:00,680
their eyes, you ever think that maybe
it's not you fucking love handles.

554
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,350
Maybe it's the fact that
you don't have on a shirt,

555
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:07,430
a tie and a sport coat to cover up
all the mistakes you've made with your

556
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:09,590
nutrition over the last 40 years.

557
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,860
Thank God there's Indochino is making
it easy to get a perfectly tailored suit

558
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,940
and an incredible price.

559
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,160
You can choose from hundreds of top
quality fabrics and personalize your suit

560
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,630
just the way you want it,

561
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,470
whether it's for work or a wedding
or another special occasion.

562
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,060
Here is how it fucking works.

565
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,560
Submit your measurements,

566
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,160

to arrive and just a few weeks.

567
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,250
Then they'll sell all this,
your measurements and all that.

568
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:53,330

these fucking nerds making robots.

569
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,140
And next thing you know,

570
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,600
there's going to be a knock at the door
and all of a sudden you're going to be

571
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,520

in no matter how much you tap out,

575
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:05,810

smell of that bloomin' onion that she's

589
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:59,180
been carrying around all day.

590
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,890
All right,
lift everybody you know about Lyft Rye.

591
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:12,070
It's the APP that gets you a ride in
minutes on demand 24 seven for less than

592
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:13,730
the cost of a cab.

593
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,840
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted
through their 10 point safety standard,

594
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:20,540
including criminal and
DMV background checks.

595
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Unlike those other people with that
other thing that rhymes with mover,

596
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,760
right? You don't know what
you're going to get, right?

597
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:32,060
You can walk in there with a bloody ax.
Those fucking cops would hire, you know,

598
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:34,340
you'll get around quickly and safety with,
with Lyft,

599
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,560
Lyft drivers are rated after every ride,
so only the best stick around.

600
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,950
You don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car with some creepy dude.

601
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:45,390
Everybody doesn't get a ribbon at Lyft.
The way they do over it. Mover with Lyft,

602
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,780
you can tip in the APP,
which obviously leads to happier drivers.

603
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,740
I mean I not attend Lyft riders get
a perfect five star rating from the

604
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:56,400
passenger. It's just a better way.
All better. All around experience.

605
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,330
Bigger isn't always better.
Lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

606
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,390
but it is the fastest
growing and I is created one.

607
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,110
I'm talking quality over quantity.
Thanks to lift you can get.

608
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,930
It's an easy way to avoid drunk driving.
You never have to bum a ride. Well,

609
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:12,870
what if you're on heroin? It's another
way to to avoid nodding off in public.

610
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,470
And then I noticed that guy, oh,
you're in the cab. Nobody knows.

611
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,640
And you know what a lot of people are
actually getting rid of their cars and

612
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:23,970
relying on Lyft to get around and
evidentaly. I don't blame them.

613
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,750
What do you do when the apocalypse,
when the zombies come,

Upside. There's a better way
for you to buy business travel.

669
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,830
It's called upside.com.
Every time you buy a trip it upside.

670
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:10,180
You'll save your company a ton of money
and they give you an Amazon card with

671
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:15,181
hundreds of dollars upsides able to do
this because they bundle your flights and

672
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,400
hotels together for one low price.
That's what they do.

673
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:22,270
They rip this seats out of a commercial
airliner and they just stuff you in

674
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:25,000
there. You know, you might think flying,

675
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:29,330
standing up like you're at a mosh pit
for six hours from New York to La. Mike,

676
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,130
suck. Yeah, talks to me when
you that only cost you 40 bucks.

677
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:38,050
Now that's not what they do. Um, bundle
pricing saves money. This is what they do.

678
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:39,820
If you're a frequent business traveler,

00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,270
you're company saves a ton of money and
you can get thousands a year and gift

682
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,670
to what the f I feel like in the end
of this you can be missing a kidney.

683
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,380
This seems like too,
too good a deal.

684
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,450
And I get a gift card and I get to keep
my miles and I saved them a bunch of

685
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:05,770
money. If you're shopping for business
travel and you'd be crazy not to check out

686
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:07,840
upside.com you're out of your mind.

00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,830
It just takes three minutes to see how
much you can say by buying your flights

688
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,580
and hotels together for
one low price. Oh, I see.

689
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:18,280
They both cut side deals with each other.
Somebody's gotta be doing, you know,

690
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:22,690
at some point somebody got sold
into fucking sex slavery here.

691
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,820

there to save your home.

702
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,760
I want those instead of fucking throw you
into it. I wasn't there, but we'll put,

703
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,910
we'll put you right back in it.

704
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,610
It's kind of a good thing if you're
not there when the fire starts, right?

705
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,040
Okay.

706
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,380
Simply safe can be there to
save your home. All right.

707
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,300
This is a robot that
has a fire extinguisher.

708
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,090
What is this with simply
safe home security,

709
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,690
you'll get a 24 seven
connection to dispatch and

710
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,930
Lightening Fast Response Times
in emergencies. All right,

711
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:27,750
I have to look up dispatch.
What does dispatch?

712
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,870
All I know is I have 24 fucking

713
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,070
okay.

714
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:37,210
24 hour access to dispatch,
dispatch.com that's not what I wanted.

715
00:42:37,211 --> 00:42:39,520
That's not what I wanted.
That's not what I wanted.

716
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,830
Why don't you wish there was like
voice command on these things?

717
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,503
Okay.

718
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,670
Then you compute will be like, what
did you want? What did you want?

719
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,833
Okay.

720
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:51,010
Oh, for fuck sakes, it'll load eventually.
I'll tell you what that means later.

721
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,440
Dispatch. Oh, here it is. It is a

722
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,440
sendoff. Oh, fucking Christ.
Don't just happened to come on.

723
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,870
Now want us to load again?
Send off to destination or for a purpose.

724
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,940
Deal with the task,

725
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,960
the sending of someone or something
to a destination for a purpose.

726
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,590
So they're going to send somebody who
has a purpose in life to your house.

727
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:17,430
When it's on fire,

728
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,580
they're going to walk up the street
holding their fucking head. Hi.

729
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:25,140
I'm imagining that person would, you know,
be driving a fire truck. Fire engine,

easy to use and completely wireless.

in your walls. No ugly wires.

733
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:38,040

think I talked about everything right?

742
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,390
Yeah. I believe I hit everything
that I want to talk about. You know,

743
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:24,530
I was just checking in on you.
Here's some fucking music. Uh,

744
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,480
excuse me that you guys
can listen to a man.

745
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:32,340
We got another like half hour of stuff
from classic podcasts from a or a Monday

746
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,050
and a year, a day a week gone by.
That's it. Go fuck yourselves.

747
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:41,310
I believe there's another f one race this
Sunday. Check it out. If you can, uh,

748
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:46,110
let's go sell dicks. I'm hoping
for a classic. I hope he went,

749
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:48,930
but I also want to see Rhonda would
come out and do his thing too.

750
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:51,540
You know what I mean? Cause I still love
that guy. He's still a Celtic to me.

751
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,160
All right.
That's it.

752
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,500
Have a great weekend you cunts
and I'll talk to you on Monday.

753
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,670
Hey,
what the fuck I'm talking about?

754
00:45:01,671 --> 00:45:05,850
We decided to have a fucking
party for our new place. You know,

755
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:07,040
you think that was my idea.

756
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,160
Do you think it was my idea to have a
bunch of strangers come into the fucking

757
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:13,130
house? I'll have people
over. That's what I do. Hey,

758
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:17,630
you want to come over and watch the
game? Nine people that I know, right?

759
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,640
Have all your fucking phone numbers.
You don't. Nia is a more open person.

760
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:27,030
So she's like, let's have a
party. All right, so we sit,

761
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,320
she goes to invite your friends. So I'm
all right. So you know, I got, you know,

762
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:34,730
I'm a, I'm a guy, I don't
have a bunch of friends. Okay.

763
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:40,130
I got six good friends for that.
I could really trust, you know,

764
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,670
it's about it,
at least out here.

765
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:48,560
Then over here in neah talking to her
mom about all excited about the party and

766
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:52,640
she's like, yeah, I thin it out a foot
Facebook. And I was just like, oh my God,

767
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:57,380
did I just invite 110 people
in my heart literally sank on.

768
00:45:57,381 --> 00:46:02,360
Please tell me you didn't just invite
110 fucking people. She's like,

769
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:06,050
don't worry, they're not all
gonna show up. It's like,
yeah, but like a third will.

770
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,990
And then they're going to bring people
that you don't even fucking know.

771
00:46:08,991 --> 00:46:12,560
And that's exactly what happened.
It was a fucking great party.

772
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,630
I'm not gonna lie to you, but I got
to admit, like I got to learn how to,

773
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,310
I thought I was going to be a
good host. I wasn't. I wasn't.

774
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,050
I was all right with the people I
knew. But the people I didn't know, uh,

775
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,780
they actually, most of them are all
right, but there were a couple of them.

776
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,630
I just find it just sends you something
fucking annoying about somebody you

777
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:33,830
don't know, sitting on your
goddamn couch, you know,

778
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,350
eating your food, drinking your booze.
He like, who the food of fuck are you?

779
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,730
And somebody else was laying down on
the floor. I felt like the kids' Dad,

780
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:46,040
I want to make, get them
get a fucking job. Right?

781
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:50,660
It's over you 26 she fucking pump.
So anyway, so the party going great.

782
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,000
And uh, I'm basically the whole time,
you know, not drinking too much,

783
00:46:56,001 --> 00:47:00,250
but I'm standing by the front tour cause
that's the only way out. All right.

784
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,170
And nobody's walking out
with any of my shit, right?

785
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,430
I'm acting basically like psycho in
fucking stripes. That's how I am.

786
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,080
It's how I'm wired.
All right?

787
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,600
So a fucking three quarters away through
the party, everything's going great.

788
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,020
And I'm like, wow, this is, you know,
I forgot, I forgot. I'm not 21 anymore.

789
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,550
I'm fucking 43.

790
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:23,480
All my friends are adults and everybody's
drinking responsibly and no one's

791
00:47:23,481 --> 00:47:26,390
really hammered. Nothing got
broken. Everything's cool.

792
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:30,000
So start just as I was starting to
relax some kid up to me. He's like

793
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,360
a, yeah, yeah, you own the house.
And I'm like, well, the bank owns it.

794
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,520
I'm fucking paying it off.
What can I do for you?

795
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,250
And he's like a yes,
kind of embarrassment,

796
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,160
but I use the bathroom downstairs and uh,
it's clock now.

797
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:49,180
And I was wondering if you had a plunger.
And I was like,

798
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,820
yeah, I do have a plunger. I got a
plunger right here, the upstairs bathroom.

799
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,330
So I give it to the guy and I, and I say,
man, I appreciate your honesty. He goes,

800
00:47:58,331 --> 00:48:02,230
no problem. He goes downstairs, he takes
care of it, comes back, he wants again.

801
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,910
He goes, he goes, sorry about that.
I said, not at all, not at all.

802
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,030
What the fuck is the toilet, you
know, plugs up every once in a while.

803
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:12,790
But I appreciate you. I
appreciate your honesty. You know,

804
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:17,290
cause I would have been nasty.
Good for you. Right. So, uh,

805
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,170
now the couple of hours goes by,

806
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:23,540
the party ends and there's
like one straggler left. And
I tell the story to knee.

807
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:26,890
I'm like, you know what a
good, what a good guy. What
a good shit. No Pun intended.

808
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,250
You know we could have left it in there.
Now that you got a party,

809
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:31,990
I come walking in my fucking bathroom,

810
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:35,080
looks like a Goddamn port authority
bus station, toilet. You know,

811
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,910
cause I was psyched. So, so one of the
stragglers at the party, he goes yeah,

812
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:43,000
he goes, I saw that whole thing go down.
That's not exactly how it went down.

813
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,730
I'm like, what are you talking
about? He goes, he goes,

814
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:50,080
it wasn't him that was in the
bathroom. And I go, who was, he goes,

815
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:51,370
it was his girlfriend.

816
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,670
Some lady took a dump of a magnitude
that it wouldn't go down the toilet.

817
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,870
So now she's in there panicking and this
is when today's technology kicks in.

818
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,240
She can add it back in the day.

819
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,690
She would have had to crawl out the
fucking window and hope nobody saw her and

820
00:49:14,691 --> 00:49:18,260
just left the door locked. Everybody
would have panicked. Holy Fuck.

821
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:22,370
Who's in there? Did somebody pass out? If
somebody, if somebody committed suicide,

822
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:25,280
some of what? It kicked
in the door. Alright.

823
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,490
Knocked it off the fucking goddamn
hinges and you go in there,

824
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,720
there'd be nobody in there.

825
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,410
You'd feel the air from outside and
then look down and everyone would see a

826
00:49:33,411 --> 00:49:34,860
giant shit and be like,
whoa.

827
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,570
As a party would be over and the owner
of the house would be walking around

828
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,423
going home.

829
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,990
Why are you mother fucking Jared

830
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,190
told you mother Fucker,

831
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,200
you better drive away. Right.
That's how I would have ended.

832
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,790
But because of today's technology,
not saying she didn't panic,

833
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,220
you know,
it's even worse is a lady,

834
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:59,950
cause they're not even supposed to
do stuff like that. Right. And uh,

835
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:04,770
she was able to text her boyfriend and I
would fucking pay at least $400 to read

836
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:07,650
those texts,
the panic in those texts.

837
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,220
And to his credit,
he fucking EHC stepped it up.

838
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,130
He took the hit,
he came up to me,

839
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,630
v h one ones I love the
eighties on Belper and said,

840
00:50:23,071 --> 00:50:24,600
I took a dump in your toilet.

841
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,980
Do a magnitude that didn't
go down and need the tools

842
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,380
required to alleviate this situation.

843
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,700
So Anti Douche bag of the week,
that guy right there.

844
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,550
So taking a fucking
bullet for the team that,

845
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:46,140
that right there is the
reverse Peyton manning award.

846
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:51,030
He didn't fucking go, we had protection
issues, right? No, he took one.

847
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,840
He took one for the fucking tape,
went upstairs like a God.

848
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:56,940
They have gentlemen asked for a plunger,

849
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:02,360
gave it to him and it was all fun and I
went down there at the end of the party.

850
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,850
You never would've known anything,
anything happened. You know what I mean?

851
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,090
Like, uh, you know, three hours after
the Kennedy assassination. I bet it was.

852
00:51:12,091 --> 00:51:13,380
It was all I would say it,
you know,

853
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,890
marked it all up and everything was all
figured out, but it was a nice road.

854
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:17,724
Again,

855
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,620
mopped up the brain talking to her and
it is Monday morning podcast from Monday,

856
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,090
April 20 something 2009.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

857
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:34,320
You know, I really don't.
I really don't. All right.

858
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:37,340
I feel like shit.
Uh,

859
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,620
I had a really rough weekend in Columbus,
Ohio,

860
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,570
but before I get into the details,

861
00:51:42,571 --> 00:51:47,070
I want to thank everyone who came out
on a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

862
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,700
I had a great time.
I had too good of a time.

863
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:54,900
Let's put it that way. Um, yeah.

864
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,610
Too good a time to go to fucking time.
And I'm paying for it right now.

865
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,290
You know? I don't know why I keep
doing this. I don't know why.

866
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:08,820
I just can't learn, you know?
You know I always do overrated,

867
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:12,330
underrated on this shit.
All you know what's fucking underrated?

868
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:16,890
Eight hours sleep, you
know? You know what's,

869
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:20,970
you know what's fucking underrated going,
hey, you want another shot at Jamieson?

870
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:25,290
You know what? No, I think I've had
enough. You know what I would like?

871
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:29,790
I would like a water that's underrated.
You know,

872
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:36,000
not going to fucking steak and shake at
three in the morning. That's underrated.

873
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,970
Yeah, one of those fucking double burgers.
I never even made it that place before.

874
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:45,740
It didn't even look like meat like a patty
in order I've had. He looks like, sure.

875
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:50,120
We all do. We've all had a fucking burger.
Even you little Veggie cons out there,

876
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:51,440
you know what it looks like.

877
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:56,220
This is a little burned up
wig and there was two of them.

878
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:58,421
You know what?

879
00:52:58,421 --> 00:53:02,650
I was kind of a 40 year old fucking guy
going to be 41 in fucking June goes to

880
00:53:02,651 --> 00:53:07,651
steak and shake at three in the fucking
morning when he's got a Goddamn fucking

881
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:11,440
eight 40 in the morning flight.
Why would you do that?

882
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:15,820
Schererville you suck at math. We
all know that, but she can tell time.

883
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,390
I know there's numbers
involved of Jesus Christ.

884
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,810
What a fucking idiot.
This whole fucking,

885
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,220
I just thinking about that boogie nights.

886
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:31,220
I'm a fucking idiot fucking idiot Eddie,
and I'm a fucking Eddie.

887
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:35,430
I'm a fucking idiot.
Twice Friday night,

888
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:39,000
ended up at steak and shake at
three in the morning. You know,

889
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,980
fucking Sunday night I was
as far as I didn't walk in.

890
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,670
They weren't like no norm like on
chairs areas again, all shit faced.

891
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,490
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking motley crew.

892
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:54,120
You want to see a motley crew go to a
fucking steak and shake at three in the

893
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:57,900
fucking morning.
Good God Almighty.

894
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:02,850
Now I'll tell you, I was part
of the problem. I was, you
know, I bet I was doing it.

895
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:03,720
Everybody else was doing.

896
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:06,390
They were all sitting in their shit face
looking around. Everybody else gone.

897
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:11,010
Jesus Christ, look at, okay,
that fucking guy. Oh my God.

898
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:15,750
Look at her. She's wearing
slippers. Jesus Christ.

899
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,260
You know you don't even realize
they're doing it to you too.

900
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:23,940
I'm going to have fucking guy. Huh?
Look at that. Look at his fucking eyes.

901
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:28,530
What does, it's almost like he's
been drinking Jameson all night. Why?

902
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,430
When did you get a water after
awhile? What a fucking idiot. Yeah.

903
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:36,320
Let me have one year burnt
up wig fucking burgers. Ah,

904
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,560
why is shit food so good when
you, when you shit faced? Yeah.

905
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,190
Is that what it is? Shit. Face Shit.
Food is just, it's just all shit shit.

906
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,610
Fucking decisions. I didn't want
to do that man. I was doing well.

907
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,490
You know I went to trader Joe's,
you know,

908
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,910
dodged a bunch of fucking Bergen
stock. Hippies and I, you know,

909
00:54:56,911 --> 00:55:00,990
I went in there and I, I, Oh I,
I got the fridge put in my room.

910
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:06,850
Fuck global warming. I want to be in
shape. I had a fridge, put my Romeo.

911
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,010
I had got all this healthy food.
What do I do?

912
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,290
What do I do?
I go out,

913
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,970
I go drinking to water four
nights like a fucking more,

914
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,660
oh my God, I went to this
one. You know what I had,

915
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,450
I had a slice of pizza last night
too. That's so fucked up. I was,

916
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:28,050
this is like all coming. It's
like a slide show. You know,

917
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,900
you can't remember this shit that
happened in between, but you just,

918
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:31,890
you just have pictures.

919
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah.

920
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,130
Good.
God Almighty was at a bad looking pizza.

921
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:40,410
Is there anything fucking worse than
that? Just a bad look. And it just,

922
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,700
you know those, you know when
someone makes a pizza, right?

923
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,040
And it even sucks when it's hot,

924
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,280
but then it just sits there for
awhile and it just gets that,

925
00:55:48,281 --> 00:55:51,850
that a cold case file look to it.
You know what I mean?

926
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,310
Like it should have a fucking toe
tag hanging off the crust. They,

927
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,580
they brought over a whole pie
that look like that. You know,

928
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:01,840
they looked like some five year old made
it and like an easy bake oven, you know,

929
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,400
and you're their parents. And now you
have to eat it and say, oh, Susie,

930
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:11,470
it's delicious. You know, just begin.

931
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,940
Begin her little life of people lying to
her and not being fucking honest saying,

932
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,620
no, don't wear that. You look
fat in that. No, you just go,
oh, Susie York. Beautiful.

933
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,570
That's an excellent pizza you made.
You know what, Susie? It fucking sucks.

934
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,830
All right. I'm not saying to give
up your dream about being a cook,

935
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,280
but you definitely don't fucking have
any talent at this point in your life.

936
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:37,210
You know, maybe we can send you to
some sort of, uh, oh, Jesus Christ.

937
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:41,440
What are those chefs schools called?
Huh? Well, what does that art called?

938
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,840
You know, come on. You know what it is
because of the sea. It's not custodial.

939
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,470
It's not calm. Macerich he plays for
fucking the Canadians. Oh, Canadians.

940
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:57,130
I want to say a bone, Julia to all my
friends up there in Montreal. You know,

941
00:56:57,131 --> 00:56:59,800
I was just breaking your balls. I've
been blogging for the Bruins and, uh,

942
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:03,220
is basically I went down as blogging
for the Bruins during the playoffs,

943
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:08,200
which I'm going to continue to do because
they swept the Montreal Canadians. Um,

944
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:12,040
and basically, uh, you know,

945
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,450
I have to blog for the Bruins that
playing and Canadians. I mean, what do,

946
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:17,710
what do you, what am I going to
say? The Canadians won 24 cups.

947
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,760
We've only want five.
We haven't won since 1972.

948
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:26,590
All I can do is just try to piss you
off. That's all I was doing. I said,

949
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:31,150
Montreal fans get really, really fucking
mad. You know, I made fun of their coach.

950
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,270
I just did what I get. Oh, I
just made fun how they looked,

951
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,740
how they blew their fucking players.
I don't even more,

952
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,700
I said I was just trying to be a jerk
and as people got all [inaudible] noise,

953
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,850
you were hockey.
You know,

954
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:48,450
this guy calls himself a comedian.
I don't take,

955
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,240
this is very funny.
Whatever,

956
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:54,670
you know,
it's fucking funny.

957
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:58,330
I heard Celine Dion is thinking
about buying the Montreal Canadiens.

958
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,230
He's probably gonna move him to Vegas.
That'd be a fucking mascot on ice.

959
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:05,230
That would be, that would be a crime.
That'd be a goddamn crime. All right.

960
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,700
This is the Monday morning podcast.

961
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:10,060
This is the hangover episode
of the Monday morning podcast.

962
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:14,860
I am sitting in a hotel in Manhattan,
New York. Why are you doing that, bill?

963
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:18,400
Huh?
You lay in low after a weekend of Busan.

964
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,880
Now I've got a week at Caroline's and
I'm working with Joe de Rosa once again,

965
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,990
my partner in crime too.
Codependent fucking alcoholics.

966
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,000
Do you know one time,

967
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,450
I think I might have told this story on
ONA opie and Anthony Show for you? Uh,

968
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,560
people who live in, I don't
know, fucking North Dakota. Um,

969
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,580
I don't know when that,

970
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:43,030
it wasn't Caroline's Caroline's comedy
club on Broadway where I will be Thursday,

971
00:58:43,031 --> 00:58:46,420
Friday, Saturday and Sunday
for a fucking 22 shows,

972
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,740
22 fucking shows. I can't even do one
show at this point. I'm laying low, man.

973
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:54,160
I'm laying low. Um, but
anyways, one night I was,

974
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,830
I was standing there at
the bar and I decided,

975
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,100
I didn't know if I decided I wasn't going
to drink, but I just wasn't drinking,

976
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:05,320
you know, and all of a sudden who comes
walking down the stairs, you know,

977
00:59:05,321 --> 00:59:10,321
like some starlet in the 1950s making a
big fucking debut Joe to Rosarito do you

978
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:13,390
think was missing was the
fucking the evening gown.

979
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:18,340
He comes fucking Walson down the
stairs, you know, all dainty, like,

980
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:23,060
and the second I saw him, I was like,
fuck, now I've got a drink. Right.

981
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,450
And you know what, he was thinking the
exact same thing. That was a funny thing.

982
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:31,400
Neither one of us wanted a drink. You
got any friends like that? You just,

983
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,920
you just been fuck ups for so long that
neither one of you can just pull you out

984
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:41,630
of the tailspin. I'm sure.
Anybody who's in in Aa good.

985
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:45,380
Tell me what exactly that that's called,
what kind of friendship that is?

986
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,540
Um, I don't fucking know.
I, I really, I really,

987
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:54,560
really feel like shit right now and a,
so I'm setting the room and uh,

988
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,870
if you noticed the quality
might be a little bit better.

989
00:59:56,871 --> 01:00:01,310
Actually got a microphone now and I have
a little mixer and I have my headphones

990
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:05,360
on and I'm sitting here in the
fucking dark. That's not true.

991
01:00:05,361 --> 01:00:08,650
I got the one little desk light on,
uh,

992
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:12,920
basically talking to myself. You know,
technically once you start listening,

993
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:16,550
this whole thing makes sense.
But Right now before I upload this thing,

994
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,070
this is really, uh, you know,

995
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,500
this is why they don't give
everybody handguns. Because
if one was laying around,

996
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,670
I'm fucking with you.
You know what I would do?

997
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:30,980
I'd probably pointed out the window.
I wouldn't shoot anybody.

998
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:32,000
Just try to scare someone,

999
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,080
maybe make me laugh and I could get a
little oxygen or something into my fucking

1000
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:39,080
head. What do you guys, what do
you guys use for hangovers? Huh?

1001
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:43,680
Other than the smart thing,
not drink anymore. God Damn.

1002
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:46,730
It's just so much fun though. You
know, I was having a great time.

1003
01:00:46,731 --> 01:00:50,630
You know those broads, you know,
just having a good fucking time.

1004
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:55,340
Just a good time. You know that
fucking people who like to drink.

1005
01:00:55,610 --> 01:01:00,380
I met a couple of hunters. I am at a
couple of dancers. I man, you know,

1006
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:05,210
I met a, you know, a nice mix of
people as I'm a fucking weird dude man.

1007
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:08,210
I don't like people before I get onstage,
I don't want to see him.

1008
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:11,390
I don't see anybody in the fucking crowd.
But the second the show's over,

1009
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:13,920
if somebody is cool, I, I,

1010
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,960
that's the part of the show I I enjoy
and I become like this fucking ah,

1011
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,370
Charlie rose and I just started
interviewing people. You know,

1012
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,720
what's it like to shoot a pheasant in the
face? Huh? What's that like? You know,

1013
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:31,550
do you got a little fucking couple of
pieces of wood that you rubbed together

1014
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:35,660
and somehow it sounds like a pheasant
going, hey Eddie, come on over here.

1015
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,650
You know, or whatever fucking pheasants
names are. If you had a pet pheasant,

1016
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:43,250
what would you name it? Huh? Larry,
that'd be a great name for a pheasant.

1017
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,240
Has to be funny. If you had it right and
people looking at it like, oh my God,

1018
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:50,120
is that a pheasant? Like Larry,
get the fuck off of that thing.

1019
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:52,100
Actually got off of it,
you know?

1020
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:55,610
And then he got on a late night talk
show and then you went out there and then

1021
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:59,480
it didn't work. And then the host
sorta mugged about how it didn't work.

1022
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:03,830
And then maybe it takes a Turd on his
fucking wing tip shoe and 50 years later

1023
01:02:03,831 --> 01:02:07,460
it's part of the greatest hits DVD,
you know?

1024
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:10,880
And little did you know that that was a
pinnacle of your life is a fucking zoo

1025
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:13,670
keeper. That one moment you thought
it was going to keep happening?

1026
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:18,671
No one episode one episode and you never
asked back because your animal shit on

1027
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:24,360
the fucking host shoe wasn't
supposed to do that. It didn't do,

1028
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,500
they didn't do it in the rehearsals.
All right,

1029
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,780
how the fuck am I going
to maneuver this here?

1030
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:33,540
All the rattling in the background.
I couldn't move my mixer or you know,

1031
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:37,530
I feel right now I feel like the
fucking unit Obama all this, Goddamn,

1032
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,730
was he anti-technology though?
I Dunno if he was anti or pro at all.

1033
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:46,200
I know he was definitely fucking alone
and it was a paranoid son of a bitch.

1034
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,430
My back. There we go. You guys
get nervous there for a second.

1035
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:00,840
What the fuck does too
many fucking cords here.

1036
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,940
I'm going to go back to this cell phone.

1037
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:07,940
I'm not on holding my fucking laptop
like a goddamn. Yeah. You know,

1038
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,020
servants used to hand shit to kings.

1039
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,020
Would they put something on a pillow
and then they had the little hands

1040
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:15,210
underneath it? That's the way I'm
holding it. I'll tell you what,

1041
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:18,540
can I paint a fucking picture? Can
I paint a goddamn picture? Let me,

1042
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:21,510
let me adjust the microphone. I want to
tell you about my microphone. By the way,

1043
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,030
do you remember back in the
1970s, you know, nowadays,
whenever somebody has a mic,

1044
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,690
uh, and they have like a little filter on
that, a filter or whatever, I don't know,

1045
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:31,300
the technical,
you know,

1046
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:35,010
little spongy thing that you stick on
there so it doesn't pop or if there's some

1047
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:39,270
sort of wind, you know, nowadays that
just black and it just looks like a,

1048
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:42,060
you know, fucking giant cock
just sitting there, right?

1049
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,980
Something that they can put on TV, you
know. But back in the day, man, the 70s,

1050
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,080
you know,

1051
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,790
when people were buying weed by the
fucking garbage bag full and uh,

1052
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:59,340
you know, the 70s were colorful man,
you fucking day just start it off.

1053
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:00,174
You know,

1054
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,650
you had that crazy cereal that they used
to have somebody brought a booberry or

1055
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,390
count Chocula and Franken Berry and I
was in the cereal aisle. Uh, you know,

1056
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:11,460
the other day, well, when
I went to trader Joe's,

1057
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:15,800
when I was going to have a healthy week
before I down five bottles of whiskey on

1058
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,300
the worst drunk too, I'm one of
those guys, I fucking call up people.

1059
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:22,950
And start telling him I love him, you
know, and one of those guys, you know, I,

1060
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,850
I do everything but ended up in the drunk
tank on the fucking Andy Griffith show.

1061
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,180
I'm such an old school drunk,
but I'm not an angry guy when I get drunk.

1062
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,550
I'm really not. I'm actually
pleasant and I'm able to emote.

1063
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,130
Is that why you do it,
Bill? I don't fucking know.

1064
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,870
All I know is it makes me feel like shit
the fuck was I just talking about? Oh,

1065
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:45,000
how coat colorful the
seventies where yeah,

1066
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:50,001
you'd start off with that fucking
cereal that they had and uh,

1067
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,830
it was one of the worst sentences ever.
Yeah.

1068
01:04:55,831 --> 01:05:00,030
He started off with that cereal that
they had. Oh, there you go, Bill.

1069
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,390
That's a great way to, to fucking
start it off. Right. If you,

1070
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,300
Patty yourself on the back about how
you could paint a visual, you know,

1071
01:05:06,301 --> 01:05:07,650
it's funny,
I have headphones on right now.

1072
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:11,490
I have no idea how a lot I'm talking and
I'm sure that there is somebody on the

1073
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:16,410
other side of this wall that is
contemplating calling the front desk,

1074
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:20,560
but what they're to is so fucking bizarre.
They haven't been able to tap out yet.

1075
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,530
Um,
well that's arrogant bill.

1076
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:27,020
Maybe they're listening and your sound
fucking annoying. All right. Whatever.

1077
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,500
Stop Heckling yourself. Get to
the point. Yeah, you'd start off.

1078
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:30,760
Will you eat tricks?

1079
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:34,570
You booberry the shit literally
change the color of your milk,

1080
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:37,750
which is some really hacky comedy from
fucking the 80s but I'm telling you,

1081
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:42,340
you had that shit going on honeycomb,
you know the,

1082
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,920
the fucking people were
wearing polyester at the,

1083
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,980
I mean Shit was loud in the 70s
you know those plaids slacks,

1084
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:54,730
people had slacks, he had boots had set
up the side. They're all fucking shiny.

1085
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:59,410
Women had like those, those plastic
looking purses. It was fucking freaky.

1086
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,780
It was weird.
Everything was like done.

1087
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:04,600
Suddenly I think the
advertisers just like, look,

1088
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:09,400
everybody's on drugs so we,
we really need to enhance their trip.

1089
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,520
So much shit in the 70s was like really
done to like even like the fucking

1090
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:17,560
monkeys,
which I guess you know was that this?

1091
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,040
That was the late sixties I think I went
to the early seventies we were one when

1092
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:22,750
they used to fucking,
you know,

1093
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:26,560
pretend to sing in pathend
to play instruments at the
end of the show there and

1094
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:26,781
they would,

1095
01:06:26,781 --> 01:06:31,150
they would cut to that little musical
montage is and they'd always do like half

1096
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:34,840
the time they would do like those,
they'd put it in like a kaleidoscope.

1097
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,710
So you had them actually in the middle
and then like six of them like going

1098
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:42,790
around like a fucking that
fucking revolver aside,

1099
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,970
I don't know what it was.
And you're eating that cereal.

1100
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:49,000
He just watching this shit.
Anyways,

1101
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,100
this all comes around to my microphone.

1102
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:54,910
Back then you couldn't even watch like
a sport show without sort of tripping,

1103
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:55,391
you know what I mean?

1104
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:59,650
Like they had ABC's wide world of sport
and they had these fucking bright yellow

1105
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:04,360
sport coats on and I used to have these
microphones and when they stood outside,

1106
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:07,870
the little spongy thing that
they stuck on top wasn't black.

1107
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:11,110
It didn't blend in with the microphone.
There were these crazy colors.

1108
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:14,650
And one that I always remember was
there was always like bright orange.

1109
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:18,670
It made no fucking sense.
But as a kid I liked it.

1110
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,330
So whatever.
I bought a microphone and the guy goes,

1111
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:26,920
what kind of wind screen do you want? You
know, you want the standard black one?

1112
01:07:26,921 --> 01:07:29,560
I said, fuck that. I want that one.

1113
01:07:29,561 --> 01:07:34,561
Keith Jackson used to use when he do
Monday night football way back in the day

1114
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:38,950
or Redo the college games. Remember
Keith Jackson? Huh? Hello again.

1115
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:43,150
Everybody that says kicked Jackson.
Remember that guy? Alabama,

1116
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:46,570
Crimson tide and I'm fucking
world learnings. I Michigan,

1117
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:51,250
they're going to be Schwab and paint. Um,
anyways. Yeah, so that's what I got here.

1118
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,180
That was a really long fucking
way to go to explain that.

1119
01:07:54,181 --> 01:07:57,790
I put an orange spongy thing in the
end of my fucking Mike and I'm a Jew.

1120
01:07:57,791 --> 01:08:00,580
I know I'm cursing a lot right now and
I'm cursing. I'm not cursing at you guys.

1121
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:03,910
Okay? Sometimes people get
confused. Stop cursing at me.

1122
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:07,270
I'm not cursing at you and cursing and
my hangover because I described shit to

1123
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:11,500
you. All right? Jesus Christ. Look at
this fucking fake wood in this desk.

1124
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,540
This is the kind of desk that you sit,

1125
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:18,080
you know that you sit at when
you're like confessing to a murder.

1126
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:21,050
You know what I mean? And you just
sitting in there trying to wear you down.

1127
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,420
They bring in some food acting
like they're your friends.

1128
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:31,610
I was just watching those fucking
cold case files, man. God Damn,

1129
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,730
those things are creepy.
He just fucking creepy.

1130
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,010
Just watching the people when they come
in and, and they, and they, and they,

1131
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,800
they get questioned for the murder and
they just sounded like, you know, regular,

1132
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:46,250
regular guys. Where were you that
night? Ah, you know, I was home

1133
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:52,430
watching a basketball game, you
know, just chilling out at a pizza.

1134
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,070
Find out he fucking hacks up 23
people. Then when they, when they,

1135
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:00,760
when they admit it, they're like, oh yeah,
yeah, yeah, I did it. You know, they,

1136
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:02,330
they found this one guy that, that, uh,

1137
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:06,250
who's that fucking guy that
the green river, I never,

1138
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,520
they always got to give them nicknames,

1139
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:10,160
the fucking news so they
can sell more papers.

1140
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:12,950
They give them nicknames like they're
going to the rose bowl. Shit, you know,

1141
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:17,000
crazy legs Johnson,
he's killed 48 fucking people.

1142
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,730
They call me ice man.
Um, anyways, so there,

1143
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,240
there's one guy up in Seattle,
right? He killed all these,

1144
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,780
all these women who was brutal and uh,
they picked the guy up,

1145
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:31,910
he never been arrested
before and they, they, they,

1146
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:35,780
they meet them outside of his job
cause they put together a case. Okay.

1147
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,940
He has no idea that they're
onto them. And they got, they,

1148
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:43,070
the cops come up to the guy and they
say, listen buddy, uh, where, you know,

1149
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,950
fucking whatever the police officer's,
I choose to try to get a headache.

1150
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:48,530
I don't know what the fuck they say.
You know, they say hi, we're cops.

1151
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:51,590
And we're here to arrest you for
the murder of four women. Now,

1152
01:09:51,591 --> 01:09:55,220
if you've never been arrested before, when
your heart drop, that guy just is like,

1153
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,420
he, I guess evidently he just went, oh,
okay. Then they brought him down there,

1154
01:09:59,421 --> 01:10:03,260
he confessed to that and he confessed to
like fucking 60 other women that he had

1155
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:06,770
killed. So they bring this guy into, uh,

1156
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,450
another room to talk to what?
To a psychologist, you know,

1157
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:15,290
cause he wants to try to break them down
so you can figure out so he can stop

1158
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:19,700
these maniacs. Right. And they asked
the guy this question, they said, ah,

1159
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,680
you know, if you could, um,

1160
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,860
you could pick out one thing about your
personality that you feel is different

1161
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,960
from the average person walking
down the street, what would that be?

1162
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:38,360
And without missing a beat, the guy said,
ah, that whole, that whole caring thing.

1163
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:47,300
Wow. You know, when you think you
don't give a fuck Jesus Christ,

1164
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:52,130
just regular. Yeah. The whole Karen,
that whole caring thing. Yeah.

1165
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,340
I just don't seem to give a
fuck. It's weird, you know,

1166
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,480
I don't know. I hate watching that.
I don't know why I watch that show.

1167
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:01,250
That show literally gives me nightmares.
You know what I mean?

1168
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:03,830
You start thinking about what?
This is not funny.

1169
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,230
What the fuck am I talking
about? See, this is what happens.

1170
01:11:06,231 --> 01:11:07,910
This is what happens when
you go out boozing. I,

1171
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:09,590
you know what the sad thing is as I know,

1172
01:11:09,591 --> 01:11:13,950
at some point at some point this weekend,
I'm probably going to do this again.

1173
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:18,470
But fortunately I'm in New York City
so I want end up at a steak and shake.

1174
01:11:18,471 --> 01:11:22,190
I have never eaten there. I think
I've made fun of that fucking place

1175
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,530
on these podcasts. How would you rate,
how would you guys out there? Huh?

1176
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:33,450
All my listeners out there, please tell
me you listen and please tell me I'm not.

1177
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:34,001
I'm done.

1178
01:11:34,001 --> 01:11:39,001
Just sitting here baking under this
fucking hotel lamp for nothing.

1179
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,810
How would you rate the worst?
Your worst?

1180
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:48,480
Like a fast food, you know
what I mean? Everybody, you
know, no one wants to eat it,

1181
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:51,210
but we all eat it cause you know it
tastes good. Fucking tastes good.

1182
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:53,220
But then there's, there's
certain ones, either you had,

1183
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:58,260
either you had a bad experience or
you, uh, just the look of it. You know,

1184
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,250
I got, let's say for me like Taco
Bell, I just can't go in there.

1185
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:07,200
There's just something about
the colors on the sign. They,

1186
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:08,670
it just makes my stomach hurt.
You know,

1187
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:12,280
you just get that awful feeling
in your stomach. You know,

1188
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,460
I fell the same way about like Arby's.

1189
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,840
He's never fucked with RBS.

1190
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:19,690
Yeah.

1191
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:21,860
Um, Mcdonald's guy. I'm old
school. I like Mcdonald's

1192
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:26,110
in and out of this shit,
but you know,

1193
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,970
I got a lot of memories
as a kid at Mcdonald's,

1194
01:12:27,971 --> 01:12:30,550
so I think that one's still wins even
though in and out is even better.

1195
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:34,120
But there's just certain ones I won't
even go into, you know? All right guys.

1196
01:12:34,121 --> 01:12:38,140
I'm fucking fade and fast. Jesus Christ.
I need a fucking water or something.

1197
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,530
The hell did I do with that water?
Didn't I have water around here?

1198
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:45,720
Hang on a second. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

1199
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,030
Fucking water I should had
last night. All right, let's,

1200
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,970
let's get on with the questions
here. Um, if you're new to my page,

1201
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:53,760
you probably think I'm out of my
fucking mind and you would be right.

1202
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:55,620
I am out of my mind,
but you know what?

1203
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:57,610
Yeah,

1204
01:12:57,610 --> 01:13:00,580
you know what? I don't have anything
to say to that. I am guilty as charged.

1205
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:05,320
What are you fucking perfect.
Why don't you go to sit tough fucking www.

1206
01:13:05,321 --> 01:13:07,930
I'm fucking perfect.com and
go listen to that podcast.

1207
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:13,090
I bet there's a lot of fucking lapse on
that one. You know? Did they got a mixer?

1208
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,900
I've got gotta fucking mixer.
Bitch. You liked that shit.

1209
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:19,693
Yeah,

1210
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,680
I'm learning a lot of computer stuff.
You know what?

1211
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:25,130
How about you guys make me computer
literate? Can you do that for me?

1212
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:27,110
I'll start off with something really easy.

1213
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,310
Something that really fucking annoys
me on my computer. And you know what?

1214
01:13:31,311 --> 01:13:32,580
Maybe someone else does this.

1215
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,470
Maybe this annoys someone else who
has a computer who also has a drinking

1216
01:13:36,471 --> 01:13:40,840
problem. Okay. And then, uh, you
know, I'll read how to do it. I mean,

1217
01:13:40,841 --> 01:13:43,490
I can help another drunk out there.
All right.

1218
01:13:43,491 --> 01:13:47,210
This is one of my problems that I have
when I go to,

1219
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,580
when I go into to apple works.
Right.

1220
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:54,470
The text is so fucking small. I
don't understand it. It's set.

1221
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:58,340
I know how to change it, but I gotta
change it every time. All right.

1222
01:13:58,341 --> 01:14:02,190
Right now it's stuck on 12 okay.

1223
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,990
Which is basically squint size.

1224
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:10,860
You know when I copy and paste your guys'
emails into my fucking thing, it's it.

1225
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,970
It makes it smaller.
I don't know what it's doing.

1226
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I wanted at 18 I want the default set
at 18 how the fuck do I do that in apple

1227
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:22,150
works? I've got a brand new MAC book.
I want to learn how to do that. Okay.

1228
01:14:22,151 --> 01:14:26,140
I want to learn some shit. You
know? I know how to upload.

1229
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:29,800
I know how to do this now. Look at
me. I don't know what to upload. Shit.

1230
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:32,590
I'll turn it into a fucking MP3.
I'll send it right to you.

1231
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,420
I know how to do that now.
I feel great.

1232
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,290
It's my new opening line when
I hit on chicks in the road.

1233
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:42,880
You know what's up, sweetie? Are
you doing? You'd like to show.

1234
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:48,130
Do you know I can also upload audio
files and turn them into an MP three Oh,

1235
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:53,990
put it on a desktop. A fucking
drag it right over there. Same Way.

1236
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:56,870
I'm going to drag you across the
fucking carpet and Mike Hotel.

1237
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:01,730
What the fuck is that? All right. Can
somebody teach me how to do that, please?

1238
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:06,080
Okay, and let's get on with the podcast
here. You know what the problem is? Is,

1239
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:09,490
is not enough fucking room here. Well, I
got it. Why don't I just move this dude,

1240
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:13,700
I even have a little stand here for my
microphone. I have a little fucking stand.

1241
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,810
This is like a,
I dunno,

1242
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,930
this is one of these like really nerdy
things that if you start when you're 18

1243
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:25,460
by the time you're 30 you're famous
and you're not a nerd anymore.

1244
01:15:25,461 --> 01:15:29,750
Like chicks want to fuck you.
It's on, it's unreal. But
when you start this at 40,

1245
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:33,740
it's just pathetic and
sad. Okay, here we go.

1246
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:37,770
We're going to go to a, I already did
the underrated, so I don't, I do over it.

1247
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:43,250
Um, I know this is really, this is
really coming off grumpy. I understand,

1248
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:46,250
but whatever, you know,
last week I was pissed.

1249
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,990
This week on grumpy. You know what? I'm
due for a happy one about next week.

1250
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:55,890
Next week, be all bubbly and I won't be
cause I'll be flying across this country.

1251
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,830
Oh man, that's gonna suck.
Let's not think about that dino.

1252
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:03,090
Like I literally fall asleep on the plane.

1253
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:06,990
I've flown across this country so many
fucking times that I can literally look

1254
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:11,520
down and pretty much guess
what state I'm over. You know,

1255
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:16,830
as a passenger I can do that. Why these
levels so low but the fuck is going on.

1256
01:16:16,831 --> 01:16:20,970
There we go. Might not talking into
this thing. Hello, test. There we go.

1257
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:25,800
You know what I mean? I can
look out. I can tell, you know,

1258
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:30,690
pretty good. I mean, Rick,
I dunno. Wait a minute.

1259
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:33,510
What the fuck am I bragging about?
What does southwest is a desert.

1260
01:16:33,511 --> 01:16:38,240
Do you get into Colorado? You've got
the mountains, starts getting flat.

1261
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:42,200
You're like, all right, this is the
Brassica Kansas. Maybe we're in the Iowa.

1262
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:45,360
He starts seeing more lights.
You moving towards fucking

1263
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:51,750
into Illinois. Right. And that
all works. I don't fucking know.

1264
01:16:51,751 --> 01:16:55,800
Like I actually like,
I recognize like lakes now,

1265
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:00,660
you know, I can look down at my watch.
Ah, you know what? It's taken this long.

1266
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:04,710
We're right about here and we should be
seeing Cleveland coming by. There it is.

1267
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:08,700
There it is. I looked down sometimes
to look at fucking stadiums.

1268
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:13,220
All my fucking life is now.

1269
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:17,270
If I could be outside the plane and look
at my stupid round head looking out of

1270
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:20,690
that little oval fucking window.
This is what I signed up for.

1271
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,940
This is how fucking hung over I am.
I'm actually bitching that I'm a comedian.

1272
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:29,390
Something that I wanted to do something
that I decided to do. All right.

1273
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:34,190
Jesus Christ. There was a way for you
guys to email me a fucking tampon.

1274
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:38,180
I think I get like 9 million this
week. All right. Uh, here we go.

1275
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:41,150
Let's read the overrated. All
right, let's get into your thoughts.

1276
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:44,270
I think you've heard enough from me for
one week. All right. Over eight bill.

1277
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,160
All right, Bill. Uh, I
think this is overrated.

1278
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:49,070
A lot of people don't talk about this.
This is coming from a woman. She says,

1279
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:52,370
male strippers are overrated.
She said,

1280
01:17:52,371 --> 01:17:56,540
especially when they are hired
for a Bachelorette party,

1281
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,140
is it me or does uh, uh, Jesus Christ,

1282
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:02,660
I can't read when I'm fucking
not hung over. She goes,

1283
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:06,800
is it me or does anyone else think this
is the stupidest waste of 125 bucks

1284
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:10,730
they've ever seen? You guys get
strippers? 425 bucks. Jesus.

1285
01:18:10,731 --> 01:18:14,390
Is there anything that sucks about being
a woman? Yeah. Given birth periods.

1286
01:18:14,391 --> 01:18:17,820
All right, you're right. You're
right. Sorry. Um, yeah. I can't even,

1287
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,300
let me get back to this.
Yeah, the guys are all,

1288
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,690
the guys were all muscled up and
everything, but to be honest,

1289
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,340
when you see women looking
at male strippers and they
are hooting and hollering

1290
01:18:28,341 --> 01:18:31,130
and laughing and laughing it
up with their girlfriends,

1291
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:34,430
they're actually laughing at the stripper.
Yes,

1292
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:39,460
it is true that they are likely some
women who enjoy it and thinking this guy

1293
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:41,210
would probably be awesome in bed,

1294
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:46,211
but 95% of women are hysterically laughing
at the Ridiculous Man All oiled up in

1295
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:52,031
his g string with his stupid little
boombox playing NXS what you need,

1296
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,280
Jesus Christ. Yeah, she just, there
you go. She's painting a picture there.

1297
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:02,540
That's what you need and a good story
and you need a narrator who's not fucking

1298
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:05,540
grumpy and hung over anyways,
playing what you need.

1299
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:09,440
Gyrating around the living room
and dry humping. Dad's lazy boy.

1300
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:15,770
You know what? Jesus Christ, uh,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1301
01:19:15,771 --> 01:19:18,560
This is really fucking long. Let me get
to the point here. She says, well women,

1302
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:22,940
what women want is women
want a man who was a man,

1303
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,730
kill spiders, drank beer, etc.

1304
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:30,790
None of us would picture a man acting
like a sex machine with a wax chess

1305
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,350
dancing in front of a group of housewives.

1306
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:36,800
A man will offer my girl a man will offer.

1307
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:40,430
My girlfriend is a stripper and he knows
his buddies will congratulate them.

1308
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:42,650
Like, God, Dude, you go friends,
a stripper. That's awesome.

1309
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:46,160
A woman would never offer
the same information. Why?

1310
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:50,870
Because she knows the response from other
woman would be a snicker and a yikes.

1311
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,930
Gee, I'm so sorry. Look, is that true?

1312
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,320
The women really not like
don't just like cougars,

1313
01:19:57,321 --> 01:20:00,500
don't they like male strippers?
You know?

1314
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:05,070
If you want to know what it's like
to be a guy, be a woman in your ear.

1315
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:08,190
As far as like our sex drive,
you know,

1316
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:11,990
I think maybe a woman once you're in
your forties at that time I didn't know

1317
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,410
what the fuck point I'm
trying to make there.

1318
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,920
I just know that like older women
act like the same level of retarded.

1319
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:23,670
That guys act like
our entire fucking wise.

1320
01:20:23,671 --> 01:20:26,160
When they start to get older. I don't
know what it is. I guess it's safe.

1321
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:30,270
They finally don't give a shit and they
could admit that they like cock or they

1322
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:33,570
like sex, you know? Because before
they have to be like, well, you know,

1323
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:37,530
it's just for procreation. All
right. Just like my boyfriend's cock,

1324
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,210
I don't have any other fucking
fantasies, you know? Whereas guys,

1325
01:20:42,211 --> 01:20:43,980
we just get,
we just get to be pigs.

1326
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,150
We just get to be the God damn pigs
that we are. But you know what?

1327
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:50,850
You get to cry at movies and get that
shit out and I get to hold it in.

1328
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,760
You know what? There was a rough
one was that Harvey milk movie.

1329
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:57,600
The amount of Shit I had to think about
so I wouldn't tear up there in that

1330
01:20:57,601 --> 01:21:02,310
movie just so I wouldn't be feeling, you
know, as a guy, you can't fucking cry.

1331
01:21:02,311 --> 01:21:04,890
So I got to sit there and be like, you
know, he's, he's going through some shit.

1332
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,040
I know everyone was getting all sad when
a, you know, when he gets whacked there,

1333
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:15,420
you know. So in order to not to get
emotional myself, I just thought,

1334
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:17,700
you know what, if someone just came home
and just kicked him right in the balls

1335
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:25,050
and I just started laughing,
you know, that's what it is.

1336
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:30,420
That's what comedy is. It's to
stop from crying. All right?

1337
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:35,310
Um, number two. Oh, this
is, oh my God, this,

1338
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,140
some New Yorkers aren't
going to like this one.

1339
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:41,520
This is another thing that she
says is overrated is underrated.

1340
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:45,450
Actually a two run homer
in the bottom of the ninth.

1341
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,300
Ninth after Mary off of Marianna Rivera.

1342
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:53,610
And I could've fucking read that better.
Yeah, the red sox swept the Yankees. Man.

1343
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,550
This fucking unbelievable. There'll
be back. This shit always happens.

1344
01:21:56,551 --> 01:22:00,500
One team always jumps out in front of
the other team. Right? And then we would

1345
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,730
do we fucking own you guys.
You good on you good.

1346
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,170
And then they literally
almost like it's fixed. Now.

1347
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:11,030
The Yankees will sweep us down there and
we'll play each other like 12 times or

1348
01:22:11,031 --> 01:22:14,540
13 times and someone will win
when it fucking seven to six.

1349
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:18,350
It's a God damn business people.
Okay, there's no fucking Santa Claus.

1350
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,070
Don't I don't buy it. Um, and we
stole home plate and you know how to,

1351
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,520
how the fuck does that happen? $200
million team. You know something.

1352
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:26,840
You realize the red sox sale,

1353
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:30,770
they're only there number four this
year as far as money spent. Oh yeah.

1354
01:22:30,771 --> 01:22:35,330
A lot of you fuckers didn't know that.
Did Ya? Yankees spent 200 million,

1355
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:40,160
then it's the mets. Then I believe the
cubs and then us. We're 122 million.

1356
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,360
Isn't that great?

1357
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,960
Now we can act like where some little
fucking starving panty little Pansy

1358
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:49,010
fucking team
Yaggie did ruin in baseball.

1359
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:54,230
Um, who gives a fuck? I'll tell
you what's funny is of the, the,

1360
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,260
the fuck did I just do? There I am.
I sit on my computer. All right,

1361
01:22:58,261 --> 01:23:00,920
let's let you know what
I'm really starting to feel
like I'm losing the momentum

1362
01:23:00,921 --> 01:23:04,760
of this 31 minutes. 31 hung over minutes.
Dude. I'm going to tell you right now,

1363
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:08,960
this is like four hours. I feel like I'm
doing a fucking telethon right now. Uh,

1364
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:13,710
let's get to the questions for the
week. I got a, I've got one here. Um,

1365
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,720
am I the only one who thinks
Terry Francona is glasses?

1366
01:23:16,721 --> 01:23:21,640
Make him look like a cancer stricken
Mrs Clause. He's the, he's the,

1367
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,820
uh, he's the manager of the red sox.
I did see him. Yeah. Those they,

1368
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:31,120
they're definitely a, yeah, he looks
like he should be at the very least, uh,

1369
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:36,250
you know, going out Carolyn or something
reading the night before Christmas.

1370
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,100
I don't fucking know.
I don't know. You know,

1371
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:42,640
I talked a lot about sports last week
and a couple of people really got pissed

1372
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:45,640
just talking about how dumb they are.
Some guy since this,

1373
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,690
this huge fucking rant about saying how,
you know,

1374
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,810
being into a sports team is
almost as dumb as patriotism.

1375
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,930
I know the point you're trying to make.
You know what I mean?

1376
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,940
I get it. You know, I know what you're
saying, but you know what the fuck dude.

1377
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:03,900
I mean I've, I've done like
almost two years of these things.

1378
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:08,910
Eventually sports was going to come up
that we always have to talk about what

1379
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:12,390
you want to talk about. This
guy was really, I dunno.

1380
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,000
Sometimes I don't know if people are
going for Douche bag of the week.

1381
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,250
I don't know what,
do I have anything else here?

1382
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:21,570
I don't think I have anything else. Oh,
Bill, I need some advice. All right,

1383
01:24:21,571 --> 01:24:24,210
here's another guy obviously had
some Jamison. Listen to this shit.

1384
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,350
This is his question. Hey
Bill, big fan bombed right now.

1385
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,290
I didn't get there for a second.
I thought like he said,

1386
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:33,270
big fan and he meant like that line bomb.

1387
01:24:33,271 --> 01:24:37,380
But evidently he means he shit faced or
he's the worst speller anywhere in the

1388
01:24:37,381 --> 01:24:40,680
world. Here we go. It starts
off. It says, anyways,

1389
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,220
I need some objective viewpoint.

1390
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,470
Me and this hot chick,

1391
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:52,040
I'm a big old ugly rugby player
recently started hanging out.

1392
01:24:52,381 --> 01:24:55,830
He misspelled that and we like, no, he,

1393
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:01,290
he put the e at the beginning of each.
We like each a lot.

1394
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:07,000
Jesus Christ. Dude recently started
hanging out. We like each other a lot.

1395
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:09,820
My problem,
she used to date a black guy.

1396
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,430
I have black friends. My buddies
will tear me apart. Thoughts,

1397
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:19,180
advice.
Thanks John.

1398
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:25,030
Well John, um, my thoughts are you're
pretty fucking shit faced when you,

1399
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:26,650
uh,
when you sent that email,

1400
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,300
that's my thoughts cause the
rest of it makes no sense.

1401
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:34,420
She used to date a black guy.
Okay, you have black friends.

1402
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,760
Is that supposed to establish
that you're not racist?

1403
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:41,660
My buddies will tear me apart.
Like what?

1404
01:25:41,661 --> 01:25:45,650
They're going to in a good natured way
rib you that your Dick isn't going to be

1405
01:25:45,651 --> 01:25:49,130
as big. I don't know what you're
trying to say here. Tell you what,

1406
01:25:49,131 --> 01:25:50,360
why don't you fucking,
you know,

1407
01:25:50,361 --> 01:25:53,630
don't email me now cause I know you're
feeling the way I'm feeling, but you know,

1408
01:25:53,631 --> 01:25:58,250
sober up. Try to clean that up. You know,
I think maybe you got something there.

1409
01:25:58,251 --> 01:26:02,600
Send me a second draft. I
Dunno. What the fuck that means.

1410
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,830
She used to date a black guy.
How to fuck would they know

1411
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:12,250
you have black friends? My Body will
tell you where your black friends.

1412
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:15,800
Do they know this guy?
Did she used to date one of the,

1413
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:19,450
one of your friends who's black?
That's just a weird statement.

1414
01:26:19,451 --> 01:26:23,500
I have black friends. Do you have
black friends? Sure. We all do.

1415
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:27,250
Like you're trying to loan yourself
some sort of credit credibility.

1416
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,370
The fuck does that made anyways?
You know how many friends do I have?

1417
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:39,010
Jody Rosea. He's half Egyptian.
So that takes care of the, uh,

1418
01:26:39,670 --> 01:26:42,040
does that take care of Arabs?
Are Egyptians considered era?

1419
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:44,800
I don't know what the fuck Arabs are. I
don't even know. I don't fucking know.

1420
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,950
I can't, I know. I don't
know. I don't know.

1421
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:53,170
Is being an innocent one
question I've always is being
Jewish, is that, oh, I know.

1422
01:26:53,171 --> 01:26:57,820
It's a religion. Is it a, is it
a race? It's not a race, right?

1423
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,280
I don't want to tie,
a long time ago, I, I,

1424
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,480
I was in high school and one of
my friends was Jewish, right?

1425
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:11,660
And uh, I said to him, I said,
what are you, what are you Italian?

1426
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:15,680
He goes, no, I'm Jewish. And I,
I could tell I offended them.

1427
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:18,740
So I didn't do a follow up question,
but in my head I'm going, okay,

1428
01:27:18,741 --> 01:27:22,310
Italian is a race at the Jewish was a
religion. I know Jewish is a religion.

1429
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:27,230
You know, that doesn't make any fucking
sense. I don't fucking know. Let's,

1430
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:30,350
let's read a revenge story.
That's what he'd revenge story.

1431
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:34,430
And let's fucking wrap up this podcast.
This is going to be a shorter one.

1432
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:38,060
This is the hung over version.
Oh, here's something else.

1433
01:27:38,061 --> 01:27:41,420
I came up with this. I'm actually
contributing underrated. You know,

1434
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:45,170
it's underrated. Free Internet and
the hotels got damn. And I liked that.

1435
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:49,700
I wrote all that other shit in anger, so
let's not read that. All right, here's a,

1436
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:54,560
here's a big long revenge story to end
the podcast this week and let me know

1437
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:55,790
about what do you guys
think about this sign?

1438
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:58,220
I know kind of intern in my head a
little bit and I got this mic like

1439
01:27:58,221 --> 01:28:02,270
stationaries that affecting the sound
cause God knows I'm not going to go back

1440
01:28:02,271 --> 01:28:06,290
and listen to all this shit. I usually
listen to them, but not this week, man.

1441
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:09,230
Not this week. It's been a rough fucking,
we kind of want to tell you, you know,

1442
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,020
this is one of these times, so it's
great. I don't have a kid, you know,

1443
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:13,590
because I would have no patience for him.

1444
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:18,500
I know it's a new bit I've been working
on in my act talking about how much I

1445
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:22,910
like, uh, I like kids when they're, I
like kids the same way. Like I like dogs,

1446
01:28:22,911 --> 01:28:26,300
I like, I like them when they're
puppies and full of life, you know?

1447
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:29,180
And once they get a little bit older
and stubborn, they think they know shit.

1448
01:28:29,181 --> 01:28:33,470
It's just, it's fucking there.
Annoying. You know? I like kids like a,

1449
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,710
you're fucking cracks me up.
I saw this kid the other day,

1450
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:40,040
this kid was like two years
old, right. You know, it's
funny about toddlers, right?

1451
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:44,750
How they did I, I talked
about this already. How they
got their little fucking,

1452
01:28:44,751 --> 01:28:48,420
they got, they already have a beer
belly and they never even drank daily.

1453
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,330
You know, look, these
little fucking truckers,

1454
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:58,390
it always is just fucking makes me
toddlers fucking beer bellies just fucking

1455
01:28:58,431 --> 01:29:01,110
make me laugh every time
I say, oh, you know,

1456
01:29:01,111 --> 01:29:03,840
it's because they're not self
conscious about their bodies.

1457
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:05,250
They don't give a fuck.

1458
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:09,510
So they just got it hanging out there
like some fucking drunken slob and a

1459
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:13,170
barbecue. You know, they just,

1460
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:16,620
it's just funny to me.
They look like they've already fell.

1461
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:21,180
They fucked up in life. You
know, like they're gambling,

1462
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:25,750
they're eating the wrong food. I don't
know. Why do they have those fat bellies?

1463
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:30,970
Jesus Christ. You're eating mush
in milk. You do you the first,

1464
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:34,761
well,
I just admit,

1465
01:29:34,761 --> 01:29:38,900
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about sometimes and literally sweating

1466
01:29:38,901 --> 01:29:43,700
right now because of a lamp. That's
how fucking hung over. I am. Okay.

1467
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:46,650
Okay. Here we go. You know
something, I'll say, hey, I met,

1468
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,140
this is something I've been doing. I've
been, I've been trying to eat, you know,

1469
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,660
one just veggie meal a day,
you know,

1470
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:55,410
to then I can make up for the fucking
oxen that I'm going to eat later on that

1471
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:59,760
night or evidently the fucking steak
and shake that I'm going to eat. And uh,

1472
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:01,860
you know, I can't stand about
those fucking veggie meals.

1473
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:05,140
I ordered this Veggie meal,
right? I ordered a, uh, uh,

1474
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:09,390
some sort of fucking horrific Veggie,
a rap,

1475
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:13,530
which really sucked because they
grilled the vegetables. You know,

1476
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,120
like when you go beyond where
they start becoming mushy,

1477
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:22,620
it just a, I can't even say what it
sounds like, what it, what it tasted like,

1478
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:25,680
because it's gonna make me fucking
gag here, but you know, it just,

1479
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,620
I'm going to do it. You know
what, if you're squeamish,

1480
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:32,190
cover your fucking ears right now. You
know what it tastes like when when you,

1481
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:36,310
they over steam vegetables
or they fucking, uh,

1482
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:39,690
over grill. I don't know what
it gets all squishy and mushy.

1483
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:41,250
It tastes like it's preach.
You'd

1484
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:47,640
just pausing right now waiting for the
groans people throwing their headphones

1485
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:48,483
off.

1486
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:53,950
All you people on elliptical,
talented. You just grown.

1487
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,700
Do they have the fat Harry Fuck
next to you. Start looking at you.

1488
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:02,950
Wondering what you're listening
to. Um, there's one I hate.

1489
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:06,850
You're Veggie wrap. All right.
And they go one veggie wrap.

1490
01:31:06,851 --> 01:31:11,020
I ordered some soup like an old
fucking Jewish man in Manhattan, right?

1491
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:15,960
And then what happens?
They bring it to me and this,

1492
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:20,750
they got French fries on the side.
It's like, can't you see? I'm trying,

1493
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:26,080
I'm trying to get in shape. I understand
it's a French fries or potato. It's a,

1494
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,160
it's a vegetable. I get it. What the fuck?

1495
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:31,170
It's like when you go to
the cheesecake factory,

1496
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:35,480
you order a salad and then they go,
would you like to third? It's like,

1497
01:31:35,481 --> 01:31:39,000
do you not get the fucking
theme here lady? Do you not
see what I'm trying to do?

1498
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:44,080
Do you see my bloated
alcohol infused phase?

1499
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:46,770
Do you understand what I'm trying to
do here? I actually, you know what,

1500
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,360
it's not even fair cause I actually
talked to one of those a cheesecake,

1501
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:54,860
I think I was making fun of the
cheesecake factory and now my act. And um,

1502
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:57,051
they actually was,

1503
01:31:57,051 --> 01:32:01,450
there was a waitress in the crowd as I
always ended up shitting on something.

1504
01:32:01,451 --> 01:32:04,450
And then someone from the crowd, it's
like, Hey, I do that. What the fuck?

1505
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:08,950
So it was this cheesecake factory waitress
and she came up to me and she said,

1506
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:13,550
uh, she goes, actually, they
make us do that. We have to
do that. If we don't do it,

1507
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,310
we get fired.
Really?

1508
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:18,830
Is that what it's come down to?

1509
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:20,853
Yeah.

1510
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:20,930
Yeah.

1511
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:24,990
That's where the decisions in your life
led you that you have a job that if you

1512
01:32:24,991 --> 01:32:28,350
don't ask people for cake, which is
usually a nice fucking thing to do.

1513
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:31,380
If you don't do it,
you get fired.

1514
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:36,770
They have a gun to your fucking head to
basically have your job to try to make

1515
01:32:37,141 --> 01:32:41,240
people become diabetics. Is
that what's going on? Yeah.

1516
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:44,160
Is that what happened in your life?
Because you sucked at something in school.

1517
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,130
Okay.

1518
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:49,480
You know, I don't fucking know. All
right, let's get on with a revenge story.

1519
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:53,300
I am fucking, I know why I
shut off the air conditioners.

1520
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:54,880
Anybody else just hate air conditioning.

1521
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:59,230
I don't mind air conditioning when it's
9,000 degrees out, but when it's fucking,

1522
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:05,040
you know, it's like, I don't know
what it is. It's like 65 degrees out.

1523
01:33:05,041 --> 01:33:08,820
70 72 and they got the air
conditioning on. It's like,

1524
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:13,590
are you trying to give me pneumonia? Huh?
Is that what the fuck you trying to do?

1525
01:33:13,591 --> 01:33:17,370
Jesus Christ. Am I in a mood? Hey, what
do you guys think about that? Swine flu?

1526
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,060
You know, this might be a
little comfort, controversial,

1527
01:33:21,061 --> 01:33:23,160
but I'm kind of all for it.

1528
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:24,890
Yeah.

1529
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:29,890
I think this is another time where
were were getting in the way of nature

1530
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:36,370
running it's course nature
is trying to kill off us.

1531
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:41,300
Not all of us,
but some of us so that you know,

1532
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,140
there's no traffic.
You know what I mean?

1533
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,030
It's like the forest fire. It's a
rebirth. You know, your burn it down.

1534
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:54,360
Some animals die, some trees die.
You get rid of all the brush.

1535
01:33:54,361 --> 01:33:58,740
It's like a spring cleaning. That's all
a plague is. It's just that we, you know,

1536
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:03,290
you don't want any loved ones to
die plagues. And I'll tell you,

1537
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:07,320
man plagues that there are really,
uh, they're fascinating. Like they're,

1538
01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:10,100
they're putting out all these stats.
You know what? Fuck this revenge story.

1539
01:34:10,101 --> 01:34:12,510
Let me go on the Internet
here. Let me, let me, uh,

1540
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,570
let me restart Firefox now. What is your
fucking problem? I never stopped it.

1541
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:20,510
I'm in the middle of a podcast.

1542
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,430
Okay.

1543
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:25,310
God Damn, these fucking computers. What
do they do? This shit to me. Come on,

1544
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:29,840
let's go. Anyways, yeah, they were,
they were given up all, all these, uh,

1545
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:38,210
all these statistics on a plagues and
that type of stuff every day. Like,

1546
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:38,910
do you need all that?

1547
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:43,910
Like 675,000 people died in the United
States in 1918 because of like an eye

1548
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:52,080
influenza, whatever the fuck that is.
I ain't know what the fuck that is,

1549
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:56,930
but everybody got it and a whole
bunch of people died, man, you know,

1550
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,950
fuck it. You know what's fucked up
about that was thank God they did.

1551
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:04,970
You know, cause if they didn't
they all would've fucked

1552
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:07,920
and they would have made
more fucking people.

1553
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:10,670
You might've been where we're at right
now. We might have been there, you know,

1554
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:15,380
15 years earlier. I love, I
just throw numbers out man.

1555
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:19,310
Like I'm a fucking scientist here or
when I'm talking about, hang on a second,

1556
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:21,950
let's look up plagues.

1557
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:27,490
It's going to get me on some
sort of FBI lists, you know?

1558
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:29,930
Oh I need to do now is
Google fucking anthrax in?

1559
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:33,370
There'll be a knock at my door and I
really will be confessing at this fucking

1560
01:35:33,371 --> 01:35:37,270
table here.
Great plagues

1561
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:43,960
in history. Okay. That should
be a great game. Show that,

1562
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:47,490
that'd be a fucking great game.
Show. Okay. Is you try to,

1563
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:51,850
you start googling shit and whoever
gets the FBI to come to your place first

1564
01:35:51,851 --> 01:35:55,920
wins and you can't do
like easy shit like uh,

1565
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:58,870
like he obviously any sort of creepy
pedophile stuff cause that's just fucking

1566
01:35:58,871 --> 01:36:01,360
horrific and it's,
it's never funny is it?

1567
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,540
Even though I joke about it
on stage sometime. All right.

1568
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:09,010
List of historical plagues.
Let's go to Wikipedia.

1569
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,690
God knows they're always number one.
Alright.

1570
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:15,740
In human history,

1571
01:36:15,741 --> 01:36:20,210
the term plague refers to an epidemic
disease causing a high rate of mortality,

1572
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:25,670
a pestilence and academic dash. Shut
the fuck up. I want to, I want stats.

1573
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:30,140
Okay. What? I've got to go MLB.
You got to go to CBS sports.com.

1574
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:33,860
Is that what I got to go?
Ongoing danger.

1575
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:38,900
Great plagues of Athens.
Let's get to some recent ones here.

1576
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,250
You know, what do we got
here? Great plague of Iceland.

1577
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:47,780
See what I'm saying? Everywhere everybody
had a plague and it thin the herd.

1578
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:52,610
Great plague of Portugal, great plague
of Russia. Great Plague of Ireland.

1579
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:54,290
Scotland.

1580
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:56,440
Yeah,

1581
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:00,490
London plague. Just attack the
fucking city for two years.

1582
01:37:00,491 --> 01:37:04,660
1592 to 15. 94, the Italian plague,

1583
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:09,490
everybody's fucking had one. It was the
last time we had a plague. You know,

1584
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:14,740
you just say that you just can nip it
in the bud with, with, with fucking,

1585
01:37:14,741 --> 01:37:19,210
with the media. They just, they get it
out there before it gets a chance to, to,

1586
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:22,480
to help with the traffic.
You know?

1587
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:27,600
So I'm in New York City right now and
they have a number of a number of cases

1588
01:37:27,821 --> 01:37:32,170
out in Queens and uh, you know, they're
telling people how, oh, you know,

1589
01:37:32,171 --> 01:37:34,420
it's funny as hell. They tell
people, did you use common sense?

1590
01:37:34,421 --> 01:37:37,120
If you feel like you're getting the
flu, go to the hospital. Right? So they,

1591
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:41,380
they say, you know, if you
sneeze or if you cough,

1592
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:46,150
just cover your mouth. Right? So half
hour later, I'm walking down the street,

1593
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:48,670
walking down whatever fucking
avenue here in New York,

1594
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,560
and I see this kid on a bicycle and he
proceeds to sneeze and he just turns his

1595
01:37:53,561 --> 01:37:57,120
head and it looked like a fucking take.
And I just burst out laughing,

1596
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:00,930
bursting out, laughing. You
know, rather than being,

1597
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:05,910
I'm like the exact opposite of a Yah.
I was going to say a hemophiliac.

1598
01:38:05,911 --> 01:38:07,050
That's not what I'm trying to say.

1599
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:09,900
What are those fucking people that
always nervous that they got something,

1600
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:12,960
a hysterectomy? What does it,
I know it begins with an h.

1601
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:16,980
This always happens to me is what happens
to my fucking brain as I knew the word.

1602
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:22,050
And then at my brain panics and
all I'm left with is a letter, uh,

1603
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,840
fucking hemophilia.
I can't get that word out of my head,

1604
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,350
you know,
and I got to talk about something else.

1605
01:38:28,351 --> 01:38:30,500
Let's talk about the Jonas
brothers comedy show. Huh?

1606
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:35,670
I think I speak for the group when
I say it's about time, you know,

1607
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:42,060
because their music is fucking
hilarious. And uh, I, I just, you know,

1608
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:46,320
the fucking cunt is fucking business,
you know what I mean?

1609
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,030
Really is, is that, is that what I
should, that's that what I should've done.

1610
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:55,440
I should've gotten this
business with fucking three,

1611
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:59,590
three of my other brothers,
you know, I'll play the drums.

1612
01:38:59,591 --> 01:39:02,950
You get a Ukulele and then you do this
and then you'll get your own fucking

1613
01:39:02,951 --> 01:39:07,800
sketch show
sons of bitches.

1614
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,610
Oh yeah, I am better. I'm better
about the fucking Jonas brothers.

1615
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:15,660
I want some goddamn stats here on dead
people. All right? I don't feel good.

1616
01:39:15,661 --> 01:39:19,110
So I wanna read about dead people.
Make all the black death. Here we go.

1617
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,670
Here we go.

1618
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:25,020
The black death was one of
the deadliest pandemics.

1619
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:29,070
The fuck is a pandemic is
an epidemic in a pandemic.

1620
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:34,370
A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious
disease that spreads through pop

1621
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:39,990
populations across their large region.
For instance,

1622
01:39:39,991 --> 01:39:43,830
a continent or even worldwide.
Thank you, Wikipedia.

1623
01:39:43,831 --> 01:39:45,360
So what the fuck is an epidemic

1624
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,920
is what happens and you just start
fucking search and everything and then you

1625
01:39:49,921 --> 01:39:54,921
figure out what the hell an epidemic
occurs when new cases of a certain disease

1626
01:39:55,421 --> 01:39:58,720
occur in a given human
population during a given period.

1627
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:01,370
Isn't that the same fucking thing?

1628
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:06,380
Is that not the same fucking
thing but close enough? All right,

1629
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:09,200
you guys want to hear
about the black death, huh?

1630
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:11,840
When you're sitting there and your
cubicle at work? While, God damn,

1631
01:40:11,841 --> 01:40:14,090
and I'm going to read you some shit.
God knows you could do this yourself.

1632
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:17,600
It's right there. And Wikipedia. The
black death was according to chronicles,

1633
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:22,160
characterized by Boobos,
a swelling in the lymph nodes.

1634
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,730
I don't even know where the lymph nodes
are. I think there are they in your neck.

1635
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:30,260
A hypochondriac. Bam. I got it. All
right. See, that's what I gotta do.

1636
01:40:30,261 --> 01:40:32,590
Just start talking about
all this shit that on.

1637
01:40:32,591 --> 01:40:36,260
I know where I yell out the word and
now I can't remember what I was talking

1638
01:40:36,261 --> 01:40:39,710
about. Oh, I know. I'm the exact
opposite of a hypochondriac where uh,

1639
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:45,080
no, that doesn't make sense. HYPOCHONDRIAC
is nervous. I had to keep my,

1640
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:45,914
I eat apples.

1641
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:50,000
Scientists and historians at the beginning
of the 20th century assume that the

1642
01:40:50,001 --> 01:40:55,001
black death was an outbreak of the same
disease by the bacterium who gives a

1643
01:40:55,271 --> 01:40:59,080
fuck and spread by fleas with the help of,

1644
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,950
of animals like the black rat.

1645
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:05,133
However,

1646
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:10,450
this view has recently been gimme
some stats for Christ's sake.

1647
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:15,330
How many fucking people died?
What?

1648
01:41:15,331 --> 01:41:19,240
Wait, wait a minute. The origins
of the plague. Does that,

1649
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:23,590
did that to Deb deep a debit to the
total number of deaths worldwide is

1650
01:41:23,591 --> 01:41:26,680
estimated at 75 million people,

1651
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:32,740
approximately 25 to 50 million
of which occurred in Europe.

1652
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:38,910
The black death is estimated to have
killed 30% to 60% of Europe's population.

1653
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,290
Just stick about that people.

1654
01:41:43,291 --> 01:41:47,790
Six out of 10 automobiles that you'll see
in front of you tonight as you try and

1655
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:50,490
drive home would not fucking be there.

1656
01:41:51,270 --> 01:41:53,370
And we already built the highways

1657
01:41:55,590 --> 01:42:00,210
to hold, you know, a ton of fucking
car. You know what I'm saying?

1658
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:05,340
You know it's America, man.
You want to fucking drive,

1659
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:10,110
put the top down and I'm making Pontiac's
anymore. How fucking sad is that?

1660
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:14,460
Let's think about some great Pontiac's.
That's where we're going to close out.

1661
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:18,000
After we talked about the epidemic,
we talked about death.

1662
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:21,360
Let's talk about how sad it is that
there's no more Pontiac's anymore.

1663
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:25,710
There's just no more.
The Pontiac Trans Am eh,

1664
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:31,940
kinda drops off after that.
But you know the sun bird,

1665
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:38,070
the t 1000 you guys remember the Pontiac
t 1000 as when you're really fucked up.

1666
01:42:38,071 --> 01:42:39,690
When you bought a bootleg Chevette.

1667
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:43,590
That's when you really were saying that
you were an extra level of white trash.

1668
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:47,340
Okay? You ate macaroni and
cheese five times a fucking week,

1669
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:52,190
you know?
You know I can't even,

1670
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:55,960
what the Fuck I've even said today
that I was, I riffing about Sharon,

1671
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:59,650
a tray of macaroni cheese with
another man looking into his eyes.

1672
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:04,060
Was that this podcast?
Was that another podcast?

1673
01:43:04,061 --> 01:43:07,960
Was that at some point a show last night?
I don't know what,

1674
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:12,790
but this has been the Monday morning
podcast for a April fucking 20 something.

1675
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:17,740
I don't know what it is.
I don't know. This is,

1676
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:19,810
we're into garbage time.
They still have their as well.

1677
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:21,790
Their official site is still up.

1678
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:27,180
When I went to a party x or they
have the Bonneville. You know what?

1679
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:30,720
They were a one trick pony.
Anybody drive a Pontiac?

1680
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:34,440
I don't know. Well, let's talk
about that next week. Okay.

1681
01:43:34,441 --> 01:43:36,900
This is the Monday morning podcast,
Mba Caroline's this week.

1682
01:43:36,901 --> 01:43:40,470
And then I'm taking a break
here for a May and June,

1683
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:45,570
going to recharge my fucking batteries
and I'm coming out swinging in July.

1684
01:43:45,571 --> 01:43:47,490
I started the comedy works in Denver,

1685
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:53,120
and then I go do a Eddie's
fist fuck in a fucking a Uma.

1686
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:00,500
I'm just gonna make up shit now.
And then I'm going to be at a wallpaper.

1687
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:05,460
Freddy's at the limelight.
Um,

1688
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:10,130
beautiful theater. We're a
Cirque de Solei performed.

1689
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,070
Just reading the awful brochures here.
What is Cirque de Solei?

1690
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:15,770
I'm really impressed with the,
the strength that those guys have.

1691
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:20,600
Not so much on the costumes.
All right, you guys, that's
the podcast for this week.

1692
01:44:20,601 --> 01:44:22,670
I hope you guys all
have a tremendous week.

1693
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:27,230
And I apologize if I was a little bit
grumpy this week, but, uh, you know,

1694
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:32,150
I'm sorry. All right, that's on me. I'm
just going to palm. Sorry. All right.
