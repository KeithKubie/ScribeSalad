00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:04.259
When you imagine the robots of the future
what do you picture?

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.740
Humanoids made of steel?

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.749
Massive metal monsters?

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:10.850
Turns out, they might be a little squishier.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.180
If you haven’t noticed, evolution of biological
life has done a pretty good job at making

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.080
things perfectly equipped to interact with
our world.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.720
And now, robotics is starting to follow suit,
in an emerging field called soft robotics.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.010
You’ve probably seen this little guy from
MIT swimming through your social media timelines.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.850
Look at him go!

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.989
This autonomous fishbot can swim right alongside
marine life, giving biologists a whole new

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.499
way to observe this ecosystem.

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:40.479
And there’s other tech helping scientists
study the ocean, like this underwater microphone

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:42.149
aboard the Seeker Vessel!

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.010
Long distance swimmer Ben Lecomte and crew
are on an expedition to gather data to raise

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.010
awareness about ocean health.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.410
Their hydrophone records the secret sounds
of the deep.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.379
Hydrophones and soft robots could be important
conservation tools in the future, because

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.989
they’re uniquely suited to work with their
environment.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.929
And these bots in particular draw inspiration
from nature for their designs.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.390
But before I get into all that, let’s tackle
how these squishy bots actually work in the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.390
first place.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.840
The main characteristic of a soft robot is
that, well, it’s soft.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.501
Instead of traditional materials, the body
is constructed out of rubber, polymers, and

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.060
sometimes even fabric.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.009
But it’s harder to adapt the components
that make the bot move, like the actuators

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.821
- These have to be radically rethought for
soft bots, since traditional robots tend to

00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:29.380
use electric motors that are difficult to
downsize.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.020
So, instead some use hydraulics or pneumatics
to push air or water through the soft body

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.880
parts in a way that creates predictable motion.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.470
Others use shape memory alloys that change
shape when exposed to heat, so when a limb

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.130
is heated, it will unfurl or coil up in a
particular way.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.369
Some researchers are even looking into replacing
actuators with soft, LIVING MUSCLES, which

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.969
is [WHOA], and, a whole video of its own.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.520
When it comes to the power source, some of
these guys- like our friendly robo fish - rely

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.340
on small lithium ion batteries.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.729
But there’s also a lot of experimentation
in this part of the field - from hydrogel

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.100
batteries (which we’ve covered on the channel
before) to ditching batteries all together

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.590
and using chemical energy from hydrocarbons.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.090
But, soft robotics still has some limitations.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.650
Many robots still require tethers to electrical
or pneumatic devices because we haven’t

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.000
figured out how to integrate these onboard
the robot, just yet.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.280
That hasn't stopped engineers from tinkering
with new robots, and there are some really

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.040
cool ones in action!

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.990
One such example is the octopus robot from
BioRobotics.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.460
Inspired by the squishy but strong nature
of octopus tentacles, This robot uses synthetic

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.390
arms that rely on shape memory alloys to grasp,
and even crawl- allowing the robot to travel

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.010
underwater.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.250
Octopuses have also inspired gripping robots,like
this one from Harvard- that can gently pick

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.850
up marine life from the ocean floor so biologists
can study them.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.350
What makes all of these robots so promising
is the way they easily adapt to new tasks

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.430
and environments, unlike traditional robots
that would need to be frequently modified

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.750
or reprogrammed.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.200
This also means they have a ton of applications.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.170
They could one day be used in rescue missions
that require squeezing through small spaces

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.680
and traversing over rugged terrain.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.900
Or these soft, biocompatible robots could
be used inside your body for medical diagnosis

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.900
&amp; treatment.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.800
To be honest, I’m kind of surprised it’s
taken us this long to start making soft robots.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.090
I mean when you look at animals--which are
debatably the best examples we have for adapting

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.030
to new environments -- they’re pretty much
all soft!

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.890
Humans ourselves are less than 15% rigid material!

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.940
But, I suppose, biological evolution did take
millions of years, and to be fair, robot evolution

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.400
has only just begun.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.870

And to check out the crazy sounds Ben and
his crew recorded with their hydrophone- watch

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.960
their latest episode here.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.690
This data will help us learn about our largest
ocean’s marine life AND help us to protect

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.690
it!

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.880
Can’t get much cooler than that.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.840
Thanks for watching.
