00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.100
Michael Spivak's "A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry" - he really means topology, I suspect, but...

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:16.320
It says: "A classical theorem of topology states....blah blah blah. To which of these 'standard' surfaces are the following homeomorphic?"

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.380
A hole in a hole in a hole. If I solve this, what is it?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.520
Well, I head over to the glass shop and, I said, "I can make that."

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.160
So I made a hole in a hole in a hole.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:42.040
There's a hole... that... goes through a hole, that's in a hole.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.240
In the book it's in paper, here, it's glass.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.320
How do I simplify this to something that answer Spivak's question?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.380
So, let me take the inner hole and stretch it a little bit.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.380
[Glass sounds]

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.060
Now, one of these holes is untouched,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.500
but what used to be a ring around this is now stretched out - it's almost an ellipse.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.460
Well, that's okay in topology, because I can stretch things.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.480
Haven't changed much. Let's go a little bit further - I'm going to keep pulling that this way.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.600
*grunts* Until this piece of plastic I'm just touching right now, the end of my finger.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.820
It's coming all the way up. I'm going to stretch this, oh, about 2 or 3 cm further this way until it starts to pop out the other end.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.360
So now what had been a ring is stretched out and I'm now touching that place

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.080
Let's keep going. Now, this part of the hole

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.360
and this part of the hole - I'm going to move these, I'm going to push the glass

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.040
until it's almost wishbone shaped.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.160
This will pull this way, I'll pull this one over here.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.780
This is the original beast,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.380
however, instead of this coming over like this, that piece of glass now is continuous across

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.180
&gt;&gt; We haven't broken any rules yet?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.300
We've broken no topological rules. In fact, we've just assumed that this is strictly... flexible glass.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.280
And, at 1200 degrees fahrenheit, it *is* flexible glass.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280
Now that we have this

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.840
I'm going to pull this *brrrp*

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.400
Around here.  And this *keeeywp* over to there.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.860
We're going to straighten it out

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.020
So the wishbone, here, has

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020
become a t-bone.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.880
Haha. A t-bone and this is straight through.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.960
It's still the same 'beast' we started with,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.700
but we just moved the holes around, we moved things around.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.660
Is it still a hole, in a hole, in a hole?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.640
Well it's still the original thing,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.560
that's been topologically reshaped.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.880
The rules are, we can't cross things, we can't tear anything, but we can move these around, and that's what we've been doing.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.240
Let's instead of going straight across, lets go boink, boink.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.040
Let's make this that's something a little more curvy.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.040
From here,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.400
over to here.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400
Notice, we still have,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.260
This hole is the same as this hole

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.600
(Is it ok if I'm pointing with my nose?)

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.800
So, these are still topologically the same, the intersection of the 'T' is now the intersection of two curves.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.320
And you can see what we going to do next.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.900
The next step I'm going to do is to pull this tube over here and pull this tube over here.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.700
Remember here's one of those holes.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.980
Now, we've separated those holes so that's is now three tubes.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.700
One tube here, this tube, this tube.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.760
Let's go back to what's the source of that.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.880
And you can see we've simply pulled those tubes along.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.360
Nothing was torn, haven't added, haven't subtracted from it.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.660
BRADY: It does seem a bit like it's torn, but no?

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.740
Has it been torn? All I'm doing is pulling this hole along here,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.940
and this hole further along here.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.980
So I'm just pulling that outward,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.720
and in so doing,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.220
forcing this tube to the side, this tube to the side.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.560
I now have a tube, a tube, and a hole!

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.760
Given this, let's straighten the tube.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.880
So I've got this tube, I'm gonna bring this hole around here,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.800
this hole around here, pull them really straight.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.000
Like this. And now those two curved tubes are two straight tubes,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.960
And, I have another straight tube here.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.820
Ok, now it's a piece of cake!

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.760
All I have to do is pull these two to be parallel to this one,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.080
Or, alternatively, rotate this tube to be parallel with these two.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.000
So, let's try it!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.740
Here is all three of those tubes parallel.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.100
So all three holes are now parallel.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.900
And! [CHUCKLES]

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.400
Now this is getting close to a solution!

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.840
I'll take this in one hand, this in another,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.800
and I'm gonna squash it! I'm gonna push it down this way.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800
So instead of a sphere,

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.480
I'm going to compress it down till it's more like a pancake.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.500
I'll get something that's pancake-shaped,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.820
but the three holes are still there.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.400
There's also a tiny little hole there.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.020
When you make hand-blown glass,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.100
it's necessary to have a little hole to let out hot air --- ignore that guy.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.760
These are the main three, and oh!

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.040
Doesn't take much to say this is a three-holed torus.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.300
This is a torus with one, two, three holes in it.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.300
Which, is a nice way of answering Spivak's question.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.300
How would I manipulate this into a solution?

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.800
A three hole torus will make any topologist in the universe happy! in the universe happy!

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.860
But, let's go back and try something else.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.260
Let's go back one step. Remember we had this guy? And...

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.620
I said, we're going to squash this down to here.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.860
Instead, let's pull this tube...

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.240
over towards the sides. So right now it's near the middle,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.240
let's pull it over towards the sides.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.040
In fact, let's pull it almost to the edge, and we find that,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.380
It would be possible to go through it.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.380
If we kept pulling it, we could pop it out!

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.860
From here...

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.940
We can make a sphere with three handles.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.260
I am jumping over several steps, but think of this:

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.880
Right here is a handle, I could put 
a chain right through here,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.120
pick it up, I put a string right through here,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.940
pull this outward.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.820
This, is the same as this.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.880
Notice that hole there, is the same as...

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.600
This hole, a second hole, and a third hole.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.800
Here's a three-handled sphere,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.560
a sphere with one, two, three handles.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.000
This three-handled sphere, is homeomorphic to this three-holed sphere,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.920
and that's homeomorphic to this three-holed torus!

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.120
If I have this three-handled sphere,

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.420
I can go to my glass shop, heat it up,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.820
put my hand right there, push down right here, pshh,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.720
and push down really hard,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.880
and, from here, I can transform this,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.720
into a three-handled coffee mug.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.940
This is a three-handled mug,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.340
a three-handled drinking glass,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:22.140
that's homeomorphic to, and has the same 
properties as this three-holed torus,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.160
a three-holed donut,

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.060
and that is...

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:34.100
the solution to the question: What does this map onto.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.860
BRADY: thanks for Audible.com for supporting this video.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.100
If you haven't discovered audio books yet 
as a great way to catch up on excellent writing,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.600
well, you've been missing out.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.980
After numerous recommendations from friends, 
I've finally been listening to Ready Player One.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.480
I actually became a bit obsessed with it on a recent holiday,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.300
every spare few minutes I had I was listening to a bit more of the book.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.360
I don't want to give anything away about it,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.680
because I really enjoyed going into it cold, knowing nothing.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.680
I want you to have the same if that's possible, 
but I do recommend it highly.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.200
But whatever kind of writing you're into, you can rest assured,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.380
Audible is going to have  something you'll like.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.260
And when you do sign up, you get your first month
and your first books for free.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.120
Do that on audible.com/numberphile, 
so they know that you come from this channel,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.800
and if you do download a book that say you don't like, 
Audible will let you exchange it for another.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.980
I've actually done the exchange myself, and it was really easy,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.000
but I don't think you want to exchange Ready Player One.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.980
It's a really good recommendation
for your first audio-book,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.800
really well-read by  Wil Wheaton.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.740
Give that book a try, give Audible a try, and thanks
to them for supporting Numberphile yet again.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.660
CLIFF: the changes that have happened from one to the next to the next,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.000
have not required moving things through one another.
