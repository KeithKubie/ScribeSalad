00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.352
This right here is a
picture of Carl Linnaeus,

00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:05.060
and I'm sure I'm
mispronouncing the word.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.780
He's a Swedish gentleman
who lived in the 1700s,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.170
and he's known as the
father of modern taxonomy.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.750
And the word
taxonomy, if you just

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.590
split up into its
original root, it really

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.987
is the science of really
classifying things.

00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:20.320
But when people talk about
taxonomy-- and in particular,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.300
in Carl Linnaeus'
case-- they're talking

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.900
about the
classification of living

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.410
things, so
classifying organisms.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.430
And his real innovation--
before he came about, peopled

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.360
realize that you had
species of animals,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.382
that lions had certain
properties that

00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:38.340
made them all lions, that
they could interbreed

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.182
and things like that, that
monkey or chimpanzees would all

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:43.140
interbreed and that would
be a separate species

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.890
and that polar bears
were separate species

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.009
and that humans were
a separate species.

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.300
But what he really brought
to the table was he decided,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.760
well, let me not just
group animals into species.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.600
Maybe I can group species
into other categories.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.760
And that's where we
get the genus from.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.224
You group similar
species into a genus.

00:01:00.224 --> 00:01:01.640
And then he went
even beyond that,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.306
because even the idea
of grouping things

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:06.610
into a genus dated back
to the ancient Greeks.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.030
He said, well, why don't I
group similar genuses together

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.730
into orders, orders together
into classes, and then classes

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.500
together into kingdoms.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.010
So really what he
did is he said,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.960
well, maybe I can classify--
I can create a tree.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.130
I can create a tree of life.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.838
I can create a structure
so we can really

00:01:21.838 --> 00:01:24.684
see how far apart any
two organisms are,

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.350
and so that's why
he's really the father

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.240
about modern taxonomy.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.350
And he did not have many tools.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.895
All he could do was look at
his powers of observations

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:35.290
and say, OK, those kind
of animals, they have fur,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.060
or they reproduce in this way.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.860
Or they lay eggs, or
they don't lay eggs.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.530
Or they have spinal columns, or
they don't have spinal columns.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.640
So that's the best that he could
do when he did his taxonomy.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.070
But since then,
there's obviously

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.110
been tons of innovations
in how we perceive

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.881
animals, or the natural world,
and our tools for studying

00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:53.380
them.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.650
So one thing that he
did not know about

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.770
is evolution-- this
idea of common ancestry.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.490
And between our
understandings of evolution

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.890
and our ability to look
back at the fossil record,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.690
that helps us get more
precise at figuring out

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.270
which animals are
related to which.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.170
We can see, do they have a
common ancestor more recent

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.300
or further back.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.670
And what even Charles
Darwin didn't have,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.420
which we now use as
a tool in taxonomy,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.559
is the genetic evidence.

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.850
So now we don't even have to
rely on the fossil record.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.330
We could look at the DNA of
two species that exist today

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.400
and see how similar is that DNA.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.450
And that tells us how
recently they branched apart

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.790
if we were able to find
it in the fossil record

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.180
or how recently in the past
did these two species become

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.707
two different species.

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:42.790
Now, with that said, I do
want to make this clear.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.390
And this is something
that I've always

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.889
had a little bit-- it was fuzzy
for me the first time that I

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.920
was exposed to this
idea of taxonomy--

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.620
is that taxonomy is as much
an art as it's a science.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.300
And today, even to
this day, people

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.850
are debating about the
best way to classify things

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.810
and what do you
pay attention to.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.590
And DNA has been
the best tool so far

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.330
in giving us a more systematic,
a more analytical way,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.670
of deciding how close
two animals are.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.940
But to a large degree, a lot
of these categories-- deciding

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.920
where to divide along kingdom,
phylum, class, order, family,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.950
tribe-- these are
somewhat arbitrary.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.749
These are just picked based on
early taxonomists, including

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.290
Carl Linnaeus, and
saying, well, this

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.873
looks like a grouping
right over here.

00:03:21.873 --> 00:03:24.301
But they could have grouped
at a broader level or a deeper

00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:24.800
level.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.920
So these things right over
here are somewhat arbitrary.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.470
A more analytical way is
just to see how much DNA you

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.690
have in common and then use that
as a measure of how far apart

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.950
two animals are.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.760
Or really, I should
say, two species are,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.910
because this taxonomy doesn't
only apply just to animals.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.030
It applies to plants
and bacteria and Archaea

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.800
and all sorts of
things, so it's actually

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.445
a broader thing
than just animals.

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:51.320
Now, with that out of
the way, what I thought

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.111
would be fun-- just so
that we could really

00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.340
get a sense of where
modern taxonomy is, where

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.660
the field that was essentially
fathered by Carl Linnaeus,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.730
where it is now, how we-- and
use that to figure out where we

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.270
humans fit into the big picture.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.470
And obviously, I'm drawing
just a small fraction

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.030
of the universe of the
organisms that we even

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.100
know about right now.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.440
But at least it frames the
picture in terms of something

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.079
we understand--
in particular, us.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.200
In particular, humans.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.300
Now, our species, we
call ourselves humans.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.930
But we're really Homo sapiens.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.250
And the sapiens is
the species part,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.084
and then Homo is the genus.

00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:30.500
And what I'm doing
right over here

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.020
is I'm saying, well, if
Homo is the genus, what

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.030
other species were
inside of Homo?

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.040
And the reality is--
or at least as far

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.480
as we know-- there are no other
living species inside of Homo.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.640
We probably killed them all off.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.606
Or maybe we interbreeded
with them somehow,

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:47.230
which might have
argued that maybe they

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.440
weren't different species.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.950
But more likely,
they were competing

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.380
in the same ecosystems, and
they became endangered species

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.410
very quickly when they
competed with our ancestors.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.580
But the most recent
other species

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.900
within the genus that we know
about are the neanderthals,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.310
and the formal term for their
species is neanderthalensis.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.390
Now, if we go further
up the tree of life,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.200
further up the taxonomy--
and you'll sometimes

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.310
see tribe mentioned.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.480
Sometimes you won't.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.550
And we tend to get a
little bit more granular

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.740
the closer we get to humans.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.290
When we go further away
in the tree of life,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.380
we get a little bit
less granular sometimes.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.330
But that's not always
the case as well.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.150
You go a little bit further
up, then you get Hominini.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.520
And I'm sure I'm mispronouncing
some of this as well.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.489
But another species that's in
Homonini that is not in Homo--

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:35.280
and I'm definitely not
listing all of them,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.660
and that's why I'm showing
all of these other branches

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.180
over here-- is what we
call the common chimpanzee.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.380
And their species name
is-- their genus is Pan,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.600
and their species
is troglodytes.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.594
So you would refer to
them as Pan troglodytes.

00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:53.010
And that's also
another convention

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.590
that Carl Linnaeus
came up with, is

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.140
that you refer to a
particular species

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.384
by its genus and
then its species.

00:05:59.384 --> 00:06:01.800
And you capitalize the genus,
and you lowercase a species.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.300
So we're Homo sapiens.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.380
This is Homo neanderthalensis.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.710
This Pan troglodytes or often
referred to as chimpanzees.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.310
Now, if you go up one
higher level of broadness

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.010
on this tree of life, you
then get to the family.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.120
And we are in the
family Hominidae,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.310
and I'm sure I'm
mispronouncing it once again.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.080
But just to give you an
example, so everything I've

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.240
listed so far, everything
I've talked about so far

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.770
are within this family.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.350
And to show you an animal
that is not in this family,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.950
you just have to
look at the gorilla.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.640
And you could call it
the Gorillini gorilla,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.290
or G gorilla.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.480
That's its actual species name.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.450
And this family right over
here, sometimes the common term

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.465
is the great apes.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.420
Now, you go one further
level-- and the whole reason

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.700
why I'm doing this--
and I'm not by any means

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.310
being exhaustive about
the other species that

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.530
are in that family, but
that are not in our tribe.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.530
I'm just trying to give
you a picture of-- as we

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.640
get further and further
out, as we get further

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.090
out of our tribe, our
family, our order,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.960
we're getting to things where
the common ancestry with human

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.030
goes further and
further back in time.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.750
The genetic similarities
become more and more different.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.520
And even just the
physical differences,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.960
if we look it at a very
superficial level, become

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.010
more and more and
more different.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.710
So you get to even
a broader category.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.590
This is where you
get to the primates,

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.214
and this is probably
something that you

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:29.590
might be somewhat familiar with.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.150
And the term
primates is generally

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.010
these animals that
look like they either

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.835
live in trees or a
rain forest, or they're

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:36.610
a descendant of things
that live in trees.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.120
So they have these things that
they can grasp things with.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.667
They're good at
climbing, broadly.

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:41.500
Not all of them are.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.330
Humans are probably
the worst primates

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.660
when it comes to climbing,
or one of the worst.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.810
But that's the general
classification.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.830
That's what we generally think
of when we think of primates.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.440
And if we think of a primate
that is not a great ape,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.330
you just have to
think of a baboon.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.010
So this right here is a baboon.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.380
It is a primate, but
it is not a great ape.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.020
It is probably a descendant--
some baboons actually

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.872
don't live in trees.

00:08:03.872 --> 00:08:05.580
But all of them are
probably a descendant

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.163
from things that
first lived in trees,

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:08.900
and that's why their
hands and their feet

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.560
look the way they do.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.480
Now you get to even a broader
level of classification.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.464
You get to the mammals.

00:08:14.464 --> 00:08:15.880
And once again,
probably something

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.130
you're used to thinking about.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.790
Mammals are
air-breathing animals,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.100
and they tend to
have fur or hair.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.670
They tend to provide some
form of milk for their young.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.251
They have active mammary glands.

00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:30.750
There's other things we can
talk about, what makes a mammal.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.791
I'm not going to go into
the rigorous definition.

00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:35.120
But just to give you an
example of a mammal that is not

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.909
a primate, I could show you
this polar bear right over here.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:44.074
This is a mammal that
is not a primate.

00:08:44.074 --> 00:08:45.240
And I could do other things.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.740
I could show you a
tiger, or I could

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.050
show you a giraffe or a horse.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.070
And so by no stretch
of the imagination

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.820
am I being comprehensive.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.450
But let's keep getting broader.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.910
Now let's go to the
class-- we're already

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.460
at the class of Mammalia.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.110
Now let's go to the phylum.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.790
In phylum, we are--
humans and all mammals,

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.150
we are in the phylum chordates.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.475
And chordates, we're
actually in the subphylum,

00:09:10.475 --> 00:09:12.100
which I didn't write
here, vertebrates,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.391
which means we have a vertebra.

00:09:13.391 --> 00:09:15.730
We have a spinal column
with a spinal cord in it.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.590
Chordates are a little
bit more general.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.570
Chordates is a
phylum where-- kind

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.550
of the arrangement of
where the mouth is, where

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.670
are the digestive organs,
where the anus is,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.974
where the spinal column
is, where are the brains,

00:09:25.974 --> 00:09:27.640
where are the eyes,
where are the mouth.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.339
They're kind of all
in the same place.

00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:30.880
And if you think
about it, everything

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.540
I've listed here kind of has
the same general structure.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.150
You have a spinal column.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.560
You have a brain.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.900
You have a mouth.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.460
Then the mouth leads to
some type digestive column.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.020
And at the end of it, you
have an anus over there.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.770
And you have eyes in
front of the brain.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.520
And so this is a general way--
and I'm not being very rigorous

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.670
here, is how you
describe a chordate.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.010
And to show a chordate
that is not a mammal,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.950
you would just have to
think of a fish or sharks.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:05.170
So this right over here
is a non-mammal chordate

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.520
This is a great white
shark over here.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.680
Now, let's go even broader.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.346
As you'll see, now
we're going to things

00:10:10.346 --> 00:10:15.490
that are very, very
not human-like.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.990
So you go one step broader.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.030
Now we're in Animalia,
the kingdom of animals.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.720
And this is the
broadest category

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.550
that Carl Linnaeus
thought about.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.789
Well actually, he did
go into trees as well.

00:10:26.789 --> 00:10:28.330
But when you think
of kingdom animals

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.246
and you think of things
that aren't chordates,

00:10:30.246 --> 00:10:32.540
you start going into
things like insects.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.820
And you start going into
things like jellyfish.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.610
If you go even broader, now
we're talking about the domain.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.700
You go to Eukarya.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.790
So these are all
organisms that have cells.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.660
And inside those cells, they
have complex structures.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.600
So if you're a Eukarya, you have
cells with complex structures.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.470
If you're a Prokarya, you
don't have complex structures

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.620
inside your cell.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.110
But other Eukarya
that are not animals

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:00.060
include things like plants.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.610
And obviously, I'm
giving no justice

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.737
to this whole branch
of the tree of life.

00:11:03.737 --> 00:11:05.820
It could be just as rich
or richer than everything

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.694
I've drawn over here.

00:11:06.694 --> 00:11:10.160
This is just a small fraction
of the entire tree of life,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.240
but let's go even
broader than that.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.640
So if you go even
broader than that,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.030
you say, well, what's
a kind of life form

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.300
that isn't Eukarya, that
wouldn't have these more

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.760
complex cell structures, the
mitochondria in the cells,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.410
the cell nucleuses?

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.602
Then you just have to think
about something like bacteria.

00:11:28.602 --> 00:11:30.060
And if you want to
go even broader,

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.018
there's things like
viruses that you could even

00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:34.400
debate whether they
really even are life,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.510
because they are
dependent on other life

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.060
forms for their
actual reproduction.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.860
But they do have genetic
material, like everything else.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.030
And that, to me, is kind
of a mind-blowing idea.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.580
As different as
a plant is-- look

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.580
at a house plant that is
in your house right now

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.410
or the tree when you walk home
or bacteria or this jellyfish.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.980
There is a commonality
in that we all have DNA.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.460
And that DNA, for the
most part, replicates

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.490
in a very, very,
very, similar way.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.110
So it's actually crazy that
we actually even are related

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.620
or that we even do have a
common ancestor with some

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.452
of these things.

00:12:03.452 --> 00:12:05.160
And then it even begs
the question, well,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.834
what about things like viruses?

00:12:06.834 --> 00:12:08.000
Anyway, I'll leave you here.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.375
And I really just
want to let you

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:13.310
know that-- make sure you
realize that this is a-- it's

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.240
definitely worth studying,
because we understand where we

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.735
fit in in the universe
of living things.

00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:21.360
But I also want to
let you know that it

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.510
is a little bit of an
art on where you decide

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.930
where to make these
classifications

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.000
or where you decide to
focus on, whether you

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.050
want to focus on
what properties,

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.850
whether it's how they reproduce
or how they feed their young

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.780
or can they move around
or what they breathe

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.200
or whatever, things like that.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.500
Anyway, I'll let you go there.
