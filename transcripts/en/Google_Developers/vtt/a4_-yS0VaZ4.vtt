00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you guys for
joining us here at the YouTube

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:04.430
space at the second
day of I/O. We're

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.659
so excited to have you
and talk about distribute.

00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:08.450
And basically when we
talk about distribute

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.400
what we want to talk about is
once you design and develop

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.410
amazing product, how do
you get it out there?

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.170
I couldn't be more exciting than
to be joined by Aaron Grant who

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.610
is a co-founder of Thalmic
Labs to talk about how you

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.460
distribute an amazing
new technology which

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.175
is on the forefront
of wearables.

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.150
And after graduating
Y-Combinator and coming

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.680
in all the way from
Waterloo, we're

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.388
so excited to have
you here today, Aaron.

00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:30.180
How are you doing?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.180
AARON GRANT: I'm doing great.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.210
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.650
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.149
Awesome.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.951
So again, my inner Star
Wars fan could come out,

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:37.700
because I feel like
what you're developing

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.283
with your technologies
like the Force.

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:40.540
You're able to control things.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.465
Not with your mind, but with
the power of wearable technology

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:47.994
and controlling what's in front
of you around all devices.

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:50.160
Can you give a little more
detail about what exactly

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.572
the Myo armband is
and how it came to be?

00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:53.280
AARON GRANT: Yes.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.660
So the Myo armband is what we
call a gesture control armband.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.160
And it's a slim band that
you wear around your forearm,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.534
like you'd wear a sweatband.

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:04.700
And it has a couple different
types of sensors in it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.610
that actually detect the
motions and gestures you

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.450
make with your
hands and fingers.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.440
And we allow you to use that to
control any of your technology,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.690
whether it's your laptop or
your Smart TV or your tablet.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.986
The possibilities are
pretty much endless.

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:22.360
The way it works is that
there's a couple different types

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.480
of sensors embedded
in the armband.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.370
One of those is a
motion sensor that

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.760
tracks the position
and orientation

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.170
and movement of your arm.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.980
And we combine that with the
proprietary muscle activity

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.780
sensors we've developed,
which actually detect

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.740
the electrical
signals that occur

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.410
when you contract your muscles.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.130
So if I'm wearing a Myo
armband, and I make a fist,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.950
just by reading the electrical
impulses from my muscles,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.350
it can tell that my
hand is making a fast

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.320
or touching different
fingers together.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.900
So that's what
the technology is.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.816
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:58.740
Aaron, tell me about what
your favorite use case is?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.960
You guys put together
a lot of materials,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.150
a lot of videos about
you showing Myo in action

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.380
in the kitchen, a
military soldier using

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.860
it to control robots.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.330
What's your favorite, most
mind blowing application

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.294
of your technology?

00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:13.710
AARON GRANT: There's just so
many different possibilities,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.870
it's tough to pick
one as a favorite.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.650
One of the really
interesting ones to us

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.640
is being able to use this
to control other wearable

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.240
technology.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.680
So as we see computing shifting
from being purely something

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.810
that you do sitting in
a chair at your desk

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.430
to interacting with all
these different devices

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.790
with different form factors.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.030
And some have screens
and some don't.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.070
And all this different
stuff out there now.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.410
Using the Myo to be able
to naturally interact

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.370
with those devices in
a way that makes sense

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.320
is something that myself
and everyone back at Thalmic

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.544
is super excited about.

00:02:47.544 --> 00:02:48.460
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.510
Let's rewind the clock.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.890
How long have you been around,
and what was day one like?

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.060
What was day one when you
tried to develop this armband?

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.810
What were the struggles
that you got into?

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.420
Let's talk about the early
days of your project.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.128
AARON GRANT: Yes.

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:04.240
So Thalmic Labs has been around
for about two years now--

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.960
just over two years.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.490
It was founded by myself
and two other graduates

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.660
from the University of Waterloo.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.180
And we basically got
together and decided

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.180
that we wanted to build
a company-- do something

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.680
together.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.152
And so started looking
around for some things

00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:20.860
we could work on.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.020
And we were actually
thinking about this kind

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.530
of new wave of wearable
technology, a new form

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.080
factors of devices.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.870
And what the best way to
control those and interact

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.560
with those devices
would be going forward.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.540
And that's where the idea
for the Myo was born.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.170
There are some camera-based
gesture control solutions

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.670
out there.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.800
And there is, as you
can probably imagine,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.379
a lot of limitations with having
to be in front of the camera

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.920
all the time.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.050
And so we thought about how
we could overcome those.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.000
And from that the Myo was born.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.950
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.130
So let's talk
about-- you developed

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.852
and designed the product.

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:58.310
What were you thinking about
in terms of getting out there?

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.810
Obviously, it's
something different.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.920
People aren't used to it.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.682
What did you do differently than
most other apps or start-ups

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:07.390
that are out there to
get your technology

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.390
in the hands of users?

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.140
AARON GRANT: Yeah.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.130
So one of our biggest
challenges was

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.360
that if I walked up to
someone on the street

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.389
and told them that the Myo
was a gesture control armband,

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.180
they'd have no idea
what I'm talking about.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.800
And it's a brand new technology.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.810
It's not a new version
of something else

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.830
that already exists.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.730
And so communicating to
people what the technology is,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.970
why you would want to use
it, what it's good for,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.960
is a difficult challenge.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.370
And we knew that going into it.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.737
So in terms of
getting it out there,

00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:41.570
we thought of all sorts
of different things.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.250
Like Kickstarter was an
obvious potential avenue

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.840
that we didn't exactly end
up going down that route.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.240
But we really felt
that it would come down

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.320
to how well we could
explain what the product is,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.737
what it can do, and why you
would actually want to use it.

00:04:57.737 --> 00:04:58.736
MALE SPEAKER: Of course.

00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:00.690
I think so many startups
struggle with that.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.960
They have an amazing product.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.370
And then when they try
to get to explaining it,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.650
they do so many things.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.830
Let's distill it to
a 10-second pitch.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.705
Let's put together a
PowerPoint presentation.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:10.780
But I want to talk
about something

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.910
that you did that just
really, really amazed me.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.850
You guys put together this video
that I checked this morning.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.460
You guys have over
three million hits.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.760
There's no cats in this video.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.870
It's like a viral video.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.070
And it's about a product.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.782
You guys do such an amazing
job of conveying that.

00:05:26.782 --> 00:05:28.240
And it was still
in your early days

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.490
when you were still in the
product development phases.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.736
So Aaron, talk to me about
how the team at Thalmic

00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:36.360
thought about putting that video
together, especially when it's

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.207
so ahead of the product
development curve.

00:05:38.207 --> 00:05:40.540
I thought that was a really
ingenious move on your part.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.890
AARON GRANT: Yeah.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.650
So backing up a
little before the time

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.800
when we actually created
that video, when we were just

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.145
trying to get the
company off the ground--

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:50.020
No matter who you're
talking to, whether it's

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.710
a potential investor,
or a potential employee,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.016
or anyone else, you're
always pitching your idea.

00:05:55.016 --> 00:05:56.890
And you're trying to
sell people on your idea

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.710
whether you're physically
selling them a product or not.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.480
And we found that we had
a lot of trouble getting

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.400
the idea of the Myo
across just with words

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.060
and maybe a few of PowerPoint
slides or diagrams.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.360
People would get it,
but it it didn't really

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.870
click just with that verbal
explanation of the technology.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.120
And so we realized we needed
something more than that,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.550
especially for when we wanted
to go and try and sell this

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.320
to millions of people.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.760
And so we came up with the
idea of putting together

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.300
this essentially
concept video that

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.030
showcased a bunch of the
very different applications

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.330
that Myo could be used with.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.580
And we felt that
would be a great way

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.350
to actually get across
what the product is,

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.760
what you can use it
for, and why there's

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.390
nothing else that
can really accomplish

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.260
what the Myo can do right now.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.468
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:49.240
So let's go through
this thought process.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.070
So you decided a
video is the best

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.710
way to communicate our message.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.212
And then you said, I'm
going to pull out my phone,

00:06:55.212 --> 00:06:57.170
I'm going to record some
buddies in the office.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.400
Working with Myo, you went
after a more professional agent.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.680
I think so few
entrepreneurs even

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.310
think about making a
YouTube video related

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.905
to the product in their
early days, but you did.

00:07:08.905 --> 00:07:11.030
Can you get us into the
nitty gritty of how exactly

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.026
you did that so perhaps
anybody in the audience

00:07:13.026 --> 00:07:15.060
could replicate it if they're
trying to develop something

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.660
on their own?

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.826
AARON GRANT: Yeah, for sure.

00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:19.870
So we thought about a few
different possibilities,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.630
different ways of
doing it, storyboarded

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.780
out a few different things.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.410
And one of the
main decisions was

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.450
whether to shoot
something ourself

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.750
and make it obviously a
home video kind of thing

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.180
and show some of
the early prototypes

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.130
and show what a lot
of Kickstarter videos

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.960
tend to do showing the
development process

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.370
and where we had come from
and where we're at today.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.970
And that was one option
or make a really polished,

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.360
high production value video
showcasing at its best, what

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.230
Myo could be, and
really make a video that

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.890
would have a big
impact on people.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.030
And we decided to
go the second route,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.140
work with a local up and
coming up video production

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.100
company to go and produce
something just very visually

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.020
stunning, very high energy, high
impact video that would just

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.240
grab people's attention
and make them say, wow,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.899
this is an awesome product.

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:19.940
And start to think of all
of the potential things

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.780
that they could do
with it as well.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.988
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:08:22.988 --> 00:08:25.480
It sounds like you put the
entire city of Waterloo

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.170
to work.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.390
I'm waiting for the
day where we're all

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.973
going to be like,
welcome to Waterloo,

00:08:28.973 --> 00:08:31.870
home of Aaron Grant and
Thalmic Technologies.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.990
So I think that's awesome.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.789
So talk to me, also,
some of the stats

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.360
when we were catching up the
other day just really, really

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.070
amazed me.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.830
You guys now have
40,000 pre-orders.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:39.320
AARON GRANT: Yes, we do.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.010
MALE SPEAKER: Is that right?

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.760
AARON GRANT: Yeah.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.294
MALE SPEAKER: And you guys
recently redesigned the armband

00:08:43.294 --> 00:08:44.169
and put it out there.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:45.752
So how many days has
it been since you

00:08:45.752 --> 00:08:48.240
announced the redesign
and the launch?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.810
AARON GRANT: So we announced
the basically final design

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.270
of the consumer
hardware that we'll

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.144
be shipping to all of
our pre-order customers

00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:56.140
later this year.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.530
And that was about
two weeks ago.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.270
And the reception for that
has been absolutely fantastic.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.530
And we couldn't be more
thrilled because we

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.550
spent six months redesigning,
essentially from scratch,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.557
the entire Myo armbands
to make it something

00:09:10.557 --> 00:09:12.140
that we're really
proud of and that we

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.435
think our users will love.

00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:14.810
MALE SPEAKER: And
it's beautiful.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.695
If you see that the
armband, you wouldn't

00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:19.880
tell if it's a basketball-like
armband, sweatband.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.859
It looks so seamless.

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:23.275
You guys did such a good job
of cutting it down and making

00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:25.810
it look slim and sleek.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.880
So these 40,000 pre-orders
have come in the past two weeks

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880
alone.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.450
AARON GRANT: So
these are pre-orders,

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.831
all of our pre-orders from
when we launched that video.

00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:35.330
Yeah.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:35.650
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.580
And so talk to me
about how do you

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.300
generate so many pre-orders
for this product?

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.770
And give us the
price point again?

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.520
AARON GRANT: So it's
$149 for a pre-order.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.978
MALE SPEAKER: $149
for a pre-order.

00:09:44.978 --> 00:09:47.160
And you didn't spend a
dollar in paid marketing.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.520
AARON GRANT: That's correct.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.670
MALE SPEAKER: So how
else beyond the video

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.760
did you distribute
this technology?

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.000
How did you get the word out?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.450
AARON GRANT: Yeah, so the
video was really the key.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.010
And then, once we had that
and we were happy with it

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.310
and we tested it on
some people, made sure

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.120
that it got the idea across and
did what we wanted it to do,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.830
we reached out to just a
handful of different reporters

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.180
and journalists, less
than five, and got

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.620
them to agree to write
a story about it.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.660
And from there, it
essentially just took off.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.220
We put a lot of time and
effort into making sure

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.950
that the video communicated
what we wanted it to

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.410
and how we wanted it to.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.170
And from there, we just
gave it a little nudge,

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.620
and then it went from there.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.960
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.470
So talk to me also about
the developer community.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.900
It sounds like you
have a lot of people

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.030
working on the Myo armband to
start developing your products,

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.210
apps so people can engage
in many different use cases

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.220
and make it their own.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.136
How have you empowered
the developer community

00:10:49.136 --> 00:10:50.011
with the Myo armband?

00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:51.927
AARON GRANT: Yes, so
right from the beginning,

00:10:51.927 --> 00:10:54.210
we've had a very, very
strong focus on developers.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.690
And our goal with the Myo
is to essentially make

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.800
it a platform for
controlling and interacting

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.880
with your software
and hardware devices.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.050
And so we have SDKs available
for all the major platforms--

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.450
Windows, Mac, iOS, Android.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.270
We have a very active
developer community.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.780
And actually, last
December, we began

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.980
shipping what we call our
alpha units to early developers

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.840
and partners to
get them starting

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.220
to work on
applications and learn

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.680
how they can use the technology.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.520
And we're really
excited to be starting

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.680
to get the final consumer
hardware into the hands

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.550
of a much bigger developer
community starting next month.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.758
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:43.650
So Aaron, let's talk more
about the early days,

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.330
and were there any mistakes you
made when you look back like,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.480
I wish we didn't distribute
the product this way.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480
Maybe in hindsight we
should have done something

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:50.980
differently.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.340
Anything you would
have changed in terms

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.350
of getting the Myo
technology out there?

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.470
AARON GRANT: Everyone
makes mistakes, for sure.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.840
Just because we had a fairly
successful pre-order campaign

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.610
doesn't mean that we
did everything right.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.700
This is our first
time doing this.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.380
We learned a lot along the way.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.280
I think, looking back, the
route that we went down

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.980
in terms of producing the video
and selling these pre-orders

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.660
through our own
website, I still believe

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.710
that was the right decision.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.350
There are obviously
little things

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.641
we could have done differently.

00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:30.400
Maybe the timing wasn't perfect.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.680
Some would say we should have
waited a bit longer to do this

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.610
so that our pre-order
customers wouldn't

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:37.740
be waiting for so long.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.757
But as you say,
hindsight is 20/20.

00:12:40.757 --> 00:12:42.340
MALE SPEAKER: And
so were you thinking

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.020
about developing on other
sites or doing other ecommerce

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.480
storefronts to take
the pre-orders?

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.780
And what ultimately
led you guys to want

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.970
to just post it yourselves?

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.030
AARON GRANT: So
we're big believers

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.300
in controlling the whole
product experience.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.740
And that starts when
you watch the video

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.800
or go to the site
for the first time

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.870
and basically the first time you
hear about or see the product.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.940
And so, the only way
that we could really

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.690
do that and make sure that
people have the experience we

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.560
want them to is to build
that all ourselves.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.290
So that was a natural
way for us to go.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.890
MALE SPEAKER: So let's
throw aside any cliches.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.396
Let's not talk
about oh, the work

00:13:22.396 --> 00:13:23.770
it takes to
distribute a product.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.110
Obviously, you put a
lot of heart and sweat

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.160
in putting Myo out there.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.330
What would you say to an
entrepreneur developer

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.663
today that's just trying to
get their product out there?

00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:33.525
What advice, what
little nugget of insight

00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:35.150
can you give them
that maybe you didn't

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.330
realize when you're
starting out?

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.780
AARON GRANT: Yeah, I think
this applies to more than just

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.420
distributing the
product, as well.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.640
But when you're
just starting out

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.580
and you have very
few people, you

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.020
have way more things to
do than you have time.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.150
You really, really have to
focus 100% on finding ways

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.670
to be resourceful
and get things done

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.610
that maybe seemed kind
of impossible at first.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.490
Or figure out how to open doors
that seemed like maybe they're

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.850
a bit out of reach for now.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.370
It comes down to
a lot of things.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.110
One of them is
being very creative.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.890
One of them is just
being gutsy enough

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.890
to go out and talk to people who
maybe you would think would not

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.420
want to talk to you at this
point, but you just try

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:20.380
and see what happens.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.310
There's no harm in doing that.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.970
And, yeah, just being very
creative and resourceful

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.190
in trying to find
ways, new, better

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.627
ways to do things that either
save time or save money or both

00:14:31.627 --> 00:14:34.210
is really what's going to make
or break you in the early days.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.010
MALE SPEAKER: And I guess
to bring this full circle,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.593
talking about being resourceful
and saving money, how much did

00:14:38.593 --> 00:14:40.930
that video that had over
3 million hits, what

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.640
was a ballpark figure of
how much that video cost?

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.860
AARON GRANT: So I can't disclose
the actual amount there.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.276
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
yeah, of course.

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:50.020
AARON GRANT: One
thing we did there

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.440
was we found a local up
and coming video production

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.220
company who the
publicity generated

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.720
would be equally valuable
for them as it would for us.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.700
And by doing that,
we were able to avoid

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.870
some of the sky high
prices that would usually

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.009
be associated with producing
something like this.

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:07.050
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:08.170
Yeah, and if you
look at the video,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.660
it's just so
professionally made.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.421
It's worth every ounce
of those 3 million views.

00:15:12.421 --> 00:15:14.420
And again, I encourage
you guys to check it out.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.297
Just blows you away.

00:15:15.297 --> 00:15:16.880
Sounds like it
inspired a lot of users

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.480
as well as your
team to just move

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.752
towards the vision
of your product.

00:15:20.752 --> 00:15:23.900
So it's amazing how
you got that out there.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.205
I just wanted to leave the
last few seconds here to you

00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:28.580
in case there's
anything else you

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.621
want to talk about in
terms of the Myo technology

00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:32.700
and getting it out
there before we open up

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.660
to the audience
for you guys to ask

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.150
any questions you
may have to Aaron.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.950
So any final closing
words about the

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.970
struggles you had or just advice
to developers and entrepreneurs

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.007
in the audience today?

00:15:45.007 --> 00:15:47.090
AARON GRANT: Yeah, I'll
just reiterate what I just

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.967
said about being resourceful.

00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:51.050
You can't say that enough.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.040
It's absolutely the key thing.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.310
I'll give a little
anecdote for something

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.165
we did in our early days.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:58.540
So one thing that's
traditionally

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.210
a lot more difficult with
hardware than software

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.500
is actually iterating
and making changes

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.212
and seeing those results
in a short amount of time.

00:16:07.212 --> 00:16:09.730
Because you have to
actually build the thing.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.910
And so something that we
did when we were still

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.410
funding the company on
our personal credit cards

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.229
was we scoured all the
local buy and sell websites

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:20.770
like Craigslist and
everything there,

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.240
and we found a guy
selling a 3D printer.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.420
He had it in his basement.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.960
It was a big industrial
grade 3D printer

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.280
that would cost around
$30,000, and we got it

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.240
for about an eighth of
the price from him there.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.612
And using that, we were able
to make new prototypes in a day

00:16:37.612 --> 00:16:39.570
rather than waiting two
weeks to get them back.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.210
And so it enabled us to
iterate on the design much,

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.360
much, much faster, almost as
fast as we do with software.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.770
And so, doing
things like that is

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.239
what really makes a difference.

00:16:49.239 --> 00:16:51.447
MALE SPEAKER: Craigslist
saving the day again, I see.

00:16:51.447 --> 00:16:52.721
Awesome, awesome.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.220
So with that, we're
going to open up

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.950
to you guys for questions.

00:16:58.672 --> 00:16:59.380
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.840
I was wondering what
Distribute 2.0 looks like, now

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.829
that you really hit it big
with word of mouth marketing.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.150
What's your plan to spend
your first actual dollar

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.810
or is this the plan for now?

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.599
AARON GRANT: Yeah,
so right now, we're

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:18.702
focused on fulfilling the orders
to the pre-order customers

00:17:18.702 --> 00:17:19.660
that we have right now.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.869
And we'll be starting
to do that next month.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.849
And once we've
shipped all those,

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:29.220
we'll be moving out into
retail, and with that, the wider

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.494
availability of the Myo,
we'll have more marketing

00:17:32.494 --> 00:17:33.660
and everything around there.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.830
I can't really talk
about exactly what that

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.434
will look like at
this time, but you

00:17:38.434 --> 00:17:40.076
can expect that later this year.

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:44.770
MALE SPEAKER: In the back.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.270
AUDIENCE 2 : Just
had two questions.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:50.825
So the first was when you
look for team members, what

00:17:50.825 --> 00:17:52.750
did you look for in
putting a team together?

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.208
I think that's
probably the hardest

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:55.922
part of a start-up
in any company.

00:17:55.922 --> 00:17:57.380
And then the second
is, how did you

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.420
come up with the idea
for the Myo band?

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.270
AARON GRANT: OK, so to
answer the first question.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:08.120
The founding team, myself
and the two other founders,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.730
we had been classmates
for five years.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.360
And I think that was, aside
from being resourceful,

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.880
probably the second
key thing that

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.505
has helped us get to
where we are today

00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:19.620
because we had that
initial core team.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.340
We had had experience
working together,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.839
we had pulled all
nighters together,

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:26.390
we had gone on trips
together, lived together.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.169
And more so than
anything else, we

00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:31.710
knew that we could trust each
other, no matter what happened.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.260
And that's really,
really, really important.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.780
Especially when it's
just the three of you.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.890
And especially when you have
to make a decision when,

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.660
say, two of the other founders
are traveling around the world

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.110
and something comes up, you
have to decide immediately,

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.840
we can trust that they're going
to make the correct decision.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.730
And I think we were fortunate in
that sense that the three of us

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.530
already knew each other and
we were in that position.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.530
We already had the team.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.180
That's what I would
look for if you're

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.810
building a team from scratch is,
don't just go and find someone

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.620
on the street that you just met.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.134
You definitely want people
that you know you can trust,

00:19:12.134 --> 00:19:13.800
you have some sort
of past history with.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.290
Ideally you've done projects
or worked together before

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.180
or something like that.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:19.810
Sorry.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.594
What was the second question?

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:24.010
AUDIENCE 2: How did you come
up with the idea for the Myo?

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:24.370
AARON GRANT: Right.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:24.870
Yes.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.740
So we came up with the
idea, we were thinking

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.310
about these new form
factors of computing

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.390
and where wearable
tech is going,

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:39.100
where the smartphone's going
to be five years from now.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.900
And we realized that
there's another opportunity

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.920
for the way we interact
with and control devices.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.960
And so people use their
hands to naturally

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.810
interact with things already.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.180
People are very familiar with
gesturing with their hands

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.412
and controlling things.

00:19:56.412 --> 00:19:58.620
Even if it's just picking
something up and putting it

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.142
down or opening a door.

00:20:00.142 --> 00:20:02.600
You control things and interact
with things with your hands

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.100
already.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.740
And so, we wanted to find a
way that you could do that

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.050
without having to use
a vision-based method.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.620
And so that's where
the idea came from was,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.650
how can we control things
naturally with our hands

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.176
without being in front
of a camera all the time.

00:20:23.144 --> 00:20:23.935
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:20:23.935 --> 00:20:25.240
Well, if there's
no other questions,

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.781
I just want to say
thank you to Aaron

00:20:26.781 --> 00:20:29.020
for joining us here at I/O
and I really [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.620
AARON GRANT: Oh, thank you.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.286
It's been great.

00:20:30.286 --> 00:20:31.420
I appreciate it.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.820
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.370
Great.
