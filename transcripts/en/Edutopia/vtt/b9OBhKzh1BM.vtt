00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:13.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They are dueling
with robots in Florida,

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:19.036
and study microorganisms in New York,
designing future schools in Seattle,

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:22.006
and racing electric cars in Hawaii.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.316
All across the country
students are being called upon

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:28.646
to show what they know in
challenging tests of their abilities.

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:29.826
&gt;&gt;Man: Here we go!

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:32.076
The national championship
on the line.

00:00:32.576 --> 00:00:34.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These are the fun tests.

00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:39.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Today we're going to
take SAT I, the reasoning test.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:43.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But today's students face
other kinds of exams and their score

00:00:43.896 --> 00:00:45.976
on one of them can
determine their future.

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:49.176
With pressures mounting
and stakes on the rise,

00:00:49.296 --> 00:00:52.496
some educators believe we are
asking the wrong questions

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:54.036
with standardized tests.

00:00:55.196 --> 00:00:57.706
&gt;&gt;Linda: There's an irony in
testing in American schools.

00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:02.356
We probably have kids who are the
most tested and under examined

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:03.566
of any kids in the world.

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:06.606
Take New York State for example.

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:09.656
Even before they get to
the Regents examinations,

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.156
students will have taken
20 batteries of tests

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.836
over the course of
their school careers.

00:01:15.026 --> 00:01:20.286
So there are thousands and thousands
of hours spent on taking these tests

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:23.546
and preparing for these tests
which give very little indication

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:26.636
of what kids can actually
do in real-world situations.

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:30.666
&gt;&gt;Howard: People may be good test
takers but once you leave the world

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.186
of testing you have
to think for yourself

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:35.216
because the world doesn't
come organized in four choices

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.266
with the fourth one being
"None of the above".

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.356
&gt;&gt;Hugh: As I was mulling all these
issues about the SAT I was struck

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:44.036
by the fact that there are all
sorts of other attributes like drive

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:47.506
and grit and determination,
ability to problem-solve,

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:50.276
communication skills,
leadership skills.

00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:52.906
These intangibles that
were critically important.

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:56.946
&gt;&gt;Student: So we could get 120
points just for getting our robots

00:01:57.076 --> 00:01:59.196
in the end zone without
scoring any balls...

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:03.116
&gt;&gt;Hugh: And that by virtue of
excessive reliance on SAT scores,

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:06.636
you're ruling out large numbers
of youngsters of all races

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:10.566
and all complexions who may not
have stratospheric SAT scores,

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:13.296
but who have these other
kinds of attributes

00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:17.496
that experience shows contribute to
high-level success in the real world.

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:20.226
&gt;&gt;Eeva: Is this what the
science wing would look like?

00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:23.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers like Eeva Reeder
believe that measuring performance

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:26.666
on projects is a better way
to gauge a student's potential

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.056
for real world success.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:29.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Open inviting area...

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: So instead of
memorizing geometrical abstractions,

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.116
her students spend the last six weeks

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:39.216
of their sophomore year designing
schools for the year 2050.

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:41.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Why not have the
whole side like wall open,

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:43.216
be glass facing the water.

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:47.096
&gt;&gt;Eeva: To assess a student's
deep understanding of a subject

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:51.746
and their ability to apply a
concept you cannot test those kinds

00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:56.176
of abilities through a traditional
paper and pencil kind of assessment.

00:02:56.596 --> 00:02:59.876
It has to be what we call a
performance-based assessment

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:02.046
and that's why I do these projects

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:03.816
because the project
requires these students

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.606
to create products or performances.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:07.616
&gt;&gt;Student: In the beginning
we decided to start

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:09.966
with the floor plans and the designs.

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:11.906
Our school has one main building.

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:15.606
&gt;&gt;Eeva: I have to come up with
ways to assess those products

00:03:15.606 --> 00:03:18.936
and performances so I look
at the site plan and look

00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:20.286
at the perspective drawing.

00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:21.606
I read the proposal.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:24.916
And I have a scoring guide
developed for each one of those.

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:30.066
But I think that the most powerful
assessment for this project is

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:31.486
that provided by the architects.

00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:33.626
&gt;&gt;Man: When I first saw
your drawings I thought

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:36.986
to myself this is a
real consistent idea.

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:40.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While performance-based
assessment requires a significant

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:41.646
investment of time and energy,

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:44.676
proponents insist it
is time well spent.

00:03:45.176 --> 00:03:47.696
&gt;&gt;Linda: The students have
to develop the performances.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:50.366
The teachers have to evaluate them.

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.956
But the time is not lost
to teaching and learning.

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.366
The time is teaching and learning.

00:03:56.186 --> 00:04:01.256
Because the actual conduct of the
assessment is a learning experience

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:03.906
for the students as
well as the teacher.

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:05.216
It informs teaching.

00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:08.566
It actually gives teachers feedback
immediately about what they need

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:12.196
to do to meet students' needs so
it's actually productive time.

00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:16.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Urban Academy in New
York City is part of a consortium

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:20.536
of 32 schools that has rejected
tests like the state's Regents exam

00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:23.836
and replaced it with a series
of performance assessments.

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:25.186
&gt;&gt;This thesis isn't clear.

00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:26.736
It seems as though he jumps from-

00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:30.126
&gt;&gt;Ann: We're very interested in
students developing certain skills.

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:34.296
We re interested in them
developing an ability to work

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:36.066
with multiple perspectives to be able

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:38.296
to analyze evidence,
to be able to critique.

00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:41.526
&gt;&gt;We want them to be able to
take text and talk about it,

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:44.116
be able to understand to
compare different texts

00:04:44.816 --> 00:04:47.866
and to read whole books, not
just little snippets of books.

00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.466
And we've set them up
with an external assessor.

00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:54.686
Someone who has agreed to spend an
hour with that student who has agreed

00:04:54.686 --> 00:04:58.606
to read the book, and who then sites
sown with that student and discusses

00:04:58.606 --> 00:05:00.276
that book for 45 minutes or an hour.

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:01.576
&gt;&gt;Student: She's going
to him to see whether

00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:03.976
or not he saw what she had done.

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:04.276
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:07.206
&gt;&gt;Ann: What we're really trying
to see is can that student take

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:10.216
that reading and go and talk
to somebody they don't know,

00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:13.926
a perfect stranger, about the book
and have a conversation about it.

00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:18.676
That's one way that we can tell
whether a student is ready to go on

00:05:18.676 --> 00:05:19.796
and do college-level work.

00:05:19.796 --> 00:05:22.696
&gt;&gt;Student: Is that about a 26.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:24.606
How come it's so low?

00:05:25.146 --> 00:05:27.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Critics of
performance-based assessment worry

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.956
that if students are
free to pursue projects

00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:32.466
of their choice standards
will suffer.

00:05:32.856 --> 00:05:34.736
But some assessment experts say

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:38.126
that independent study projects
should meet the highest standards.

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:40.596
&gt;&gt;Grant: What we have to
do is realize that even

00:05:40.596 --> 00:05:45.236
if we give the kid free reign to do
really cool projects it's still got

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:48.746
to fit within the context of some
objectives and some standards

00:05:48.746 --> 00:05:52.026
and some criteria that
we bring to it.

00:05:52.026 --> 00:05:52.866
&gt;&gt;Student: For those of you

00:05:53.126 --> 00:05:55.916
who aren't sure what
[inaudible] pools are, they're-

00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:58.516
&gt;&gt;Grant: So that we can say
by the end I have evidence,

00:05:58.546 --> 00:06:02.356
I can make the case that you learn
something substantial and significant

00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:04.006
that relates to school objectives.

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:07.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: As far as listening
and speaking and writing,

00:06:07.516 --> 00:06:08.946
you're making steady progress.

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:12.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One school the Key
Learning Community in Indianapolis

00:06:12.296 --> 00:06:14.776
in Indiana has a clear
and unique objective.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:19.236
Established in 1987 the school
is dedicated to the cultivation

00:06:19.236 --> 00:06:23.896
of multiple intelligences and to
developing new methods of assessment.

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:26.346
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Ours represent that
these are his strength areas

00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:29.066
and also anytime that
you see a the shape

00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:31.726
of a triangle those also
represent the strengths.

00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:35.746
&gt;&gt;Pat: We're interesting in
how students apply knowledge

00:06:36.076 --> 00:06:38.496
and so students are required
through their high school

00:06:38.936 --> 00:06:41.186
to do major projects each semester.

00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:44.786
At the end of high school they
should have eight major projects

00:06:44.786 --> 00:06:47.536
that they would have developed
and all of this is put together

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:52.726
on a multimedia portfolio to document
what it is they're capable of doing.

00:06:52.886 --> 00:06:55.536
&gt;&gt;Student: I've been working with
the Egyptians because they had

00:06:55.536 --> 00:06:58.766
so many symbols and
hieroglyphics and things like that.

00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:02.666
&gt;&gt;Pat: I think that what we're doing
here is going to be needed very soon

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:07.056
because people are going to realize
how shortsighted all of this effort

00:07:07.366 --> 00:07:08.836
on standardized tests is.

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:10.396
It's going to crash.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:11.466
It has crashed in the past.

00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:15.516
It will crash and people will
need something else to replace it

00:07:15.996 --> 00:07:17.876
and maybe we might
help in that effort.

00:07:18.576 --> 00:07:21.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For schools that are
challenging the high-stakes testing

00:07:21.356 --> 00:07:25.346
movement, the goal is to put less
emphasis on cramming, drills,

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:28.916
and test taking strategies and
focus on in-depth learning.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.636
&gt;&gt;Ann: I'm all for high standards.

00:07:30.786 --> 00:07:32.466
I don't know of anybody
who is for low standards.

00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:34.226
The question is do we get

00:07:34.226 --> 00:07:38.276
at what we're saying we want
using the tests to drive this?

00:07:38.486 --> 00:07:41.866
That's the real crux of it and
I would argue that we don't.

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:44.226
&gt;&gt;Grant: A lot of teachers
and administrators

00:07:44.466 --> 00:07:47.006
in their understandable concern

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:50.606
about these high-stakes tests are
making a mistake when they say "Teach

00:07:50.606 --> 00:07:51.716
to the test, teach to the test.

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:52.716
That's what we have to do."

00:07:53.426 --> 00:07:57.096
There's no evidence to show that you
raise test scores by teaching worse.

00:07:58.006 --> 00:08:00.586
There's no evidence to
show that when you teach

00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:03.496
for an in-depth robust performance

00:08:03.756 --> 00:08:06.046
where you have high-quality
local assessment

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:07.656
that your test scores suffer.

00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:10.246
In fact the evidence
is to the contrary.

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:14.256
High quality local assessment is
what we need to pay attention to.

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:17.356
