00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:43.340
far so it's one of those things where I
 

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.700
far so it's one of those things where I
do wonder if they focused at one point

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:45.710
do wonder if they focused at one point
 

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.090

I'm like a there's a found maybe we was
seeing the flaws there - I think it's

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880
seeing the flaws there - I think it's
 

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.650
seeing the flaws there - I think it's
implied actually um generally looking at

00:16:59.650 --> 00:16:59.660
implied actually um generally looking at
 

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.240
implied actually um generally looking at
it it seems implied to me that the air

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:01.250
it it seems implied to me that the air
 

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.870
it it seems implied to me that the air

that is a criticism sometimes levied
 

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.970
that is a criticism sometimes levied
against that sort of you know basically

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:30.980
