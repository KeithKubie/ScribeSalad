00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.780
 
people often ask me what I think the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
people often ask me what I think the
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.790
people often ask me what I think the
limitations are for transformative

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800
limitations are for transformative
 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.600
limitations are for transformative
technology and I would say that I don't

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
technology and I would say that I don't
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.960
technology and I would say that I don't
think anything replaces sitting down one

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
think anything replaces sitting down one
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.140
think anything replaces sitting down one
on one on one with someone that you love

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
on one on one with someone that you love
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.120
on one on one with someone that you love
or care about like there's nothing that

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
or care about like there's nothing that
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.839
or care about like there's nothing that
replaces that but we don't live in a in

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
replaces that but we don't live in a in
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.529
replaces that but we don't live in a in
a only one thing world I really believe

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
a only one thing world I really believe
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.520
a only one thing world I really believe
in having a suite of tools that we use

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
in having a suite of tools that we use
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.150
in having a suite of tools that we use
and so when you can't be one-on-one with

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
and so when you can't be one-on-one with
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.030
and so when you can't be one-on-one with
your loved one and you are forced to be

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
your loved one and you are forced to be
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.250
your loved one and you are forced to be
a distance then to have things that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
a distance then to have things that
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.389
a distance then to have things that
support you in that and in terms of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
support you in that and in terms of
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.209
support you in that and in terms of
other limitations i thinka limitations

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
other limitations i thinka limitations
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.470
other limitations i thinka limitations
are really our imagination because it's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
are really our imagination because it's
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.889
are really our imagination because it's
out of our imaginations that we develop

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
out of our imaginations that we develop
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.779
out of our imaginations that we develop
products you know it isn't really a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
products you know it isn't really a
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299
products you know it isn't really a
coincidence that the first flip phones

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309
coincidence that the first flip phones
 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.359
coincidence that the first flip phones
look like the communicators on Star Trek

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369
look like the communicators on Star Trek
 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.800
look like the communicators on Star Trek
like that's not a coincidence it was

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810
like that's not a coincidence it was
 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.170
like that's not a coincidence it was
sort of set and then we worked to make

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
sort of set and then we worked to make
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.740
sort of set and then we worked to make
it so and so I think with transformative

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
it so and so I think with transformative
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.630
it so and so I think with transformative
technology or any technology really it's

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640
technology or any technology really it's
 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.899
technology or any technology really it's
being of the mindset that there won't be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
being of the mindset that there won't be
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.100
being of the mindset that there won't be
one way and there shouldn't be one input

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110
one way and there shouldn't be one input
 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.760
one way and there shouldn't be one input
so we should always prioritize real live

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
so we should always prioritize real live
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.920
so we should always prioritize real live
interactions with other people we should

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
interactions with other people we should
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080
interactions with other people we should
prioritize having healthy spaces and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
prioritize having healthy spaces and
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.999
prioritize having healthy spaces and
cities where people can connect and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
cities where people can connect and
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.120
cities where people can connect and
collide we should have spaces where

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
collide we should have spaces where
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249
collide we should have spaces where
people of different backgrounds and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
people of different backgrounds and
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740
people of different backgrounds and
socio-economic levels come together so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
socio-economic levels come together so
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.859
socio-economic levels come together so
we don't have stratified experiences

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
we don't have stratified experiences
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.649
we don't have stratified experiences
because part of growing up is and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
because part of growing up is and
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.859
because part of growing up is and
becoming an adult is being exposed to a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
becoming an adult is being exposed to a
 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990
becoming an adult is being exposed to a
lot of different things so we should

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
lot of different things so we should
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.899
lot of different things so we should
have those two and then we should also

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
have those two and then we should also
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.780
have those two and then we should also
have technology that helps us work on

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
have technology that helps us work on
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.810
have technology that helps us work on
the things that we're working on there's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
the things that we're working on there's
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.839
the things that we're working on there's
one device that I particularly love I'm

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
one device that I particularly love I'm
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.650
one device that I particularly love I'm
really interested in

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660
really interested in
 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.750
really interested in
behavior change I'm really interested in

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760
behavior change I'm really interested in
 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.000
behavior change I'm really interested in
behavior change because it's it's really

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010
behavior change because it's it's really
 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.130
behavior change because it's it's really
quite hard and there's been a couple of

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
quite hard and there's been a couple of
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.450
quite hard and there's been a couple of
studies that have come out on human

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460
studies that have come out on human
 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.990
studies that have come out on human
willpower and and our willpower actually

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000
willpower and and our willpower actually
 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.960
willpower and and our willpower actually
isn't that strong and so there's two

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
isn't that strong and so there's two
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.660
isn't that strong and so there's two
products that work on behavior change

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670
products that work on behavior change
 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.760
products that work on behavior change
that I've been tracking one uses

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770
that I've been tracking one uses
 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.740
that I've been tracking one uses
affirmation and the other one uses

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750
affirmation and the other one uses
 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.700
affirmation and the other one uses
cessation as a tool so the cessation one

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710
cessation as a tool so the cessation one
 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.960
cessation as a tool so the cessation one
is called Pavlik and it shocks you when

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970
is called Pavlik and it shocks you when
 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.340
is called Pavlik and it shocks you when
you do something that you don't want to

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
you do something that you don't want to
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.250
you do something that you don't want to
do so it's a slight electrical shock but

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260
do so it's a slight electrical shock but
 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.630
do so it's a slight electrical shock but
it shocks you nonetheless in you can

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640
it shocks you nonetheless in you can
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.300
it shocks you nonetheless in you can
sort of amp it up if you want to right

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310
sort of amp it up if you want to right
 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.750
sort of amp it up if you want to right
now you there are some things that it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760
now you there are some things that it
 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.550
now you there are some things that it
can tell that you're doing so you can

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560
can tell that you're doing so you can
 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.070
can tell that you're doing so you can
put in a list of websites so if you have

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080
put in a list of websites so if you have
 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.840
put in a list of websites so if you have
a facebook addiction and you want to get

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850
a facebook addiction and you want to get
 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.690
a facebook addiction and you want to get
off fat every time you go to Facebook

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700
off fat every time you go to Facebook
 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.510
off fat every time you go to Facebook

that matter you can put all of those in
the app and every time you go to a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940
the app and every time you go to a
 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.880
the app and every time you go to a
website with those words in it then you

website with those words in it then you
 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.040
website with those words in it then you
get shocked and they're actually really

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050
get shocked and they're actually really
 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.590
get shocked and they're actually really
helpful because if that's a problem for

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600
helpful because if that's a problem for
 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.860
helpful because if that's a problem for
you it's a real problem and so people

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870
you it's a real problem and so people
 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.020
you it's a real problem and so people
need to have things that help them

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030
need to have things that help them
 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.390
need to have things that help them
change the behaviors that they want to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400
change the behaviors that they want to
 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.420
change the behaviors that they want to
the flip side of that is another device

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430
the flip side of that is another device

sounds like a really silly thing you're
 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.380
sounds like a really silly thing you're
like why would you do that but it turns

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390
like why would you do that but it turns
 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.820
like why would you do that but it turns
out that our are you know our inner mind

loves that yeah we just love it and so
 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.090
loves that yeah we just love it and so
every time you do something that you

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100
every time you do something that you
