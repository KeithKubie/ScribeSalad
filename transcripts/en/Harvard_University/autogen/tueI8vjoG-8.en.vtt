television at the white domed capital a
white man in a white room lifts his

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700
white man in a white room lifts his
 

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.260
white man in a white room lifts his
glass of white wine I'm always searching

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.270
glass of white wine I'm always searching
 

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.400
glass of white wine I'm always searching
the faces of strangers for a friend

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:48.410
the faces of strangers for a friend
 

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:55.910
the faces of strangers for a friend
thank you very much

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:55.920
 

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.980
you
