00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.250
 The debt limit is a financial weapon of mass destruction attached to 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.450
 Government of the United States by the United States Government. 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.660
 Confusing? Then it is time to explain the debt limit of the United States. 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.679
 To find out the debt limit, you need to know that the US shares the financial one 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.359
 responsibility between the president and the congress. 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.810
 As for money, the president has two tasks: 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.989
 1. To collect taxes and ... 2. Spend them to lead the government. 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.559
 This may give you the idea that the president is omnipotent in terms of money. 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.119
 Especially when you hear in the news "the new budget of the president" or his plan to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.460
 "raise the tailor's taxes" or "reduce the beekeeper's taxes". 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 But reality is the opposite and the president is the one who gets the orders. 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.600
 By whom? 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.309
 Congress. 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.660
 The congress's job is to set the tax and state what part of the government it is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.489
 will spend, by making the budget. 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.859
 And while the president sends a budget to the congress and wants changes 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.079
 in the tax level, these are just requests the Congress can ignore. 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 Congress can add or withdraw whatever it wants from the presidential budget, 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.339
 or throw it away and write a new one. The same applies to the tax level. 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.170
 So the congress decides what it wants: bridges, tanks, buildings, courts, robots on Mars, 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.979
 Earth robots, National parks, etc., and approves a budget with these things in it. 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.020
 Once approved, the president is legally obliged to spend the ones specified by Congress 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.090
 budget money and cover it through taxes specified by the Congress. 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.100
 While tax revenues are more than costs, everything is fine. 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.700
 But, almost always, the Congress stakes more in the budget than it collects with taxes, 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.509
 which means the president has to borrow money to cover the difference. 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.469
 In most countries, things are over, because if legislators approve more spending 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.600
 they have indirectly approved the necessary loans - but not in the United States. 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.460
 Here, Congress * also * limits the total debt the United States can have. 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.100
 The debt limit sounds like a good idea until you look at the real consequences 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.450
 of the interaction between the two branches of the government. 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.460
 When total loans get close to the limit, Congress usually points to the president 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.119
 and he feels shock, * shock * that his reckless spending has come close to us 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.869
 to limit the debt that they, the prudent and forward-looking people of Congress have bet on. 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.280
 And while it is technically correct that the president has taken the loans, 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.660
 the congress forced him through the approval of a budget he is obliged by law 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.450
 to spend without and have approved the necessary taxes to cover the costs. covering 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.280
 So the fight for the debt limit is a government version of a favorite game: 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.220
 "stop hitting", but with the addition that they all look horrified. 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.830
 Because, it is important to note that the debt limit does not apply to future costs - 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.870
 there is no credit card on which to raise the limit in order to pick up a risky government coupon. 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.750
 The debt limit covers the costs already incurred. 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.850
 For example, the government hired a company to asphalt a federal highway. But if the United States 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.660
 reaching the limit when the company asks for the money after finishing the job, 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.290
 the government can not. This has shaken confidence in the United States, and in large parts 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.470
 of the global economy rely on the dollar to be trustworthy, trust is very significant. 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.350
 But there is always an outlet: Congress raises the debt limit and, given the horror, 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.000
 that we have always talked about. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.290
 So if the non-lifting the debt ceiling can be devastating, the solution is simple 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.700
 and always taken into account: why does the discussion last for months? 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700
 Because: politics. 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.730
 The debt limit is not in the constitution, the congress has only created it by them 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.620
 the limit of debt is great because: 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.560
 1. Creates a problem for which 2. Congress may (technically) blame 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.890
 the president who 3. Needs the decision they only give. 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.850
 Congress uses the threat of mutual financial self-destruction as a trump card 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.900
 in negotiations that they have the benefit of losing to the last ... possible ... second.
