00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.790
Many people buy organic food hoping to feel
healthier, and potentially have a positive

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.019
impact on the environment. But are organic
foods even better for you and the environment

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.320
in the first place?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.480
For plants, the term organic basically means
something grown without the use of synthetic

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.029
fertilizers or pesticides, but this is a little
bit misleading. You see, many consumers buy

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.009
organic to avoid pesticides all together,
but the truth is, organic farmers can still

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.730
use pesticides and fungicides to prevent insects
from destroying their crops, they just can’t

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.719
be synthetically made. There are over 20 chemicals
approved for organic use in the US derived

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.149
from natural sources like plants, but studies
have shown that some natural pesticides are

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.050
actually a more serious health and environmental
risk than man-made ones. Not to say they are

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.230
all bad, but simply that, ‘natural’ doesn’t
always mean better for you or the environment.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.089
On top of this, not all organic foods are
completely organic. If a label simply says

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.300
‘organic’ it only has to contain 95% organic
ingredients. The label “made with organic

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.710
ingredients” on items like bread may only
contain 70%, while “containing organic ingredients”

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.360
may only have 50%. Only when a label says
“100% Organic” does it contain purely

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.890
organic ingredients. For what it’s worth,
the term “free range” also only requires

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.650
evidence of access to the outdoors for a minimum
of 5 minutes per day. Huh!

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.830
Interestingly, a meta-analysis conducted in
2012 found that organic crop yields are 25%

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.310
lower on average than conventional ones, though
differences vary greatly between types of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.810
crops. For example, organic vegetable yields
are typically 33% lower than conventional

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.670
ones, putting a greater strain on the natural
environment as more farmland is required.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.180
However, organic legume yields are only 5%
lower, as they are more efficient at absorbing

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.410
nitrogen from organic fertilizers. Of course,
many organic farming practices like crop rotations

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.490
and mixed planting as opposed to using mono-cultures
are better for the soil and the environment.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.980
But are they better for you? After analyzing
237 studies, researchers concluded that organic

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.030
fruit and veggies are no more nutritious than
conventionally grown food. However, long-term

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.170
studies of purely-organic diets are difficult,
as most people eat a mixture of foods with

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.700
non-organic ingredients.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.970
Those on short-term organic diets do show
higher levels of carotenoids, polyphenols,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.090
Vitamin C and E, LDL cholesterol, antioxidant
activity, immune system markers, and ever

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.230
higher semen quality. But, the differences
are clinically insignificant. Children placed

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.319
on organic diets for ten days have lower levels
of organophosphates in their urine, which

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.230
in higher concentrations are associated with
neurological problems, but both levels are

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.560
orders of magnitude lower than the amount
needed to cause clinical harm. And just because

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.950
something is organic, doesn’t make it better.
An bag of organic chips, for example, is still

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.210
just deep fried carbohydrates with very little
nutritional value.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.790
Most surprising is that organic food has a
higher incidence of being dangerous. Though

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.020
organic foods accounts for only 1% of agricultural
acreage or space, they account for 7% of recalled

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.740
food units in 2015. For example, this year
several flavours of Clif Bars were recalled

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.670
from stores due to organic sunflower kernels
that were potentially contaminated with listeria

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.990
- a bacterium which kills hundreds in the
US each year. Another study found E.coli in

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.880
10% of organic produce, compared to 2% in
conventional ones.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.130
The truth is, eating organic foods can be
good for you, and in some ways be better for

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.650
the environment, but it’s not the be all
and end all. Production methods vary greatly

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.130
for both organic and conventional foods, from
one farm to another - or from local farms

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.660
to factory farms - and it’s likely a combination
of methods that will lead to the greatest

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.870
results for your health and the environment.
Organic and conventional foods can co-exist

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.150
and don’t have to be at odds with one another
- anyone who tells you with 100% certainty

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.730
one way is fully better than the other is
ignoring the science.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.560
When it comes to your own health, it’s really
a combination of diet, exercise, various other

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:24.690
lifestyle choices, and of course, your genetics!
