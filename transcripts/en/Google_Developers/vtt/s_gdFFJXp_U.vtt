00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.379
&gt;&gt; All right, Sasha. Can you give us a little
introduction to your company and your products?

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.881
&gt;&gt; AICKIN: Sure. My name is Sasha Aickin.
I'm the engineering manager of the search

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:18.130
team at Redfin. And Redfin is an online web
Real Estate Agent. So the idea is you--we

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.520
pull together information from lots of different
MLSs (ph), and we show that information on

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.110
map. We do make searching really easy. And
we let people find the houses they want to

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.750
find. We help them get into those houses and
tour those houses. And then when they want

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.980
to put an offer on them, they can come to
us, and we have agents who will help them

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.890
make the offer, go to through (inaudible),
do all the things you need to do to buy a

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.620
house. But we only charge half of what Traditional
Real Estate Agents charge. Because of the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.649
efficiencies we have on the web and, you know,
because people are doing a lot of their own

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.179
search, that's people really want to do these
days, our agents are able to be incredibly

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.680
much more efficient than Traditional Real
Estate Agents. A Traditional Real Estate Agent

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.799
only does, you know, six or so deals a year.
Our agents can do that many in a month. And

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:09.920
so, we use Google Maps and other APIs to make
search as hopefully as easy as possible for

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.200
our customers.
&gt;&gt; All right. So tell us a little bit about

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.399
your decision to use the Google Map for your
product.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.770
&gt;&gt; AICKIN: Sure. Our decision to use Google
was interesting. We actually--when I started

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.120
we were work--we were using a proprietary
Flash client. Redfin actually started doing

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.789
listings on a map before there were easily
available maps APIs. And we had what I'd like

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.710
to call the parallel of the first mover, you
know, that first mover disadvantage really

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.520
because, basically it was actually before
I got there or sort of just happened. They

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.759
actually, it was a Seattle-only business and
actually source to satellite imagery, created

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.909
the image pyramid tiles, created a proprietary
Flash client, built the whole thing, and we're

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.200
showing listings on the map. And people in
Seattle thought this is really cool. It was

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.409
popular in Seattle. But then Google Maps,
API came out, and it was suddenly--it was

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.460
really easy to put listings on a map, and
we are sort of at a disadvantage. After I

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.180
started, we actually switch to Virtual Earth
API, and we run that for two years. But we

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.470
switch to Google in November or so, November-December,
and the number one reason was speed. We, you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.190
know, we put a lot of things on the map. We
put up to 500 listings on the map at a time.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.220
And we're very heavyweight Ajax site, and
we know that speed is incredibly important.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.250
So we had all along done test Virtual Earth
versus Google. And eventually we found a way

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.040
to add pushpins or markers--pushpin is a deadly
(ph) term, to add markers really fast to the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.060
map at Google. We talked about it today at
IO at the Performance Session. And when we

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.560
found that we could it much faster in Google,
we called up the team and started talking

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.370
about doing it.
&gt;&gt; Great. Was there any technical challenges

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.760
that you had using the platform?
&gt;&gt; AICKIN: I mean, you know, no more than

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.310
you would know--so I wouldn't say there were
tremendous technical problems. The biggest,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.040
I think, insight we had to get was how to
add a ton of things to the map (inaudible).

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.590
That's our single biggest--our single biggest
technical challenge. But I actually--once

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.120
we figure that out in sort of researching
kind of way, I actually spent a long weekend

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.110
where I supported our site from Virtual Earth
to Google maps. And we had to spend another,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.920
you know, two weeks or so polishing and getting
all right, but it basically worked after the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.370
end of the weeked of just being working on
it. It was sort of--it's one of those, you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.320
know, math (ph) fueled, you know, coding weekends
of craziness, but it actually, you know, I

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.340
was surprised at how well--how quickly things
went.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.740
&gt;&gt; All right. All right. So you mentioned
performance, talk to me about the performance

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.030
of the platform.
&gt;&gt; AICKIN: Sure. I mean, I think it's you

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.920
know, Google puts a lot of, you know, of emphasis
on performance, so that's something we really

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.250
value. The images are on CDN. The script is
much smaller than some competitors. It's--and

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.420
I'm very heartened (ph) as well that V3 (ph)
which was announced yesterday most of the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.470
thing--most of the reason behind it, most
of impetus is performance. So modular, I think,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.750
in script. You know, putting up a static image
before you can pull down the tile. These are

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.670
all great things. And, you know, it matters
to me that they're thinking about performance

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.450
constantly. So, you know, overall, it's been
really great.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.340
&gt;&gt; Great.
&gt;&gt; AICKIN: As I say, we didn't have trouble

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.760
adding tons of things to the map, but we were
able to just sort of to do a custom overlay

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.810
and make that work much faster than we thought--we'd
be able to.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.520
&gt;&gt; Okay. So how did the maps improve your
user experience?

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.750
&gt;&gt; AICKIN: How did the maps improve our user
experience? It's an interesting question,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.490
because in some ways, we're known for the
map being our user experience. I mean, I said

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.430
this before, you know, the old, you know,
the old thing in real estate is--the three

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.970
most important things are location, location,
location. You've all heard this, right? But

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:16.620
we kind of took that as what our UI should
be too. You know, we--our UI is very app like.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.970
It's not a long page. It's--you know, it scales
to the browser size, no scroll bars. And,

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.210
you know, it has this big map right in the
center, and that's really how you define your

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.250
search. You can type in the neighborhood saying,
you know, "The mission," for example, and

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.370
it will draw a polygon--it will go there and
draw a polygon on the map, but you can refine

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.800
that, you can zoom in, zoom out. And every
time you move the map or pin, we do another

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.240
search. We go back to the database and pull
new records. I mean, it's almost the weird

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.810
question to say, "How does it help with the
user interface?" because it really just is

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.750
the user interface. Now, I mean, there are--there's
a thing on the side that shows you the details

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.520
of the house, and there's a list below. And
we find it's really important to display them

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.060
spatially, but also have a list so that people
can sort of scan in another way. But by in

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.120
large, we're known as the company that has--that
uses the map as their main user interface.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.039
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, what do you see in the future
of mapping?

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.890
&gt;&gt; AICKIN: What I see in the future of mapping?
I think there are a lot of interesting things

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.680
coming in the future. I think, you know, once
again, performances, hopefully going to get

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.990
better. It's been interesting to hear all
these people talk about HTML5, which I think

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.420
is great. I'm still wondering what we're going
to do about IE6 and--I mean, I don't know.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.350
I haven't heard--I haven't heard anybody give
me a good story on that one yet. But--so I

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:41.870
think performance, being able to show more
things. I think intelligent, smart, performant

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.460
and, you know, good feeling algorithms for
clustering are going to be something that

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.650
hopefully is happening, you know, soon. I
think a lot of people are working on that

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.169
in different--from different angles. It's
actually--I've just working on it this week,

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:02.270
so it shockingly hard. It's shockingly hard
to get a UI that really feels good in clustering

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.850
that you know it stays consistent and maps
to the way the user thinks about how it should

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.080
work. I was just talking to somebody else
from another company, and he saying that they

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.830
actually implemented the clustering UI two
years ago, and I had to see they rid of it

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.510
because users so didn't like the way it worked.
It's actually, it's one of those problems

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.199
that the more you think about it, I think,
the harder it gets. So I think good clustering

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:28.699
and figuring out how to, you know, how to
display a large amount of information is going

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.110
to be a really, a really interesting thing.
And obviously, you know, rich media kinds

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.580
of things, you know, how much it's going to
become more earthlike, and more flashy, and

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.558
more sort of HTML5, I think, it's probably
one of the other good things for mapping.

00:07:40.558 --> 00:07:45.440
&gt;&gt; All right Sasha, well, I want to thank
you for your time today (inaudible).

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.800
&gt;&gt; AICKIN: Great. Thanks. And have a good
time.
