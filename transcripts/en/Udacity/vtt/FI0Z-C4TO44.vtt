00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.590
All right, let's talk about the different task queues and

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.070
start off with the push queue which is the most

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.290
common one. The execution of push queues are managed by

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.330
App Engine itself. This means that App Engine has worker threads

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.860
that scan these queues and pick up tasks. These threads

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.400
then call a URL that you have specified when you

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.160
insert the task in the queue. This means that the

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.980
execution is broken out from the HTTP request response flow since

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.610
App Engine provide the threads to execute the tasks.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.900
But the code used to process each task is still

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.700
provided by you, since you provide the URL that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.680
the worker threads call. The best of two worlds, a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.130
generic execution methodology,. That works with code that you

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.710
write. So the worker thread picks up task by task

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.650
and calls your url for each of them. And this

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.050
behavior continues for all the tasks in the queue until

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.240
the queue is empty. By default, the maximum execution duration

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.770
for a task is ten minutes. It is of course up

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.300
to you when you develop the application to split up

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.460
the work into tasks that can be completed within this time,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.310
for example 100 mails each. There are many different configuration

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.030
options for queues in the following screen, we will look at

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.610
some of them. First to note is that the queues of

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.190
the find in the queue configuration file when you do development.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.460
All queues have a queue name. For all applications,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.260
half engine order provides a default queue with the name

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.720
default. This queue can be used without adding anything to

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.640
the queue configuration file but you may want to change

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.820
its default options, in which case you need to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.820
define it in the file. Other things you can configure

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.090
are the performance parameters such as, the rate of processing,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.460
the maximum rate in case of traffic peaks. The bucket

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.620
size and the maximum number of concurrent tasks that can

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.780
be executed. There are also a lot of parameters surrounding

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.870
error management. So now we've talked about how to define

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.470
a queue. Let's finish this part by looking at how to

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.710
create a task and assign it to a queue for

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.000
execution. The first thing you do is get the queue by

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.560
the queue name then you create the task and set

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.550
options such as the task name, the url to process the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.930
task, another parameter such as performance and retry

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.280
options and finally you add the task to the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.450
queue for execution. Finally, it is important that you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.990
to protect the URL so only administrators can access

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.350
them through the permission settings. You don't want external

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.490
users to be able to execute your task logic

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.880
should they get ahold of these URL's. That was

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.470
a lot of theory, but that's it for now.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.820
Now the time is come for you to do some work because we

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.740
have an exercise coming up where you will use push queues. Good luck.
