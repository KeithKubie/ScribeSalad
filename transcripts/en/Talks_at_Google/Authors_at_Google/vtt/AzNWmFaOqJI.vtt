00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.660
PETER: Welcome to
Authors at Google

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.400
and welcome to Alex Bellos.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.660
I don't know if any of
you saw his earlier talk

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.990
a couple of years ago around
his first book, "Adventures

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.790
in Numberland,"
which was a huge hit.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.200
And on a personal business,
it was a huge hit for me

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.620
because my 10-year-old
son at the time

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.490
I couldn't get him to
read any books at all.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.240
And in desperation,
we were on holiday,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.365
and I kind of handed him
"Adventures in Numberland"

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.940
and said have a look at this.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.880
And he quickly became
extremely hooked on

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.370
and spent the entire holiday
going yam, tan, tethera which

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.470
I'm sure you'll know is the
ancient English way of counting

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.210
sheep.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.557
And when you get to
15, it's bumfit I

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:48.640
think I'm right in saying.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.120
And he spent the entire
holiday talking about bumfit.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.290
So it sort of both hooked
him in an interest in maths

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.040
and gave him a license
to use bad language

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.600
so it was kind of perfect.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.490
So the new book is "Alex
Through the Looking-glass."

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.560
Alex is going to
talk for half an hour

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.089
or so and then take
some questions?

00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:08.380
ALEX BELLOS: A little bit
more than that but, because I

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.860
want to be very informal,
so if there's anything

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.890
you don't understand or you
want more, just shout out,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.740
put your hand up.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.800
So let's kind of have
the kind of Q and A

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.470
as we go I think because
we're a little bit delayed.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.908
I'm going to have to--

00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:21.616
PETER: And I'll hand
if over [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:21.616 --> 00:01:22.060
Keep going.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.559
Cheers.

00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:27.780
ALEX BELLOS: Usually,
I'm used to giving talks

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.240
to book festivals where the
kind of mathematical numeracy

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.700
is going to be a lot lower
than you guys are here

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.560
so I might whip through
it but you might

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.720
have slightly more
high-brow questions.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.990
So thank you very much, Peter.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.220
I'm Alex Bellos.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.011
This is me.

00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:46.510
Oh, my god.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.551
I just pressed something.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.970
That's me with a weird
stain on my red jumper.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.570
I don't know why
I was given that.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.300
And this is my new book, "Alex
Through the Looking-glass,"

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.330
which sounds very much like it's
a sequel to "Alex's Adventures

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.530
in Numberland" but
it isn't really.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.779
Both can be read separately.

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.070
You don't need to have read
the first one to read this.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.340
If there is a
difference, the first one

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.750
was just an exploration about
mathematical abstraction

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.240
and what we get when we use it.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.820
This is a little bit
more kind of applied.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.112
It's about using
abstraction to learn

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:26.570
about the world, mathematics
being the language that we use

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.780
to talk about the
world, and also

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.920
how life reflects numbers
and numbers reflect life.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.180
I also wanted to get into
kind of psychology of numbers

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.035
and interesting
psychological responses

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:40.680
that we have to numbers which
are quite surprising I think

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.810
and definitely under-researched.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.931
Now, how do you write a
book on maths and numbers

00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:48.930
and make it interesting.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.590
It's quite difficult because
the nature of the subject is dry

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.490
and sometimes it's
conceptually challenging.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.220
So I've got a degree
in maths and philosophy

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.850
and then I became a journalist.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.130
So my approach is
always to tell stories.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.790
And I think that
by telling stories,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.010
if you can interest
someone in the story,

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.214
then you don't need
to say, oh, by the way

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:14.630
I'm going to teach
you some maths.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.630
You just learn the
maths on the way.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.080
And where do you
look for stories?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.580
Well, the kind of classic
place to look for a story

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.050
is in oneself.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.760
And so, actually, my story as
a popularizer of mathematics

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.570
is really where
this book begins.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.400
And I have to say I don't
think it happened at my talk

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.870
at Google last time, but pretty
much every talk that I did

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.340
when the first book came out,
I would give what I thought

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.459
was a fantastically fascinating
talk about maths and numbers.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.500
And someone would put
their hand at the end of it

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.060
and they would say, yes, sir.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.856
And they would just say, so
what's your favorite number?

00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:54.230
And I can just
remember thinking,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.207
oh, have you learned nothing?

00:03:56.207 --> 00:03:57.290
Who has a favorite number?

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.850
I'm grown-up.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.060
You're a grown-up.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.226
And I would just think they
were kind of teasing me.

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:03.580
It was way of belittling
the subject on myself.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.490
Until I kept on being
asked this question.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.140
I would give talks
at universities,

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.530
secondary schools,
books festivals.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.331
People were always asking it.

00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:14.955
So once I just said,
oh, I didn't know.

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:16.269
What's your favorite number?

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.000
But rather than saying,
ah, they went, oh, 12,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.510
gave me a considered response.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.924
And I just was like, what?

00:04:24.924 --> 00:04:26.840
And then the person next
to them said, oh, no,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.045
my favorite number is 13.

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:31.500
I said, well, who here's
got favorite numbers?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.390
And at least half the
audience of grown-ups

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.830
put their hands up.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.500
And this happened
a few more times.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.280
So I thought, well,
this is interesting.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.350
From being something that I
thought was completely idiotic,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.920
I thought, well, if
grown-up people who

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.470
are literate and numerate
have serious [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.820
emotional reactions
numbers, this is interesting

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.580
and why don't I try
and research it?

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.650
And so what I did is I thought
I would undergo a survey

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.870
to try and find the
world's favorite number.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.620
But essentially it was
to try and quantify

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.170
emotional responses to numbers.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.970
So I set up this website
here, favouritenumber.net.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.440
I realized it was going to
have to be international,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.870
so I also bought this
one, favoritenumber.net,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.830
just so no one was excluded.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.385
And within a few
weeks-- at that time,

00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:25.760
four years ago, I maybe had
only a few thousand followers

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.569
on Twitter.

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:27.610
I just put it on Twitter.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.110
What's your favorite number?

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.320
Join my survey.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.640
Within a few weeks,
more than 30,000 people

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.794
from around the
world had replied.

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:38.710
And so this was already
vindicating this idea.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.650
This is something
that serious people

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.090
feel passionately about it.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.120
Now, what were the results?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.160
The results were this.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.690
7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 13, 9, 6, 2, 11.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.660
Which "Metro" said was
the most confusing top 10

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.962
list ever written.

00:05:57.962 --> 00:05:58.950
Which it is.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.700
Now, if you go back
to favoritenumber.net,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.033
I have all the results up there.

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:03.550
There's a big Excel file of all.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.687
There's more than 1,000
individual numbers

00:06:05.687 --> 00:06:06.770
and all their frequencies.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.030
And you can get
them there if you

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.730
are interested to do
an analysis on them,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.267
if you have a statistical mind.

00:06:13.267 --> 00:06:14.850
But what was interesting
was that when

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:22.030
I launched the results, it
was an actual news story.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.550
Again, showing that people
are interested in this stuff.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.760
It was a news story
in the "Times."

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.840
It was a news story in the
"Daily Mail" of all places.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.820
But it also started
going around the world.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.860
This is "Glamour"
magazine in Paris.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.760
And I don't think I
found one country that

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.250
didn't report it in some way.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.750
Just going to mention
a few of them.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.110
Hungary.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.870
Hungary has a huge brilliant
mathematical tradition.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.560
And per capita, I think
that more Hungarians entered

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.740
the survey than
any other nation,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.940
so they were really
fascinated by it.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.100
Obviously, it was
[INAUDIBLE] Greek,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.520
Greece being the beginnings
of Western thought.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.150
By the time, it got
to India, I was now

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.233
a Brazilian mathematician.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.150
But India-- there
are certain countries

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.440
where mathematics and the
idea of doing arithmetic

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.620
is really an important
part of national identity.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.940
And so it was all over the
regional press in India.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.440
Vietnam, and obviously
I can't read Vietnamese.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.000
And it just became
quite interesting

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.690
what happens in the different
photo archives countries

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.080
when you put in seven.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.200
This is what you get
when you're in Vietnam.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.610
And when you're in China,
this is what you get.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.330
So it was a new story.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.250
But what is the
moment that you really

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.820
know that it has touched
the public consciousness,

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.070
it's become a real news story?

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:52.420
It's when you're a
question-- volume, please?

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.840
Three days afterwards, it was
on "Have I Got News for You."

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.630
-Alex Bellos asked 44,000
people to submit their favorite

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.290
number--

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.664
ALEX BELLOS: So yeah there
were 44,000 people in the end.

00:08:04.664 --> 00:08:10.630
But I only did the cleaning
of the data for 33,000.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.225
The Nigel [INAUDIBLE] numbers.

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:16.063
---top ten world's
favorite numbers.

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:16.562
-Yes.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:17.792
-Yeah.

00:08:17.792 --> 00:08:19.250
ALEX BELLOS: The
reason why this is

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:28.890
funny is because we actually
do have feeling-- things are

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.610
only fun if there's an element
of something serious about it.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.125
-Number ten, the tenth most
popular is, in fact, 11.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.409
ALEX BELLOS: [INAUDIBLE]
mathematical joke.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.929
-14.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:43.801
-No.

00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:44.300
-21?

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.244
-No.

00:08:45.244 --> 00:08:48.548
At number nine is
the number two.

00:08:48.548 --> 00:08:53.076
The most popular number
in eighth position is six.

00:08:53.076 --> 00:08:55.201
And seven, the seventh most
popular number is nine.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.490
And the sixth most
popular number is 13.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.990
OK.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.185
Here's the top five.

00:09:04.497 --> 00:09:08.454
-This is going to be on Channel
Four for a whole evening.

00:09:08.454 --> 00:09:10.710
There'll be some talking
heads in a minute.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.620
What did you of six?

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.500
Eh, not it.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.125
ALEX BELLOS: This is
actually my idea--

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:17.115
-I've always liked five because
it's a working class number.

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:19.600
That's what I like about five.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.130
But I think that
three [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.638
and I thought three was a
magnificent num-- oh, I'm

00:09:24.638 --> 00:09:26.106
sorry.

00:09:26.106 --> 00:09:27.970
I'll stop auditioning.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.020
Sorry.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.739
Where am I?

00:09:30.739 --> 00:09:32.280
-Let's firstly
complete the top five.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.350
The number five is five.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.766
And number four is four.

00:09:37.766 --> 00:09:40.025
And number three is eight.

00:09:40.025 --> 00:09:45.350
And number two is
three, the magic number.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.527
And, of course, seven is
the top one, number one.

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:48.360
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:48.600
ALEX BELLOS: OK.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.516
It's interesting that
everyone laughed at five

00:09:50.516 --> 00:09:53.849
being five and four being
four because, essentially, we

00:09:53.849 --> 00:09:54.640
like small numbers.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.260
And the bigger the numbers
get, we like them least.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.890
This is what the survey says.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.400
So a number should, if there
are no other considerations

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.010
punch more or less exactly
their numerical value.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.610
So those are almost the ones
that are the least funny

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.626
or the least interesting.

00:10:08.626 --> 00:10:10.000
And what happens
and what you see

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.310
is the odd numbers and
especially prime numbers

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:17.900
are way up the rankings
and round numbers really,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.351
really way back
down the rankings.

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:20.850
We do not really
like round numbers,

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.620
but we really like
prime numbers.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.070
And that is
something which, even

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.916
though the quantitative research
you can dismiss and say,

00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:29.920
oh, this is silly because
it's 44,000 people

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.170
but it was 44,000 people who
already feel passionately

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.660
about it who selected
themselves to join the survey.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.910
Even amongst them, there
are very coherent patterns

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.570
of these emotional responses.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.540
So on the survey, I said,
what's your favorite number?

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.310
But I also said, why?

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:49.185
I just left it blank.

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:50.143
There's a little space.

00:10:50.143 --> 00:10:51.520
You could write it in there.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.130
And to me, it was the
qualitative results

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.330
of the survey that were
actually a bit more interesting

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.790
and a bit more
surprising and that

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.590
felt a bit like
proper new research.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.920
So I'm going to just take you
through some of the entries

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.550
with some of the reasons.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.720
And we start to
understand what it

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.300
is about numbers that make
people excited by them.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.624
So this number was
selected, 10 over root two.

00:11:17.624 --> 00:11:19.040
Now, in this
audience, does anyone

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.740
know what 10 over root
two is in decimals?

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.930
It's 10 times 1 over root two.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.994
Which if you work out is
actually square root of 50.

00:11:28.994 --> 00:11:32.590
7.07 which in America is
called the Boeing number

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.200
because of 707.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.635
And I had originally thought
that Boeing was called 707

00:11:37.635 --> 00:11:39.890
just because this looks a
little bit like a plane, two

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.290
wings and a fuselage.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.090
Apparently that's
not the reason why.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.460
But you will find that certain
numbers work in brands really

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.860
well based on just how they
look and how they sound.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.460
Because even though
numbers are supposedly

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.230
these abstract entities
just representing

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.770
quantity and order.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.100
How do we get to them?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.390
They exist within
culture, within language.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.270
They have to look like
something as a symbol.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.240
And all these things
actually influence

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.230
how we understand even
the numerical properties

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.990
of numbers.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.790
I'm going to read you the
reason why the person chose 707.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.780
It wasn't because they were
an aviation enthusiast.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.880
People wrote down their
nationalities, their genders,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.270
their level of mathematical
ability, and their age.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.140
And this was from a
woman in Canada, aged 34,

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.380
with university-level maths.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.539
She said, this number
is 10 root two.

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:40.080
I'd been doing a
lot of trig homework

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.780
for a calculus class I
was taking in undergrad

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.910
and this number appears a lot.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.280
At the time, I was sort
of weirded out by the fact

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.340
that I kept waking up at 7:07
in the morning instead of 7:30

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.710
when my alarm was set for.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.460
Anyway, one Saturday, I went
to my local art supply store

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.780
and bought some paintbrushes.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.080
To my surprise, the
total came to $7.07.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.510
And I sort of blurted out,
oh, that's 10 over root two

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.370
all over again.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.000
So the very cute
cashier, for whom

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.590
I had a rather pathetic crush
and who I was constantly

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.030
embarrassing in front of,
after explaining myself,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.650
he was duly impressed and
began embarrassing himself

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.490
in front of me whenever
I came to the store.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.560
And from that point
on, I realized

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.620
there's a brand of arty guys
that like nerdy girls and this

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.400
still makes me happy
some 15 years later.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:26.900
OK.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.560
This is written in a tiny
little white space on a website.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.450
Just the story, the passion.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.420
There's so much stuff
that you could analyze.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.730
Also the fact that when you
start to think emotionally

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.438
about a number you
just see it absolutely

00:13:39.438 --> 00:13:44.250
everywhere even though numbers
don't really predominant one

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.690
over the other in
such a strong way.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.370
1,000,000,007.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.690
Why was this chosen?

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.710
This was chosen by
21-year-old male Russian

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:03.540
because it's the largest
prime number I can remember.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.617
So the fact that people take to
remembering large prime number.

00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:08.950
A prime number I'm sure you now.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.620
A prime number is a number that
only divides by itself and one.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.615
So they start with two.

00:14:14.615 --> 00:14:16.800
Two is the only even
prime number, then

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.000
it goes 3, 5, 7, 11,
13, 17, 19, et cetera.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.430
Now, 1,000,000,007
is interesting

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.772
because 1,000,000,009
is also a prime number.

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:33.980
In fact, you get this things
called twin primes which

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.540
are prime numbers
that are two apart.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:41.760
And it's conjectured that there
are an infinite number of them.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.439
But the largest one
that's know of the form

00:14:44.439 --> 00:14:46.730
one, loads of zeroes, then
seven, one, loads of zeroes,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.660
then nine is 1,000,000,007
and 1,000,000,009.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.243
So you can kind of
think you're really

00:14:50.243 --> 00:14:53.350
clever to remember
[INAUDIBLE] prime number.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.950
It would be clever if it
was the second highest

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.470
prime number I can remember.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.350
219.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.940
Now, this was chosen by
an 18-year-old Irishman

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:11.540
because it's the lowest
whole number that does not

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.010
have its own Wikipedia entry.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.720
So it's too boring.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.930
It's the lowest boring
number, basically.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.942
Every number from one to 218
has it's own Wikipedia entry.

00:15:21.942 --> 00:15:23.900
And, actually, this was
a couple years ago now.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.180
So I've looked.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.360
There's an inflation in
lowest boring numbers.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.860
And now the lowest
boring number is 224.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.147
OK.

00:15:34.147 --> 00:15:35.730
But you might not
think that Wikipedia

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.021
is a very good judge of what
makes a number interesting

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:38.540
or not.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.085
And so I thought I would look
in the online encyclopedia

00:15:41.085 --> 00:15:43.885
of integer sequences, which is
a kind of Bible of mathematics

00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:45.550
and really of all science.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:49.990
It contains about 250,000
separate sequences.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.860
And a sequence is just
a list of numbers.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.734
They can be infinite.

00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:53.600
They can be finite.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.160
So the prime numbers,
that's a sequence.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.030
The square numbers, at
one, four, nine, sixteen,

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.530
twenty-five.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.484
That's a sequence.

00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:04.900
What it be interesting
to find out

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.490
what is the lowest number
that has never appeared

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.400
in the online encyclopedia
of digit sequences, which you

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.840
could probably say is the
only number-- well, probably

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.530
the lowest number never
to have to appeared

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.580
in any mathematical
piece of research

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.600
in the last 3,000 years
since, really, there's

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.030
been mathematics.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:29.720
And that number
is 14,228, which I

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.380
thought was quite
low personally.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.580
But it's also interesting.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.570
It's very, very
divisible, isn't it?

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.052
Divided by two obviously.

00:16:42.052 --> 00:16:44.135
This idea that numbers
that are really interesting

00:16:44.135 --> 00:16:48.000
are the prime numbers,
the odd numbers.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.761
Finally, this number 11,
which is also a cheap

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:53.510
plug because I also
used to live in Brazil

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.130
and wrote a book on Brazilian
football, which has also

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.120
been updated for the World Cup.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.746
So if you're interested
in finding out

00:16:59.746 --> 00:17:03.315
about Brazil and the World
Cup buy my book about it.

00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:05.709
It has [INAUDIBLE], who
is the-- well, he's not

00:17:05.709 --> 00:17:07.290
the captain, actually,
at the moment,

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.470
but he's the talisman of
the Brazilian national team.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:14.520
And the reason why 11 was
chosen was from an American,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.660
36 years old, and I like to
think that he was from the deep

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.130
South because if he wasn't, it
doesn't really make much sense

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.454
because he said, I like 11
because it sounds like lovin'.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.574
So, why?

00:17:28.574 --> 00:17:29.990
What are the reasons
why seven was

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.330
the world's favorite number?

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.600
I made a little animation,
hoping the sound is OK.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.310
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.420
-We've been obsessed by the
number seven for as long

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.340
as we know.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.260
Go back to the
earliest writings there

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.660
is, on Babylonian clay
tablets, and they're

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.550
just full of sevens.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.392
Then you have seven dwarves,
seven sins, seven seas,

00:17:47.392 --> 00:17:48.370
seven sisters.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.590
The list just goes on and on.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.100
So why is seven so special?

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.150
One argument is that
there are seven planets

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.860
in the sky visible
to the naked eye.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.480
To me, that's just coincidence.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.740
There's a much more
compelling reason.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.866
Seven is the only number
among those that we can count

00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:07.590
on our hands-- that's
those from one to 10--

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.010
that cannot be divided or
multiplied within the group.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.420
So one, two, three, four, and
five, you can double them.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.680
six, eight and 10,
you can half them.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.490
And nine you can
divide by three.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.790
Seven is the only
one that remains.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.910
It's unique.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.890
It's a loner, the outsider.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.580
And humans interpret this
arithmetical property

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.290
in cultural ways.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.320
By associating seven
with a group of things,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.890
you kind of makes
them special too.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.410
The point here is
that we're always

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.610
sensitive to
arithmetical patterns

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.940
and this influences our
behavior even if we're not

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.304
conscious of it and irrespective
of our ability at maths.

00:18:43.304 --> 00:18:44.144
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:44.144 --> 00:18:45.560
ALEX BELLOS: There's
another thing

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.080
which kind of ties into this.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.670
If you were to ask someone-- and
this is a psychology experiment

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.080
that's been repeated many
times-- just think of a number

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.070
off the top of your
head between one and 10,

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.480
most people say seven.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.690
And why they say seven,
essentially-- again,

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.900
you're doing mathematics
without realizing.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.101
You think, well, I'm
not going to say one

00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:06.850
because that's not off
the top of my head.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:07.914
That's just too obvious.

00:19:07.914 --> 00:19:09.330
It's not sort of
arbitrary enough.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.080
I'm not going to say 10.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.400
I'm not going to say five.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.610
Well, you've just done
the two times table.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.044
And then you sort of say,
well, two, that's also.

00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:16.960
I wouldn't choose two.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.668
Then you eliminate
two, four, six, eight.

00:19:18.668 --> 00:19:20.350
You do exactly what
I was doing in there

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.710
and you're left with seven.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.750
Seven-- it's the most difficult.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.540
It's the one that's
[INAUDIBLE] to stretch

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.300
where it feels the most random.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.230
Now, if we go back to
the qualitative results

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.300
of the favorite number survey,
I was trying to work out,

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.680
is there any way that I
could grasp or explain

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.957
the kind of collective
views about numbers?

00:19:40.957 --> 00:19:42.790
And I was thinking,
well, how can I do this.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.630
And I was reading all this
more than 30,000 reasons

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.180
why people like numbers.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.380
And I noticed that the language
used to describe each number

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.690
was different.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.580
So I'm going to
pluck the adjectives

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.340
that we use to describe
different numbers.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.490
Number one was
described-- this is

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.580
each word in a
different reason--

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:08.210
as independent, strong,
honest, brave, straightforward,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.950
pioneering, competitive,
dramatic, egoistic, hot-headed,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.440
and lonely.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.230
So imagine we were a
creative writing class.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.910
And I said this is like the
main protagonist of our story.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.761
Those are really quite coherent
personality traits there.

00:20:25.761 --> 00:20:26.260
Two.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.730
These are words used to
describe the number two.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.327
In fact, sorry.

00:20:30.327 --> 00:20:31.160
That was number one.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:31.660
Two.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:37.040
So look at number two and see
if you visualize these traits.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:43.090
Simple, elegant, cautious, wise,
observant, pretty, fragile,

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:48.080
open, sympathetic,
comfortable, flexible, subtle,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.059
inconspicuous.

00:20:49.059 --> 00:20:50.600
This is from lots
of different people

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.420
and they've got lots
of different reasons

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.510
but together, again, there
is a kind of coherence there.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:59.060
And what struck me most of
all was that if these were

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.870
a creative writing
class and we were having

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.710
to imagine characters for
the numbers one and two,

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.820
one is really male
characteristics

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.630
or traditionally
male characteristics.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.380
And two, traditionally
female characteristics.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.180
So the cartoonist of the
book did exactly that.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.840
This is how she interpreted it.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.410
We could do a fantastic kind
of rom-com or romantic story

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.364
with one as the man
and two as the woman.

00:21:24.364 --> 00:21:27.120
Now, I saw this and
I thought, well,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.350
this is really quite striking.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.810
But the more that I read--
and I read quite a lot

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.800
of stuff on the history
of maths and the growth

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.500
of intellectual ideas and
also about psychology--

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.320
it's really quite
common, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.620
So numbers were invented
about 8.000 years ago, say,

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.200
in Sumeria, which
is present-day Iraq.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.420
The very first
words that we know

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.500
that we used by humans for
the number one and the number

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.410
two-- the word
for the number one

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.010
is the same words as
the word for phallus

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.300
and the word for two was
the same word for woman.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.360
So right from the beginning,
there-- for whatever reasons.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:05.960
We don't know.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.590
You can imagine, I suppose.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.120
One is male and two is female.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.830
Actually, a friend of mine who's
a quite well known novelist,

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.870
she said well, Alex, I
was reading your stuff

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.254
about masculine and feminine.

00:22:22.254 --> 00:22:24.170
And I just thought that
everyone thought that.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.586
I've always thought-- and she's
one of the smartest people

00:22:26.586 --> 00:22:27.250
that I know.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.984
And she was saying, yeah,
well because it's obvious

00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:31.900
that one and odd numbers
are masculine and two

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.150
and even numbers are feminine.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.200
They obviously are because two
you can kind of split apart.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.580
They can become two new things.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.410
It's like they
kind of give birth.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.450
And obviously, I had
never thought that at all.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.290
But the fact that
someone-- there

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.680
are people who are
smart who think these.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:50.510
We do relate to numbers
in emotional ways.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.120
Pythagoras who's the
beginning of Greek mathematics

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.620
had this Pythagorean
brotherhood.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.420
And they believed that
odd numbers are masculine

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.312
and even numbers are feminine.

00:23:01.312 --> 00:23:02.770
And I discovered
some research that

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:07.150
had been done quite recently
in which respondents

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.580
or participants were asked
to look at babies who

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.160
are six weeks old of
indeterminate gender

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.090
and all you have to do is
just say, is this a boy

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.182
or is this a girl.

00:23:18.182 --> 00:23:20.140
Always, they had numbers
at the bottom of them.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.920
But the people were told.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.670
Don't look at the numbers.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.878
There's going to be a number.

00:23:22.878 --> 00:23:25.470
But just don't look at it,
just look at the child.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.530
And what the
experimenters were doing

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.380
is that sometimes it was all
three even numbers, sometimes

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:34.090
all three all numbers,
all kind of randomized,

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.240
proper science and that.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.800
And it turns out that,
with odd numbers,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.830
you're 10% more likely
to think that a baby

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.600
of indeterminate gender is male
and with even numbers, 10% more

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.040
likely that the baby is female.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.970
So there is still this kind
of subconscious association

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.985
with odd numbers with
masculinity and even numbers

00:23:55.985 --> 00:23:56.797
with femininity.

00:23:59.636 --> 00:24:02.260
Also, when I [INAUDIBLE] started
to get interested in this idea

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.480
that numbers have personalities.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.965
And even though if I had
been talking to myself

00:24:07.965 --> 00:24:09.465
a few years ago I
would have thought

00:24:09.465 --> 00:24:10.740
that absolutely ridiculous.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.115
When I started to
think about it,

00:24:12.115 --> 00:24:14.640
I though, yeah, well I
use numbers all the time.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.420
Yeah, certain numbers do kind of
feel a bit different to others.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.770
And then when you
start looking at even

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.370
Shakespeare noticed this.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.650
This is from "Merry
Wives of Windsor,"

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.380
Falstaff, They say there
is divinity in odd numbers,

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.930
either in nativity,
chance or death.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.050
And it's true.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:36.170
All our most mystical
religious symbolic numbers

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.680
are odd numbers in
the Western tradition.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:45.190
So three, Christianity,
seven, 13, five a little bit.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:49.270
They're all low primes
and this is interesting.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.625
And there is
psychological research,

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:55.250
proper psychological
research, not just

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.972
my online survey,
that starts to give us

00:24:57.972 --> 00:25:00.180
a bit of an inkling about
why this might be the case.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.760
So one of the experiments was
you're just shown two digits.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.670
Either they're both odd
or they're both even

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.992
or one is even and one is odd.

00:25:08.992 --> 00:25:10.700
All you need to do is
just press a button

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.824
when they're both the same.

00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:14.540
So either when they're both
even or when they're both odd.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.110
Turns out you're much slower
pressing the button when

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.977
they're both odd and
you make more mistakes.

00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:23.560
In other words, it kind of takes
us longer just to process it,

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.880
just to think about them,
not to do any math with them,

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.380
just to think about odd numbers
than it does with even numbers.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.840
And this sort of gives this
idea that somehow there's

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.130
sort of more room,
there's more space,

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:38.650
to have a kind of emotional
interaction with them.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.540
The final experiment I
want to talk about in terms

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.000
of these psychological and
emotional responses to numbers

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.250
is all about branding.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.310
And I'm sure we're going to
be seeing a lot more of this

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.050
because this is
quite recent work.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.980
The scientists, the
academics, wanted

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.480
to know if we are more
likely to be attracted

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.050
to want to buy and pay
more money for brands

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.040
if they have different
types of numbers on them.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:13.420
So WD-40 is a very
popular brand.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.270
That's an even number.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.600
Oxy10.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.890
That's an even number.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.740
There's something sensible,
safe about even numbers.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:24.190
And it turns out that, for
household products, for things

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.380
that you want to
work and be reliable,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.870
people are much more
likely, will pay more money,

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.390
if they have an
even number on them.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:36.680
So the experiment here was
two packs of contact lens,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.051
one is the brand called
Solus36, one is Solus37.

00:26:39.051 --> 00:26:40.550
They're absolutely
exactly the same.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.790
You do all these tests about
how to evaluate the brand.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.080
Solus36 is much more popular.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.155
People pay more money for it.

00:26:46.155 --> 00:26:46.696
They want it.

00:26:46.696 --> 00:26:47.950
They like it better.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:48.520
OK.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.120
So this is the first
of the experiment.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:57.130
Then they add in this
tagline, 6 colors.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.250
6 fits.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.359
Just to see if this affected how
much you wanted the brand how

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:03.900
much you liked it,
how much money you

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.440
were prepared to pay for it.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.890
And what happened
is that Solus36

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.140
becomes even more liked
and Solus37, which

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.890
wasn't liked very much
in the first place,

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.890
becomes even less liked.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:19.230
And the argument put
forward, the hypothesis,

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:26.070
by the scientists is that the
reason why we like Solus36

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.530
is that we-- how do
we learn numbers?

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.490
We learn numbers by
learning times tables

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.270
by rote when we're children.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.720
So we are much more
familiar with numbers

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.240
that are in times tables.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.562
So 36.

00:27:41.562 --> 00:27:43.520
Whenever we do the six
times tables, we get it.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.520
We do the 12 times
tables, we get to it.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.490
And what happens?

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.490
We never get to 37 because
it's a prime number.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:49.810
It's not on any times table.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:53.860
It will be the answer to very
few-- basically, as a child,

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.930
you will never utter or
think about the word 37

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.650
but you will use
36 all the time.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.650
So this idea that it's
what you're familiar with

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.360
is that fluency of processing.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.600
And you misattribute this
fluency of processing

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.700
for liking of the product.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.770
So it kind of feels good.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:07.436
Oh, I like that.

00:28:07.436 --> 00:28:10.290
Oh, it's like a friend,
a friendly product.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.680
And this is what's
exacerbated by the tagline

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.100
because subconsciously
we're seeing six, six, 36,

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.560
and it's like, oh, yeah.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.522
It's like a nursery
rhyme from school.

00:28:19.522 --> 00:28:20.188
I remember that.

00:28:20.188 --> 00:28:20.960
I like that.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.060
I really like those
contact lenses.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.060
And with six, six, 37, there's a
kind of mathematical cacophony.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.030
We don't like it.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.960
So that brand is
really unattractive.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.100
And they did a lot
more experiments.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.660
And it's interesting that when
you have an ad for something

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.050
and if you subtly put numbers
in it that relate arithmetically

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.560
together, you can
increase quite drastically

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.080
the liking for that brand.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.280
So in the future
I'm sure there'll

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.470
be lots of numbers subtly
positioned within ads.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.270
Which you tend to
think, oh, god,

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.680
I hated learning maths by rote.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.300
I hated learning
my times tables,

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.370
but actually that either can
be kind of leveraged to make

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:04.660
you feel good about a product
is ironic to say the least.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.932
That is essentially what is
the beginning of my book,

00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:09.723
the story about me and
the favorite numbers

00:29:09.723 --> 00:29:11.223
and emotional
connections to numbers

00:29:11.223 --> 00:29:14.827
which is how life
reflects numbers.

00:29:14.827 --> 00:29:16.660
The rest of the book,
so the majority of it,

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.450
is kind of proper
more serious maths.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.940
And I'm going to just talk to
you about one part of it now

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.330
that begins with-- we're
talking about prime number.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.340
So let's just repeat
prime numbers.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.510
These are the prime numbers.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.900
The numbers that only divide
by themselves and one.

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.862
Those are the first seven--
I think, yeah. --of them

00:29:38.862 --> 00:29:42.166
two, three, five, seven,
eleven, thirteen, seventeen.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.830
We live in the age of algorithms
as we're told every day.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.830
What was probably the
very first algorithm

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.660
in mathematics and,
therefore, in civilization?

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.390
It was probably what's called
the sieve of Eratosthenes which

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:00.970
was the algorithm
to try and find

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.800
all the prime numbers
under a certain number.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.420
So this is a grid of the
numbers from one to 100.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.507
I've done them in six rows.

00:30:08.507 --> 00:30:10.340
We're going to use the
sieve of Eratosthenes

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.860
to try and find all
the prime numbers.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.240
OK.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.270
What do you-- you start at the
bottom, you get to a number,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.540
if the number has
not been eliminated,

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.780
it's a prime number.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.930
And then you eliminate
all multiples of it.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.530
So let's start with one.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.990
One's not a prime number
because we start at two.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.500
Get to two.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.520
Then we eliminate
all multiples of it

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.250
which is basically
all even numbers.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.680
And it's nice when you
do it in rows of six.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.640
So next one.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.786
We get to three.

00:30:37.786 --> 00:30:38.910
Three's a prime number.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.750
Then we eliminate all
multiples of three

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.386
which is just one more line
because the bottom row is

00:30:44.386 --> 00:30:46.760
all multiples of three but
we've already eliminated that.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.718
Four's been eliminated.

00:30:47.718 --> 00:30:49.194
We get to five.

00:30:49.194 --> 00:30:50.110
That's a prime number.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.850
Eliminate all multiples of that.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.890
Six has been eliminated.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:56.380
You get to seven, eliminate
all multiples of that.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.280
Nice little crisscross pattern.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.880
Then up to 11.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:06.442
And you only need to--
when doing the sieve,

00:31:06.442 --> 00:31:07.900
go to the square
root of the number

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.621
that you're seiving which
is root of 100 which is 10.

00:31:10.621 --> 00:31:12.370
So we've got to 10
already so therefore we

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:17.250
can guarantee that all of those
numbers in their are primes.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.140
And there are few
interesting things to say.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.870
First is that all prime numbers
are either one or one less

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.170
or one more than
a multiple of six

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.350
because that can only be in
line one or in line five.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.030
If this went on to infinity,
it would be the same.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.300
But also-- which is why
people are kind of fascinated

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.455
by prime numbers-- is that
before you get to them,

00:31:35.455 --> 00:31:37.830
there's no way of knowing if
a number is going to be prim

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.040
or not.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.640
They appear to be
kind of randomly

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.410
sprinkled around
the number line.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.110
And that is one of the
reasons why they are still

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.150
one of the first things
to be studied in numbers

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.620
and there's still--
lots of things

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.610
about them are just not known.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.820
Lots of books about
prime numbers.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:04.610
So in 1963, Stanislav
Ulam, who was

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:07.540
one of the great mathematicians
of the 20th century,

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.100
was doodling, got
bored in a math lecture

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.360
and started to doodle.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.400
And he did a great but he
put the one in the middle

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.800
and then started to
spiral and then started

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.851
to cross off the prime numbers.

00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:22.350
And he noticed
something that no one

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.320
had noticed before--
that prime numbers tend

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.850
to sit on lines together.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:32.180
And so this is something
after several thousand years

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.680
no one had ever
bothered to do this.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.819
And this is up to 100,
which is the numbers

00:32:35.819 --> 00:32:37.110
that we saw on the grid before.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.660
But if we do it up to 20,000,
you see it a bit more.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.910
There are these lines that
prime numbers seem to sit on.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.790
And it's called an Ulam spiral.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.750
And really, in maths, you
kind of have total order

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.010
and that's a bit boring.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.480
You have total chaos.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.210
That's a bit complicated.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:00.280
When you have this sort of in
the bit between order and chaos

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.270
which you have here is where
things get really interesting.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.600
So this is a really kind of
simple yet incredibly deep

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.970
image of where are
all these primes

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.590
and what relations do
they have to each other?

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.680
This is Ulam right
here on the right.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.930
And he's sitting.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.620
This is just after
the Second World

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:28.630
War near Los Alamos with John
Von Neumann on the left, who

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.020
I hope that Google has a
shrine to John Von Neumann

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.910
somewhere because basically
he invented the computer

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.460
with Alan Turing of course.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.250
But a lot of the kind
of conceptual framework

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.050
of computing was basically
invented by John Von Neumann.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.870
In the middle is
Richard Feynmann,

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.785
the famous American physicist.

00:33:45.785 --> 00:33:48.160
This is an amazing picture
because you could quite easily

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.810
argue that these three
men sort of changed

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.500
the 20th sort of
more than anyone

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.170
else because they were
instrumental in creating

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:03.760
nuclear weapons, the computer,
Von Neumann-- possibly

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.230
the greatest mathematical
genius of the 20th century.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.380
Whatever he tried to do he
invented like a new field.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.179
And it's one of the fields
that he and Ulam invented

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:18.400
I'm just going to finish
off talking about now which

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.020
hopefully is right up your
street because it talks about

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.350
essentially the first computer
craze that there ever was.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:29.530
So Von Neumann was
inventing so much stuff.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.989
And it was in the
1940s, early '50s,

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:38.159
started to worry about
what he was creating.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.020
Computers, robots, what's
going to happen to robots?

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:45.040
What would it take, he asked,
for a robot or a machine

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.290
to replicate itself?

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.139
And this is actually a kind
of psychologic problems.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.540
It's like a
mathematical problem.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.081
It's not really a
biological problem.

00:34:53.081 --> 00:34:55.370
It's a kind of conceptual
idea because just

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.360
say you've got the
machine and you've got,

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.999
say, the instructions.

00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:01.790
If you put the instructions
in the machine,

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:06.100
can the machine make itself
from the instructions?

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.600
Because the
instructions, obviously,

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.641
are part of the machines.

00:35:08.641 --> 00:35:10.150
So you cannot replicate.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:15.526
And basically it can't
in a finite world.

00:35:15.526 --> 00:35:17.900
Just say you've got a machine
with a set of instructions.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.340
What you want to do is
create exactly that.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.140
A machine and a set
of instructions.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.790
Just say the machine
reads the instructions

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.240
and it's got instructions
how to rebuild a machine.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.080
Does that set of instructions
have instructions

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.770
on how to build a new
set of instructions

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.090
because if it does, then
that set of instructions

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:37.730
within the instructions.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.280
It's got to have some
other instructions.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.540
And then you get this
infinite regress.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.560
It's a finite system.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.680
It can't happen.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.420
So he realized that
if you have a machine

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.050
with a set of instructions
to self-replicate,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:51.190
you need to treat the
instructions in two ways.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:55.950
You need to read it
to build the machine

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.990
and then you need to
duplicate it and then

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.280
present it to the new machine.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.220
So there are two
ways-- basically,

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.860
you need these two elements.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.329
And when, a few years
ago, Watson and Crick

00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:10.870
discovered DNA, they realized
that essentially the same thing

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.290
happens in humans
more in general terms.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.800
The DNA is the instructions.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.880
It has instructions
for the cell.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.280
But DNA does not contain
instructions for DNA

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.920
because DNA replicates.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.560
It's a double helix and one
of the helixes splits off

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.980
and then you create another one.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.460
So this is another fantastic
example of something

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:32.820
which the mathematics was
conceptually discovered years

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.130
before it was shown
to be that was

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.630
the way-- it's like
the Higgs boson.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.129
It was kind of
mathematically proved

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:41.350
and then, decades later,
it was discovered.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.397
What John Von Neumann
wanted to do--

00:36:46.397 --> 00:36:48.480
he's also like a fantastic
entertaining character.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.680
He loved parties and
sometimes would hold parties

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.930
just because he liked working
to the sound of parties.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.763
So he would be there
kind of mixing together

00:36:55.763 --> 00:36:59.680
and then go back to his room
and do some amazing maths.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.200
He wanted to think
about building

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.550
a self-replicating
robot, something which

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.600
can use instructions,
then duplicate them.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.976
But it was just too complicated
actually working out

00:37:07.976 --> 00:37:09.350
how to build it
in the real world

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:12.440
so Ulam who, as we've seen,
loves grids and things

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.320
like that and
patterns, said, let's

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.670
invent a new kind of
mathematical abstraction.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.610
Which they did, called
the cellular automaton.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:26.880
And a cellular automaton
essentially is a grid of cells.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.740
The cells can have
different states

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.270
but the behavior of
the cells depends only

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.170
on neighboring cells.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.740
I'm going to explain now a
very simple cellular automaton

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:41.950
called the Game of Life
because Von Neumann invented

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.590
it to try and find something
that would self-replicate

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:48.630
and he managed to do
that conceptually.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.850
And then, a decade or
so later, at the end

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.659
of the '60s, a British
mathematician called

00:37:52.659 --> 00:37:54.200
John Conway, who's
still alive-- he's

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.780
at Princeton at the
moment-- invented what

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.670
is one of the most famous
examples of what's called

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.800
recreational maths but
it's also quite serious

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.210
called the Game of Life.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:04.920
It's not a game.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.700
It's a cellular automaton.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.540
Life because it emulates
evolution of life.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.520
So this is the grid.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.840
The game of Life-- I'm going
to explain how it works.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.100
All of it takes place on
a two-dimensional grid.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:28.070
The grid can be infinite, and
it has these orthogonal cells.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:31.500
The cells can have two
states, either alive or dead.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.480
This is a live cell.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.870
All around it are dead.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.250
And it's immediate
neighbors-- there

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:41.020
are eight of them-- are these
ones here all around it.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:48.450
So its behavior depends only
on those eight cells around it.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:51.260
And these are the
rules that it obeys.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.810
There are the Game
of Life genetic laws.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.410
One, if you have a live, if
it's surrounded by zero or one

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.846
live neighbors, it
dies by loneliness.

00:39:00.846 --> 00:39:02.970
If it has two or three live
neighbors, it survives.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.054
Four or more live neighbors,
it dies by overcrowding.

00:39:09.054 --> 00:39:09.970
Really, really simple.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.170
Basically, it a live cell is
surrounded by two or three,

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.680
it survives.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.190
If it's not, it dies.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.330
A dead cell, if it has
exactly three live neighbors,

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.940
it becomes alive.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.000
And in all other
cases, it stays dead.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.147
So Conway-- this
was the late '60s--

00:39:25.147 --> 00:39:26.230
he had one of those grids.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.060
It was basically a Go board.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.268
There were no computers then.

00:39:28.268 --> 00:39:30.920
And he used Go counters just
to see what would happen.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.180
So let's see what happens.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:38.930
This is a pattern
with three shapes.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:43.070
What the Game of Life does
is what we will always

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:44.625
do-- we will start
with a pattern.

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:46.500
And the idea is to put
an interesting pattern

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.490
on the board and then you
don't, in fact, touch it at all.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.200
It then just
evolves and changes.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.660
So what we want to
see is how it evolves.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.680
And Conway chose
his rules to make

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:01.620
the most unpredictable
and interesting way

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.820
that things evolve.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.790
So what we're going to do here--
let's look at this one here,

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:11.440
surrounded by one live
neighbor, it will die.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.570
Surrounded by two live
neighbors, it will survive.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:17.310
Surrounded by one live
neighbor, it will die.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.881
A dead cell surrounded by
three, it will survive.

00:40:19.881 --> 00:40:21.380
So what happens is
that you work out

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.540
how each one is going
to behave and then you

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.659
apply the rules on
everything and then

00:40:26.659 --> 00:40:27.700
you get a new generation.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.783
So what would happen here?

00:40:28.783 --> 00:40:31.400
The new generation
would be that.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.360
OK.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:37.230
And then it dies because
there are only two left.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:39.650
This one here.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.890
That becomes that.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.900
And then it dies.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.530
This one here.

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:50.060
We're going with shapes
with three live cells.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.012
Becomes that.

00:40:51.012 --> 00:40:52.220
And then it just stays there.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.770
It's called a stable form.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.896
So at the beginning, they
were like zoologists.

00:40:55.896 --> 00:40:57.020
They've got this new world.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.430
They were just
trying to work out

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:02.450
what was there, finding the
patterns and what would happen.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:07.750
This one here, another
three cell pattern.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:11.260
Becomes that, then
that, and then that.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.010
That's known as the blinker.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:15.010
OK.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.340
Not that interesting yet.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:22.620
When you start to add more,
most things end up dying,

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.360
but sometimes you get
amazing bursts of life.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:31.640
So this four-cell pattern
becomes this then this

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.100
then this then this.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.905
It's four blinkers, which
is called traffic lights.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.040
Let's go and look at
a five cell pattern.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.700
So they had done four-cell,
see what happened to them.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.374
They were cataloging them.

00:41:53.374 --> 00:41:55.040
And then they noticed
something amazing.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.490
And this is when basically
the study of life

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.781
really took off because look
at this five-star pattern.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.836
It repeats.

00:42:08.836 --> 00:42:09.940
It's called a glider.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:15.690
Every four generations,
it's moved one space down

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:17.830
and one cell along on the grid.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:20.050
So essentially it moves.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:21.660
It looks like it's moving.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:30.470
And this was the-- Conway
called these spaceships

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:35.460
in the kind of etymology of the
kind of animals or the living

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.710
things that you get.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.720
And he wondered and
in Scientific American

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.340
he said, does anyone
know if there's

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:46.709
any pattern that can grow and
have more and more live cells.

00:42:46.709 --> 00:42:49.250
Because this one it all stays
at five cells all the way down.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.490
Something that can grow
and get infinitely big.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.390
And he put a reward in
Scientific American.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.980
And the Martin Gardener
article that wrote about it

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.240
was the most read
article he ever wrote.

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.250
And this is a guy
who is like the guru

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:08.690
of all kind of popularization
of maths and science.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:14.220
And this was Conway in
Cambridge writing about it.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.510
Martin Gardener in
America writing about it.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.800
But the real development
started to happen at MIT.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.670
The Game of Life
came along at a time

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.386
where computing
was just beginning.

00:43:27.386 --> 00:43:28.760
But you would only
have computers

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.980
if you were in a big
kind of organization

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.860
or if you were at a
university like MIT.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.470
And I don't know
if you know where

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:37.720
the word "hacking" comes from.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.290
The word "hacking" originally
comes from the MIT Model

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:44.650
Railway Club, and a hack is when
you kind of customize something

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:47.314
just for the hell of
it, just to make it fun.

00:43:47.314 --> 00:43:48.730
And so the hackers
were the people

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.792
who worked at the MIT
Model Railway Club.

00:43:51.792 --> 00:43:53.250
But when computers
came along, they

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.140
became not so interested
in model railways

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.246
and worked on computers.

00:43:56.246 --> 00:43:57.870
And the thing with
Game of Life, as you

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.870
saw-- incredibly simple
rules but incredibly complex

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:01.740
behavior.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:06.850
It became basically the
first computer craze

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:09.870
that the hackers
at MIT-- and this

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.740
is essentially
the people whose--

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:20.080
the forefathers or forebrothers,
say, of Steve Jobs,

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.184
Bill Gates, et cetera, were
the hackers at MIT working

00:44:23.184 --> 00:44:25.350
on the Game of Life, which
was basically the biggest

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:27.850
deal in computing
in the early '70s.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:30.720
And Bill Gosper, who was the
kind of king of the hackers,

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.150
discovered and won the prize
for the first pattern that

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.645
grows without bound,
which is this.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:44.050
And it looks like a
kind of pair of lungs.

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.870
And what it's doing is
called a glider gun.

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:54.115
And basically it just, every
period, spits out a glider.

00:44:54.115 --> 00:44:55.740
And that will carry
on, getting bigger.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:59.474
And the total of live cells
just gets bigger and bigger.

00:44:59.474 --> 00:45:01.140
And the more that
people looked at this,

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.806
they started to find
other patterns that

00:45:02.806 --> 00:45:05.470
did other interesting things.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.730
So this thing here
is called an eater.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.850
And what an eater
does is an eater

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:13.040
will eat anything
that you send at it.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.825
So this gave the
first indication

00:45:15.825 --> 00:45:17.950
that this might actually
have some use because it's

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:20.010
like how to build
self-repairing object.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:24.090
But also it meant that
you could start to just

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:27.360
have these amazing kind
of engineering patterns

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.810
where you could build
massive patterns

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.100
and all the debris you could
have eater just clean them up.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:38.780
So let's have a look at
the eater, what happens.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.550
So this is a glider coming in
it to an eater, gets eaten.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:45.030
This is another spaceship,
just gets eaten.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:48.800
And let's now look at--
this is the sort of thing

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.510
that people started to build.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.570
So this is a glider moving.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.202
And I'm going to
be going out of it.

00:45:56.202 --> 00:45:56.910
What's happening?

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:58.820
So it's going to this
other massive pattern.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.361
What's going to
happen to the glider?

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.350
Bing.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:05.010
It bounces.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.860
So that's basically
a glider reflector.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.940
It will bounce a
glider at 90 degrees.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.240
So as we keep on
going out we see

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.780
we've got these gliders
in kind of outer space.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.150
And what's interesting is
that now you look at it,

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.750
you're thinking it's like these
little ants walking around.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.880
The grid, every cell, is only
responding to the eight cells

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.520
around it.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:30.900
So there is no kind of
overall guiding thing,

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:31.990
but yet there is.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.740
So Game of Life is
such a great way

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.820
to understand how things
at different scales

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.460
take on different appearances.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:41.590
So we keep on going
out of this pattern.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:45.260
All these are
gliders in streams.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.330
And here we are.

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:52.005
In fact, what this
is-- it's a gun.

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.630
It goes back in in
a second, magnifies.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:00.620
These are the two
kind of barrels.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:11.710
And everything is working
in such synchronicity that--

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:12.390
going in.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.892
This is a spaceship, a special
slightly larger spaceship

00:47:17.892 --> 00:47:18.475
than a glider.

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:22.550
That will be shot out.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.360
So this thing will keep
on going forever, just

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.900
shooting out those spaceships.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.170
Now, what kind of things can you
build using the Game of Life?

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:35.960
And I wanted to show
you this pattern.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.300
So this is a pattern,
20,000 cells.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.910
It's the sieve of Eratosthenes.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:44.130
What it's doing-- it's a gun
that's shooting out spaceships

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.800
only in the prime
number positions, OK?

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.817
This is two, three.

00:47:47.817 --> 00:47:49.275
Four's not prime
so it's not there.

00:47:49.275 --> 00:47:49.960
That's Five.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.668
Six is not there.

00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:52.010
That's seven.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:53.710
That's nine.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:56.720
Nine's not going to come back
because a glider gets shot

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.750
at it.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:58.430
OK.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.060
So what is actually
happening here

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.380
is that, as that
goes along there,

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:12.090
this thing here shoots
a glider every three.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.980
In other words, anything
that's divisible by three

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:15.930
it's going to kill.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:19.130
This shoots something every
five, this every seven,

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.330
this every nine.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:28.184
And if I go to the
next, this one here.

00:48:28.184 --> 00:48:29.106
Hang on.

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:32.520
Yeah.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.390
So again.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.200
So this shooting every three.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.270
That's seven.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:49.530
This is nine.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:52.110
Because we know all even
numbers aren't prime,

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:54.290
we only shoot at the odds.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:56.090
That is nine.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:56.700
That's 11.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.866
That's going to get through.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.290
So it's the sieve
of Eratosthenes

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.810
turned into this kind of
intergalactic shootout

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.910
between gliders and spaceships.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.390
That's 11.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.280
The next one is 15 so 15
is divisible by that's

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.470
the three coming in.

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:16.650
That's the five coming in.

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:18.100
That's 15.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.080
That's going to get shot.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.290
So we could let this
pattern go forever

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:26.940
and it would just
shoot out gliders.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:31.980
I've one slide to go left,
which is this one here.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.710
So what is the extent
of the Game of Life?

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:39.020
What can the Game of Life do?

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.380
It can find prime numbers.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.730
Actually, speeding up so we have
enough time, the Game of Life

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.640
can do absolutely anything
that any computer can do.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.140
Right?

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:52.180
Because what is a computer
at its most basic level?

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.770
It's a bunch of wires with
a pulse going through it.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:55.780
It's binary.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:00.650
You can emulate a wire with
a pulse going through it

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.200
by a stream of
gliders like here.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.990
So when there's a
space it's a zero.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.574
When there's a
glider, there's a one.

00:50:06.574 --> 00:50:07.490
What else do you need?

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:08.550
You need logic gates.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.170
You can make the
three logic gates.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:12.045
There are patterns for
the three logic gates.

00:50:12.045 --> 00:50:14.900
And you need wires to be
able to cross each other.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.330
You can do that just by
thinning out the wires so

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.280
they don't hit.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.690
And you need a memory register.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:21.820
You can do that with a
block, which is the square.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.630
And a block at a certain
distance, keeping the memory.

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:27.990
So the mathematical
term for that

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:30.680
would be that Life is
universal because it's

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.510
capable of universal
computation.

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:36.040
So even though it would be a
very inefficient way to do it,

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.000
you could actually
use the Game of Life,

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.580
which incredibly simple
rules can do anything

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.930
that the most complicated,
sophisticated computer could

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.040
ever do.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.510
And I guess on that note,
which is kind of quite a wow.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.840
We come to the end of the talk.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.300
That's the name
of the book, which

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.270
has more information both about
emotional responses to numbers,

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:04.820
loads of things in
between, culminating

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.230
in cellular automata.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.980
And the whole idea
about cellular automata

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:13.280
is that it's really good
for emulating replication.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.240
And people have now
started to get patterns

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.680
that do self-replicate in
the sort of Von Neumann

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.190
sense of self-replicating.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:21.490
And mathematicians there's
only a matter of time

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:25.260
that you will be able to create
self-replicating creatures that

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:29.450
live on a kind of big infinite
grid of the Game of Life.

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:33.260
So the kind of game
is turning into life.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:37.500
And there are philosophers who
say that, actually, the best

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.160
explanation for the
world and the universe

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.290
is a bit like the Game
of Life-- that there's

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:46.320
some initial
configuration of kind

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.620
of discrete elements of some way
and that we are just squillions

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:55.980
of generations beyond
that beginning grid.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.540
So, again, it's interesting
to think philosophically

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.131
about that.

00:52:00.131 --> 00:52:01.630
That's the first
book, "Numberland."

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:03.410
That's the football
book that I did.

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:05.960
I blog, "Alex's Adventures in
Numberland," at the "Guardian"

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.580
every couple of weeks.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.170
And I'm on social
media if you want

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.770
to follow any of the maths
popularization work that I do.

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:12.603
Thank you very much.

00:52:12.603 --> 00:52:15.053
Sorry for talking for
a bit longer than I

00:52:15.053 --> 00:52:16.100
probably expected to.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.923
Thank you.

00:52:17.923 --> 00:52:19.250
PETER: Thank you so much.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.188
That was crazy stuff.

00:52:21.188 --> 00:52:22.120
Brilliant.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.601
And people have to
run, I'm afraid.

00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:24.350
It's not rudeness.

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:25.880
I think people have
meeting at 2:00.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.060
But I think we've probably
run out of time for questions.

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.900
Except you neglected to say
what your favorite number was.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.790
ALEX BELLOS: Well,
that's the last thing.

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:32.289
I don't have a
favorite number which

00:52:32.289 --> 00:52:34.920
is why I got interested
in it in the first place.

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.912
I don't have one.

00:52:35.912 --> 00:52:37.620
PETER: He'll be around
for a few minutes.

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:38.620
ALEX BELLOS: I will
totally be around.

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.770
PETER: If you want to
ask questions one-to-one,

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:41.900
feel free to do so.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.100
Thank you very much indeed.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.550
