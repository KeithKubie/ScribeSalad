00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.414 --> 00:00:06.580
JAKE TAPPER: Thanks so much.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.621
It's so great to be here.

00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:09.940
I really appreciate it.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.440
Just first of all,
I should tell you

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.360
I wrote the book on Google Docs.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.230
I don't know if that
means anything--

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.660
if that means anything to you.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.080
But the idea that I could
bring my computer or not bring

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.770
my computer, and just wherever
I was-- at work or on the road--

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.576
I could write and pick
up where I left off,

00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:26.950
not have to worry
about it saving

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.810
since it saves automatically--

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.430
it's a great product
and it really

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.160
helped me write the book.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.800
So I'll just talk a
little bit about the book.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.440
And then, I'll take
your questions.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.590
I guess, when I think
of "The Hellfire Club,"

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.230
I think of it on
three basic levels.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.950
One of them is this--

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.710
I tried to write a thriller,
what I thought would be fun.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.760
It takes place in 1954.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.410
A World War II hero
turned academic

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.390
named Charlie Marder
and his wife, Margaret,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.820
who is a zoologist,
moved to Washington DC.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.670
He gets appointed to
a congressional seat.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.190
And immediately, they become
ensnared in a grand conspiracy

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.410
with secret societies
and all sorts of factions

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.472
competing against each other.

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:12.430
One of the things that
I thought would be fun--

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.930
and I hope is fun for readers--

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.880
is I have actual
people from that time--

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.080
like Joe McCarthy, and Roy Cohn,
and John and Robert Kennedy,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.030
and Eisenhower, and
others-- interacting

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.830
with my fictitious characters,
which I thought would be fun.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.440
People ask me all the
time, why the 1950s?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.450
And I think of the 1950s as
a time that, on its veneer--

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.850
especially, if
you're a white male--

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.790
it is an idyllic period.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.490
In our popular culture,
we think of "Happy Days"

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.510
or "American Graffiti."

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.330
We think of the '50s
as a pleasant time.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.910
But actually, it was
a time of real menace.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.520
You had actual communists
infiltrating the government.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.260
You had McCarthyism
and the Red Scare.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.200
You had the atomic race.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.250
In March, 1954, Puerto
Rican separatists burst

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.720
into the capitol
and shoot it up,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.640
and shoot five
members of the House.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.530
There are the bizarre
comic book hearings,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.350
where the US Senate is
blaming juvenile delinquency

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.120
on comic books.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.050
Any of you who
collect comic books--

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.980
and I'm guessing at Google,
it's probably a few--

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.572
the little Comics
Code Authority--

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:22.780
the little tag on the front
page of the comic books--

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.000
is a remnant of
that ridiculous era.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.720
So I thought it would be fun.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.920
I thought it would be just an
exciting time to write about.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.680
That's one level I
think about the book.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.940
Another level I think about
the book is Charlie Marder--

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.420
one of the two main characters--
comes to Washington to do good.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.190
And one of the first
things he tries to do

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.510
is to stop a company-- a
rubber and tire company that

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.240
made bad gas masks
during World War II--

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.280
stop them from getting
any federal money.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.230
And he finds out that
in order to do good,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.480
he needs to make compromises.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.800
And this is something that I've
just noticed in Washington DC,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.410
having lived there
now, basically,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.850
since the end of 1992--

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.374
which is really good people--

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:08.290
Democrats, and Republicans,
and Independents--

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.300
come to town to do good things.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.470
They want to do good.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.109
And a lot of them get trapped
in a cycle of compromise,

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.400
where they dip one foot into
the swamp and another foot

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.130
into the swamp.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.380
And the next thing they know,
they're up to their neck

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.254
in swamp and they don't
know how to get out.

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:25.670
So that was another
thing I wanted

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.460
to try to capture
in the book, is just

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.800
the idea of why it happens--

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.470
that so many good people
that you believe in,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.240
you look up and 10
years later, and you're

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.359
like, whatever happened to her
or whatever happened to him?

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.400
I used to think that that
person was pretty cool,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.730
and now they're not.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.521
Which is not to say
that there aren't still

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:45.290
a lot of really good
people in Congress.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.220
There are.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.036
The heroes of the
book are politicians

00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.910
and the villains of the
book are politicians,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.070
so they're both covered.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.520
And then, the last
thing is, in addition

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.540
to the swamp, the thing
that I think is resonant

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.490
for a lot of readers is--

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.570
and this was--

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.080
I started writing
this book years ago.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.600
And if you set a book
in 1954, and you're

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.789
going to have people--

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.080
characters-- interacting with
real people from the era,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.654
obviously Roy Cohn
and Joe McCarthy

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:16.070
are going to be obvious people
you're going to seize upon.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.311
I did not know at the time
that Roy Cohn's protégé,

00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:23.810
Donald Trump, was going to be
president of the United States

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.060
by the time the book came out.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.970
But it turns out there is this
connective tissue that Senator

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.790
McCarthy's protégé was Roy
Cohn, and Roy Cohn's protégé was

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.630
Donald Trump.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.040
That's nothing I invented.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.750
It just is a reality.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.630
And so diving into the 1950s
and reading about the time

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.540
of McCarthyism-- and
I don't want to--

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.510
Donald Trump and Joe McCarthy
are not the same person,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.050
and Trumpism and McCarthyism
are not the same thing.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.620
But the occurrence of a major
political figure using lying,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.180
and smearing, and
indecency as his method

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.150
of art in his political
warfare has happened before.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.910
And reading about people
and how political figures

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.140
acted or didn't act at the
time was very instructive.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.930
So some of the book--

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.400
not a lot of it--

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.080
I might have played
up a little bit,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.420
or I did play up a little
bit, because of the era

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.235
that we're in.

00:05:31.235 --> 00:05:33.110
But the rhyming-- you
know, they say, history

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.600
doesn't repeat
itself, but it rhymes.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.450
And the rhyming
was already there,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.090
and so there is some of that.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.492
I thought I'd read one
really quick scene to you.

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:45.950
I want to apologize
ahead of time--

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.750
especially to a Boston crowd--

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.120
because I am going to do
Robert Kennedy's voice.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.750
And I want you to know that I
don't think I do it very well,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.760
but I can't not do it.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.520
One of the thrills about writing
this book was the research.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.100
I know I'm in a room full of
people who like to do research.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.570
And last year, I did an event
for the 100th anniversary

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.520
of the birth of John F. Kennedy.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.800
And I met Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.850
who is Robert
Kennedy's oldest child.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.150
And I was doing-- you know, I
was in the thick of research.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.670
And actually, I had
read in several books

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.660
that her godfather was Joe
McCarthy, because the Kennedys

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.270
and Joe McCarthy
were very close.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.596
So I fact checked it with her.

00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:40.970
And she said, no,
it wasn't true,

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.340
but they were very close--
the families were very close.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.320
And I asked her why, because Joe
McCarthy was a horrible person.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.930
And she said it was very tribal
because they were all Irish,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.770
and the '40s and
the '50s were still

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.160
a period where the Irish
were looked down upon.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.210
And no matter how much
the Kennedys achieved,

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.450
the Boston Brahmins still
looked down their noses

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.560
at the Kennedys.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.684
And so they bonded that way.

00:07:08.684 --> 00:07:10.100
Then another time,
I was reading--

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.766
when I was doing
research for the book--

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:15.080
I was reading a Ted Sorensen
biography of John F. Kennedy.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.700
And Sorensen kept referring
to Robert Kennedy as Bob--

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.850
Bob Kennedy-- which I had
never heard before in my life,

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.610
and I'm something of
a student of history.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.980
And so I emailed Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.720
did people call your dad Bob,
because I'm reading this book?

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.910
And she said, yeah, that's
what they called him.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.372
So I have a character in the
book correcting somebody.

00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:38.330
Nobody calls him Bobby.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.000
Anybody who knows
him calls him Bob.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.760
Now, I told this anecdote
at a publishing event

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.080
about a year ago, forgetting
that one of Robert Kennedy's

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.060
other kids was in the audience.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.560
He had, like, 100.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.080
And this one was Kerry
Kennedy Cuomo, I think.

00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:01.790
I was doing a presentation
for "The Hellfire Club."

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.880
She was doing a
presentation for a book that

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.130
was commemorating the 50th
anniversary of her father's

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.240
assassination.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.490
And she-- after I told that
story about Bob and Robert

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.310
and Bobby--

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.980
she went on stage
and corrected me.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.620
She said, it wasn't
necessarily true.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.430
People called him Bob.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.270
Some people called him Bobby.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.650
Some people called him senator.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.441
And I went up to her
afterwards and I said,

00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:23.110
you know, your oldest
sister is the one

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.490
who told me the Bob thing.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.450
And I'm an oldest
child in my family.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.720
And I know who has the
most credible information

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.450
in any family, and that
is the oldest child.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.480
We are the keepers of history.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.460
So anyway, I took
it as a good sign

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.870
that Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's
daughter came to one of my book

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.220
events in Washington DC.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.230
I took it as
official recognition

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.460
that I had it right.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.280
The oldest child is correct.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.200
So this is just a quick
scene just to give you

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:59.130
a taste of the
book, where Charlie

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.120
is at a fancy party at the
Mayflower Hotel in Washington

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.140
being thrown by Conrad Hilton
after Congress passed a bill

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.690
to let cheap Mexican
labor come over the border

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.600
more easily, which they actually
did that actual day-- or that

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.610
actual week.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.100
And Charlie goes,
and he and Roy Cohn

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.080
start getting into a fight--

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.870
an argument.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.900
Roy Cohn is such a fun character
to write because you could just

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.760
make him be really
smart and just the worst

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.240
person in the world, except
for possibly Joe McCarthy.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.360
So anyway, at this
point, Robert Kennedy--

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.530
Bob Kennedy-- walks in and tries
to settle the two because they

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.020
seem to be squaring off.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.690
And again, I apologize
for my Kennedy accent.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.150
""Evening Roy,' Bob Kennedy
said, approaching them.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.537
Recognizing Charlie,
he said, 'Congressman.'

00:09:46.537 --> 00:09:49.120
'Charlie Marder,' Charlie said,
not sure if Kennedy remembered

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.230
his name.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.790
In Washington,
Charlie had noticed

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.150
people tended to avoid names
in case they got them wrong.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.190
They tended to say,
nice to see you,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.480
instead of nice to meet you, in
case they had met you before.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.150
New social rules
for an egoistic town

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.650
where every monument
and street was

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.366
named for their predecessors.

00:10:07.366 --> 00:10:08.740
'Right, of course,'
said Kennedy.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.486
'We met you and your lovely
wife at Martin's Tavern.

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:14.110
I just heard you're working with
Estes on the upcoming juvenile

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.090
delinquency hearings.'

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.830
Cohn choked on his drink.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.630
It turned out he was laughing.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.180
'You're part of those bullshit
comic book hearings,' he

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.040
guffawed dramatically.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.560
Kennedy grinned and looked
at Charlie apologetically.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.090
Charlie was not
particularly amused.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.390
He'd had enough of Cohn's
abrasive company by now.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.910
'You were asking me about the
commie symps in this room,

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.230
congressman,' Cohn said.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.830
'Well, they worry me more
than Wonder Woman does.'

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.210
He took another
swig of his drink

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.419
and stared out the window.

00:10:41.419 --> 00:10:43.960
'But none of them concern me as
much as the commie symps over

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.660
there in that big white
building,' motioning with his

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.250
chin toward the White House.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.740
'What must the world look
like from that address?

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.710
It must look upside down.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.120
Goddamn Ike protects the
commies and screws with Senator

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.270
McCarthy.'

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.560
Cohn looked at Kennedy.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.920
'He's terrified Joe will
run for president, you know.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.320
Joe could beat him, too.'

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.080
'Joe McCarthy could beat
President Eisenhower?' asked

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.230
Charlie incredulously. 'Beat
the smartest general we've had

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.520
since Sherman?'

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.140
'Smart?' said Cohn.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.440
'MacArthur called Ike the
best clerk he ever had.'

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.810
'And Ike said he studied
drama under General MacArthur

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.250
for four years.'

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.180
Kennedy chuckled.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.470
'Now, gentlemen.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.410
MacArthur-- MacArthur,'
said Charlie sarcastically,

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.200
pretending to search the skies
for a reminder of the general,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.080
so ignominiously fired by
Truman three years earlier.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.610
'The name rings a bell.'

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.590
'MacArthur's a great man,
a patriot,' said Cohn.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.290
'I'm sure you have a medal of
honor under your shirt there?'

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.460
'No,' said Charlie,
'just some shrapnel.'

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.200
He finished the
rest of his drink.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.830
'Nothing like your paper cuts
from the Battle of Torts 101.'

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.930
An awkward silence
hung like a noose.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.120
Charlie had surprised even
himself with that one.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.070
Liquid courage, he supposed.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.630
Kennedy tried to
break the tension.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.330
'Why do you think Joe would
be a good president, Roy?'

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.160
'If Joe were
president,' Cohn said,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.715
'the first thing he would do
would be to end the Cold War.

00:11:59.715 --> 00:12:01.840
He'd pick up the phone and
call Joe Stalin and say,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.924
this is Joe McCarthy.

00:12:02.924 --> 00:12:04.840
I'm coming over tomorrow
to talk about things.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.207
Meet me at the Moscow
airport at 1 o'clock.

00:12:07.207 --> 00:12:09.040
When he arrived in
Moscow, he would sit down

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.660
with Stalin in a closed room.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.276
First, he'd tell a
couple dirty jokes.

00:12:12.276 --> 00:12:13.900
Then, he'd look Stalin
right in the eye

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.720
and say, Joe, what do you want?

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.220
And Stalin would tell him.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.904
They would talk man to man,
not like pansy diplomats.

00:12:20.904 --> 00:12:22.570
They'd find out what
each of them wanted

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.220
and settle their differences.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.845
But when Joe left,
he'd tell Stalin,

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:27.970
the first time I catch you
breaking this agreement,

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.060
I'll blow you and your whole
goddamn country off the map.'

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.560
Charlie turned to Kennedy.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.250
'He can't honestly believe
this rubbish, can't he?'"

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.350
So one of the things
about that scene that I

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.010
like is the entire paragraph
where Roy Cohn is explaining

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.180
why he thinks Joe McCarthy
would be a great president

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.540
is an actual paragraph, except
it wasn't said by Roy Cohn.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.170
It was said by Joe
McCarthy's campaign manager--

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.240
a guy named Urban Van Susteren--

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.510
who would go on to have a
daughter named Greta Van

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.340
Susteren.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.840
And it really gets to the
fact that some of this stuff--

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.050
the truth in the book-- is
often stranger than the fiction.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.040
That paragraph reminded
me so much of the pitch

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.317
that we would hear
on the campaign trail

00:13:14.317 --> 00:13:16.150
about why Trump would
be a great negotiator.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.441
He'd go into a room with Putin.

00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:18.790
He'd do this-- blah, blah, blah.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.537
And you know, like I said,
history doesn't repeat itself,

00:13:21.537 --> 00:13:22.120
but it rhymes.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.650
And I heard a lot of rhyming.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.750
And one of the fun
things about this book--

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.540
and it's actually one of the
reasons why I included about 10

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.450
or 15 pages of endnotes
at the end of it--

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.102
is because there's so many
weird details that are real,

00:13:34.102 --> 00:13:36.310
I wanted people to know that
I didn't make it all up.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.282
Like, a lot of it
actually happened.

00:13:38.282 --> 00:13:39.990
There's important
stuff, and then there's

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.890
strange little color,
like when Eisenhower--

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.150
I'm sorry, when McCarthy would
drink, which he did a lot,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.690
he would also eat
a stick of butter.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.930
He would just order a stick of
butter and eat it with a fork.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.667
And I thought it was so
strange, I put it in there.

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:58.000
But I said, people are going
to think that, oh, it's too

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.320
weird-- that I made that up.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.470
And then, so I put in a
whole endnote section,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.450
which is also probably
the researcher

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.510
nerd in me showing
off a little, perhaps.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.550
Anyway, so that's
"The Hellfire Club."

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.481
And it's doing OK.

00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:14.980
We're going to debut on "The
New York Times" bestseller list

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.630
this Sunday at number three.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.322
And we've been selling
a lot of books.

00:14:20.322 --> 00:14:22.030
And I've been going
all over the country.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.404
And it's really
great to be here.

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:26.000
And I'm happy to take
any questions you have.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.910
And I recognize that
they might not all

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.474
be about the book,
which is fine.

00:14:31.474 --> 00:14:33.015
But I do hope you
check out the book.

00:14:33.015 --> 00:14:34.870
So thank you so much

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:41.400
So should I sit here?

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.185
OK, cool.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.000
SPEAKER: So I'll just
kick off the conversation.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.320
I was really interested
in your choice

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.340
to write a fiction novel at
this time in our history,

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.720
when I think a
lot of journalists

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.210
are publishing memoirs
right now, publishing

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.740
a lot of non-fiction.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.020
And given the
parallels between what

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.660
happened in the
McCarthy era and today,

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.760
did you feel that fiction
was a really good way

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.940
to sort of explore things
more allegorically as

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.670
opposed to writing a
work of non-fiction?

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.220
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah, well,
there are a few reasons,

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.490
because we're complicated people
and we don't only do things

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.020
for one reason, right?

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.450
But one of them
was the last book

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.490
I wrote was called
"The Outpost--

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.880
An Untold Story of
American Valor."

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.650
It was a true story about one
combat outpost in Afghanistan,

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.890
and its whole 3.5 year history,
and then the deadliest battle

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.200
for the US in 2009.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.530
And to be completely candid,
it was a very wrenching

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.780
experience, writing that book.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.550
I did more than 200 interviews.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.190
I traveled to Afghanistan twice.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.840
I spent a lot of time
talking to people

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.170
who had sacrificed a great deal,
including loved ones and limbs.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.842
And while certainly,
what I went through

00:15:58.842 --> 00:16:00.800
was nothing compared to
what they went through,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.690
it was very emotionally taxing.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.540
So I was looking for a
project that would be fun.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.700
That project was important,
but it wasn't fun.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.700
But then, yes, you're
absolutely onto something.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.530
I think that I was
able to make arguments

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:18.440
I wanted to make about, not
just about indecency and lies--

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.360
the kind that we're
experiencing now

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.710
on a daily basis from
the White House--

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:27.230
but also compromise,
also the importance

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.160
of standing up for
what you believe in

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.440
in an allegorical way.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.230
I think that if I had tried
to do it in a non-fiction way,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.040
it would not have worked.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.570
But doing it in a way that
was combined with a thriller

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.710
and fun flight of
fancy elements--

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:48.215
that that might make more
sense and be more effective.

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:50.498
SPEAKER: Do folks in the
audience have questions?

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.275
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:57.990
So my question is
about lying, actually.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.790
And I appreciate that you--

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.680
I've noticed you call out
people you're interviewing

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.369
if they're obviously lying,
or if they're repeating lies,

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:06.569
or that kind of thing.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.300
And I'm wondering if you
think, with your experience,

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.010
that we may get back
to a point where

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.172
people aren't lying as much,
or if this is sort of normal?

00:17:14.172 --> 00:17:15.630
And I'm also
interested in sort of,

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.099
as a journalist, when you know
something is a lie, like just

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:22.140
how are you striking that
balance when something

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.520
is clearly a lie?

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.680
JAKE TAPPER: So
everywhere I go, everybody

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.760
wants to know whether
or not we're ever

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.884
going to go back to normal.

00:17:27.884 --> 00:17:28.990
And I don't know.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.540
I hope so.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.780
I mean, right now, we're in
a period where in the last 24

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.760
hours, somebody went
on "Fox Business News,"

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.110
and attacked John McCain--

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.010
called him Songbird
John, and basically

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.349
smeared his war record.

00:17:45.349 --> 00:17:46.890
And then, somebody
at the White House

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.850
was making fun of the
fact that he was dying.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.280
You know, I can't
even imagine that.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.040
I mean, I remember
covering the 2000 campaign

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.530
when John McCain got
smeared in South Carolina,

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.620
but at least that was
like shadowy groups

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.720
without ties to--

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.510
direct ties to George W. Bush
and his opponents at the time.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.370
This is like people
just saying things.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.864
So we're in a time of
lies and indecency.

00:18:10.864 --> 00:18:13.030
And I see them as part and
parcel of the same thing,

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.260
because it all has to do with
we don't care about standards.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.100
And I hope we get back to it.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.410
I worry.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.880
I really do.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.524
In terms of calling out lies,
or untruths, or falsehoods,

00:18:25.524 --> 00:18:26.940
or whatever you
want to call them,

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.920
I mean, a lie means
you know it's false

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.320
and you're saying it anyway.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.610
And I try to be more
selective about the use of lie

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:42.000
versus falsehood in terms
of what I can assert.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.670
But if President Trump
says something wrong,

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.620
and then after it's
been pointed out

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.370
that it's wrong, he continues
to say it, at that point,

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:50.640
I think it's a lie.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.259
Maybe the first time, he
misunderstood or he misspoke.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.800
And I just think we
just need to call

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.860
these things what
they are because we

00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.850
can't normalize this.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.490
We can't normalize making
fun of the disabled,

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.740
or making light of people's
drug and alcohol problems,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.080
or the demonization
of minorities.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.770
It's just not acceptable.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.700
And that's not to say that
he's wrong on immigration,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.467
or he's wrong on trade,
or he's wrong on--

00:19:14.467 --> 00:19:16.050
I mean, those are
issues and we should

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.700
have those policy debates.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.490
But the indecency
and the lies just--

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.061
if news anchors aren't willing
to say what they are, who is?

00:19:25.061 --> 00:19:25.560
Right?

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.726
We're supposed to be the
arbiters of fact and truth.

00:19:27.726 --> 00:19:29.732
And if we can't say,
that's not true,

00:19:29.732 --> 00:19:31.440
then I don't know what
we're doing there.

00:19:34.954 --> 00:19:36.620
AUDIENCE: You might
have heard last week

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.430
that there's a new Google
News app that was announced.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.160
Quite a few people in
this room worked on that

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.500
and continue to work on it.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.700
If you had a lot
of people and a lot

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.370
of resources in
terms of technology,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.772
what would you build?

00:19:52.772 --> 00:19:54.120
JAKE TAPPER: Oh, God.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.780
It's such a tough-- you know,
I was talking to [? Sanders ?]

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.970
about this before, because
one of the things--

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.090
I mean, I use Google
News all the time.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:01.990
I mean, all the time.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.840
I could not do my
job without Google.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.670
And in fact, by the
way, one of the reasons

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.570
I set my book in 1954-- not the
main reason, by any stretch,

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.290
but one of the reasons
why I set it in 1954--

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:20.440
is because every plot of every
movie or book that we know

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.097
and love inevitably would
become ruined if it was set now,

00:20:24.097 --> 00:20:25.930
because it's just like,
well, why didn't you

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.250
just Google it and realize
that every city he's been to

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.980
has had a rash of
serial murders?

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.580
Why didn't you just call her?

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.170
And then, I started noticing
that a lot of movies

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.540
now, people are in the
middle of the desert

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.460
and they don't have cell
service, because cell

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.270
phones and Google ruin plots.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.530
So anyway, I use Google News.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.639
You know, I have to find
out more about this app.

00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:52.180
I mean, I've heard about it,
but I've been on this book tour,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.820
so I haven't had the
time to plunge in.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.680
I think one of the
problems-- and I

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.060
don't know that
this is something

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.310
that you guys can come up
with or what you can solve--

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.860
but there's so much
fake news out there.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.820
There's so many lies out there.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:09.880
And it's not just by
truepundit.com or whatever.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.530
Some of them are by Breitbart
or agenda-driven publications.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.710
And I don't know how Facebook
or Google or anyone--

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.720
how you make a decision
about what is news

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.470
and what is not news.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.830
But since we're
talking theoretically,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:29.800
in my own perfect universe, I
would have some sort of method

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.730
to help consumers, without
any sort of political agenda

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.980
or political bias, a way
to discern what's real

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.130
and what's not.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.310
But I don't think that
you guys can do that.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.820
This is in a perfect world.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.610
This is a utopian idea.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.967
And I recognize the
slippery slope of, well,

00:21:44.967 --> 00:21:47.050
if you say this about this
news organization, what

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.280
about this news organization?

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.126
Or if these people are purposely
wrong about this story, what

00:21:51.126 --> 00:21:53.500
about this time that "The New
York Times," or "NBC News,"

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.880
or whatever got something
accidentally wrong, et cetera.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.470
So I realize it's a very
difficult challenge.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.497
And that probably didn't
answer your question.

00:22:01.497 --> 00:22:02.830
I'll think about it more though.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.580
AUDIENCE: That's pretty close.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.640
JAKE TAPPER: OK, thanks.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.030
AUDIENCE: Let's say,
10 years from now,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.575
you decide to write
a novel about today.

00:22:12.575 --> 00:22:14.950
I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about what

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.430
the protagonist would
be like in your novel.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.097
JAKE TAPPER: Well, I mean,
honestly, I don't think

00:22:21.097 --> 00:22:22.180
that "The Hellfire Club"--

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.770
I mean, if you
read it, you'll see

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.670
that there's a lot in the
book about the choices

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.700
that people are facing
today, except it's just

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.310
framed in the 1950s.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.580
If you read about
the 1950s, you'll

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.039
see that there were
heroes at the time.

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:42.580
One of my heroes-- now that I've
done research on this book--

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.200
is a woman, Margaret
Chase Smith.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.542
She was a senator from Maine.

00:22:45.542 --> 00:22:47.500
First woman elected to
the House and the Senate

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.150
in her own right.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.520
In 1950, she went to
the floor of the Senate

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.330
and gave her declaration of
conscience speech, in which she

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.870
condemned McCarthyism in 1950,
when he was just starting

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.240
to become popular and powerful.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.110
Edward R. Murrow, who
is a hero of mine,

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.710
he didn't go after
McCarthy until 1954.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.160
And the US Senate didn't censure
him till the end of 1954.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.070
So she was years ahead.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.700
One of the things when you read
about that era that you see

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.040
is that there were a lot
of people who failed.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.810
The Kennedys failed,
quite frankly,

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.720
and I'm a student
of the Kennedys.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.330
But Robert Kennedy was the
chief democratic counsel

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.680
on the McCarthy committee.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.299
John F. Kennedy was
pretty AWOL when

00:23:28.299 --> 00:23:29.590
it came to condemning McCarthy.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.010
More importantly, McCarthy's
fellow Republicans failed.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.220
Senator Bob Taft, who ran
for president in 1952,

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.400
lost to Eisenhower-- lost
the nomination to Eisenhower.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.590
But the Senate went
into Republican hands,

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.630
and Taft became the
majority leader.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.120
I'm sure that Senator Taft
thought that his agenda--

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.450
his legacy would be that he's
Mr. Conservative, that he stood

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.860
up for these
conservative values,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.984
that he represented something
important in American

00:23:55.984 --> 00:23:58.400
foreign policy and
American domestic policy.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.500
But at the end of the day,
he died suddenly in 1953.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.130
And a big part of his legacy is
he didn't stand up to McCarthy.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.930
And if I were a
member of Congress,

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.980
I would think about Bob
Taft every day of the year--

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.010
every day-- and think--

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.010
we all like to think that
our legacies are going

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.343
to be like our achievements,
but the truth of the matter

00:24:17.343 --> 00:24:19.450
is our legacy and
how we're remembered

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.980
is often dictated
by the moral choices

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.140
that we make, or fail to make.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.560
And so I don't think I need to
write a book about the Trump

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:35.611
era because I think what I've
written is resonant enough.

00:24:35.611 --> 00:24:36.360
But you know what?

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.040
Maybe my son will
write it in 50 years,

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.410
and you can say that
it was your idea

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.350
and try to get a
share of the profits.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.750
SPEAKER: I want to take one
of our online questions now.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.090
This one is on immigration.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.790
"I feel media always
tends to discuss more

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.272
about undocumented immigrants,
with whom I sympathize,

00:24:54.272 --> 00:24:55.980
and ignore the plight
of legal immigrants

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.990
who have to get through
hellish restrictions.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.630
Do you see a change in future
where legal immigrants would

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.000
be considered for discussion
in media and elsewhere?"

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.708
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:25:04.708 --> 00:25:06.870
I mean, I think the reason
that the media focuses

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.570
on illegal immigrants, or
undocumented immigrants,

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:14.225
is because they are the ones
that are being threatened-- you

00:25:14.225 --> 00:25:16.350
know, rounded up in ICE
raids, and being threatened

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.180
with expulsion, et cetera.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.400
We do have legal
immigrants on our shows

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.590
all the time, not because
they're legal immigrants,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.660
but because they just happen
to be incredibly talented

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.826
and it turns out they're
legal immigrants-- like Ana

00:25:26.826 --> 00:25:30.210
Navarro, who is from
Nicaragua, is a good example.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.170
But I think the
debate is largely

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.540
about illegal immigration.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.670
Although the immigration
bill that Cotton and Perdue

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:46.800
introduced-- which would have a
big effect on legal immigration

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.796
if that bill ever were to
become seriously considered,

00:25:49.796 --> 00:25:51.420
which I don't think
it would as of now,

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.809
not with this Senate and the
Democrats able to block it--

00:25:53.809 --> 00:25:56.100
I think there would be a lot
more discussion and debate

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.440
about legal immigration.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.170
Unfortunately, we
have to make choices.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.880
And the people in the media
tend to go to the bigger story

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.160
and can't always
focus on everything.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.370
AUDIENCE: So sort of related to
your comments about fake news,

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.979
a lot of people often
just receive news

00:26:17.979 --> 00:26:19.770
from a single source
or from their friends,

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:20.770
which may not be fake.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.103
It might be good news, but
it might also be consistently

00:26:23.103 --> 00:26:25.650
from one point of view.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.530
Do you have any
suggestions for how

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.070
people could be broken out
of their ideological echo

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.642
chambers?

00:26:32.642 --> 00:26:34.100
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah,
and I'm a huge--

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.540
I follow more than--

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.170
not to bring up a
competitor-- but I

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.270
follow more than 5,000
people on Twitter.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.010
And one of the great
things about it

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.340
is I try to get as many
divergent viewpoints as

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.910
possible.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.714
And I completely agree with--

00:26:46.714 --> 00:26:48.630
look, I was the kid in
high school and college

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.838
that would go to the library.

00:26:49.838 --> 00:26:51.570
And I would read "The
Nation," and then I

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.910
would read the
"National Review."

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.630
I was always trying to get news
from different perspectives.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.299
And my friends in DC--

00:27:00.299 --> 00:27:02.340
some of them are very,
very liberal, some of them

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.380
are very, very conservative.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.990
And as somebody who is generally
fairly politically agnostic

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:15.010
in my personal views, which
is actually kind of a relief,

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.150
it's a pleasure for me
to try to open my eyes

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.190
and see how the world
looks to everyone.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.660
Now, sometimes, the world looks
to some people rooted like it's

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.070
not actually this world.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.810
It's actually some
other world where

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.060
there's a whole other set
of facts, that on this world

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.890
are actually not true.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.920
So I tend to avoid those
websites and those channels.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.330
But I think that it's-- and I'm
giving a commencement address

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.620
at UMass Amherst later today.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.453
And one of the things
I'm going to be saying

00:27:42.453 --> 00:27:45.780
is expose yourself to as
many different points of view

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.230
as possible because that's
how you enrich your knowledge.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.140
And not just in terms of
liberal versus conservative,

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.890
but also in terms of
military versus nonmilitary,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.150
or what does the world
look like from Yemen,

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.550
what does the world look
like from the point of view

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.400
of somebody who is deeply
religious-- whether Baptist,

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.450
or Muslim, or Jewish.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.190
I mean, to expose yourself to
all different points of view,

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.300
I think, is so important.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.230
It's a big part of what
you guys do, I know.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.480
And it's a big part
of what I do too.

00:28:18.387 --> 00:28:20.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you for being
here with us this morning.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.480
We appreciate you
spending some time.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.160
I do have a question, but I
just want to get everything

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.860
on the table first.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.360
JAKE TAPPER: Uh oh.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.070
AUDIENCE: --which is to say that
we know you're an Eagles fan.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.028
JAKE TAPPER: I'm sorry.

00:28:28.028 --> 00:28:29.650
I knew it was going to come up.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:30.980
Isn't it enough, the Celtics?

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.550
That's not enough?

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we're
happy with the Celtics.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.320
And I'm going to be mature
and say congratulations.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.070
JAKE TAPPER: Well,
congratulations to you.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.230
You guys almost swept us.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.480
I mean, you know,
that's painful for me.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.250
I mean, I grew up in the
'80s when you guys had

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.220
the master team of Larry Bird.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.650
So I'm sorry.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.400
Look, we don't win a
lot of championships.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.250
AUDIENCE: And we're spoiled.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.800
I get it.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.716
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah, how
many rings do you need,

00:28:51.716 --> 00:28:52.560
for God's sake?

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.315
AUDIENCE: No, they earned it.

00:28:54.315 --> 00:28:56.440
JAKE TAPPER: I'm sorry, I
got a little carried away

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.398
during football season.

00:28:57.398 --> 00:28:57.980
I admit it.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.977
I'm sorry.

00:28:58.977 --> 00:29:01.060
AUDIENCE: I won't bring
up the disparaging remarks

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:01.851
about the Patriots.

00:29:01.851 --> 00:29:04.030
JAKE TAPPER: Please don't,
because I actually heard

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.020
from Robert Kraft about them.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.524
So I get it.

00:29:07.524 --> 00:29:08.440
I got a little heated.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.700
I got a little excited.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.840
You know, I don't know what
it is about Philadelphia--

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.144
because Boston people don't
seem to have this issue--

00:29:16.144 --> 00:29:17.560
but we have chips
on our shoulder.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.390
And we feel like
we're underdogs, even

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.950
compared to Boston,
even though we're

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:22.420
a bigger city than Boston.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.490
So I don't understand
it, but you guys

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.780
seem to handle your non-New
York, LA status much better

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.100
than we do.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.230
I can't explain it.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.880
AUDIENCE: Well, it was a
little different before 2004.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.861
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah.

00:29:34.861 --> 00:29:36.110
AUDIENCE: But my question is--

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.610
so you talked a
little bit about how

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.820
the DC you write
about in the book

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.940
is maybe not that different
than the DC we see today.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.830
And I think a lot
of us, regardless

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.380
of political leaning,
feel pretty fed up,

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.497
and in some ways, at a little
bit of a loss about what to do.

00:29:51.497 --> 00:29:53.080
And we hear a lot
of talk about, well,

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.640
if you really want to
make a difference, run

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.600
for local office.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.530
And that makes sense.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.404
And some people are in
a position to do that,

00:29:58.404 --> 00:30:00.452
and many of us maybe are not.

00:30:00.452 --> 00:30:02.410
So I guess I'm wondering
if you have one or two

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.451
pieces of advice-- sort
of the first things you'd

00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:06.820
say to an everyday
engaged citizen about what

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.555
steps to take.

00:30:08.555 --> 00:30:09.430
JAKE TAPPER: Wow, OK.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.910
So that's a really
good question.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:16.210
The truth of the matter is, is
that the best thing you can do

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.910
is support candidates
that you believe in.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:24.220
And if it's local candidates,
then you can knock on doors

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.340
and make phone calls.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:33.746
And if it's candidates in other
states, you can send money.

00:30:33.746 --> 00:30:37.120
Or also there are ways to
either travel to knock on doors

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.270
or make phone calls, also.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.880
Although, you know, generally
those kinds of things

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.000
are better coming from in state.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.170
But, you know, I
think that Washington

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.780
is better in some ways
than it was in the 1950s.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.660
Because of the post-Watergate
reforms, we know more.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.790
Believe it or not, the
media is much better now

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.590
than the media was in the 1950s.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.740
The media covered up all sorts
of stuff for people in power.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.612
And we know things.

00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:05.320
Somebody asked me the
other day about how

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.910
would a journalist in the
1950s cover Scott Pruitt.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.040
We wouldn't even know
about Scott Pruitt.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.230
We wouldn't know
any of that stuff.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.500
And there wouldn't be reporters
covering it as aggressively.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.660
If you go back and
read newspapers from

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.962
the '50s-- and I
did for this book--

00:31:21.962 --> 00:31:23.920
there was a lot of great
journalism being done,

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.050
but it is much more
aggressive today.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.030
So things, I think, are
better in many ways.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.070
There's a lot more money today.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.300
And that makes it worse.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.190
But on balance, I would say
we're probably a little better

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.890
off.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.490
But I honestly think that the
best thing that people can do

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.290
is find candidates
who you believe in.

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:47.770
And also, I don't think--

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.270
I mean, if you're
a Democrat, great.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.920
If you're a Republican, great.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.910
But I think that people should
scratch beneath the surface

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.980
beyond just party labels.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.640
It's important that there be
reformers in both parties.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.380
It's important that
there be people

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:09.390
in both parties who are willing
to stand up for certain values.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.219
There's a guy named--

00:32:11.219 --> 00:32:13.510
well, I probably shouldn't
name individual politicians,

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.360
but let me just say that there
are Democrats and Republicans

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.260
in Washington who I
see legitimately raging

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.720
against the machine and
really actually trying

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.430
to do good and stand
up for what is right.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.720
And I think it's important
to have both parties have

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.770
that kind of pressure.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:34.090
So if you are not necessarily
the most partisan person

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.401
in the world, I would argue,
look at the other party

00:32:37.401 --> 00:32:39.400
and see if there are
people from the other party

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.320
that you can support
in the primary.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.214
So even if-- and also
there are certain districts

00:32:45.214 --> 00:32:46.880
that are never going
to elect a Democrat

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.980
and certain districts
that are never

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.450
going to elect a Republican.

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:52.000
There's nothing wrong
with, theoretically,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.520
finding the best person from
the party that's definitely

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.781
going to win and
supporting that party

00:32:56.781 --> 00:32:58.780
and supporting that person,
even if you disagree

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.470
with them on issue x, y, and z.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:02.391
That's just my view.

00:33:02.391 --> 00:33:03.640
Look, it's easy for me to say.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.160
I don't give money to anybody
because I'm a journalist.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.320
But I mean, I just think
that a lot of times

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.690
I don't look at the world and--

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.800
people who live in Washington
and political journalists

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.820
see that partisanship
is important

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.070
and the parties are different.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.750
And I'm not disputing
any of that,

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:25.270
but there are also other
ways to split up the town.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.550
And one of them is people
who want to reform it

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:31.510
and people who like how
it is, because the status

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.494
quo is fine with them.

00:33:33.494 --> 00:33:35.410
Can I say one other thing
about your question?

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:41.110
Which is, it is tougher to
challenge yourself and get out

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.910
of your ideological--
not you-- but get out

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.060
of one's ideological bubble.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.480
Right now, we are in a
period where people go home

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.330
and they put on their team
jerseys and watch cable news.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.660
And they want to have
their beliefs reaffirmed.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.640
And I see things
on both of our--

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.990
look, I'm biased
because I'm with CNN,

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.410
but I see things on
both channels that

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.680
are our main competitors,
Fox and MS, that I think,

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.080
that's really not
telling the whole story.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.810
Sometimes I watch MSNBC
or see something on MSNBC

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.609
and I think, boy,
they make it sound

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:15.400
like President Trump's
about to be arrested

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.840
in like the next five minutes.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.120
And then on Fox,
there's no Russian--

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.120
what Russian investigation?

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.840
So I mean, I think breaking
free of those bubbles

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.610
is very important, even though
it's more difficult to do that.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.150
Sorry.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:31.960
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.929
Thanks for being here.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:35.320
So I wanted to talk a little bit
about the kind of terminology

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:35.820
that we use.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.770
Like, for instance,
I'm a big fan

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:41.860
of liberal democratic
values, but more so

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.739
in the Thomas Jefferson sense
than the Elizabeth Warren

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.510
sense.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:52.300
So as far as lower case
liberal democratic principles,

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:57.580
what do you see the media's
role as in promoting, defending,

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.020
championing those
values, or being

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.380
neutral about them relative
to maybe illiberal values

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.310
or undemocratic?

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.740
JAKE TAPPER: Well,
why don't you tell us?

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.030
How would you define lowercase
l liberal and lowercase d

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.170
democratic values?

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:11.890
How would you?

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.920
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.190
So I'll borrow the
definition from Yascha Mounk,

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.790
who was here a couple months
ago giving a similar talk.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.920
Which is, liberalism in the
sense of civil liberties,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:28.000
standing up for the voice and
the rights of minority groups

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.230
or marginalized
groups in society,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:37.150
and democracy being the will
of the people translated

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.810
through some process or
representation in government.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:42.740
And these can be at odds, right?

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.460
But for instance, if the
majority of the people

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.770
decide that, yes, we need
to strip this minority

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.140
group of certain rights
or certain voting

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.950
rights or their voice,
there's some tension there.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.450
But together, it seems like
that's the magical package,

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:57.950
that when America
throughout history

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.680
is operating at its best, we
find a good balance of that.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.820
But at times, we get off balance
and off kilter about that.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.540
So I'm curious about those
combined values which

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.510
don't always
naturally go together,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:14.680
do you see the media as having
a role with those values

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.040
and promoting them or being
more neutral about them,

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.160
like the media ideally should
be neutral about partisan

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.910
political policy issues?

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:23.980
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah, that's
a challenging question.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.030
I mean, I think,
first of all, one

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.113
of the things that's at
the heart of your question

00:36:27.113 --> 00:36:30.640
is the idea that we should
be covering individual issues

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.220
on their merits and not--

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.945
without the partisan divide
necessarily as the only prism

00:36:35.945 --> 00:36:36.820
through which we see.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.194
I mean, so for
instance, if we're

00:36:38.194 --> 00:36:44.050
talking about NSA
wiretapping, or drone strikes,

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.850
or whatever, we
should just be talking

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.590
about that in terms
of the efficacy

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.834
and the morality of it.

00:36:49.834 --> 00:36:51.250
And I think the
best way we can do

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:55.690
that is by having intellectually
honest guests to discuss them.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:58.529
And sometimes it's, in
Washington, not always

00:36:58.529 --> 00:37:00.070
the easiest thing
in the world to do,

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.486
because people tend to see
things through partisan lenses.

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:06.754
But for instance, Senator
Chris Murphy of Connecticut,

00:37:06.754 --> 00:37:08.170
who is a pretty
partisan Democrat,

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.480
but he was very critical
of the Obama administration

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.494
for its role in--

00:37:12.494 --> 00:37:14.410
this is not a domestic
issue, but for its role

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:20.410
in the war in Yemen, the
proxy war between Saudi Arabia

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:22.450
and Iran that's going
on in Yemen right now.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.540
And having him on-- whenever
there's somebody who is just

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.080
refreshingly candid, and honest,
and open about a debate about

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.910
a principle--

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.590
Senator Tim Kaine
was like that when

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.650
it came to the authorization
for use of military force.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:37.912
I think it's just important
to run to those voices

00:37:37.912 --> 00:37:39.370
so that people can
see these issues

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.440
through non-partisan lenses.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.780
In terms of the
positions we take,

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.480
I don't know that it's my job
to say the United States should

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.510
not be doing this.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.550
The United States should
not be doing that.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.650
I think that there are
certain lines we can draw,

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.900
but really it's much
more my job to have

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.775
on people to have
discussions about these

00:37:54.775 --> 00:37:58.210
and to make sure that these
discussions are rooted in facts

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:04.660
and truth, and where people
can make their arguments one

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.720
way or the other.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.750
I don't necessarily--
unless it's stark,

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.880
I don't think it helps
the viewer for me to say,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.530
well, this is unconstitutional.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.992
That's not for me to say if
there's a debate about it.

00:38:14.992 --> 00:38:15.700
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.804
JAKE TAPPER: Thanks.

00:38:17.804 --> 00:38:18.970
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.760
So getting back to the parallels
between Trump and McCarthy,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.820
McCarthy eventually reached
a point where he went too far

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.550
and the party abandoned
him and he was censured.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.340
Can you foresee any
sort of similar scenario

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.380
where something similar
happens with Trump,

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.570
or do you think it's as
straightforward as, as long

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.370
as the base supports
him the Republican

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.294
Party is going to fall in line?

00:38:39.294 --> 00:38:40.960
JAKE TAPPER: It's a
lot more complicated

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.985
than that, because first of
all, he's the president and not

00:38:42.985 --> 00:38:43.960
a Wisconsin senator.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.450
Second of all,
he's signing bills

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.190
that the Republicans
want him to sign,

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:52.270
and he's doing things that
some of them, I think,

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.470
have his support.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.200
If he succeeds to
any degree in North

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.660
Korea and the Korean peninsula,
that will be a great thing.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.434
But in terms of just the decency
and the lies, I don't know.

00:39:03.434 --> 00:39:05.350
And if I've learned
anything about predictions

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:06.730
with Donald Trump, it's
don't make predictions

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.810
about Donald Trump.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.410
But I do wonder,
if he were to fire

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.330
Mueller, what would happen?

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.050
Would that be a bridge too far?

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:18.550
I feel as though Speaker
Ryan and Leader McConnell

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.072
have made it clear,
privately and publicly,

00:39:21.072 --> 00:39:22.780
that they don't think
that should happen.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.714
I don't know what they
are willing to tolerate.

00:39:25.714 --> 00:39:27.880
And I don't know what
Republican members of Congress

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.280
are willing to tolerate.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.760
Having lived through and
covered the Clinton years,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.464
I find it unimaginable.

00:39:35.464 --> 00:39:36.380
I mean, if President--

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.320
I guess he couldn't have
fired Ken Starr because there

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.111
was an independent
counsel law at the time,

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:45.340
but behavior is being
tolerated now by Republicans

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.500
that they never would
have tolerated before.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.550
And in fact, every
day it's just a

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.140
here's what Rudy
Giuliani says now

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.460
and here's what he
said 20 years ago,

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.780
and it was the same
exact situation

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.870
except it was Bill Clinton.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.330
Here's what Mike Pence
says now, except here's

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.030
what he said two years ago
when it was Hillary Clinton.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.220
So the hypocrisy doesn't
seem to bother people

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.020
very much anymore.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.360
I don't know.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:07.960
I don't know.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.310
I don't know how
much farther we're

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.530
going to be tested as a
nation, in terms of the checks

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:12.071
and balances.

00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:18.970
So far everything, the American
institutions and the separation

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.220
of powers are still there.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.560
Mueller is still investigating.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.020
I don't know.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.690
If I had to pick
a bridge too far,

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.740
it would be possibly
firing Mueller,

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.090
but I honestly don't know.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.730
And if you go back and look at--

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:36.280
I mean, the Senate tolerated
a lot from Joe McCarthy.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:36.960
A lot.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.010
And you go back, he smeared
senators in the late '40s.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.350
I mean, there's
this bizarre-- it's

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.610
mentioned briefly in the book.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:50.500
There's this bizarre period in
American history, where there

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.210
was a massacre committed by
Nazis towards the end of World

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.330
War II.

00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:00.490
And then a lot of those
Nazis were captured,

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.820
and they went to a prisoner
of war camp in New Jersey.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.780
And interrogators, American
military interrogators,

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.360
were accused of being
too tough on these Nazis.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.110
They weren't torturing
them, but they were

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:15.880
accused of mistreating them.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.770
And at the time
in the late '40s,

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:22.870
there was a big movement by
German Americans to whitewash

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:25.300
what had happened
in World War II.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.820
And McCarthy was part of that.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.850
And he took over this committee
he wasn't even a member of,

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.220
that was investigating
the alleged mistreatment

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.910
of these Nazis, and basically
smeared the chairman, who

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.280
ended up retiring.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.290
And I have a character in the
book saying something like,

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:45.340
"Oh, I thought we'd all come
to our conclusions about Nazis

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:51.940
already," which was something
else that I added post-2016.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:55.840
So my only point is, the
US Senate tolerated a lot.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.610
He smeared war heroes.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:41:58.630
He smeared US senators.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:00.650
He smeared US senators.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:05.050
It was only after the
Army-McCarthy hearings

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:09.040
and some violation of Senate
rules that they took him on.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.274
But a lot of people had
been ruined by then.

00:42:12.274 --> 00:42:13.690
AUDIENCE: Brief
follow up on that.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.370
Do you think it was
more-- so after he

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:16.744
went after the
army, do you think

00:42:16.744 --> 00:42:19.660
it was the people
got tired of him,

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.920
the politicians followed suit?

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.600
Or do you think
it was politicians

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.026
displaying some leadership?

00:42:27.269 --> 00:42:29.560
JAKE TAPPER: One of the
reasons the book is set in 1954

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.934
is because he began that year
at the height of his power.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.520
There's a book by David Nichols
called "Ike Versus McCarthy"

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.230
that I used as a basis
for some of the plot

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.313
in the book, which is the
idea that Eisenhower was

00:42:43.313 --> 00:42:47.230
the whole time setting a plot,
setting a trap for McCarthy,

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:51.270
and the Army-McCarthy
hearings were part of that.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.070
Ultimately, I think
McCarthy gave them

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:58.690
an opening in the
Army-McCarthy hearings,

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.760
and the US Senate took it.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.640
But like I said, that
they tolerated a lot.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.340
George Marshall is a
hero of World War II.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.380
He's a hero of the post-war.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.000
And Joe McCarthy smeared him.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.130
He wrote a book about
him, just attacking him.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:21.340
And there was a
time in 1952, when

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.040
Eisenhower, who was so
sick of McCarthy doing this

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.900
to his friend and
mentor George Marshall,

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.150
that Eisenhower was going
to say something about it

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.360
during a campaign
appearance in Wisconsin.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.960
And McCarthy was
going to be onstage.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.340
And at the last minute,
the governor of Wisconsin

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:44.560
heard about it and convinced
Eisenhower to take it out

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.250
of his speech.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.625
And it was something
he regretted

00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:48.310
for the rest of his life.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.810
Although we have to give him
credit for going to Wisconsin,

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.310
I guess.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.580
Little Hillary Clinton
joke there, sorry.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.890
But in any case,
my only point is,

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.990
people are willing
to put up with a lot

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.550
until all of a
sudden they're not.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:07.850
I don't know where
this US Congress is.

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:11.390
SPEAKER: So I had a question
about the echoes of gun

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:17.060
violence that both pervade your
book and what's going on today.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.910
It really struck me
as reading the book,

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.765
this violence goes back all
the way through our history.

00:44:22.765 --> 00:44:23.540
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.000
SPEAKER: Just the anecdotes
about William Taulbee

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.085
earlier in the book.

00:44:27.085 --> 00:44:28.460
JAKE TAPPER: That's
a congressman

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.027
who killed a reporter.

00:44:31.027 --> 00:44:31.610
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.569
And you think about
that in the context.

00:44:33.569 --> 00:44:34.610
JAKE TAPPER: In Congress.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:35.000
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.375
JAKE TAPPER: And the bloodstains
are still on the stairs.

00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:38.080
That's true.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.540
Yeah, once again,
look to the endnotes.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.130
Sorry.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:45.590
SPEAKER: And now here we are
today, and a couple of months

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.639
ago you moderated the
town hall at Parkland.

00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:50.180
And I know you said it was one
of the hardest things you ever

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:50.680
did.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.950
And I just wonder,
what can we do,

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.620
where do we go from here,
and your thoughts on that?

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.120
[SIGHS]

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.940
JAKE TAPPER: OK.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.820
It was challenging just because
the emotions in the room

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.230
were just so raw.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.550
You know, their daughters, and
sons, and brothers, and friends

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.440
had been murdered
one week before,

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.300
and everybody was so raw.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:15.980
And it was an opportunity
to facilitate them to allow

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:18.590
them to speak truth to power.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.230
But it was difficult
just emotionally.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.690
I mean, again, much more
so for them than for me,

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:27.980
but it was just tough to do,
to be around all that pain

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.810
and heartache.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.570
I don't know what the solution
is to gun violence in America.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.810
I recognize that it's
a complicated problem,

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:40.490
and it's probably a
lot more complicated

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:46.640
than policymakers on either
side, on the extremes,

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.260
want to make it seem.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:53.420
There is no way that
the US Senate, even

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.450
under Democratic control,
would be willing to ban

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:58.770
so-called "assault weapons."

00:45:58.770 --> 00:45:59.357
They won't.

00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:01.190
If the Democrats want
to control the Senate,

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:02.390
they need to have
Democrats in there

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.140
from places like West
Virginia and Montana

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.097
who won't vote for those things.

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:08.180
That said, there are a lot
of commonsense measures

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.030
that it would seem, you would
think, would be able to get

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:14.720
support, ones that the president
has expressed support for.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.170
And yet, when the cameras
are off, not so much.

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:19.830
I don't have a solution.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:23.240
And I wish I did.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.880
Obviously, the
biggest intersection,

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.880
it seems to me, where
there should be action

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:37.220
is in the nexus between people
with violent emotional problems

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.170
and their ability to get guns.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:43.370
And it seems to me that
the temporary restraining

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.920
order that allows family
members to say to a judge

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.620
or to a police officer, we're
worried about this person,

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.950
and we think that they have
guns, and we're concerned,

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.620
and they petition the court,
that that should be something.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.120
California
experimented with that

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.690
or passed something like
that after the San--

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:01.331
Santa Barbara or San Bernardino?

00:47:01.331 --> 00:47:02.330
SPEAKER: San Bernardino.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:03.040
JAKE TAPPER: San Berna--

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.706
no, I forgot it was--
no, Santa Barbara.

00:47:04.706 --> 00:47:08.540
Santa Barbara, that
little misogynist

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.890
who drove around
hitting, killing people.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:15.459
It was after him, because his
family knew he had problems.

00:47:15.459 --> 00:47:17.000
And the police went
to check him out,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.430
but they didn't
go into his room.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:19.910
Anyway, there are
things that can

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.560
be done in that
nexus between people

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.160
with violent emotional
and mental problems

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.860
and the ease with which
anybody can get a gun.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.250
And it seems like that is an
area where policymakers should

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.230
focus as much
attention as they can,

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:37.500
because it seems to be the
area where there's a lot to do.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.000
But the truth of the matter is,
most gun deaths in this country

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.086
are suicides, not murders.

00:47:44.086 --> 00:47:46.440
And I'm not saying
that's not as serious,

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:51.390
but when people say 30,000 a
year, 2/3 of them are suicides.

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:55.910
And most of the gun deaths are
not mass weapon slaughters.

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:59.390
They are handguns in
individual occurrences,

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:04.910
oftentimes men killing
women in their lives.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:10.310
So Parkland, that kind of
thing doesn't happen as much,

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:12.170
in terms of body count.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:15.560
The more serious thing has
to do with individual handgun

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.700
shooting incidents.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.850
And I don't know
what can be done.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:21.290
SPEAKER: OK.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:22.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.970
Big fan, since you were a
guest host on ABC "This Week."

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:27.684
JAKE TAPPER: Thanks.

00:48:27.684 --> 00:48:29.100
AUDIENCE:
Non-Washington question.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.550
I mean, Washington is
polarized, but the country

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:32.584
is pretty polarized too.

00:48:32.584 --> 00:48:34.250
It's probably about
eight states, right,

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:36.860
where you have a chance
of moving the needle.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.830
My brother lives in Missouri,
and he canceled his cable bill

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:41.840
because any time
any election comes,

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.085
it's wall to wall political ads.

00:48:44.085 --> 00:48:45.710
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:48.140
AUDIENCE: So this seems
like a much harder question.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.754
If I ask myself,
I'm fairly liberal,

00:48:51.754 --> 00:48:53.420
even if I was
conservative in the state,

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.790
I have no shot of
doing anything.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:58.610
If everybody is
like me, then what

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:03.200
is the principle that
causes states to shift?

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.750
I mean, because if
you don't remove

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:09.160
the polarization in
the people, you're

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.350
never going to remove the
polarization in politics.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.520
JAKE TAPPER: Mm-hm.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.720
I don't know.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.060
I'm not an expert on
demographic shifts

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.210
or why certain states
become more liberal or more

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:21.500
conservative.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:26.840
I've seen it happen in my life
as the Northeast has become

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.500
decidedly more progressive,
and other parts of the country

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:34.830
have been decidedly
more conservative.

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:39.080
I mean, I'm old enough to
remember Democrats, not just

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.910
Democrats, white
Democrats representing

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:42.530
parts of the South.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:45.170
Mainly, it seems like
the Southern Democrats,

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:46.640
a lot of them are
African American

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.681
because they represent
African American districts

00:49:48.681 --> 00:49:50.150
redistricted.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:56.360
And I'm old enough to remember
liberal Republicans, when

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.990
Susan Collins was not an
endangered species, when

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:01.900
there were a lot of--

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.650
AUDIENCE: There are
none in the House now.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:04.860
And there were a lot.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:06.350
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah, not
from New England, right?

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.950
I mean, you have
Charlie Baker here,

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.260
so it's not like
it can't be done.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.490
It can be done.

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:15.260
I don't know why it happens.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.050
I think it just has to do with
one of the things going on

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:21.320
is just people siloing
themselves off from people

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.270
with different points of view.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.330
Whether it's cable news,
or news in general,

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:30.560
or websites, or
politicians, we just

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.620
seem to be becoming a more
tribal society in terms

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.720
of our political beliefs.

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.880
Yeah, I mean,
every four years, I

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:42.720
hear about how Missouri
is a purple state,

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.440
and I never believe it.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.890
But I have lived long enough to
see purple states go from red

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:50.520
to blue and from blue to red.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.250
I mean, I have lived
long enough to see.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:55.790
I remember when John Kerry was
trying to get Colorado in 2004.

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:59.690
And I thought he was on
drugs, but now Colorado

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.470
is pretty solidly
purple, if not blue.

00:51:06.823 --> 00:51:10.760
And amazingly, I can't
even believe it happened.

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.260
Barack Obama won Indiana.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.210
I mean, it did happen in 2008.

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:19.640
So different candidates
can win over a populace

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.051
based on who they are.

00:51:21.051 --> 00:51:22.550
But generally
speaking, I just think

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.983
we're becoming more tribal.

00:51:24.983 --> 00:51:26.950
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:31.450
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious about,
as your career has spanned time

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:33.960
before the internet
was a big thing,

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.950
and then now we
have Twitter, and it

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:40.020
feels like everything
has just accelerated.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:42.040
The news cycle is
faster and faster.

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:49.030
And I'm curious both how
you feel about that and also

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:52.219
how that factored in when you
go back and look at the '50s,

00:51:52.219 --> 00:51:54.010
researching that and
then writing about it,

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:58.060
in a world when we didn't
have Twitter and things

00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.530
weren't happening so quickly.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.749
A great example of that
would be Scott Pruitt.

00:52:01.749 --> 00:52:03.790
There's so much news about
Scott Pruitt one week,

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.880
and then by Friday, it was
gone, because everybody had

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.261
moved on to the next scandal.

00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:10.510
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah, I mean,
the Scott Pruitt situation,

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:12.051
I can just tell you
as somebody who's

00:52:12.051 --> 00:52:14.620
responsible for an hour
of news show every day,

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:18.520
is that President Trump pushes
Scott Pruitt off our deck.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.916
I mean, President Trump--

00:52:19.916 --> 00:52:21.540
we'll have, like, a
Scott Pruitt piece.

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.915
This has happened now at least
twice, if not three times,

00:52:23.915 --> 00:52:27.520
that we had a piece about
Scott Pruitt's five most

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.744
recent scandals, and
then President Trump

00:52:29.744 --> 00:52:31.660
did or said something,
and we didn't have time

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.620
to get to Scott Pruitt.

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.119
I mean, so Donald Trump is the
best thing that ever happened

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:36.796
to Scott Pruitt in every way.

00:52:36.796 --> 00:52:39.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:42.520
You know, it's funny because my
first job in journalism was--

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.540
after freelance-- was I worked
for "Washington City Paper."

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.010
And then I worked for salon.com.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:52.030
It was very different
than what it is today.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:54.710
It was much more--

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:55.910
it was not ideological.

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:57.250
It was just a lot of
different points of view.

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.030
It leaned left, because it
was based in San Francisco,

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.905
but it was a lot of
different points of view.

00:53:00.905 --> 00:53:04.660
And I'll tell you, it was
amazing working for salon.com

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.630
in 1999 and 2000, covering
the presidential race,

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.940
because at the time--

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.400
and some people here might be
too young to remember this--

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.450
at the time, newspapers,
other websites,

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:19.190
only updated once a day.

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.800
So I would be on
the road with people

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.470
from the "LA Times" and "The
New York Times" and "ABC News,"

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:28.210
"Washington Post," whatever,
and something would happen,

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:28.990
and I would write.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:31.870
I would write a piece on
my laptop and send it in,

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:35.120
and it would post on
Salon within an hour.

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.710
And I would scoop
everybody, not because I

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:42.040
was such a great reporter, but
because their websites weren't

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.100
going to update until the
next morning at 6:00 AM.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.480
It's crazy.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.760
And then I remember
"The Washington Post"

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.690
took this amazing step
that every day at 4:00

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:56.590
they were going
to do one update.

00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:02.800
So it was awesome for me,
being on the tip of the spear

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.540
of the internet journalism.

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:08.680
Because all these dinosaurs
that I was competing with

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.590
didn't realize
what was going on.

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:13.570
Ultimately, they did.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:16.690
Now the news cycle is crazy.

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:20.770
But when writing the book, the
most you could hope for then

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:22.664
was there was an
afternoon newspaper.

00:54:22.664 --> 00:54:24.580
There was "The Washington
Post" in the morning

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:29.080
and "The Washington Star"
in the afternoon in DC.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:35.350
And I mean, the news,
early on, the evening news

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.150
was 15 minutes.

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:40.690
And then they adapted it
to become half an hour.

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:47.200
So it was just like a glacier
moving, the news in that era,

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.780
compared to what we
deal with today, where

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.080
I'm getting the shakes because
I want to go to my phone

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.180
right now and find
what has happened

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.940
in the last hour and a half.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:00.850
What has President Trump done?

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:02.200
What is going on in the world?

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.350
Because it changes.

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:05.770
We'll be in the
middle of a show.

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:09.040
I remember one time just in
the last couple of months,

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.690
at the top of the
show, I just laid out

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:13.420
all the huge events
that had happened just

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.750
in the last 24 hours.

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.460
And that was in our A block.

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:23.300
And by our C block,
Hope Hicks had resigned.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.300
And I said, "remember
when I did that commentary

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.770
six months ago about all the--

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:27.269
oh, wait.

00:55:27.269 --> 00:55:29.206
That was 15 minutes ago."

00:55:29.206 --> 00:55:31.330
I mean, that's what it
feels like, this news cycle.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:32.830
It's just a different era.

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:35.260
By the way, this
has to be it, right?

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:39.700
I mean, we can't get any
more insane than this?

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.830
At a certain point,
it would have

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:44.410
to actually be traveling back
in time or something like that.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:49.720
This is as crazy as it
gets, I would think.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.517
SPEAKER: I think we have time
for about one more question.

00:55:52.517 --> 00:55:53.350
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.730
I hate to be the last
question with this,

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:56.830
but I can I ask you
about Kellyanne Conway?

00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:59.350
JAKE TAPPER: Sure.

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.930
AUDIENCE: So I think last
weekend she did the rounds

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:03.330
on the Sunday shows.

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.180
And it seems like every time she
does one of these Sunday shows,

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.530
not only is it a lost
segment, because you don't

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:12.280
get any information out of
her, but the interviewer always

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.110
seems to leave it
off frustrated.

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:14.904
JAKE TAPPER: Yeah.

00:56:14.904 --> 00:56:16.570
AUDIENCE: And it just
seems like a waste

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.580
of that segment of the show.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.187
So--

00:56:19.187 --> 00:56:20.270
JAKE TAPPER: So why do it?

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:21.353
AUDIENCE: Why have her on?

00:56:21.353 --> 00:56:23.363
JAKE TAPPER: Why have her on?

00:56:23.363 --> 00:56:27.828
So you're not the first
person to ask me this week.

00:56:27.828 --> 00:56:30.239
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:30.239 --> 00:56:32.530
I did at an event at the 92nd
Street Y Wednesday night,

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:34.488
and Stephen Colbert asked
me the same question.

00:56:34.488 --> 00:56:36.470
So you're in good company.

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:38.697
Here's the answer.

00:56:38.697 --> 00:56:41.030
First of all, she's a senior
counselor to the president.

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:42.560
So if there is
something going on

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.615
and we want answers
to questions,

00:56:46.615 --> 00:56:48.490
other than the president,
who hasn't given me

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:51.040
an interview since the
Judge Curiel questions

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.750
that I asked him
in June 2016, there

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.910
isn't anyone necessarily better.

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.400
And Sunday was, I
had questions about--

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:03.760
what was it?

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:04.810
I guess, Michael Cohen.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:05.980
I forget.

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:10.360
300 scandals ago, but
there was something.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:15.280
Oh, it was, yeah, Rudy Giuliani
had basically let the cat out

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.984
of the bag that the
president had lied.

00:57:16.984 --> 00:57:19.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but it
didn't matter what you asked.

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.340
JAKE TAPPER: Thank you.

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:20.006
I appreciate it.

00:57:20.006 --> 00:57:21.496
Thank you so much.

00:57:21.496 --> 00:57:22.870
I'm not above
being fact checked.

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:25.150
I appreciate it.

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:27.310
So how do you explain this?

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:28.740
So that's one.

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.990
Two, I thought it
was interesting

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:35.080
that the premise of
all my questions,

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.260
accurate, but also
a premise was,

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.630
the president lies so much.

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:41.380
Why?

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.120
Why does the president
tell so many lies?

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.565
And her response was, "The
president does many things."

00:57:46.565 --> 00:57:48.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:49.575
That's a quote.

00:57:49.575 --> 00:57:50.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.116
JAKE TAPPER: "The president
does many things."

00:57:52.116 --> 00:57:53.140
Right.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:56.020
And why aren't you covering
this, this, and this as opposed

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:56.907
to the lies?

00:57:56.907 --> 00:57:58.240
So I thought it was interesting.

00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.410
I thought we were
making progress.

00:57:59.410 --> 00:57:59.730
Here we are.

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:00.730
We're making progress.

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:02.688
She's not disputing the
fact that the president

00:58:02.688 --> 00:58:04.480
tells lots of lies.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.500
And Roy Blunt, Senate
Republican leadership,

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.580
was in the next interview.

00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:12.820
Also, "Does it bother you that
the president lies so much?"

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.601
was my question.

00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:15.100
"It would bother
me a lot more if we

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.350
weren't getting so much done."

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:18.640
So I mean, we've made progress.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:23.040
They're acknowledging that
the president tells lies.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.840
I felt like a small
victory there.

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:31.070
Third, 63 million
people voted for Trump.

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:34.780
I don't think it's not
worthwhile to have the Trump

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:39.650
point of view represented
on any number of issues,

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:40.319
including hers.

00:58:40.319 --> 00:58:42.610
She was trying to explain
what the president meant when

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:45.160
he was on Air Force
One and he said, "No,

00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.470
he didn't know
about the payment."

00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:48.940
You know, whatever.

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.700
And then fourth-- and this
one is actually, I think,

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.780
the most important to me--

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:57.520
I think there is value in a
news anchor challenging people

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.260
in power, even if--

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:05.744
this isn't an Aaron Sorkin
scripted Sunday talk show.

00:59:05.744 --> 00:59:07.660
I mean, she's not going
to say, "You're right.

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:08.690
He's a liar.

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:10.253
What am I doing?"

00:59:10.253 --> 00:59:13.704
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:19.340
But I think viewers
can get something out

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.640
of feeling
represented, at least.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.950
Why does he tell these lies?

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:28.940
For instance, the
president said that Obama

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.490
had tried to get these three
hostages out of North Korea

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.430
and failed, but he
was going to do it.

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.730
Two of them were taken
hostage during the Trump

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:39.030
administration.

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:43.940
So that would have been a neat
trick, if Obama had actually

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.280
anticipated and not
been able to prevent it.

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:52.350
So just to say it, just to
say, it's not true, it's a lie.

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:54.320
I think there is value in that.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.230
That said, it's not as
though it isn't a discussion

00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:02.240
that we have every time
we book a Trump guest.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.349
It is a discussion that we have.

01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:05.390
What are we going to get?

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:06.510
Why would we do it?

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:09.350
We turn down people.

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:11.844
But anyway, that's my reasoning.

01:00:11.844 --> 01:00:13.010
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.124
JAKE TAPPER: Thank you.

01:00:15.124 --> 01:00:17.040
SPEAKER: Thanks so much,
everyone, for coming.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:17.750
JAKE TAPPER: Thanks for
being here, everyone.

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:18.890
I really appreciate it.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.640
