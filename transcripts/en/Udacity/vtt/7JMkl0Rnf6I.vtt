00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.990
Welcome back.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.380
In this lecture, I'm going to talk
about the concept of coded photography.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.790
Recall, again, the whole pipeline
of computational photography.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.050
We have illuminated scene
that goes through a series of

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.230
different processes to be able to
capture the light to generate an image.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.410
Now, one concept we looked at was,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.080
how do we control different
aspects of this pipeline?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.770
We looked at how to control light,
the illumination sources.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.410
We also want to now start thinking about
how we can actually change things inside

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.910
a camera and the optics and such to be
able to generate newer forms of images.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.830
This leads us to the concept
of coded photography.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.720
We actually have looked at some of
these ideas briefly when we talked

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.300
about the concepts of
epsilon photography.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.220
Epsilon photography was when we
basically said, let's take a series

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.560
of pictures of something,
just different in one parameter.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.190
Now, actually,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.370
let's talk about how we can create
those changes in the camera itself.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.210
And the whole concept of coded
photography is basically being able to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.130
put something in a camera that would
let us capture this information

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.080
right on the camera itself.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.686
And all of the variations that come in,
perhaps,

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:09.387
on things like epsilon photography,
but done on-board on a camera.

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:13.700
We're going to talk about how to modify
cameras to support this in principle and

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.370
actually what you're learn about is,
again,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.400
the whole principle of coded
photography through this lecture
