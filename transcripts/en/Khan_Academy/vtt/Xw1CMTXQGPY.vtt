00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.820
- [Instructor] In the last video,

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.400
we named this molecule
using the common names

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.460
for this group right over here

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.270
and I thought it would be fun to also use-

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.790
to do the same thing but
use the systematic name.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.400
So in the last video,
we called this isobutyl

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.290
but if wanted to do it systematically,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.550
we would look at this group,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.750
we would start at where it is attached

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.930
to the main backbone, and we would think

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.060
about the longest chain
of carbons from there.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.810
So if we start there, we can
get one, two, three carbons.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.560
So if we're dealing with three carbons,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.620
then this is going to be a propyl group,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.470
and we would number it one, two, three.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.620
And we see on the two
carbon of the propyl group,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.710
the two carbon of the propyl group,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.670
we have a one carbon
group right over here,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.310
so this is a methyl group
branching off the two carbon

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.760
of the propyl group.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.770
So we could call this, we could call

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.930
this thing the systematic name,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600
instead of calling it isobutyl,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.330
we could call it two methyl,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.290
that's the methyl group right over there.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.690
So let me write this down, two,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.710
two methyl propyl,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.490
two methyl propyl,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.230
two methyl propyl.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.250
And so this is the systematic name,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.590
and of course there is two of them.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.350
This is a two methyl
propyl right over here

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.650
instead of an isobutyl, we'll
call it two methyl propyl.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.120
And this is another two methyl propyl.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.450
So instead of writing,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.070
instead of writing the
five, seven diisobutyl here,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.770
we can instead substitute that
with the systematic names.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.603
So let's do that.

00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:34.006
Let me copy and paste everything
else that comes before it.

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.333
So let me copy,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.920
copy and paste it.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.270
Whoops.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.730
Whoops, I'm in the wrong
layer of my program.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.420
Let me go one layer down.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.633
So let me copy and paste it again.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.520
Copy and paste, there we go.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.100
So I got that part.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.830
But now I'm going to write
this part differently.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.380
So we still have stuff, we still-

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.400
it's still on the five
carbon and the seven carbon

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.680
of our main chain.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.350
So five comma seven,
and we have two of'em,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.010
but when we're using systematic naming,

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.852
we won't say di- this
thing, instead we say bis-.

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:17.390
So five comma seven bis,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.520
that says, "Hey, we've got
two of what I'm about to say."

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.940
Bis- this thing.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.900
So let me copy, dude,
that's in a different layer.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.393
Let me copy and let me paste that.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.770
Bis- this stuff right over here,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.063
and then, of course, we have cyclooctane.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.580
And then, of course, we have

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.923
cyclooctane,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.350
and we are done.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.193
We have named it systematically as well.
