00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.120
Now, we know exactly how to check whether each of these numbers down here

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.922
actually is a zero of this function. We just need to substitute each one in for

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:12.330
x. And see which of these values give us f of x equals zero. Let's check the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.957
easy ones first. The first two on the list. 1 and negative 1. So, please tell

00:00:16.957 --> 00:00:22.100
me whether negative 1 and 1 are each zeros of this function. Just answer yes or

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.423
no for each one.
