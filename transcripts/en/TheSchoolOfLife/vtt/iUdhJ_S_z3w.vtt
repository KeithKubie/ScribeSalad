00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.400
It isn't 42 and you don't need sandals and beard to understand that there are 4 things that make life meaningful

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.260
Firstly, helping others

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.480
The most meaningless life would be to have to roll a boulder up a mountain repeatedly

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.080
Because what makes life meaningful is doing something useful for other people

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.400
We often think that the nicest thing is to be served

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.340
But that is nothing next to the joy of serving others

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.120
Fixing their heart

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.400
Teaching them trigonometry

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.540
Helping them to burp

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.320
The meaning of life is service

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.900
It's also to make something that's better than we normally are

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.000
We're all a bit of a mess, anxious, furious, forgetful

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
so there's meaning in creating something superior

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.960
The train set that's more organized than we are

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.660
The garden that's pretty in a way we aren't always

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.560
The book that says what we normally can't

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.900
Finding out our stuffs work is also meaningful

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.240
Gravity, a foreign language, computer code

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.780
and best of all, who we are

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.540
what drives us,

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.540
and what we should aim for

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.120
Lastly, meaning comes from connections with others

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.760
The opposite of superficial chat is when you show the vulnerable, scared parts of you to another person

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.520
The best way to kick-start a meaningful conversation just ask, "What are you really afraid of?"

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.980
So that's the meaning of life
