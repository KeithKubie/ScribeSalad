00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.460
I have a confession to make.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.710
I’m an addict.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.359
Wow, that’s a load off.

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.060
Yeah, finally the world knows...that I’m
addicted to saying that I’m addicted to

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.290
stuff.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.710
Hey everyone, Matt Lieberman here for DNews.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.900
Self-diagnosis of addiction is rampant in
today’s society.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.599
And I’m not talking about alcoholism, or
drugs, or anything substance-based.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.329
I’m talking about phone addiction, twitter
addiction, facebook addiction, Chipotle addiction

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.259
- well, that’s obviously a real thing.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.450
But are all of these diagnoses actually addictions?

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.430
Where does our addiction to addiction come
from?

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.860
Well, substance and behavioral addictions
are becoming more widely recognized as common.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.080
Compulsive sex, shopping, and gambling as
reactions to stress are accepted as addictions

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.690
because of how the brain processes the cycle
of stress, compulsion, and reward.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.260
In addition, and most importantly, the part
of your brain that inhibits these risky behaviors

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.340
are quieted.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.970
However, when it comes to things like Facebook
and Twitter, no such quieting occurs.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.780
The issue stems not from our ability to stop
ourselves, but from a lack of motivation to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.780
do so.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.610
AKA, it’s easier to check my notifications
than to delete my profile and potentially

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.670
miss out.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.310
A recent study from Cal State Fullerton found
that only between 0.7 and 11 percent of the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.689
people surveyed were “strongly impacted”
by the addictive tendencies that they displayed

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.549
concerning the internet and various internet
services.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.340
Now the American Society of Addiction Medicine
defines addiction as “a primary, chronic

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.100
disease of brain reward, motivation, memory
and related circuitry.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.130
It’s characterized by the inability to stop,
cravings, and most importantly, a lack of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.600
recognition of significant problems with their
behaviors.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.920
Namely, if you have the awareness to claim
addiction, you might not actually be addicted.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.039
Additionally, we have to talk about the definition
of excess.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.920
If someone plays World of Warcraft for 5 hours
a day, they obviously have a serious habit.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.819
But if that person could not stop playing
to save themself, like a man in Taiwan who

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.020
died at an internet cafe after three straight
days of nonstop play, something more sinister

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.920
is obviously at work on a biological level.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.569
Okay, so maybe we exaggerate when we say that
we’re addicted to poking people or crushing

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.480
those goshdarn candies, but what drives us
to do so?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.489
According to Psychology Today, society has
an addiction to addictions.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.569
The cycle is eerily similar to that of drug
addiction, namely, a new technology is introduced,

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.340
we overuse it to excess, and find ourselves
hooked.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.040
When we stop using it, we go into withdrawal.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.790
However, rather than go into recovery, we
label our overuse as an addiction to regain

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.700
some control over our behavior.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.990
It’s not my fault that I can’t stop snapchatting,
I have a disease.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.140
Hold on, that’d actually make a good snapchat.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.640
Sorry, I’m addicted.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.150
Our addiction to addictions and the rampant
over-labelling, not to mention the highs and

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.150
lows of watching people battle addictions
on television, are rewiring our neurochemical

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.590
impulses and pushing personal responsibility
further and further into the background of

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.680
our society.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.150
But hey, it’s not our fault that we’re
irresponsible.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.500
We’re just addicted.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.409
Are you an “addict” who’s not really
an addict?
