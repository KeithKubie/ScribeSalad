00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.760
Now that we have our
competitive analysis laid out,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.330
we need to complete a key
part of our pitch deck,

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.160
and coincidentally,
part of your final project.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.600
This is the value proposition.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.590
Our value proposition is our promise
of value to our customers or investors.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.680
Now it explains what problem
our product solves, and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.960
what benefits we're
giving our customers.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.840
We need a frame or value proposition so

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.680
everything we learn in this lesson
is clear, organized, and powerful.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.110
The leading template for value
propositions in use today was written by

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.140
none other than Geoffrey Moore,
in his book Crossing the Chasm.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.350
So let's hear from the expert himself.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.254
&gt;&gt; When it comes to articulating
a value proposition,

00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:42.148
we have a template that we use in our
practice which has got six lines and

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:44.865
it's proved over the years
to be pretty useful.

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:49.660
So the first line is for and
that's just like who you're talking to.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.560
And we'll talk about market
segmentation, but we're going to talk to

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.340
what we call the poster child in your
segment, you're perfect target customer.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.813
And the next line is called who.

00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:04.797
And that specifies the state
that your target customer

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:08.165
would be in, in wanting your offer.

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:12.010
So you have for these people,
who are in this state of mind.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.220
Then the third line, it's called
our product or our service is.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.280
And that's where you categorize
your offer generically.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.480
It's a little bit like,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.460
what aisle in the supermarket would
I go to to find your product?

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.160
It's sort of that sort of
thing is in line three.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.230
So you're not trying to
differentiate in line three,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.990
you're just trying to say what you are.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.830
And then that, and then the fourth
line is your primary benefit.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.100
The thing that basically, it speaks a
lot to the state that the customer's in.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.410
Typically if the state is a problem
state this is the answer to that

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.250
problem kind of thing.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.140
And then the last two lines help
position you against your closest

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.090
competitor.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.210
So unlike, and this is where you
put your closest competitor, and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.750
what's important here is that you not
pick a competitor that's ineffective or

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.740
not valuable to the customer.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.170
You want to pick a legitimate
alternative that this customer

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.160
should probably be thinking about.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.780
But then what you say is unlike
this competitor, our offer, and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.150
that's the sixth line.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.800
And you state your primary
differentiation there.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.614
And it's not that our offer is better.

00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:20.503
It's typically what you normally do
with differentiation, is you say,

00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:23.021
they are good for this and
we're good for that.
