like to organize things in decimal
 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.710
like to organize things in decimal
fashion so that you would have units of

fashion so that you would have units of
 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.779

a hundred units of a thousand units of
 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.680
a hundred units of a thousand units of

point in that chapter where you you sort

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:35.750

the reason it's awkward is because there

the reason it's awkward is because there
 

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.840
the reason it's awkward is because there
is more continuity across this this

broader dimensions I've been trying to
stress here the pilgrimage so far as I

now if you are going to to look at this

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880
now if you are going to to look at this
 

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.040
now if you are going to to look at this
Mameluke phenomenon and say you know as

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:06.050
Mameluke phenomenon and say you know as
 

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:12.600
Mameluke phenomenon and say you know as
a state slave warriors who become the

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:12.610
 

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:17.340
essentially the rulers of a state that

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:17.350
essentially the rulers of a state that
 

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:19.990
essentially the rulers of a state that

else you're going to say which is more

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:22.190
else you're going to say which is more
 

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:25.300
else you're going to say which is more
important the fear of the Mongols that

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:25.310
important the fear of the Mongols that
 

01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:27.730
important the fear of the Mongols that
undoubtedly was real following the

which would be more important I'm I'm
 

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:49.750
which would be more important I'm I'm
really not sure but I think that over

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760
really not sure but I think that over
 

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.490
really not sure but I think that over
the long term the more important one

01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:51.500
the long term the more important one
 

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.520
the long term the more important one
would be would be the pilgrimage but you

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:54.530
would be would be the pilgrimage but you
 

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:58.090
would be would be the pilgrimage but you

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:24.020
time in the in the broad comparison I
 

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:26.740
time in the in the broad comparison I
started with where people look at the

started with where people look at the
 

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:30.370
started with where people look at the
era of the Mongols from basically the

01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:30.380
era of the Mongols from basically the
 

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.730
era of the Mongols from basically the
1200s and into the early 1300s when they

1200s and into the early 1300s when they
 

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.740
1200s and into the early 1300s when they
look at this era and they say let's

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:35.750
look at this era and they say let's
 

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:38.020
look at this era and they say let's
think of this in comparison with the

course you can legitimately ask a

course you can legitimately ask a
 

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.370
course you can legitimately ask a
question of well is it really comparable

01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:51.380

because the voyages of discovery were
 

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:59.230
because the voyages of discovery were
followed by huge changes in the world

01:12:59.230 --> 01:12:59.240
followed by huge changes in the world
 

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.410

becomes the center of world history you

01:13:23.609 --> 01:13:23.619
becomes the center of world history you
 

01:13:23.619 --> 01:13:27.919
becomes the center of world history you
could probably make an argument that

01:13:27.919 --> 01:13:27.929
 

01:13:27.929 --> 01:13:32.479
starting with the Silk Road in 300 BC

01:13:32.479 --> 01:13:32.489
starting with the Silk Road in 300 BC
 

01:13:32.489 --> 01:13:36.810
starting with the Silk Road in 300 BC
perhaps even earlier and up to the

01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:36.820
perhaps even earlier and up to the
 

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:39.870
perhaps even earlier and up to the
period of the Mongols ending around say

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880
period of the Mongols ending around say
 

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.330
period of the Mongols ending around say
1300 or so ad then if 1600 years during

01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:45.340
1300 or so ad then if 1600 years during
 

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:51.330
1300 or so ad then if 1600 years during
which Central Asia and the transfer of

01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:51.340
which Central Asia and the transfer of
 

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:56.729
which Central Asia and the transfer of
ideas and goods and political ideas and

01:13:56.729 --> 01:13:56.739
ideas and goods and political ideas and
 

01:13:56.739 --> 01:13:58.949
ideas and goods and political ideas and
so forth across Central Asia that this

01:13:58.949 --> 01:13:58.959
so forth across Central Asia that this
 

01:13:58.959 --> 01:14:01.370
so forth across Central Asia that this
plays a central role in world history

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380
plays a central role in world history
 

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.719
plays a central role in world history
and then you would probably have to say

01:14:03.719 --> 01:14:03.729
and then you would probably have to say
 

01:14:03.729 --> 01:14:05.310
and then you would probably have to say
that that comes to an end with the

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320
that that comes to an end with the
 

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.100
that that comes to an end with the
Mongols and that maybe they should be

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:08.110
Mongols and that maybe they should be
 

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.319
Mongols and that maybe they should be
known not so much as the people who

01:14:10.319 --> 01:14:10.329
known not so much as the people who
 

01:14:10.329 --> 01:14:11.729
known not so much as the people who
destroyed all the cities but the people

01:14:11.729 --> 01:14:11.739
destroyed all the cities but the people
 

01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:17.279
destroyed all the cities but the people
who destroyed you know Eurasian Eurasian

the re-evaluation of the Mongols in
 

01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:08.100
the re-evaluation of the Mongols in
their role in world history and I think

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:08.110
their role in world history and I think
 

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:14.089
