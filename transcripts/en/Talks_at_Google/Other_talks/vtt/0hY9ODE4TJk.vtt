00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.179
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Hi.

00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:05.050
I'm Julie Wiskirchen from the authors at Google
team here in Santa Monica.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.670
And today I'm very excited to
welcome Penn Jillette.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.170
[Applause]

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.840
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: You probably know Penn
as the more vocal half of the magic

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.060
duo Penn and Teller.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.970
They have a long running Vegas show
and they also host the TV show, "Penn and

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.960
Teller: Bullshit!".

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.779
He co-produced and co-directed the film "The
Aristocrats",

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.390
has appeared in numerous film and TV shows,
including

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.649
Dancing with the Stars and is author of six
books.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.510
And
today he's here to talk about the latest which

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.250
is called "God No!: Signs You May Already
be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales".

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.930
So please
welcome me in welcoming Penn Jillette.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.830
&gt;&gt; Penn: Thank you.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:59.030
I was very excited to be at one of these
Google shindigs.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.619
Can you all hear me okay with the
microphone being so low, set for a low person?

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.299
The book is
called "God No!: Signs You May Already Be

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.470
an Atheist and Other Magical Tales"
It's laid out in my version of the ten commandments

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.200
which
is the ten suggestions.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.830
And I wrote the book.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.320
The basic
reason I wrote the book was because Glenn

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.921
Beck told me
to.[laughter] I get a lot of heat a huge amount

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:30.921
of heat.

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.240
I don't
know if any of you watch Paul Provenza, my

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.700
partner on Aristocrats, Paul Provenza.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.580
There's a show called the Green Room.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.159
And I was on there
with two of my heroes -- Martin Mull and Tommy

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.659
Smothers.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.410
And Tommy
Smothers tore me into an asshole for ever

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.259
going on the
Glenn Beck show.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.329
He thought that--.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.329
He's completely--.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.509
He's 100 percent right that when you go
on a show that you disagree with philosophically,

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.220
you're
giving that show your name.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.950
You're giving them your
brand.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.600
You're giving them your support in a certain
sense.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.050
So that I shouldn't go on anything to do with
Glenn Beck or FOX News anywhere.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.300
That argument is
completely 100 percent valid.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.549
The other argument, the
other side, I believe, is also completely

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.549
valid.

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.749
Which is
if you only go on shows with people who agree

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.079
with you,
who's going to go on Glenn Beck and say the

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.129
simple
sentence, "there is no God?"

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.799
Who is going to sit with Glenn
Beck and when he says Penn did you go to Ringling

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.709
Brothers
clown college?"

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.340
And I say, "yes, Glenn, and you're a
Mormon so we're both wearing funny underwear

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.300
but for
different reasons."

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.209
[laughter] Glenn was always
pleasant.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.209
Polite.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.409
I only went on like four times I
guess.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:54.019
And one of the things I said to Tommy Smothers
was, is there anything I ever said on Glenn

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.120
Beck that was wrong, that you
believe I was lying, that you don't agree

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120
with me?

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.469
He said, "no, no, no, -- that's not
the point."

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.760
If Hitler had a talk show and I said, "yes,
I'd go

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.209
on and I'd try to tell the truth."

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.959
So Glenn Beck and I
have maintained this slight friendship.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.950
You know, e-mail
friendship.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.449
Gmail friendship.

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.530
[laughter] Where we write back and
forth, you know, not every day and send pictures

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.959
of our cats.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.339
But we do write probably every four or five
weeks, back and

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:29.339
forth.

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:35.299
And he was working on this, one of these
rallies to destroy America that he was involved

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.459
with.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.989
And he was putting together the ten commandments.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.109
And he
made this argument, which I thought was really

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.959
counterproductive for a theist to make.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.359
The argument he
was making was that the ten commandments were

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:56.249
so built
into our morality, so important culturally

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.369
and in our
hearts that you didn't even have to believe

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.120
in religion
in order to have these ten commandments.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.659
Now, that's the
argument essentially that Sam Harris makes

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:14.159
in his -- the
moral -- what's the other word of Sam Harris'

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.909
new book -- yeah.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.079
Moral Landscape.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.280
The Moral Landscape.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.729
That's the exact argument he makes.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.220
It's the argument Dawkins makes all the time
and it's the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.900
argument that atheists make forever about
morality that

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.569
morality exists outside of religion.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.490
You can be moral
without religion.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.030
It's an argument that you can very
rarely get a religious person to accept, and

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.700
yet, here is
Glenn Beck making that argument as though

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.750
it were a
religious argument.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.430
And he called upon me to write my
ten commandments to show -- because I'm the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.490
only atheist
Glenn Beck knows [laughter] To write my ten

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.720
commandments.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:03.250
And turns out they don't actually overlap,
because the first three commandments Judeo-Christian

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.729
commandments are pretty much "I am God, suck
up to me".

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.210
And those aren't very important to the atheist.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.061
But some of the other ones like "thou shalt
not kill" I think that

00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:17.870
atheists can get behind maybe even more than
the

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.800
religious people who have kind of "thou shalt
not kill

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.689
somebody God doesn't want you to".

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.819
They have kind of
another thing around there.

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.199
And I'm also not very down
with the coveting thing because I believe

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.080
what you do
inside your head doesn't matter very much.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.650
It's the way
you act towards other people, what you actually

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.650
do.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.099
And fantasies and thought experiments that
are immoral

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.500
are fine as long as action ends up being moral.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.699
So,
after I wrote these for Glenn Beck, I decided

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.070
it would be
a good book.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:56.380
And I laid out my ten suggestions as I was
told to write by Glenn Beck and then filled

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.169
it with
stories -- some of which have to do directly

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.120
with religion
and living an atheist life -- and some of

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.870
which deal with
me trying to get laid at a gay bathhouse and

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.780
dropping my
cock in a blow-dryer.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.240
[laughter] And which some of the reviewers
who are reviewing this in a very serious theological

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.129
way
have had a lot of trouble finding out what

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:22.979
the parable of
the cock in the blow-dryer really means to

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:23.979
atheists.

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.629
But
then again Christ was cryptic, too, now wasn't

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:28.629
he?

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:32.520
[laughter] There's a
reason that my cock being dropped into a blow-dryer

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.219
is
important to this book.

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.780
The subtitle of it is Signs You
May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.780
Tales".

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.800
And it opens with --
the only thing I'm going to read to you from

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.800
this.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.580
I'm just going to take questions because you're
people I want to talk to.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.780
Otherwise I would just read from the book.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.410
But I'm going
to read just the first page, because it kind

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.289
of sums up
what I mean by signs you may already be an

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.289
atheist.

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:57.289
I
don't know why am I reading this.

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.139
I can go off the top of my
head because I wrote it.

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.419
But you may already be an
atheist.

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.150
If God, however you perceive him, her, it,
told

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.860
you to kill your child, told you however God
communicates

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.129
with you to kill your child, would you do
it?

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.240
If your
answer is no, in my booklet, you're an atheist.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.999
There's
doubt in your mind.

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:23.039
Love and morality are more important
to you than your faith.

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:26.120
If your answer is yes, please
reconsider.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.449
And one of the things I hit upon in this
book a lot is that, even people who claim

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.280
-- I mean I
guess I'll quote one of my closest friends,

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.260
Rob Pike, who
is a scientist here at Google.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.229
Not here on this
particular campus, but maybe on one of those.

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:46.559
And Rob
Pike once said to me he was so much of an

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:49.779
atheist he
didn't really believe that other people believed

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:56.690
in God
[laughter] And he did not say that as a joke.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.460
And
there's another book out by Andy Thomson called

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.949
"Why We Do Believe in God".

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:04.289
Then there's a parentheses and S
afterwards.

00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:08.169
"Why Do We Believe in Gods".

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:10.819
And one of the
points he makes is the point -- I think it's

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:15.349
very
important -- about the Abraham example in

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:20.099
the front of
the book, which is people who believe in God

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:24.900
live their
lives as though there was no God.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:31.029
They live their life
with no consideration for divine intervention

00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:33.760
and no
consideration that God's going to help them.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.219
There's a
cliché which is not true.

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:37.950
There are no atheists in fox
holes.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.090
And I would argue that there's nothing but
atheists in fox holes.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.120
If you really believe that God
was watching over your every move.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.380
If you really believe
there was an omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.670
being that
watched every sparrow fall and counted every

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.589
grain of
sand, then why wouldn't you walk through the

00:08:56.589 --> 00:08:58.370
battlefield
going "hidey hidey-ho.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.139
And I'm over here".

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.970
[laughter] And know that
God would make the bullets go right around

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.870
you the way
they did in Pulp Fiction.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.910
If God can save John Travolta, he
can sure as fuck save you, right?

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:15.060
[laughter] Every time you stop at
a stop sign, you're saying, "well, you know,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.110
I'm not sure God is
going to pick the exact time of my death,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.360
so I better
look both ways before I go through here."

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.209
And I just
think there are a lot of people who just say

00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:31.529
they believe
in God kind of as a knee jerk reaction to

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:35.370
a society that
kind of says that's a good thing.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:40.250
And I was writing this
book to kind of say that, "maybe they could

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.250
reconsider.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.860
Atheists are growing very, very quickly in
this country,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.290
but not quickly enough for my taste."

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.260
And there are a
lot of books written about atheism by really

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.329
smart people.

00:09:49.329 --> 00:09:54.959
You've got Dawkins, Hitchens, Dennett, [inaudible],
Ali . And this as I said is a book written

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.710
by a
really stupid atheist.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:02.730
Just to give you an idea that not
only smart people, but stupid people as well,

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.730
can be
atheists.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.040
I'm just going to open it up to questions
on

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040
anything.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.440
You want to ask about the book.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.899
About bull
shit, about anything we've done.

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:10.899
I'm here.

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:13.470
This is the
last interview of my day.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.120
So I'm very happy to answer
questions off subject.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.120
Sir?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.410
&gt;&gt; Male #1: What's the difference between
an atheist and an

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.410
agnostic?

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:28.250
&gt;&gt; Penn: Well, you know an agnostic is a word
that I believe

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.370
from reading the Thomas Huxley biography that
came out a little while ago.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.750
Agnostic is a
word that was developed as a weasel word.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.709
Thomas Huxley
was Darwin's pit bull.

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:49.759
When Darwin wrote his book, "On the
Origin of Species" and changed the world.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:53.339
Probably the
most important scientific breakthrough.

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:56.399
His wife,
Darwin's wife, didn't want him going out and

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:58.800
arguing
these points.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.399
And Darwin also was not a confrontational
man.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:04.459
So they kind of sent Thomas Huxley out.

00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:08.700
And
somebody, maybe Darwin's wife is major culprit.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.940
Maybe
Darwin himself.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.160
Maybe Huxley.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.830
Didn't want to use the
word atheist.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:22.670
So Huxley took the word agnostic, meaning
"don't know," and kind of threw it out there

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.920
as that's
what he was.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.920
He was agnostic.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.350
So he wouldn't scare
people away with the atheism and can maybe

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.230
slide in his
message of evolution.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:40.649
My view of that after, you know,
150 years of using the weasel word agnostic,

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:43.649
is that it
still doesn't answer the question.

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:46.139
If I ask you, "is
there a God."

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:48.930
An epistemological question, "is there a God".

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.190
And more specifically, can
you know there is a God.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.510
The answer, "no, you can't know
there is a God."

00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.110
Or "I don't know" is a perfectly
acceptable answer.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.259
That is agnosticism; it answers the epistemological
question.

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:08.899
But if you're
asked, "do you believe in God?"

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:10.540
That's an entirely
different question.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:16.410
And I think, especially from
talking to evangelicals, especially from talking

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.240
to
Mormons, born again Christians, especially

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.920
the religious
people in our culture in the United States,

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.120
doesn't
really hold up for all religions, but for

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.720
the Judeo
Christian, --what was called by a wonderful

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:35.250
science fiction
writer the Mediterranean death cults-- those

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.949
particular religions, belief is
considered to be active.

00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:42.160
You can't passively believe.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.770
You actively believe.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.230
And that is a basic Judeo
Christian idea that belief is active.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:53.269
And from that
point of view, I feel very strongly that,

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:56.760
if you don't
know, you don't believe.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.560
It's not saying that you will
not believe.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.310
It's not saying that any evidence that
comes along wouldn't change your mind instantly.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.839
It's
not even saying that you don't go back and

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:12.150
forth and five
minutes ago I believed, right now I don't.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.450
Five minutes
from now I will.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.320
But the question, "do you believe in
God?"

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.960
Does not seem it can be answered with, "I
don't

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.920
know," unless you claim not to have a sense
of self and

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.420
not have a sense of what you, yourself, belief.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.769
So I
believe if you answer the question, "do you

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:35.069
believe in
God?" with "I don't know," you're really saying

00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:36.069
"no."

00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:37.579
You're really saying "no, I don't believe
in God."

00:13:37.579 --> 00:13:41.329
So
I've been trying not to use the word agnostic

00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:44.740
except for
very specific epistemological arguments.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.940
But for theological arguments, saying "listen
you've

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.140
got to be atheist or theist.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.339
And more important than
that, do you live your life as though there

00:13:54.339 --> 00:13:56.589
were God or
as though there weren't a God?

00:13:56.589 --> 00:14:01.640
Do you live your life as
though you're going for just reward or punishment.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.660
Or do
you live your life as though there was some

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:11.710
sort of good and pleasing and loving things
you could do without worrying about what's

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.709
going to
happen to you after life.

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:20.839
So I kind of dismiss the whole
idea of agnostic and go right to atheist.

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:23.180
It's -- I just
don't think it's a dirty word.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.790
I think it's a sexy word
even though it's a little hard to spell with

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.060
the I and E
in there.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.610
We can learn.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.700
[laughter] We can look it up.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.700
Yes?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.350
&gt;&gt; Penn: [inaudible] There was a horrible
nightmare there.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.899
&gt;&gt; Penn: Well, good.

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:42.200
You got all organized out there with your
question..

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.339
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Hi.

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:48.970
The first two pages of the book that I glanced
through before the thing, you mention many

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.000
times, like five or six times at least, that
you never used alcohol, you've never used

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
drugs.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.290
And the Bull Shit! show, you make the same
assertion

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.490
in other places.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.080
Why does it matter?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.339
&gt;&gt;Penn: Yeah, I don't know; I don't know why
it matters.

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:08.690
I end up saying
that all the time because it's so unexpected

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.330
and people
just expect it if you're in show business

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.319
and you look
like me and you're enormous and you're my

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:19.620
age and you
have my hair and you have my job, people just

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.060
assume I'm
a heavy duty drug user.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:28.210
And Trey Parker considers it to
be my biggest flaw that I'm not.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.450
[laughter] And in
order to make Trey Parker happy, when he's

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.759
always
complaining that I'm never high and things

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:38.560
would be much more
interesting high, when I went to the dentist

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.920
and knew I
was going to get some heavy dental surgery

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.880
and knew they
were going to give me stuff that would really

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.490
fuck me
up, I invited Trey Parker over that afternoon.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.800
So the
only person who had hung out with me high

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.920
is Trey Parker and
we made a little pact that whenever I get

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.190
serious dental
work done and they're gonna put me under and

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.550
liquid Valium, Trey is going to be there because
we meet on

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.600
this Trey Parker level.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:08.519
[laughter] You know, I think it only
matters because I graduated from high school

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:12.889
in 1973 in a
rural high school -- Greenfield, Massachusetts,

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:18.360
a dead
factory town -- and every single student that

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.079
I knew in
my classes was tripping and on heroin and

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:24.310
drunk all the
time.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.709
And the reason I, one of the major reasons
I did

00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:30.041
not go to college is I wanted to get away
from people who

00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:31.201
were on drugs.

00:16:31.201 --> 00:16:36.019
I was so sick of being around people
who were stoned and so sick of being around

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:40.740
people who
were drunk by the time I hit 17, that I get

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.740
in the habit
of repeating it all the time just so people

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.079
after the show don't ask me to go get high.

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:51.910
I will say, politically, I'm
in favor of all of that being completely legal.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.062
The fact we
lock up people for what they put in their

00:16:54.062 --> 00:16:58.019
own body is an
atrocity.

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:06.941
The amount of people we put in jail -- not
only the horrible inhumane act that is, but

00:17:06.941 --> 00:17:09.700
also, on a
much less important level, the amount of people

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.170
we spend
to lock up people who are just putting stuff

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.580
in their own body is awful.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.230
But I mention
it too much and maybe because my mom and dad

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.250
were teetotalers.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.850
My grandparents were teetotalers.

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:25.520
And
there may be certain kind of family pride

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520
in that.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.100
And also I tend to--.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.041
Things that make me different from other people,
I tend to

00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:36.870
push and celebrate like other people to do
that.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.270
If you
watch everything I do, that particular point

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.100
comes up
really often.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.220
Not as much as I say mother fucker, but it
comes up pretty often.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.220
It's just true.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.580
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Hi, I have two questions if
I have a chance to get to

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.580
both of them.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.830
And they're totally unrelated.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.140
So the
first is about Sam Harris.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.480
You mention the Moral Landscape.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.310
I
happen to be ironically reading the End of

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:06.220
Faith last year when I
was in Jerusalem and I was there just as a

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.220
tourist, you know.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.490
&gt;&gt;Penn: [laughs] As opposed to a pilgrim or
terrorist [laughter].

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:17.180
&gt;&gt; Female #1: I was also there for work though.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.340
But what I found most
interesting about that book, and if you're

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.200
familiar with
it you'll know what I'm talking about, is

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.900
that Sam Harris
kind of makes the point that World War III

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.830
will effective be caused by the fighting between
the Christians, the Muslims and the Jews and

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.190
I was kind of wondering whether or not you
agreed with

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.740
that perspective that he has.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.620
&gt;&gt;Penn: You know, all the stuff that comes
out that's

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.570
depressing, all the World War III, end of
the world stuff,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:52.800
I always go back to thinking about my dad
in 1971, you

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.230
know.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.600
What the world must have seemed like then
when

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.750
students were shot at Kent State.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.350
When our president
was, regardless of what your politics are

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.850
or what you
thought of Nixon or the Nixon administration,

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.760
he had lost his mind.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.360
With all
the Nixon jokes aside, the President of the

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.240
United States
had gone crazy.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.610
He was going to step down.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.850
We'd gone
off the gold standard.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.390
The UN was out of its mind.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.740
Vietnam was going to go on forever.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:29.560
And that time that
my dad had to deal with when he was my age,

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.490
really seems
like the end of the world.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:41.230
And I am -- I think a -- I
can't defend this, but in my heart I'm a real

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.230
optimist.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.660
Everything seems really good to me.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.360
I think it might be
part of being raised by a mom and dad -- my

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.371
dad didn't
get the memo that dads were supposed to do

00:19:52.371 --> 00:19:54.800
conditional
love and moms unconditional love.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.570
I just had a mom and
dad and sister that loved me completely and

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.010
supported me and I have
always had good friends.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.440
So things have gone pretty well.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.450
So
maybe that distorts your point of view.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:08.850
I know about all
that apocalyptic stuff.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:14.760
I've talked with Christopher
Hitchens who will just say all your optimism

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.340
can be shot down with one word -- Nigeria
-- you know.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.760
It's full of
Muslims.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.880
It's going to go nuclear and it's the end
of

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.910
the world starting right there.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.910
Boom.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.820
And Christopher
Hitchens.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.130
Whenever you're in a disagreement with
Christopher Hitchens, it's like having a traffic

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.950
accident with a police officer.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.980
You know who's wrong.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.970
[laughter]
Anything I argue with Hitchens on, I believe

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:41.970
I'm wrong.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.120
And Hitchens is, with his view of politics,
he kind of thinks

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.200
that same thing.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:55.910
I also know that it feels to me like
what we're seeing with religious extremists

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.960
also feels
desperate to me and is dangerous and is horrible

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.190
and the
deaths that are coming.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.110
It does feel desperate.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:08.180
It
feels like since 9/11, this is just what I'm

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.180
feeling.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.180
I have no basis for this.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.680
I want to separate that.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.350
This
is in the realm of poetry not the realm of

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.770
fact.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:22.920
It seemed before 9/11,
atheists were really strident and aggressive

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.680
and loud and
unpleasant and religious people were kind

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.270
of like more
laid back.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:34.120
When you watch TV, that's the way they looked
in their little boxes.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.560
It was atheists kind of banging
their fists and yelling and the religious

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.810
people kind of
being sedate.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:46.630
And since 9/11 not just because of 911, it
seems we're seeing another thing happening.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.640
We're seeing
a lot of smiling, gentle atheists and a lot

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.150
of absolutely
panicked religious people.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:00.640
So I think one of the reasons
that everything feels so scary right now is

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.210
that the
number of atheists is going through the roof

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.340
and is going
through the roof in a very, very different

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.340
way.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.230
It's not
going through the roof that there are atheist

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.040
socialism.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.450
It's not going through the roof in the Ayn
Rand thing.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.800
It's just going through the roof of a lot
of people caring

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.100
about the world we have now and caring about
each other and going through it.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:27.360
So I read that Sam Harris stuff and
he makes really good points and he's probably

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.510
right but I
just don't feel it.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:34.960
I don't think that the wars are
going to be centered that way.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.680
I think that people are
getting more and more disgusted with just

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.800
this top-down
kind of thinking . And I think that everything,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.380
you know,
everything that's changing.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.010
And a huge part of that is
the Internet.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.430
And a huge part of that is making
information available to so many people.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.360
I think it's
really hard in a world that has the Internet

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:03.170
and Google
to keep people in these cloistered environments

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.350
where
they have to keep that raw hate going.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:12.180
Now, suicide
bombers are all well-educated, all really

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.940
nice guys, all
really wealthy.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.250
It's not the poor uneducated people.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.440
And the people that flew the planes on 9/11
all had

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.470
access to computers.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.370
And that argues against the whole
thing, but I still have this hopeful thing

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.270
in my heart
that I think things are just getting better

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.040
and I think
we haven't even started to see what the kind

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.760
of communication
that's happened with the Internet, what Google

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.760
is going to
do.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.340
I just think it's so much bigger than the
Gutenberg

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.870
press and the Gutenberg press invented the
United States

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.710
of America.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.770
That's the idea that's based on that kind
of information

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:51.830
being shared.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:58.480
And I'm just waiting for the country,
for the politics, that's truly and honestly

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480
based on
Google.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:05.180
And I mean that Google as the brand name and
also Google as the generic term for search

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.290
engine,
because you don't want me to use it that way

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.150
because then your
brand name goes away and you're all fucked.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.150
[laughter]

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.760
&gt;&gt; Female #1: My second question is about
the irony of the Church

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.460
of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and how that
Pastafanarianism, or

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.050
however you pronounce it, is growing to a
point where it

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.710
becomes kind of ridiculous because it is,
in and of itself,

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.510
a religion even though it's supposed to be
not having a

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:30.510
religion.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:36.160
&gt;&gt; Penn: You know, there's nothing --. When
a joke goes too far,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.260
you know, there's the expression it's really
funny till

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.940
someone loses an eye and then it's hysterical.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.380
[laughter] I think
that's absolutely true.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.980
When you have the flying
spaghetti monster elevated and used in those

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.900
court cases,
it's really terrific.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:25:00.620
I mean, if, it really does,
those absurdest things really do test the

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.930
laws and test
what we really want to do.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.650
I mean, there was, what I was
hoping for with the SubGenius.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.130
The SubGenius was around in the 70s.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.790
I don't
know if anybody remembers Bob Dobbs.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.760
But I was a
SubGenius from the beginning along with Mark

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.920
Mothersbaugh, all those cats,
late 70s, early 80s cats.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:25.060
And I was really hoping that
that would do with the flying spaghetti monster

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.060
had done.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:32.420
But that was much more, that was--.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:39.570
Bob Dobbs was a
religious/ anti-religious idea that was done

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.000
by artists.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.750
And I believe the flying spaghetti monster
is

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:48.010
anti-religious idea that's done essentially
by scientists.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.690
And therefore, flying spaghetti monster is
a much better

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.700
tool to argue.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.700
And that argument is important.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.260
I mean,
I've been talking to Andy Thomson who wrote

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.760
this great
book Why We Believe in God.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.830
And he's a forensic shrink.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.010
He talks to people who do horrendous stuff.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.830
And one of
the things we were talking about along these

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:16.010
lines of 'even
people who say they believe in God don't believe'.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.640
It's
very interesting that in this country in our

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.550
legal system, we
have guilty, we have not guilty, and we have

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.630
not guilty
by reason of insanity.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:33.070
We do not have any sort of plea
for "God told me to."

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:38.610
And if you go to the Bible belts,
the absolutely Bible belts, with a judge who's

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.780
an
absolute believer, with an all fundamentalist

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.550
Christian
jury and you go in front of that jury and

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:50.160
your client
says that she was told by God to kill her

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.170
family, like the
Yates case, she was told that.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:58.490
You don't get anybody in the press or
anywhere saying, "we better look into this

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.050
and see if God
told her to".

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.310
[laughter] "We'd better check".

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:07.360
I mean, that's a laugh line and yet when
you read the Bible, it happens over and over

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.360
again.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.950
And
religious people have this sense that they

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.381
believe
absolutely in the literal interpretation of

00:27:14.381 --> 00:27:19.190
the Bible and
all that is absolutely true, but has no application

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.420
whatsoever to our time now.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:27.050
And just the fact that going
in to a court case and saying, "God speaks

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.580
to you and you
hear voices," you know?

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.810
Exactly like seeing the burning
bush.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.830
Exactly like it's described in the Bible.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.970
Is
laying down the foundation for an insanity

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.120
defense.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.530
It's
weird that our court system that has "in God

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.320
we trust" on
the money and wants to put the ten commandments

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.140
on the
wall, completely, completely ignores the possibility

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.400
that
there is God in our lives.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.080
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Hi Penn.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.410
I just want to say one thing real fast before
a

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.410
question.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.410
I've seen you a couple of times and every
time

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.850
you have this -- you're very good at stopping
the

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.780
hysteria and going, "the kids are all right;
stop worrying about everybody".

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.130
And I
appreciate the fact; you are a very prominent

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.941
voice for that point of view.

00:28:10.941 --> 00:28:13.580
My question is
actually -- I'm going to move a little bit

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.580
away.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.630
You
spent a fair amount of time in England recently

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.970
doing Fool Us, which of course I would have
never seen being in the United

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.970
States.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:22.970
I've only heard rumors.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.080
&gt;&gt;Penn: No, no, there's all sorts of commercials
on now so you can see it

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:31.340
&gt;&gt; Male #3: So my question is how
do you feel that the audiences, both in terms

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.870
of, if you
want to talk about the theist/atheist split,

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.010
because I know there's a big difference between
the U.S. and England, but also as a magician.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:43.270
How do you feel the audiences
are different across the pond than your native

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.340
Vegas?

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:50.960
&gt;&gt; Penn: It used to be true and I think -- when
I say used to

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.000
be before me I believe it was true in my lifetime.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.470
I've
been on the road with Penn and Teller for

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.870
about 35 years and I
believe when we started out.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.870
And this is very hard
because there's no control group.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.890
You know, we've also
gotten more successful.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.310
Other things change as well.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:16.430
But it felt like -- and maybe this was all
an illusion,

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.880
but it felt like in the first ten years of
touring that

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.950
where we went mattered.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.820
It felt like you could feel
something when you did a show in Toronto as

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.100
opposed to
doing a show in Houston.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.080
It felt like when you were
doing jokes and standing out there, there

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.390
was a different
reaction.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:40.220
15 years ago, I could still feel a reaction
--

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:45.830
New York, Boston, Washington, Chicago, San
Francisco,

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:51.020
LA -- when we would do jokes that were anti-religious,
we

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.900
would get polite applause.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:58.210
In the Bible belt when we
played, the first joke we did that was anti-religious,

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.960
it
would stop the show with applause with screaming.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.640
It was
so positive to that.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:09.071
It threw off the timing of our show
because in the Bible belt, I believe, every

00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:14.710
atheist in town had come out to see Penn and
Teller [laughter] It was 100

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:15.710
percent.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:20.790
And also they were so sick of being surrounded
by this that even the slightest little.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.590
Our live show
was a magic show.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:28.960
There are two references to atheism in
a 90 minute show.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.770
It doesn't really deal with it very
much.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.530
Just a couple little places [snaps fingers]
here and there, but

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.460
those places would explode.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:41.090
And then over the past five
years, I've noticed that less so, too.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:45.280
There's a
homogeneity of audiences.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.850
Used to be that Vegas was very
different than New York.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.640
Now it's not.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.740
And now, because
we have a very successful show called Penn

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:58.600
and Teller: Fool
Us in London in UK -- it's very successful.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.760
I would say
that almost half of our Vegas audiences are

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.760
now from the
UK.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.750
It's just this crazy weird demographic with
the

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.920
economy in Vegas being terrible.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.590
It being the time of
year when people from the UK take vacations

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.060
and us
being very popular over there.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:26.490
And I think the whole
idea -- we did a show 18 years ago over in

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:27.490
London.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.490
We
did live shows.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:29.490
We did TV shows over there.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.620
And I felt
there was a real difference in the audience

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.620
there.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.520
I
just felt reserve quality, a slightly more

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.290
intellectual
quality, a pride in intellectual quality.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:45.290
Like, I think
that they didn't get more jokes than the Americans.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.440
They
want to let you know they got more jokes than

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.960
the
Americans.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.770
And now, I don't feel that at all.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:56.220
I think
that things are moving so quickly in terms

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.360
of
communication.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:03.990
We have a show that's in England and
can't be seen outside of the UK.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.540
And when I mention that
show in front of American audiences, ten percent

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.370
of the
American audiences have seen it.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.210
That wouldn't be true
ten years ago.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:18.560
And you know, none of us especially in
this room, none of us have any idea what's

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.850
really
happening with copyright.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.850
Not only do we not know the
legality, we don't even know the morality.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:29.420
I've talked
with people who've really thought about this.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.210
Not as
much as you've talked to people who've thought

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.290
about
this.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:39.900
But how you deal with a show that's in London,
produced for UK audiences, being seen over

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.410
the web in the
USA.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:45.910
It's a very complicated issue on who that
hurts, who

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.450
the gate keepers are, and whether it's right
to go around

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:50.510
them or not.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.710
I don't even have an opinion on that.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:56.040
But
it has made this homogeneity that I think

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.040
is wonderful.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.600
I think it should be eventually harder to
kill people

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.530
when we feel like it's one world.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:08.460
And one world is not
going to come from religion and one world

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.100
is not going to
come from politics, but one world is inevitable

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.290
with
technology.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:19.030
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Is it all surreal to have starred
in Hackers where

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.000
they're talking about 14.4 modems [Penn laughs]
and then 15 years later

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.830
be standing in Google where you're upstairs
from a gigantic server farm,

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.270
literally standing in the Gibson.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.810
&gt;&gt; Penn: [laughing] It is.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.810
It was goofy.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.070
It was goofy to be in Hackers.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.750
And they asked me to do that part not because
I was the

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.280
biggest box office act they could get, but
because I've

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.490
always been an early-adopter and always been
a big fan

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.170
and I buy things as soon as they come out.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.310
You know, I
tried to get an invitation to Google plus

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.690
as quickly as I
can but it takes me three weeks after other

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:58.690
people.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.800
What
the fuck is up with that?

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.810
You fuckers.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.730
Why aren't I on
that fucking list when I've early-adopted

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.150
everything
you cock-suckers have put out.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:14.309
[laughter] Then I have to go to some
college student in Memphis to have her give

00:34:14.309 --> 00:34:17.470
me an
invitation to your fucking thing.

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.619
Fuck you all in the neck.

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:23.490
[laughter]
But I've always been an early adopter.

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:31.700
And I remember
saying, oh, this is so embarrassing.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:43.159
In 1988 or 89, I was
having supper with Rob Pike who was then at

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.109
Bell Labs and
is now here.

00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:50.309
And I said to Rob Pike, "oh, deer."

00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:53.940
I said
to Rob Pike, I just finished backing up a

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:59.640
book that I had
written and I'd written it on my computer.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.770
And I said
afterwards, "you know?

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:09.250
I think my computer does pretty
much everything I'd ever want it to do."

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:13.720
And Rob said,
"shut up, you stupid fucker".

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:18.160
That compelling argument
"shut up you stupid fucker" is exactly why

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.190
I keep being
an early adopter.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.190
It's really wonderful.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.190
What up there?

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.190
&gt;&gt;Female #2: He has a question.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.190
[laughter]

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:31.450
&gt;&gt;Penn: [inaudible] He has a question.

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.600
How do we do that?.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:38.359
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Go ahead on the VC.
[inaudible]

00:35:38.359 --> 00:35:39.910
[laughter]

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:44.329
&gt;&gt;Penn: I've seen the greatest minds of my
generation.

00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:45.329
Shoot.

00:35:45.329 --> 00:35:50.619
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Yeah, we're not on mute.

00:35:50.619 --> 00:35:55.339
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Put the volume up.

00:35:55.339 --> 00:36:00.500
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Just ask you a question Adam.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.190
&gt;&gt; Male #8: yeah, ask it
&gt;&gt; Male # 9: You could write it.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.670
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male #10: So, I want to ask a question,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.869
but I don't know if you
can hear me or not.

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:11.869
&gt;&gt; Penn: I can hear you.

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:12.869
Go, go, go.

00:36:12.869 --> 00:36:13.869
&gt;&gt; Male #10: All right.

00:36:13.869 --> 00:36:14.869
Cool.

00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:15.869
I guess my name is Adam and first
of all I want to say I'm glad you share my

00:36:15.869 --> 00:36:18.170
taste for
shirt color.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:23.900
Secondly, my biggest hobby for the past 20
years has been magic.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:29.359
And I'm just wondering if there's
a correlation being a magician and being an

00:36:29.359 --> 00:36:30.359
atheist.

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:32.170
I'm
sure you know many magicians throughout your

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.170
career.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.660
Do
you notice people who have and interest or

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.790
an affinity for magic have a predilection
for

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.119
atheism?

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:45.460
&gt;&gt; Penn: I've tried so hard to make that argument.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.279
"Discoverie
of Witchcraft" is the first magic book.

00:36:49.279 --> 00:36:52.150
And it comes out
of the 16th century.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.920
I forgot the date.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.250
1500 some time.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.089
And it is a book that's really heavy.

00:36:58.089 --> 00:37:03.330
It's a book that
separates the idea of magic supernatural from

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:08.039
the idea of
conjuring, prestidigitation, doing tricks.

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:14.559
Since that book, there has been
a very strong movement in magic towards skepticism.

00:37:14.559 --> 00:37:17.269
Then
you get to Houdini and Houdini is an escape

00:37:17.269 --> 00:37:21.690
artist for
the first half of his career using most amazing

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.410
catch
phrase for it.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:30.400
An American man born in Budapest, a Jew
at a time of immigrants.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.559
"I defy the jails of the world
to hold me".

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:37.039
Pretty heavy expression.

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:38.380
Uses that and
becomes very famous.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:43.839
Uses that and then his mom dies and
he's appalled by the spiritualists claiming

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:46.619
to hear from
the dead.

00:37:46.619 --> 00:37:53.480
Spiritualists who would take his mom, he wife
the rabbi who never learned English

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:57.089
and send a message to him from the beyond
grave with a cross at

00:37:57.089 --> 00:38:01.350
the top that said Dear Harry and Harry wasn't
his name.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:02.849
His name was Ehrich Weiss.

00:38:02.849 --> 00:38:06.130
His mother never called him
Harry, but he would get these messages from

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.380
beyond the
grave.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.770
And he changes his whole career.

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.970
There's not
another superstar of his level that changed

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.640
the
intellectual idea of his career halfway through.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.250
And
when I say of his level, it really is for

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:22.780
the 20th century
all you've got left is Elvis and Houdini.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.250
I mean those are the
two battling it out for Most Famous Entertainer.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:30.430
I mean, Jolson, the Beatles and Madonna have
lost.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:32.619
It's down to
Houdini and Elvis.

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:40.040
And I've tried really hard to make
Houdini into an atheist.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.930
I've read everything.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.140
And he
was certainly a hard core skeptic.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:50.410
He was certainly very
skeptical and maybe a non-believer completely

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.829
of life
after death.

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:54.859
But I believe he was religious.

00:38:54.859 --> 00:38:56.079
You can
call him a skeptic.

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.839
I don't think you can call him an
atheist.

00:38:58.839 --> 00:39:04.799
And this battle, this battle between
magicians who think that magicians should

00:39:04.799 --> 00:39:08.609
be skeptical,
should be atheist, should deal with this is

00:39:08.609 --> 00:39:09.789
inside the
proscenium.

00:39:09.789 --> 00:39:13.380
Now we lie; out in the real world, we tell
the

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.730
truth.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:16.510
There's a lot of people on that side.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:18.990
You've got
Amazing Randi.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.400
You've got Banachek.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:27.640
The whole J-ref nonreligious
magician people.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.359
Jamy Ian Swiss.

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:30.510
Mike Close.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.230
Eric Mead
made.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:37.170
You know, the really great magicians in that
kind.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.869
Then you have the other magicians who were
around

00:39:40.869 --> 00:39:44.819
during Houdini's time and continue to be around
today who

00:39:44.819 --> 00:39:45.819
really believe.

00:39:45.819 --> 00:39:51.079
And I have had conversations with David
Blaine and he actually believes this.

00:39:51.079 --> 00:39:53.840
He does not want to
use the word trick.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:00.279
And he believes that the purpose of
magic is to add mystery to the real world.

00:40:00.279 --> 00:40:04.249
He would like
to, on purpose, muddy the information that's

00:40:04.249 --> 00:40:07.750
out there,
using tricks and not saying they're tricks,

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:11.390
so that people
blur that whole idea.

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:17.249
Our point of view is very
strongly, we're all working on the mysteries.

00:40:17.249 --> 00:40:20.920
There's
so much confusion out there anyway that using

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.160
lies and
cheating in order to confuse people about

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.040
reality seems
to me to be morally wrong.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:36.180
But David Blaine and Criss
Angel, if you want to call them magicians.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.759
Uri Geller and Kreskin, although I
think if you call them magicians they will

00:40:40.759 --> 00:40:41.869
sue you.

00:40:41.869 --> 00:40:44.670
But
from my point of view, possibly magicians.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.770
John
Edwards.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:50.359
People who use tricks in order to confuse
us

00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:51.549
about reality.

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:58.549
So I'd love to say that, being a
magician led to skepticism.

00:40:58.549 --> 00:41:05.940
And it does lead to a
conversation and an obsession with how information

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.579
is
transferred and how to control that information

00:41:09.579 --> 00:41:11.730
and how
to distort that information.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:17.609
And some people use that
very much for "here's a way to tell a better

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:18.640
truth."

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.249
And some people use that to "I want to fuck
people up and

00:41:23.249 --> 00:41:25.619
confuse and mystify."

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:28.369
And I've had discussions with
those people.

00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:34.260
I've talked to David Blaine and Criss Angel
for hours and hours and hours and they still

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.539
stick
with you know I want to tell people I've done

00:41:37.539 --> 00:41:41.010
a card
trick here but now I've got super underwater

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.230
powers.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.460
Okay.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.160
And then there's people like Derren Brown
probably

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.820
the greatest magician in the UK and in some
ways greatest

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.109
magician period.

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:58.460
Derren Brown is wonderful who started
out leaning way towards David Blaine.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.509
And if you're
following Derren Brown's career now in the

00:42:02.509 --> 00:42:08.299
past four
years, he's pretty much over to as close to

00:42:08.299 --> 00:42:12.069
the point of
view of Penn and Teller as you could want.

00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:15.911
And one of the
reasons is that my partner, Teller, is in

00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:18.509
e-mail
conversations with him every day and that

00:42:18.509 --> 00:42:22.369
discussion
between Teller and Derren Brown has gotten

00:42:22.369 --> 00:42:25.609
Derren Brown
to put on a book most recently that is completely

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:27.780
on the
side of skepticism.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.500
So I want to claim that all
magicians are atheists.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:37.749
I want to claim that magic
automatically leads you down the road to skepticism,

00:42:37.749 --> 00:42:39.569
but
that's not true.

00:42:39.569 --> 00:42:42.719
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Any other questions on the VC.

00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:43.719
&gt;&gt; Male #10: Thank you.

00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:44.719
&gt;&gt;Penn: Oh, thank you.

00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:46.760
I forgot that you were there.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.540
&gt;&gt;Male #10: I forget sometimes too.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.540
&gt;&gt; Penn: Yes.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.180
I was pointing to you.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.040
Just say it.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.900
I'll repeat it.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.760
&gt;&gt; Female #3: [inaudible]

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:02.869
&gt;&gt; Penn: She said, considering what you named
your children, what names

00:43:02.869 --> 00:43:03.869
did you reject?

00:43:03.869 --> 00:43:06.040
[laughter] My children's names.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.700
My daughter is 6
year old.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.089
Her name is Moxie CrimeFighter Jillette.

00:43:13.089 --> 00:43:19.130
[applause] And
my son is five years old and his name is Zolton

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.430
Penn
Jillette.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:24.079
Now, the middle name being my first name.

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:26.549
I
don't think is too wacky.

00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:28.490
His first name being Zolton.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.109
That's my wife's maiden name.

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:34.329
And her father had five
daughters.

00:43:34.329 --> 00:43:36.720
They all changed their name when they
married.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:43.220
So the only Zolton he has in his grandchildren
is my son's first name.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.920
Which I hope gets more scratch out of my father-in-law.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.630
[laughter] So that's all perfectly motivated.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.630
The name Moxie for my
daughter.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.530
Moxie is a great, great brand name.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.589
Moxie is a
soda.

00:43:57.589 --> 00:44:01.290
It's called in New England a tonic developed
in

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:06.700
Maine in the late 19th century and and Coca-Cola
took

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:10.059
their whole template from Moxie.

00:44:10.059 --> 00:44:14.490
And Moxie is a drink
that if you were not served it by your parents

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.690
as a
child, you cannot drink it, because it's horrendous

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.480
cough
syrup.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.869
But if you're served it by your parents, it
brings all these memories of home.

00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:25.849
So I happen to love
Moxie.

00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:27.720
And Moxie is an interesting word.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.359
Because Moxie,
as far as I know, starts as a brand name and

00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:36.190
then goes
into a generic name with a different meaning

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.930
because of
the advertising in Moxie and it means gumption.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.069
It means
guts.

00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:42.069
It means balls.

00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:44.760
Try to use a great name for a
girl.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.809
Moxie.

00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:49.740
The middle name CrimeFighter is something
I take a lot of heat for.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:55.490
If anybody saw me on CNN
Piers Morgan thing.

00:44:55.490 --> 00:45:00.231
He jumps all in with how this is
child abuse that my daughter's middle name

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:03.440
is CrimeFighter . And the reason for that
is not me.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.319
The reason
for that is my wife.

00:45:05.319 --> 00:45:07.690
My wife does not have a middle
name.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:11.819
For instance, Harry S Truman if you're writing
it

00:45:11.819 --> 00:45:12.819
correctly.

00:45:12.819 --> 00:45:14.720
Check this out on Google.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.849
The S doesn't have
a period after it.

00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:18.990
Because S was his middle name.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.220
S. No word at all.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.880
I'll get it.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:23.990
It's okay.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.070
And my wife didn't have a
middle name.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:31.760
So my wife was carrying on backstage saying
middle names are fucking bull shit.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.190
We don't need a middle name.

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:34.329
I don't have a
middle name.

00:45:34.329 --> 00:45:35.500
We're not gonna have a middle name.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.300
I said Moxie Jillette is really nice.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.930
She
said fuck it I don't want a middle name.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:40.440
I go just put
anything in there.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.470
And our piano player, Mike Jones, is backstage
with us.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.850
And
Mike Jones just finished reading my novel

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:52.180
that I wrote before this called Sock and
in it one of the characters says "just call

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.230
me CrimeFighter".

00:45:54.230 --> 00:46:00.039
And Jonesy says why don't you give her middle
name Crime Fighter.

00:46:00.039 --> 00:46:01.529
And I went, "Ha-ha-ha-ha".

00:46:01.529 --> 00:46:03.580
My wife said you want a middle name?

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.580
You got it.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.440
It's Moxie CrimeFighter Jillette.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.619
[laughter] And now
I've got to defend it against dipshits on

00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:13.779
CNN.

00:46:13.779 --> 00:46:20.460
But it
does have one upside which is, when she gets

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.599
her driver's
license and when she is pulled over although

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:25.710
I know --
you're all guys.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.579
You're working on cars that drive
themselves.

00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:33.170
And it's going to be in Nevada first and I'm
pushing hard for it to be in Nevada first.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:35.660
And when you
really have cars that drive themselves and

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.900
they really
work and you want someone to try them out

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.180
in Nevada, let's all make a solemn promise
we will not make the

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:47.980
same mistake we did with Google fucking plus
[laughter] and we will

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.809
all call our dear friend in Nevada, Penn Jillette,
and say

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:55.569
do you want your car to drive itself.

00:46:55.569 --> 00:46:58.920
And you have a lot
of money and you don't mind dying, so why

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.030
don't you buy
one right now and get it right now.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:07.650
And I'll go, "Hidey hidey-ho" and I'll love
you all again and the Google plus gaffe will

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:08.940
all be
forgotten.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:13.150
[laughter] But if she is driving her car,
when she's

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:16.200
pulled over and notice I say when not if,
when she's

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.920
pulled over and the police officer is going
to give her a

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.920
ticket.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.380
She'll be able to pull out her license or
I

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.780
guess her Android.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:28.010
Pull out her device.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.319
Show her
driver's license and say, "you know officer,

00:47:31.319 --> 00:47:33.619
we're on the
same side.

00:47:33.619 --> 00:47:36.809
My middle name is CrimeFighter."

00:47:36.809 --> 00:47:39.150
And maybe
she'll get a pass.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.790
Now, that's a story I tell as a joke.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:45.450
But my wife who's a little bit of a weasel.

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:49.749
She was
pulled over speeding in, with the children

00:47:49.749 --> 00:47:52.730
in the
car, in Vegas.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.990
When Moxie was 2 years old.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.779
And she
was pulled over and the officer is writing

00:47:58.779 --> 00:48:02.460
out the
ticket and my wife said, "you know, my husband

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.460
is Penn
Jillette.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.819
You know his daughter?

00:48:04.819 --> 00:48:05.820
You know about his daughter?

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.720
And the police
officer said, "yeah, she has kind of a funny

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:09.720
name."

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.720
She
said, "yes she does.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.480
Her name is Moxie CrimeFighter and
she's on your side, officer".

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.569
[laughter] And he went, "okay.

00:48:18.569 --> 00:48:20.280
Just go
on."

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.890
[laughter] So the name CrimeFighter is a middle
name has

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:25.960
already saved us 120 bucks.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.730
[laughter] Now the real question you
asked was what names did we reject?

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:37.451
We rejected a name
for my son, also suggested by Jonesy, Mike

00:48:37.451 --> 00:48:39.770
Jones, our
wonderful jazz pianist.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:45.700
He also suggested this name
for a boy and I wanted to use my father-in-law's

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.589
surname
for his first name.

00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:48.799
So I rejected this.

00:48:48.799 --> 00:48:50.430
But man is it a
good name.

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:55.440
If any of you are naming boys right now,
please consider this.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:59.650
He wanted me to name him Curly
Howard Jillette.

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:02.259
[laughter] First name, Curly.

00:49:02.259 --> 00:49:04.489
Second name, Howard;
last name, Jillette.

00:49:04.489 --> 00:49:09.819
And for those of you who are too
ignorant, Curly Howard is one of the Three

00:49:09.819 --> 00:49:10.819
Stooges.

00:49:10.819 --> 00:49:14.369
Curly Howard is perhaps the greatest philosopher.

00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:19.509
I mean his real name
Jerome Horwitz, worked on the name Curly Howard,

00:49:19.509 --> 00:49:22.849
is perhaps
one of the biggest heroes in American history.

00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:26.810
And I
loved Curly Howard 'last name here', Curly

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:34.089
Howard because if he turns out
to be a tight ass, mother fucker, kind of

00:49:34.089 --> 00:49:39.500
a dick, he can
just go by C. Howard Jillette and that's fine.

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.940
He can
just say, "call me Howard; call me Howey."

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:43.940
It's fine.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:48.989
But if he turns out to be mother fucker, rock
and roller

00:49:48.989 --> 00:49:55.009
who knows how to go [screaming] [laughter]
Then he can be called

00:49:55.009 --> 00:49:56.009
Curly.

00:49:56.009 --> 00:49:57.150
So I offer that up to you.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:58.950
We are having no more
children.

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.430
They sliced my dick.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.839
It doesn't work anymore.

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:03.630
I'm not going to have any more children.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:08.140
So somebody let
me know if you're having a child, name him

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.509
Curly Howard
Blank.

00:50:10.509 --> 00:50:12.900
Also, great name for a girl.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:16.859
[laughter] Curly Howard does
not have to be a boy's name.

00:50:16.859 --> 00:50:19.900
Curly is a pretty boss name
for a girl.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.510
So that's it.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.240
&gt;&gt; Male #11: Never going to top that.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.069
But since technology and
magic are becoming indistinguishable, have

00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:29.569
you been
incorporating more technology into your magic

00:50:29.569 --> 00:50:30.650
over the
years.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.640
&gt;&gt; Penn: That's exactly wrong.

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:40.050
Because of Google, and before
that because of magazine shows and TV.

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:45.279
Now there are
wonderful stories of technology and magic

00:50:45.279 --> 00:50:46.279
working.

00:50:46.279 --> 00:50:47.819
I
mean, the first use -- some of the first uses

00:50:47.819 --> 00:50:52.440
of ether
were in a magic show sawing women in half.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:59.529
The first
movies were done as part of magic shows.

00:50:59.529 --> 00:51:07.160
Robert-Houdin
was sent to fight an uprising in Africa with

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.150
white man's
magic.

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:16.009
And used an electromagnet to show he had powers
strongest person in the village would go over

00:51:16.009 --> 00:51:18.859
and lift --
what's called the Light-Heavy chest.

00:51:18.859 --> 00:51:22.779
Lift the chest
easily and then he would say, with his powers,

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:25.599
"you are now weaker than a woman."

00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:30.359
He was then unable to
lift the box because the whole stage is electromagnet.

00:51:30.359 --> 00:51:32.599
Run the whole thing through.

00:51:32.599 --> 00:51:37.359
That showed the power of
the English, sorry the French, was greater

00:51:37.359 --> 00:51:41.660
than the
power of the native tribes, indigenous witch

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.660
doctors.

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.049
And then he would also run electrical shock
through the

00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:48.309
handle and slam the guy back.

00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:51.460
So there's a long
tradition.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:59.880
Even braille was used early to give psychic
readers a way to look at notes without the

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.739
blindfold you
can hand braille messages to them.

00:52:02.739 --> 00:52:05.009
Early braille
messages have been used by magicians.

00:52:05.009 --> 00:52:06.920
They've always
been tied to technology.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:13.009
Unfortunately for magicians,
everybody knows the cutting edge of technology

00:52:13.009 --> 00:52:14.619
now.

00:52:14.619 --> 00:52:18.759
People really, one of the things that Google
and other

00:52:18.759 --> 00:52:22.759
technology companies have done, is really
given technology

00:52:22.759 --> 00:52:23.790
to the masses.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:28.890
I mean, people get things instantly with
the exception of my Google plus account.

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:33.680
[laughter] As far as I can
see that's the one mistake Google has made.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.410
[laughter] You get
stuff instantly.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:40.990
So people have a really good sense of
what technology can do.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.810
Even if stuff is impossible.

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:46.339
They have a really good feeling for the trajectory.

00:52:46.339 --> 00:52:48.153
So
anything that you're going to do that's going

00:52:48.153 --> 00:52:49.490
to be rapid
calculation.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:54.849
It's going to be knowing huge amounts of
information.

00:52:54.849 --> 00:52:57.000
People can figure out how to do that.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.849
Anything
with small movement, people can figure out

00:52:59.849 --> 00:53:01.759
how to do that.

00:53:01.759 --> 00:53:07.530
All the magic acts working, I'm going to be
lying a little bit on this, so I'm going to

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.759
be more careful.

00:53:09.759 --> 00:53:15.470
In our 5
and a half hours of new material that we've

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:18.619
done in
Vegas -- Penn and Teller new material -- in

00:53:18.619 --> 00:53:26.881
that entire 5 and a
half hours, done over the past 12 years, there

00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:36.779
is one
thing that uses technology later than 1940.

00:53:36.779 --> 00:53:38.009
One thing.

00:53:38.009 --> 00:53:41.950
The vast majority of things use technology
that's right

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:44.809
around the time of theater lights.

00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:52.310
And probably half of it
is all technology that predates even that.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:56.680
Technology that would go back to the 16th,
17th century.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:04.180
That is not only true for us, it's also true
-- I have to

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.220
go through the whole thing.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.670
It's also true for David
Copperfield.

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:13.400
He's using two things that were probably
within the past 30 years.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.710
I don't mean -- I mean, just
the technology.

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:17.710
Not the other stuff.

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:18.710
There's a lot of
original stuff there.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:23.900
Lance Burton, nothing in the
past 40 years.

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:27.079
Criss Angel, nothing.

00:54:27.079 --> 00:54:33.499
[laughter] It's really
fascinating, because the psychology of fooling

00:54:33.499 --> 00:54:39.089
people --
you have to stay away from things that are

00:54:39.089 --> 00:54:40.089
beautiful.

00:54:40.089 --> 00:54:42.150
That's the most important job in developing
a magic

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:43.150
trick.

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:49.059
If I'm doing a magic trick for you, and the
solution to how it's done is beautiful, and

00:54:49.059 --> 00:54:51.789
the solution
to how it's done is smart, and the solution

00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:57.720
to how it's
done fills you with joy, I will not fool you.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.390
The aha
experience -- the discovery of something;

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:07.240
the learning something -- that
beautiful aha that rushes over you is so heavily

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:11.019
desired
in people that in magic you have to stop people

00:55:11.019 --> 00:55:12.240
from
looking for it.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:18.829
So if I have a trick here that
has a really clever use of a 45 degree angle

00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:21.970
mirror
that's reflecting this and you think it's

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:23.999
here it's
actually there and you're looking through

00:55:23.999 --> 00:55:26.730
and
you can describe that by going, "it's a mirror

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:27.730
like
this."

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:33.660
And what you think of that it's this wonderful
aha feeling, that won't fool any of you.

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.789
Because one of
you will think of it.

00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:37.289
One of you will love it.

00:55:37.289 --> 00:55:39.749
And you
will whisper to the person next to you'"It's

00:55:39.749 --> 00:55:41.099
at 45 degrees".

00:55:41.099 --> 00:55:44.979
. And they will go and
that beautiful meme will spread through the

00:55:44.979 --> 00:55:47.220
whole audience and no one is
fooled.

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:48.220
So it's gone.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:53.970
So you have to make sure that the
way you're doing things is as ugly as possible.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:56.589
You have
to make sure it's gaffer's tape.

00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:58.799
It's a half told lie I hear.

00:55:58.799 --> 00:56:01.229
It's stealing something
from your pocket.

00:56:01.229 --> 00:56:05.920
And it's about 20 different things
that you can't whisper to somebody.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.210
And you have to make
sure that, if you were to tell somebody -- we

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:14.069
end our
show with what I think is a fabulous magic

00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:15.069
trick.

00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:16.069
It's the
bullet catch.

00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:19.470
And it's a trick that's killed 14 people
on stage.

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:23.979
It's the most dangerous trick in show
business.

00:56:23.979 --> 00:56:26.729
And we believe that our method is safe or
we

00:56:26.729 --> 00:56:27.799
wouldn't do it.

00:56:27.799 --> 00:56:32.940
And we don't ever claim that what we do
is dangerous, because I believe that doing

00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:36.349
things that
are really dangerous on stage is an immoral

00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:37.349
act.

00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:39.900
If
you're coming to the show to see me get hurt,

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.900
fuck you.

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.920
I
don't want to see you in the audience.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.660
We are there to
celebrate life.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.029
To celebrate cleverness.

00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:47.390
If you're
looking for a real accident, go see NASCAR,

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:50.380
you douche
bag.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.589
We're not going to get hurt.

00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:53.890
If you're waiting for
that, be disappointed.

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:58.299
We do this trick that is a celebration of
life where bullets are signed by people from

00:56:58.299 --> 00:56:59.299
the audience.

00:56:59.299 --> 00:57:00.299
No plants.

00:57:00.299 --> 00:57:01.569
People from the audience who really know guns.

00:57:01.569 --> 00:57:03.779
And they're shot across the
stage.

00:57:03.779 --> 00:57:06.309
And I ostensibly catch them on my teeth.

00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:09.569
Teller ostensibly catches
a bullet in his teeth.

00:57:09.569 --> 00:57:11.609
And it goes through glass.

00:57:11.609 --> 00:57:13.890
It's
a way good trick.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.529
Way good trick.

00:57:15.529 --> 00:57:19.170
And it fools people a
lot.

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.299
And the reason it fools people is -- and I
won't

00:57:21.299 --> 00:57:24.819
test you on this--, but the reason it fools
people is the

00:57:24.819 --> 00:57:30.019
way we're doing it is so messy and so ugly
that you don't

00:57:30.019 --> 00:57:31.019
care.

00:57:31.019 --> 00:57:34.369
If I started to explain to you in detail the
way

00:57:34.369 --> 00:57:38.049
we did that trick, you would lose interest.

00:57:38.049 --> 00:57:39.590
And there's
no moment in it.

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:45.529
There's not one moment in it that any
of you would go, "oh, yeah -- I get it!"

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:49.019
Because it's
all these little, tiny, eeny-meeny, really,

00:57:49.019 --> 00:57:52.009
really that all build up and
you kind of thought this.

00:57:52.009 --> 00:57:56.880
And it's all these smaller lie
that conceals the bigger lie.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.510
You know when you're
putting a hoop around something, you want

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:01.910
to show there's
no threads and there's no wires and you put

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:02.910
a hoop around it.

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:05.900
Well, that's a very big
lie to put a hoop around it.

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:09.089
So you put a hole in the hoop that goes over
the

00:58:09.089 --> 00:58:11.829
wire and your little lie the hole in the hoop
that no one

00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:15.930
worries about conceals the big lie how this
thing is

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:16.930
floating.

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:17.930
Now that's just one example.

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:20.539
If you want the
bullet catch, it's ten of those things.

00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:25.079
And I would
also, the way you keep magic secret.

00:58:25.079 --> 00:58:30.180
Jim Steinmeyer
great writer on magic, has said that in magic

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:34.010
we're
guarding a safe that's empty.

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:37.819
There are no real secrets
in magic.

00:58:37.819 --> 00:58:41.079
The way that you conceal it is make it ugly
and

00:58:41.079 --> 00:58:42.079
uninteresting.

00:58:42.079 --> 00:58:46.380
I offer this challenge on radio many
times.

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.920
And I'll offer it here.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.249
Because this room -- the
stakes get very, very high.

00:58:52.249 --> 00:58:57.160
And I won't tell you what the
magic trick is because that would be violating

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.299
a trust of
a friend of mine.

00:58:59.299 --> 00:59:04.329
But there is a magic trick that I
consider to be one of the greatest magic tricks

00:59:04.329 --> 00:59:07.200
done in
modern times.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.200
It's not done by us.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.800
It's done by
somebody else.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.800
And it is impossible.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:17.220
And I will
guarantee that more than half of you have

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.220
seen it.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.220
Not
live, but you've seen it.

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.460
And two thirds of you have
heard about it.

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.599
Really good trick.

00:59:23.599 --> 00:59:28.529
And people will come up
to me all the time and say, "how does blank

00:59:28.529 --> 00:59:29.529
do that
trick?"

00:59:29.529 --> 00:59:30.960
How did he do that trick?"

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.430
So you know that it's
a man.

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.089
Since there are only four women in magic and
most

00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:39.869
of them are in China, I'm not giving you much.

00:59:39.869 --> 00:59:45.240
And I say
to those people, "he has a patent on how that

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.759
trick is
done.

00:59:46.759 --> 00:59:49.200
It is in the patent office.

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.170
And the patent is
about 100-page patent that explains in detail

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:54.539
how
everything is done."

00:59:54.539 --> 00:59:56.549
And this is exactly what I say on
the radio.

00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:59.019
You can all go to Google.

00:59:59.019 --> 01:00:02.079
You can all look up "patent office".

01:00:02.079 --> 01:00:04.220
You can all look up "magic tricks".

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.440
You can go through
those that are patented and you can find your

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.119
favorite
trick and then you can go and start to read

01:00:11.119 --> 01:00:12.119
it.

01:00:12.119 --> 01:00:14.499
Start at
the abstract and you can start reading that

01:00:14.499 --> 01:00:16.749
120 pages.

01:00:16.749 --> 01:00:21.650
And you will find out in as much detail as
I know how

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.650
that trick is done.

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:25.609
I mean, absolutely your dream come
true.

01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:26.839
You'll find out how it's done.

01:00:26.839 --> 01:00:30.359
And then I finish
on the radio by saying, "once you've found

01:00:30.359 --> 01:00:33.460
that and
you've read the whole thing and you've understood

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.859
it and feel good about the
answer, just get in touch with me and tell

01:00:36.859 --> 01:00:38.109
me you've done it."

01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:41.009
And I've done that
on the Howard Stern show.

01:00:41.009 --> 01:00:42.710
I've done that on Opie and Anthony.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:47.099
I have done that on many, many, big national
shows and no

01:00:47.099 --> 01:00:49.009
one has ever come back to me.

01:00:49.009 --> 01:00:54.239
Now, I've had five or six
people showing off saying, "oh, yeah, yeah,

01:00:54.239 --> 01:00:56.980
yeah -- I
figured out the trick you were talking about.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.420
I found
the patent.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.650
I read a little bit of it."

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:03.140
That's not
good enough.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.729
You have to be able to feel like you could
build it from reading that.

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:12.230
So what mostly conceals
magic is not that we can have technology that's

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:15.009
ahead of
what anybody else has.

01:01:15.009 --> 01:01:21.329
Because in the 18th century, the
19th century, it was possible for wealthy

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:26.019
magicians to
get their hands on technology that the masses

01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:27.460
didn't
have.

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:33.599
Now in the 21st century, two magicians from
Vegas,

01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:36.769
regardless of their success, are not going
to be able to

01:01:36.769 --> 01:01:40.599
get their hands on technology that everybody
in this room

01:01:40.599 --> 01:01:41.950
doesn't know about.

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:46.240
And you people in this room are
working not on keeping that to yourself, but

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.200
getting the
information out there.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.539
And getting the information out
there is the beautiful thing you're doing

01:01:51.539 --> 01:01:52.539
in the world.

01:01:52.539 --> 01:01:53.990
It may lead to world peace.

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:58.069
And while you're doing that,
you're fucking up magicians and I'm fine with

01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:59.430
both of
those things.

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:00.430
[Applause]

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:08.009
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: We just have time for
one last question.

01:02:08.009 --> 01:02:09.140
&gt;&gt;Penn: She's got it.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.140
She's already starting.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.609
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Wait for the mic.

01:02:11.609 --> 01:02:13.109
And then Penn is going to sign some
books.

01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:15.069
&gt;&gt; Penn: Okay.

01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:16.069
[laughter]

01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:20.619
&gt;&gt; Female #4: I'm leaving for Vegas in five
minutes.

01:02:20.619 --> 01:02:26.690
Besides your
own, what other -- beside your own show what

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:29.950
other magic
show do you like in Vegas?

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:32.059
And what's your favorite place for dinner?

01:02:32.059 --> 01:02:34.160
&gt;&gt; Penn: Be very careful.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:40.220
And notice what is glaring in its
omission from what I say.

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:44.200
Because the magic shows that I
don't mention as shows you should go to are

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.719
shows you should not go to, but I will
not warn you against them.

01:02:48.719 --> 01:02:49.719
[laughter]

01:02:49.719 --> 01:02:54.259
&gt;&gt; Penn: You should go see Mac King.

01:02:54.259 --> 01:02:57.930
Mac King is the greatest
comedy magician alive.

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.799
He does an afternoon show at
Harrah's.

01:03:00.799 --> 01:03:03.859
I underline the fact -- you can remember him
as macking

01:03:03.859 --> 01:03:07.200
But it's Mac, M-a-c-k-i-n-g.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.819
You won't see big ads for it.

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:10.440
It's not a big deal.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.380
It's an afternoon show.

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.549
Every day except Sunday and Monday at 1 and
3.

01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:18.549
It's like
8 bucks to get in.

01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:21.700
You can get a free ticket with a
drink or something.

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:25.219
But it's the best comedy magic show in
Vegas.

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:26.219
Absolutely see it.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:27.619
No reservations at all.

01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:34.619
And
the place to eat is one of the two 5-star

01:03:34.619 --> 01:03:35.619
Thai
restaurants.

01:03:35.619 --> 01:03:39.690
I mean, even better than the Thai food out
here.

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:40.779
[laughter] Serious.

01:03:40.779 --> 01:03:43.729
Is called Lotus of Siam.

01:03:43.729 --> 01:03:46.650
And Lotus of
Siam is not on the strip.

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:51.990
It's in an industrial mall
about two miles off the strip.

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:55.950
And the industrial mall
has a Salvation Army clothing store.

01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:59.910
A sex swing club.

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:02.829
And Lotus of Siam so I'm thinking that's a
whole evening

01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:03.910
for you..

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:04.910
[laughter]

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:11.799
&gt;&gt; Penn: But Lotus of Siam is as good as any
restaurant

01:04:11.799 --> 01:04:13.410
anywhere in the world.

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:17.609
And it's in the dirty industrial
shopping mall in Las Vegas.

01:04:17.609 --> 01:04:18.859
Go there.

01:04:18.859 --> 01:04:20.880
Don't be a pussy.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.240
Say, "bring me food."

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.239
Don't order off the menu; just get what you
want.

01:04:26.239 --> 01:04:29.160
Lotus
of Siam, Mac King and you'll be happy.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.269
And also you can
come see our show and that will be nice, too.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:35.969
And then
there are no other magic shows in Vegas that

01:04:35.969 --> 01:04:37.469
you need to
consider.

01:04:37.469 --> 01:04:38.469
[Applause]

01:04:38.469 --> 01:04:41.880
&gt;&gt; Penn: I'll sign some books.
