here at playtime today so we're gonna

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560
here at playtime today so we're gonna
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.260
here at playtime today so we're gonna
kind of assume that you'll know about

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270
kind of assume that you'll know about
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.810

a bit more detail about what Jan

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700
a bit more detail about what Jan
 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.910
a bit more detail about what Jan
announced earlier and then Fergus who's

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
announced earlier and then Fergus who's
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.080
announced earlier and then Fergus who's
gonna come up who's going to tell you a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
gonna come up who's going to tell you a
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.460
gonna come up who's going to tell you a
little bit more about why you should

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
little bit more about why you should
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.429
little bit more about why you should
really really care about your vitals so

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
really really care about your vitals so
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.279
really really care about your vitals so
first thing I made a bit of an

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
first thing I made a bit of an
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.570
first thing I made a bit of an
assumption that you do all know about

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
assumption that you do all know about
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.339
assumption that you do all know about
your Android vitals right good night

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
your Android vitals right good night
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.310
your Android vitals right good night
show of hands maybe everybody who's

didn't put their hands up so just for
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.650
didn't put their hands up so just for
you and your vitals it's 15 engineering

are the main quality issues that are
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.050
are the main quality issues that are
really affecting your app and perhaps

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
really affecting your app and perhaps

why you're not seeing the performance on

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
why you're not seeing the performance on
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280
why you're not seeing the performance on
your in your your business metrics that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
your in your your business metrics that
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.830
your in your your business metrics that
you may expect but having said that it's

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
you may expect but having said that it's
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810
you may expect but having said that it's
still really really important to to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
still really really important to to
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910
still really really important to to
recognize this these are still

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
recognize this these are still
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.060
recognize this these are still
engineering quality metrics it's up to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
engineering quality metrics it's up to
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249
engineering quality metrics it's up to
your engineering team to actually fix

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
your engineering team to actually fix
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.980
your engineering team to actually fix
the issues that vitals identifies

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
the issues that vitals identifies
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.630
the issues that vitals identifies
therefore it's really really crucial

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
therefore it's really really crucial
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.100
therefore it's really really crucial
that your engineering time actually is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
that your engineering time actually is
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.050
that your engineering time actually is
using vitals and is going into the play

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
using vitals and is going into the play
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.760
using vitals and is going into the play
console and is looking through they're

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
console and is looking through they're
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.440
console and is looking through they're
going through all of the metrics that we

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
going through all of the metrics that we
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.139
going through all of the metrics that we
have available to to see what issues are

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
have available to to see what issues are
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.270
have available to to see what issues are
coming up because those are the guys

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280

coming up because those are the guys
that can fix it so for all of those here

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
that can fix it so for all of those here
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.389
that can fix it so for all of those here
who who didn't put the end up just now

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
who who didn't put the end up just now
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.980
who who didn't put the end up just now
come join the hundred thousand

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
come join the hundred thousand
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410
come join the hundred thousand
developers including it I think about

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
developers including it I think about
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510
developers including it I think about
half maybe more than half of the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
half maybe more than half of the
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.770
half maybe more than half of the
developers that I saw just now

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
developers that I saw just now
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.610
developers that I saw just now
that are using vitals already so I just

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
that are using vitals already so I just
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.920
that are using vitals already so I just
want to do a quick overview of what's in

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930
want to do a quick overview of what's in
 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.420
want to do a quick overview of what's in
vitals today and a few things that we

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430
vitals today and a few things that we
 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.949
vitals today and a few things that we
launched recently and then I'll go into

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959
launched recently and then I'll go into
 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.420
launched recently and then I'll go into
a bit more detail about what we're

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430
a bit more detail about what we're
 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.730
a bit more detail about what we're
launching today

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740
launching today
 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.300

so Android vitals is split into five

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310
so Android vitals is split into five
 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.070
so Android vitals is split into five
different performance areas so we have

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080
different performance areas so we have
 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.970
different performance areas so we have
stability battery rendering and then

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980
stability battery rendering and then
 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.309
stability battery rendering and then
since Google IO we added apps start at

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319
since Google IO we added apps start at
 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.309
since Google IO we added apps start at
time and also permissions now within

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319
time and also permissions now within
 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.800
time and also permissions now within
those five performance areas we have 15

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
those five performance areas we have 15
 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.610
those five performance areas we have 15
different metrics for you those metrics

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620
different metrics for you those metrics
 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.979
different metrics for you those metrics
are broken down by at least three

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989
are broken down by at least three
 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.390
are broken down by at least three
different dimensions now the set of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
different dimensions now the set of
 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.250
different dimensions now the set of
dimension varies from one metric to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260
dimension varies from one metric to
 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.320
dimension varies from one metric to
another but generally we have things

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330
another but generally we have things
 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.559
another but generally we have things
like operating system version apk

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569
like operating system version apk
 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.380
like operating system version apk
version release tracks or whether it is

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390
version release tracks or whether it is
 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.250
version release tracks or whether it is
alpha beta or prod and then there's a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260
alpha beta or prod and then there's a
 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.750
alpha beta or prod and then there's a
few other metrics which are kind of more

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760
few other metrics which are kind of more
 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.540
few other metrics which are kind of more
specific to a particular sorry a few

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550
specific to a particular sorry a few
 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.800
specific to a particular sorry a few
more dimensions that are more specific

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810
more dimensions that are more specific
 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.930
more dimensions that are more specific
to particular metrics so we have a lot

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940
to particular metrics so we have a lot
 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.940
to particular metrics so we have a lot
of data that you can really really delve

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950
of data that you can really really delve
 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.270
of data that you can really really delve
into here and we go into a little bit

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280
into here and we go into a little bit
 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.310
into here and we go into a little bit
more detail that the things that we

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320
more detail that the things that we
 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.319
more detail that the things that we
launched at i/o as well so with app

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329

app may be in we want to allow you to
 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.479
app may be in we want to allow you to
measure how often an app takes too long

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489
measure how often an app takes too long
 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.640
measure how often an app takes too long

all know about the dynamic permission

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530
all know about the dynamic permission
 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.979

them why they should grant the app this
 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.539
them why they should grant the app this
permission then quite often they'll go

then have the the full functionality

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210
then have the the full functionality
 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.220
then have the the full functionality
that you want

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230

these as I said these are the ones are

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650
these as I said these are the ones are
 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.810
these as I said these are the ones are
the most important to the user

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820
the most important to the user
 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.840
the most important to the user
experience now there's a lot of metrics

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850
experience now there's a lot of metrics
 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.300
experience now there's a lot of metrics
there 15 but these are the ones that we

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310
there 15 but these are the ones that we
 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.860
there 15 but these are the ones that we
have prioritized in order to help you

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870
have prioritized in order to help you
 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.180
have prioritized in order to help you
prioritize we've also added an

prioritize we've also added an
 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.640
prioritize we've also added an
additional piece of information to each

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650
additional piece of information to each
 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.900
additional piece of information to each
of these metrics which we call the bad

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040
whole if you're below the bad behavior
 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.700
whole if you're below the bad behavior
threshold then you can consider your app

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710
threshold then you can consider your app
 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.670
threshold then you can consider your app
to be performing well on that metric and

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680
to be performing well on that metric and
 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.250

as I said real users real world then you

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040
as I said real users real world then you
 

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.889
as I said real users real world then you
will see that in the pre launch reports

00:09:19.889 --> 00:09:19.899
will see that in the pre launch reports
 

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:21.989

00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:58.990
understand how the performance was
 

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.170
understand how the performance was
throughout the whole lifecycle and what

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.180
throughout the whole lifecycle and what
 

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.400
throughout the whole lifecycle and what
they found is that it they were actual

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:02.410
they found is that it they were actual
 

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.870
they found is that it they were actual
performance was terrible

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880
performance was terrible
 

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.030
performance was terrible
so they actually rewrote their whole

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.040
so they actually rewrote their whole
 

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.340
so they actually rewrote their whole
sign up and login process and reduce

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:08.350
sign up and login process and reduce
 

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.500
sign up and login process and reduce
that I started trying this reflected in

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:10.510
that I started trying this reflected in
 

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.300
that I started trying this reflected in
buyouts and in firebase performance

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:12.310
buyouts and in firebase performance
 

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.150
buyouts and in firebase performance
monitoring and I think it's important to

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:15.160
monitoring and I think it's important to
 

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.860
monitoring and I think it's important to
point out here why would you use fires

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:16.870
point out here why would you use fires
 

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.210
point out here why would you use fires
performance monitoring and Android

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:18.220
performance monitoring and Android
 

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.160
performance monitoring and Android

get us data is the core question to that

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760
get us data is the core question to that
 

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.330
get us data is the core question to that
so Android vitals is based on the data

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:24.340
so Android vitals is based on the data
 

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.040
so Android vitals is based on the data
that comes from the Android platform

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.050
that comes from the Android platform
 

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.930
that comes from the Android platform
itself and this is powered by the

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:27.940
itself and this is powered by the
 

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.610

performance monitoring tool is based on

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:37.300
performance monitoring tool is based on
 

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.750
performance monitoring tool is based on
you instrumenting your own application

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760
you instrumenting your own application
 

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.570
you instrumenting your own application
and you then being able to collect data

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:42.580
and you then being able to collect data
 

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.700
and you then being able to collect data
a certain point in your application and

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:44.710
a certain point in your application and
 

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.710
a certain point in your application and
it fundamentally comes down to timers

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720
it fundamentally comes down to timers
 

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.630
it fundamentally comes down to timers
and counters in the firebase forints

even and so as we all know quality

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960
even and so as we all know quality
 

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.300
even and so as we all know quality
across the whole Android system is

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:03.310
across the whole Android system is
 

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.040
across the whole Android system is
improving and if you and your whole

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.050
improving and if you and your whole
 

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.260
improving and if you and your whole
entire company are not looking at your

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:07.270
entire company are not looking at your
 

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.640
entire company are not looking at your
performance of your application and

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:08.650
performance of your application and
 

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.350
performance of your application and
these technical metrics then you're

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360
these technical metrics then you're
 

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.520
these technical metrics then you're
gonna be left behind

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:13.530
 
 

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.410
 
okay go one last I study that we did

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:18.420
okay go one last I study that we did
 

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.800
okay go one last I study that we did
this just shows how increased quality

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:21.810
this just shows how increased quality
 

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.990
this just shows how increased quality
equals increased engagement what we did

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000
equals increased engagement what we did
 

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.960
equals increased engagement what we did
is we looked at games that had users

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:27.970
is we looked at games that had users
 

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.390
is we looked at games that had users
with a really high crash rate and users

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400
with a really high crash rate and users
 

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.850
with a really high crash rate and users
who had a low crash rate it costs the

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:32.860
who had a low crash rate it costs the
 

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.220
who had a low crash rate it costs the
same game and what we found is that

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:35.230
same game and what we found is that
 

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.760
same game and what we found is that
users had two men and a half minutes

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:38.770
users had two men and a half minutes
 

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.460
users had two men and a half minutes
less engagement in the app when they had

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:41.470
less engagement in the app when they had
 

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.370
less engagement in the app when they had
a high crash rate and the trend was even

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:44.380
a high crash rate and the trend was even
 

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.050
a high crash rate and the trend was even
stronger for users who had a high a

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:46.060
stronger for users who had a high a
 

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.680
stronger for users who had a high a
and/or rage now this equates to if a

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:49.690
and/or rage now this equates to if a
 

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.820
and/or rage now this equates to if a
user was playing your game every single

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:50.830
user was playing your game every single
 

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.940
user was playing your game every single
day to about 20 hours a year of less

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:53.950
day to about 20 hours a year of less
 

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.220
day to about 20 hours a year of less
engagement time in your game and we all

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:56.230
engagement time in your game and we all
 

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.590
engagement time in your game and we all
know time is money so really focusing on

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600
know time is money so really focusing on
 

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.840
know time is money so really focusing on
increasing your quality will increase

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:00.850
increasing your quality will increase
