00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.850
Converting from miles to kilometers,
or kilometers to miles is one example

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.890
of a conversion between the US and
Metric systems.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.410
And these conversions
work just like any other,

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.030
except oftentimes the numbers
aren't quite as pretty.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.987
For example, one mile is equal

00:00:18.987 --> 00:00:22.996
to about 1.609 km.

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:28.780
So using this information, you should
be able to answer a question like,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.158
if you run 5 km,
how many miles do you run?

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:33.740
And you answer in this box.
