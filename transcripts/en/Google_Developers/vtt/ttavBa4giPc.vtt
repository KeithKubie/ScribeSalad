00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:09.601
Germick:
Okay. Hello there.

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.901
Pac-Man fever.

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.133
man:
Whoo!

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.267
Germick:
Whoo! All right.

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:14.901
Welcome to "The Secrets
of Google Pac-Man."

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:16.200
Wichary:
Thank you for coming.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.868
Germick:
I am Ryan Germick.

00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:21.834
I am the creative lead
of the Google Doodle Team.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:23.334
There I am,
eating a doughnut.

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:24.467
Wichary:
And I am Marcin Wichary.

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:27.033
I am a user experience
designer/developer

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.067
on the Chrome team.

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:30.501
And, let's see.

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:33.567
This is actually my cubicle--
well, above my cubicle

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.901
circa 2006-2007.

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:38.300
And I love all video games,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.601
and I had all of
this Atari memorabilia--

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:42.601
[clapping]
Thank you--

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.868
on top of my cubicle,
and--and--

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:46.767
and that's actually how
Ryan and I met.

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:47.767
Germick:
That's true.

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:49.133
I was sitting
around the corner

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.734
and I saw these things
hanging up,

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.534
and I just think the artwork
is really cool,

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:55.834
as an artist myself,
and I approached this guy

00:00:55.834 --> 00:00:56.968
and we struck up
a friendship

00:00:56.968 --> 00:00:59.834
based on our mutual love
for vintage games.

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:01.100
Wichary:
Yeah. And--and--

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.501
and this is actually
the project,

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:04.968
the first big project,
that we worked on together,

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:08.834
was the Google Pac-Man doodle
pretty much a year ago,

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:12.234
and in--in a way,
it came to define us.

00:01:12.234 --> 00:01:13.234
Germick:
That's true.

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:14.601
Wichary:
Ha ha.

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:15.701
Germick: So yeah, it was
basically the first opportunity

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:18.934
we had to sort of bring
to fruition our--

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.067
the intersection between
art and technology

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:22.367
and find a way
to work together.

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:23.667
Wichary:
Yeah. This--

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.400
these are actual Google
suggestions for our names as of,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.901
like, eight months ago.

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:29.767
Germick: Before Google Instant,
so no longer does this glory--

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:31.067
Wichary: Yeah.
Germick: Exist.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:33.834
So my regular job at Google
is to--to lead the team

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.634
that creates the Google Doodles,
so those are the logos

00:01:36.634 --> 00:01:39.434
that we make on the homepage
around the world to,

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:41.934
you know, surprise
and delight our users.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.234
So you know,
we would take something like,

00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:45.033
you know, the idea
for celebrating Sesame Street,

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:49.000
which we actually did globally
for a whole week in 2009,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.200
and then we'd turn that idea
into a real thing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.133
like this photo.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.501
Wichary: Yeah.

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:56.801
And I kind of do
the same thing.

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.801
I try to delight users,
try to create experiences

00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:00.868
that are, you know,
interesting, memorable,

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:02.567
and--and--
and beautiful.

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:06.334
But my kind of tools of trade
are essentially HTML5.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.634
Right? And that's what I do
to create those experiences.

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:09.801
And as a matter of fact,

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:12.200
this whole presentation
is an HTML5 website.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.000
It doesn't look like one
because, you know,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.400
these days,
it doesn't have to.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.300
We--we--
I try to pay tribute to,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.067
you know, the '80s since
we're talking about Pac-Man.

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:21.501
Just a couple of things
we did here.

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.968
One is, you might notice
there's this interlace,

00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:27.467
little flickering, little
kind of banding going on.

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:28.801
Germick: Yeah,
the projector's not broken.

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.434
We told the AV guys
we'd let you know.

00:02:30.434 --> 00:02:32.067
Wichary:
This is--

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:34.067
This is all, kind of,
our tribute

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:35.701
and this is a little bit like,
you know,

00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:38.200
this is as easy as putting
a couple of gradients together

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.033
and animating them these days,
which is pretty amazing to me,

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:42.901
you know, like, that we can do
all sorts of things

00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:46.801
using HTML5 and--
and CSS3.

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:48.667
So that's one thing
that was a software tribute

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:51.534
and we also have
a hardware tribute to 1980s.

00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:53.467
Some of you might have
noticed--

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:54.634
[clapping]

00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:58.400
I love my Power Glove.
It's so bad.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.667
We have so--
Germick: We drove--

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:01.100
we drove to a trailer park
in San Jose

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.167
to buy it off of Craigslist,
so I appreciate the applause.

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:05.501
Wichary: Two hundred bucks,
I kid you not.

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.701
Germick:
Yeah.

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.267
Wichary:
But--

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:09.367
Germick: And the guy said he'd
get us anything we need, so--

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:10.501
Wichary:
Yeah. So--

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:11.601
Germick:
I know a guy.

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:12.868
Wichary:
So here's the thing, though.

00:03:12.868 --> 00:03:14.300
So we have this HTML5 website
running the serv--

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.934
the presentation,
right?

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:17.801
It's regular--
a regular page.

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.334
As a matter of fact,
you know, like,

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.634
I can just select stuff
or whatever. Right?

00:03:23.634 --> 00:03:26.634
I also have
a regular hypertouch here

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:30.901
running another HTML5 site,
just out of the box.

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:32.534
They talk to each other
using a server

00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:34.934
that's on this computer
that know--knows JS,

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:37.467
so it's all JavaScript,
all OpenWeb. Right?

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.200
It's pretty amazing.
And what I can--look here--

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.801
you know, I can advance
to the next slide, for example.

00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:43.968
Right? And this slide is
the same slide as this, so--

00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:47.968
but I can now use my touch,
and it's--you know,

00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:50.167
the Wi-Fi is a little bit,
but, you know,

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:52.033
it's pretty much real time.
Right?

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:53.534
It's kind of amazing.

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:56.601
And--and the--the other thing
I wanted to show you--

00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:57.801
this is a Power Glove, right?

00:03:57.801 --> 00:04:00.000
So it doesn't really
work on infrared

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.567
because we didn't hook it up.

00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:04.534
It's a glorified case, but,
this guy has an accelerometer,

00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:10.067
so what I can do is I can
kind of calibrate it right here

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:14.400
and just send
this accelerometer data

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.667
from the Power Glove
to the server.

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:22.934
The Wi-Fi's kind of--you can
kind of actually see the--

00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:24.300
now how it do--
it doesn't look so great

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.601
because Wi-Fi's
kind of terrible,

00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:29.834
but you can actually see Ryan.
[laughter]

00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:32.000
Germick: That's me with--
I--I grew my beard

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.667
just so the Muppets felt like
I was one of them.

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:36.133
Wichary:
Yeah. So--

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:39.033
so I'm really excited about
being able to do stuff like that

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:40.567
using just HTML5.
Right?

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:41.868
It's all open web,
open standards,

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:44.701
and you can create things
that have, you know,

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.934
not been possible before,
and that's kind of

00:04:46.934 --> 00:04:49.701
what we wanted to
talk to you about today.

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:50.868
Germick:
Yeah. We--

00:04:50.868 --> 00:04:52.601
we think the homepage
is a great place for us

00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:54.234
to be exploring
with these kind of things

00:04:54.234 --> 00:04:56.634
and I don't see any reason
why delighting

00:04:56.634 --> 00:04:58.834
and surprising our users has to
be just, like, static imagery.

00:04:58.834 --> 00:04:59.834
Wichary:
Yeah.

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:02.334
Germick: So to the--
hon--

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.601
to honor Pac-Man
as a classic game itself,

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:06.834
we decided to turn this talk
less into a lecture

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:08.100
and more into something
participatory.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.968
And the first thing
you need to know is,

00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:11.467
it's now a game show,

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.300
and we're going to be
dividing the room

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.834
into two teams.

00:05:14.834 --> 00:05:16.901
Everybody on this side--
on my right, your left--

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:18.534
is going to be
"Team Pac-Man."

00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:21.334
Everybody on Marcin's side--
my left, your right--

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:23.033
is going to be
"Team Ms. Pac-Man."

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:24.033
Wichary:
Yeah. All right.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:25.367
Germick:
It's all right.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.400
Wichary: So you can switch
right now if you need to.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.934
Germick: Yeah.
Wichary: Ha ha.

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:30.067
[laughter]
Germick: Yeah.

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:31.067
Well, close your eyes,
count to ten.

00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:32.267
And you will notice
under your seat

00:05:32.267 --> 00:05:33.734
is a floatation device.
I'm just kidding.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:36.100
I feel like an airline hostess.
But--but--

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.567
You'll also see
there's a score on top,

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:39.567
so for being so lovely,

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:43.267
I'm going to give Ms. Pac-Man
50 points. And-- [laughter]

00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:44.801
woman: Wahoo!
Germick: Sorry.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:46.801
So for griping, I'm going
to give Mr. Pac-Man

00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:48.667
just 30 points.
[laughter]

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:50.200
Germick: Or just---
great--

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.601
Wichary:
Ryan knows "octo."

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.801
Germick: Okay, 24.
Okay, great. [laughter]

00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.501
Wichary: Ha ha!
It's all JavaScript.

00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:58.234
Germick: Yeah.
[laughter]

00:05:58.234 --> 00:05:59.601
And the other thing
we can do,

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.601
Wi-Fi is a little bit
messy here,

00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:03.901
but if you have 3G or Wi-Fi,
give it a try.

00:06:03.901 --> 00:06:09.234
Point your web-enabled device
to "io-pac-man.appspot.com,"

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:11.000
and you'll actually be doing
all your voting

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.868
and question selection--
Wichary: Yeah.

00:06:12.868 --> 00:06:14.133
Germick:
From your touch device.

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:15.534
Wichary: Let's--
let's see if that works.

00:06:15.534 --> 00:06:16.934
If it doesn't, we're just going
to shout the answers

00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:18.567
or have a captain--
team captain or something.

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:19.834
Germick:
Yeah. So give it a try.

00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:21.834
Give it a try,
and we'll see how it goes

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:23.133
and, yeah,
like Marcin said,

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.167
we have a backup plan
if it doesn't work.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:25.434
Wichary:
Yeah.

00:06:25.434 --> 00:06:26.868
And choose your team as--
you're going to log in.

00:06:26.868 --> 00:06:28.400
If it shows up, you should be
able to choose your team.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.400
Again, Pac-Man
and Ms. Pac-Man.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.634
That work?
Germick: Right.

00:06:32.634 --> 00:06:34.801
3G was better than Wi-Fi
a minute ago.

00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:36.167
If you guys have 3G,
give it a try.

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:38.467
Anybody able to see the site?
Holler.

00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:40.567
Okay, we got some people.
Got some people.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.467
Wichary: Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:45.834
man: [indistinct] 3G here.
Germick: 3Gs? Okay.

00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:47.801
Wichary: Should we--what should
we do? Should we do the--?

00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:49.033
Germick: Well, let's have
our first vote.

00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:50.801
Everybody, if you want
to try it with 3G,

00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:52.133
holler or raise your hands.

00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:54.100
If not, we can--we've got
a team captain solution.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.801
Wichary:
Hmm.

00:06:55.801 --> 00:06:57.667
Germick: All right, all right.
So a little lukewarm.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.667
We feel, I think,
as a philosophical part

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:02.901
of what we do is,
if we don't break something--

00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:04.167
Wichary:
Yeah.

00:07:04.167 --> 00:07:05.801
Germick: We're probably
not trying hard enough.

00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:08.033
But, so let's go with--
let's go with captains.

00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:09.868
We're going to--we'll take it
a little away from Jeopardy,

00:07:09.868 --> 00:07:11.667
a little more towards
Price is Right,

00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:15.567
and if I could have a volunteer
for Mr. Pac-Man Team.

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:17.367
Anybody?
Sweet.

00:07:17.367 --> 00:07:19.367
All right, all right.
In the back. Wonderful.

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:20.734
If you want to come up
to the microphone,

00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:22.567
you are going to be the answer
and question wrangler

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:23.834
for your team, and--

00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:25.400
Wichary: And we need one more
for Ms.--

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.501
Germick: Ms. Pac-Man.
Wichary: Ms. Pac Man.

00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:27.834
Germick:
All right. Lovely lady,

00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:30.567
please come to the microphone
and we thank--

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:32.033
Wichary: Yeah.
Germick: We thank you for that,

00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:33.934
and to sweeten the pot
a little bit,

00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:35.367
we've got hats for you.
Wichary: [laughter] Ha ha.

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:37.234
Germick:
Stunts!

00:07:37.234 --> 00:07:38.467
Okay, here we go.

00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:39.567
man: Thank you.
Germick: You're welcome.

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:41.868
All right.
So...

00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:43.267
[laughter]

00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:44.667
Wichary: Okay.

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:48.601
So how it's going to work is
we have five categories:

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:49.968
"History of Pac-Man
and doodles,"

00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:51.868
"Pac-Man, the Game,"

00:07:51.868 --> 00:07:52.901
the "Technology,"

00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:54.434
"Programming
the Pac-Man doodle,"

00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:55.734
and "User feedback."

00:07:55.734 --> 00:07:57.901
And we alternate, so team--
you know, ladies first,

00:07:57.901 --> 00:07:59.734
so Team Ms. Pac-Man's
going to start.

00:07:59.734 --> 00:08:02.000
Choose the category,
choose the score,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.434
there's going to be an answer,

00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:05.067
and then we're going to talk
a little bit about it.

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:06.534
Germick:
All right. So team Ms.--

00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:08.534
Team Ms. Pac-Man,
just holler out

00:08:08.534 --> 00:08:10.033
what are you going for?
Oh, somebody voted.

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:11.367
200.
Wichary: Yeah. Ha ha.

00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:13.534
Germick: So we're doing
a hybrid approach.

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:15.367
Wichary: Yeah.
Germick: Oh, it's a word game.

00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:16.968
Wichary: It's kind of all--
Germick: We're doing all right.

00:08:16.968 --> 00:08:18.501
Wichary: This should look
much better, though.

00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:21.267
There's like, five, six, seven
votes on the screen right now.

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.200
Germick: Okay.
It looks like,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.834
pencils down,
conservative approach,

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:28.934
"History of Pac-Man and doodles"
for 200 is our question.

00:08:28.934 --> 00:08:30.767
Wichary: Okay, so we have
team Ms. Pac-Man.

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:35.801
Your question is: "What was
Ms. Pac-Man's original name?"

00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:37.634
And there are four answers.

00:08:37.634 --> 00:08:43.267
Was it "Pac-Woman,"
was it "Pac-Lady,"

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:47.934
was it "Chicha Chan,"
or was it "Crazy Otto"?

00:08:47.934 --> 00:08:50.133
man: Crazy Otto!
Wichary: So...

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:51.701
Are we doing voting,
are we doing shouting,

00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:53.334
are we doing team captain--?

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:55.234
man: Voting!

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.901
Germick: We've got a captain,
we've got a little bit of both.

00:08:56.901 --> 00:08:58.200
Captain, we're going to--

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.601
what we're going to do
is a hybrid approach.

00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:01.200
Captain, you're going to choose
with your discretion--

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.601
Wichary:
Ha ha.

00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:04.534
Germick: What you think
your team is really going for.

00:09:04.534 --> 00:09:05.801
Wichary:
All right.

00:09:05.801 --> 00:09:07.067
Germick: There's a lot votes,
a lot of votes.

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:08.868
Wichary: It's kind of working.
Okay.

00:09:08.868 --> 00:09:10.501
man: Well, since
no one's shouting out

00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:12.968
and everyone's voting online,
let's go with number four.

00:09:12.968 --> 00:09:14.701
Germick: Okay, Crazy Otto,
and--

00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:16.033
[electronic tones]

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:18.033
Wichary: That is correct.
It's "Crazy Otto."

00:09:18.033 --> 00:09:21.000
So my team needs some points--
Germick: All right.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.968
Wichary: I guess.
man: Give him twice as many.

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:26.033
man: That's fine.
Germick: All right.

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:27.334
Wichary: And let me tell you
the story.

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:28.534
This is actually kind of
a cool story.

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:32.234
So Pac-Man came out,
you know, a while back

00:09:32.234 --> 00:09:34.801
and, you know, if you put a game
in an arcade for a while

00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:36.400
it's, you know, people
are going to figure it out

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.801
and going to play longer
for one quarter and, you know,

00:09:38.801 --> 00:09:40.968
the arcade owners
kind of hated it.

00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:43.734
So they wanted
a sequel to Pac-Man,

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:45.200
and they asked Namco
who's the, you know,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.767
Japanese manufacturer
of Pac-Man.

00:09:46.767 --> 00:09:48.467
"Hey, can we have a sequel?"
And they're like, "Yeah,

00:09:48.467 --> 00:09:49.968
we'll get to it
when we get to it."

00:09:49.968 --> 00:09:51.734
But there was this
other American company

00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:55.067
that created their own, kind of,
bootleg version of Pac-Man

00:09:55.067 --> 00:09:58.367
called "Crazy Otto" which
looked a little bit like this,

00:09:58.367 --> 00:10:00.701
and midway,
the American distributor

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:02.667
of the original Pac-Man
found out about it

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:04.968
and they gave them
the ultimatum,

00:10:04.968 --> 00:10:07.367
"Either we're going to buy you
and start selling

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:10.901
Crazy Otto legally
or we're going to sue you."

00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:14.400
So--so of course, you know,
they chose "buy us"

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.534
and they get this thing.

00:10:16.534 --> 00:10:18.734
They changed Crazy Otto
to Ms. Pac-Man, you know,

00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:20.300
so it looks like a lady,
there's a little bit of,

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.100
you know, thing going on.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.734
And, you know, it actually was
the most popular Pac-Man game

00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:26.601
in the history of
Pac-Man's franchise.

00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:28.501
And when Namco, the--

00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:30.501
the original Japanese
manufacturer found out about it,

00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:32.000
they got kind of angry
because they said,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.067
"You can't be doing these things
without our permission,"

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:35.200
and Midway's like,
"Yeah, we can.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.667
It's what our contract says."

00:10:36.667 --> 00:10:38.834
And they got into this long,
protracted legal battle about,

00:10:38.834 --> 00:10:41.634
you know, what they can
and cannot do.

00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:42.901
The funny thing is that--

00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:44.801
Oh, this is the advertisement
for Ms. Pac-Man,

00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:46.701
so you see the graphics
was kind of terrible--

00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:49.534
but they more than made up
for it with advertisements.

00:10:49.534 --> 00:10:51.200
Germick: I'm not sure who
they're trying to appeal to

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.334
with this advertisement.

00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:53.868
Wichary: Femme fatale
of the game world.

00:10:53.868 --> 00:10:56.734
And of course they also had
advertisements for the industry,

00:10:56.734 --> 00:10:59.000
"Don't copy Pac-Man
because we own it,"

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.467
even though that's just
what they did themselves.

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:04.067
So that was kind of
hilarious.

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:05.934
We didn't know much about it
when we worked

00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:09.567
on our Pac-Man doodle, and I
wanted to put Ms. Pac-Man in

00:11:09.567 --> 00:11:11.534
because it's such an
interesting, you know, story.

00:11:11.534 --> 00:11:15.801
So you know, what we did was
we proposed that if you press

00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:19.167
"insert coin" twice,
you actually get into this mode

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:21.901
where you can play with
Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Man

00:11:21.901 --> 00:11:23.667
on one screen, which is
actually the first time

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:25.167
it happened in the history.

00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:28.334
It was a lot of fun,
and when we talked about this

00:11:28.334 --> 00:11:30.901
to Namco, they were like,
"Ohhh, okay.

00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:33.033
It's a bit tricky, the legal,
you know, thing."

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:35.734
But they eventually--
they allowed us to do it

00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:39.300
and we were very happy
and kind of to bookend--

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.133
Oh, this is--
So the reason--

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:44.834
the way I wanted to do it was,
you know, I wanted to think

00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:48.367
about what would Namco do
in 1980 if it wanted to do

00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:49.734
a multi-player mode.
Right?

00:11:49.734 --> 00:11:51.334
I didn't want to, kind of,
throw all sorts of

00:11:51.334 --> 00:11:53.968
artificial intelligence that
wasn't possible to do in 1980,

00:11:53.968 --> 00:11:55.400
so it was incredibly simple.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.033
There is the only addition
to the A.I. for multi-player.

00:11:58.033 --> 00:12:00.801
If a ghost exits the pen,
just randomly chooses

00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:03.434
whether it should target
Ms. Pac-Man or Pac-Man,

00:12:03.434 --> 00:12:06.234
which I though this is exactly
what they would've done in 1980.

00:12:06.234 --> 00:12:08.100
So it's kind of
a historical recreation.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.868
And the last thing, ha ha,
somebody actually created

00:12:11.868 --> 00:12:14.434
a Greasemonkey extension
to change our Pac-Man

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:17.000
into Ms. Pac-Man,
which I thought was very ironic,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.868
given this whole story repeated
itself from 30 years ago--

00:12:20.868 --> 00:12:22.234
when somebody,
you know, when this company

00:12:22.234 --> 00:12:23.868
dotted this little
daughter board

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.667
on top of the original PCB.

00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:27.467
So that's the story
of Ms. Pac Man.

00:12:27.467 --> 00:12:29.300
It's a little bit more,
but we--

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.300
let's try to get
to other questions.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.901
Germick:
All right, Team Pac-Man,

00:12:32.901 --> 00:12:35.667
it's your turn
to vote for a question.

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:38.501
Yell it out, vote it up.

00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:40.367
man:
Let's see some fingers.

00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:41.734
Germick: [laughter]
Ha ha. All right.

00:12:41.734 --> 00:12:44.067
I like--
I like this aggression here.

00:12:44.067 --> 00:12:45.567
1,600 looks pretty good
to me.

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:47.400
man: Okay, we're going to go
for 1,600--

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.601
Germick:
Oh.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.701
man: With the "History
of Pac-Man and doodles."

00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:52.167
Germick:
There you have it.

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:54.601
All right, guys, so how many
cartridges of Pac-Man

00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:57.701
for the Atari 2600
video game console

00:12:57.701 --> 00:13:01.834
did Atari eventually bury
in a New Mexico landfill?

00:13:01.834 --> 00:13:02.934
Wichary:
Ha ha.

00:13:02.934 --> 00:13:04.033
We will tell you
the story in a second,

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:07.300
but first tell us,
what do you think?

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.567
Germick: 5,000,
50,000,

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:14.467
500,000,

00:13:14.467 --> 00:13:16.501
and 5 million and we're--
we're--we rest--

00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:18.968
we're--I guess it's safe to say
no one's searching for this

00:13:18.968 --> 00:13:20.267
since the Wi-Fi
doesn't really work.

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:21.734
[laughter]
Wichary: Yeah, no cheating.

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:24.567
man: Two?
Does everybody like number two?

00:13:24.567 --> 00:13:25.801
Germick:
Okay. All right, 50,000?

00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:27.901
woman: Yeah.
man: We'll go with number two.

00:13:27.901 --> 00:13:30.601
Germick: Number two,
and I'm somewhat disappointed.

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:31.767
[electronic sound]

00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:33.133
man: Eeww!
Wichary: No.

00:13:33.133 --> 00:13:37.234
The answer is actually
the last answer, 5 million,

00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:38.667
and some of you
know the story, right?

00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:40.100
It was kind of
interesting.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.834
So there was this movie that
came out in 1982 called "E.T."

00:13:42.834 --> 00:13:44.534
Huge hit, right?

00:13:44.534 --> 00:13:47.367
And Atari had this hot console
called "2600"

00:13:47.367 --> 00:13:49.501
or "VCS" originally,
and they wanted to have a game

00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:51.200
based on the movie because
everybody loved the movie

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.567
so everybody's
going to buy the game.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:55.601
They bought the rights,
they were very happy,

00:13:55.601 --> 00:14:00.234
and this is the game
that they came up with.

00:14:00.234 --> 00:14:04.300
[electronic music,
sounds]

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.067
Otherwise known--

00:14:06.067 --> 00:14:07.968
as the worst video game
in history.

00:14:07.968 --> 00:14:10.634
Germick: Ha ha!
[laughter]

00:14:10.634 --> 00:14:11.968
Wichary: It has nothing to do,
very little to do,

00:14:11.968 --> 00:14:13.167
with the movie.
Terrible game play.

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:15.033
You could finish the whole thing
in two hours--

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:18.634
two minutes, I'm sorry.
And, you know, it's awful.

00:14:18.634 --> 00:14:21.067
Right?
Germick: Ha ha!

00:14:21.067 --> 00:14:22.367
[laughter]
Wichary: So--so we had

00:14:22.367 --> 00:14:26.100
E.T. the video game,
and then there was Pac-Man,

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.801
and Atari--exactly
the same way of thinking.

00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:30.234
Everybody loves Pac-Man
in the arcades.

00:14:30.234 --> 00:14:33.267
They would love it even more
if they could play it at home.

00:14:33.267 --> 00:14:36.434
So they bought the rights,
they put together a conversion.

00:14:36.434 --> 00:14:37.434
This is the box.

00:14:37.434 --> 00:14:39.534
As always,
looks very, very nice.

00:14:39.534 --> 00:14:43.167
And they had an advertisement
that looked something like this.

00:14:43.167 --> 00:14:45.601
Germick: Notice how few frames
of the advertisement

00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:47.634
actually show the game.

00:14:47.634 --> 00:14:49.300
Pac-Man: Soon as I eat
that power block,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.567
you guys are finished.

00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:51.701
commercial announcer:
Drop Atari Pac-Man

00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:53.234
into your Atari
video computer system,

00:14:53.234 --> 00:14:56.200
and you're playing the hottest
game since Space Invaders,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.601
Atari Pac-Man!

00:14:57.601 --> 00:14:58.901
Germick:
Oh! That's enough.

00:14:58.901 --> 00:15:00.033
commercial singers:
[singing] Pac-Man fever

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.133
Germick:
Okay, now it's enough.

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:02.334
commercial singers:
Pac-Man fever

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:05.000
It's driving me crazy,
driving me crazy

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.534
Pac-Man fever,
Pac-Man fever

00:15:08.534 --> 00:15:09.767
I'm going out of my mind

00:15:09.767 --> 00:15:10.934
Pac-Man:
Hate to eat and run!

00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:12.200
commercial announcer:
Pac-Man, by Atari.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.734
Wichary: By Atari, right?
Awesome.

00:15:13.734 --> 00:15:17.901
Germick: Ha ha.
Wichary: This is the game.

00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:19.834
Germick: I think you might
get Pac-Man fever from the,

00:15:19.834 --> 00:15:24.434
sort of, frantic movements
of the ghosts. [laughter]

00:15:24.434 --> 00:15:26.567
Wichary: This has
absolutely zero in--

00:15:26.567 --> 00:15:28.133
to do with the original Pac-Man.
It's terrible.

00:15:28.133 --> 00:15:29.501
Everything's wrong here.

00:15:29.501 --> 00:15:31.200
The board is different,
Pac-Man doesn't even move right,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.634
the ghosts are flickering,
the sounds are terrible,

00:15:33.634 --> 00:15:35.000
no cut scenes, nothing.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.300
Germick: But you know what,
it makes me think

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.267
maybe we should do a doodle
for the anniversary

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:40.100
of Atari Pac-Man.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.868
[laughter]
Germick: Ha ha ha ha.

00:15:41.868 --> 00:15:43.934
Wichary: Both of these games
were huge flops.

00:15:43.934 --> 00:15:46.334
They produced millions of them
and nobody bought them,

00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:48.033
or people who bought them
returned them

00:15:48.033 --> 00:15:50.400
and Atari
was essentially trapped

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.367
with millions of cartridges
that they couldn't sell

00:15:52.367 --> 00:15:54.167
because it was after
the Christmas season

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:55.534
and nobody cared about
those games anyway.

00:15:55.534 --> 00:15:58.834
It was beginning of
the video game crash of 1984

00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:00.334
for those of you
who remember it.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:04.067
Atari had to actually literally
bury them in the desert

00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:06.634
to get some sort of a tax-exempt
refund situation.

00:16:06.634 --> 00:16:08.167
I don't know exactly.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.634
Just, you know--
But essentially they went--

00:16:10.634 --> 00:16:12.834
their--everything went
nose-dive after that.

00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:14.601
Two--two games
essentially responsible

00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:16.701
for almost killing video games,
and everybody thought

00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:20.334
video games was just another fad
like hula hoop, or whatever.

00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:22.033
And, you know,
it looked like it

00:16:22.033 --> 00:16:23.834
except there was this little
company called "Nintendo"

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:27.901
that released NES in 1985, but
that's a whole different story.

00:16:27.901 --> 00:16:29.634
Essentially,
so Pac-Man contributed

00:16:29.634 --> 00:16:33.167
to both the--kind of
the cultural recognition

00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:36.767
of video games in 1980 and
the video game crash of 1984,

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:39.267
which we think is kind of
an interesting story.

00:16:39.267 --> 00:16:40.968
All right.
Germick: All right.

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:42.701
Wichary:
So this was the--

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:44.234
Germick:
Team Ms. Pac-Man is up.

00:16:44.234 --> 00:16:45.400
Wichary:
Yeah, Team Ms. Pac-Man.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.801
What do you wanna--
Germick: Vote away.

00:16:46.801 --> 00:16:48.000
Wichary:
Talk about?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.767
Germick: Mr.--
Mr.--Ms. Pac-Man Captain,

00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:51.100
what--
what is your name by the way?

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.634
We didn't get your name.
man: Chad Killingsworth.

00:16:53.634 --> 00:16:55.000
Germick: Thanks--Chet?
Killingsworth: Chad.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Germick: Chad.
Thanks, Chad.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.067
Wichary: Crazy Chad.
Oh, sorry.

00:16:57.067 --> 00:16:59.234
Germick: Crazy Chad.
Chad ChaChan.

00:16:59.234 --> 00:17:01.067
Killingsworth: Other Googlers
have called me such, too.

00:17:01.067 --> 00:17:02.200
Germick: Ah.
Wichary: All right.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.467
Killingsworth:
Let's go with 1,600

00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:04.501
for "Pac-Man, the Game."

00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:06.801
Germick: All right,
big spender.

00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:08.701
Wichary: All right.
This is a cool question.

00:17:08.701 --> 00:17:10.467
Okay.
On one occasion,

00:17:10.467 --> 00:17:13.434
one ghost can run away from
Pac-Man while not frightened.

00:17:13.434 --> 00:17:14.734
So you know, you can
eat the energizer

00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:16.834
and they run away,
but on one occasion,

00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:18.567
one ghost even in
regular game play,

00:17:18.567 --> 00:17:21.934
runs away from Pac-Man.
Which ghost is it?

00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:23.434
Is it Blinky--

00:17:23.434 --> 00:17:25.434
It's not going to be so easy
at 1,600--

00:17:25.434 --> 00:17:28.634
or is it Inky,
or is it Pinky,

00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:30.400
or is it Clyde?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.234
So vote now if Wi-Fi
allows you to,

00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:36.701
and we're going to talk about it
in just a second.

00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:38.501
People know what
they're talking about here.

00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:39.667
Germick:
Ha ha.

00:17:39.667 --> 00:17:41.667
I think that table talk
is going to reduce

00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:42.868
the number of points
it's worth.

00:17:42.868 --> 00:17:44.367
Wichary: Okay, who has
Google search open?

00:17:44.367 --> 00:17:46.133
It's just--
[laughter]

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:47.200
You know--
you know we know.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.534
Germick: No, I'm joking.

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.300
Killingsworth: We'll go with
Clyde, number four.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.300
[laughter]
Germick: All right.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.400
Clyde is correct,
but--

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.400
Wichary:
It's--it's--

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400
Germick:
I heard some table talk.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.133
I'm going to ding you guys.

00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:57.234
Well, I'm going to ding you
400 points for that.

00:17:57.234 --> 00:17:58.601
I don't think
you really deserve--

00:17:58.601 --> 00:18:00.634
Wichary: Ha ha.
[laughter]

00:18:00.634 --> 00:18:01.901
Germick: I don't.
Sorry.

00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:03.534
Wichary: All right.
Germick: Sorry, Chad.

00:18:03.534 --> 00:18:05.534
Wichary: Here's what's great
about Pac-Man.

00:18:05.534 --> 00:18:08.701
In an era when every other game
was shooting and driving

00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:10.067
and nobody really cared
about anything,

00:18:10.067 --> 00:18:11.734
they tried
to tell the story.

00:18:11.734 --> 00:18:14.234
They had four ghosts.
Each of them had a name.

00:18:14.234 --> 00:18:16.601
Each of them had
a personality as well.

00:18:16.601 --> 00:18:18.033
Germick: I think--
I think one thing

00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:20.100
that resonated with us from
the Google Doodle standpoint

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.501
is that it was
an opportunity for,

00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:23.167
like, an emotional connection.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:18:23.167 --> 00:18:25.400
Germick: You feel a little less
invested in an Android

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.167
you're blowing up
than you do in a ghost

00:18:27.167 --> 00:18:28.834
with a name
and a personality.

00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:30.300
Wichary: Yeah.
So they actually had this,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.567
you know,
this cut scene with--

00:18:31.567 --> 00:18:33.133
with--with the names and--
and everything,

00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:35.801
but, of course,
this is 1980.

00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:38.200
How do you represent
ghosts' personalities using,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.033
you know, five lines
of machine code

00:18:40.033 --> 00:18:41.601
that you have available.
Right?

00:18:41.601 --> 00:18:43.334
Not very much memory,
nothing really crazy.

00:18:43.334 --> 00:18:44.601
Here's how.

00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:46.534
Let me actually show you
this in practice.

00:18:46.534 --> 00:18:47.934
It's kind of hard to play
with a Power Glove,

00:18:47.934 --> 00:18:50.133
ironically, but--
[laughter]

00:18:50.133 --> 00:18:51.434
Germick: It was also hard
to play with the Power Glove

00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:53.100
when it was working properly.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.501
So at any given moment,

00:18:54.501 --> 00:18:56.801
a ghost--the only thing
a ghost has to do

00:18:56.801 --> 00:18:58.701
is to reach
a specific tile.

00:18:58.701 --> 00:19:01.734
So let me actually
show you.

00:19:01.734 --> 00:19:05.000
Right now, as you can see,
two of the ghosts are out,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.300
and they're trying to reach
a tile that doesn't exist.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.501
It's a tile outside
of the screen.

00:19:08.501 --> 00:19:09.634
So we're going to be--

00:19:09.634 --> 00:19:11.000
it's kind of circling
in the corner.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.467
The idea being, that, you know,
you just started the game,

00:19:13.467 --> 00:19:15.667
we'll give you some slack.
Right?

00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:17.100
As you familiarize yourself
with the controls.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.767
I slowed it down
so I can actually play

00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:20.267
and talk at the same time.

00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:23.601
I'm--a secret--
not a very good Pac-Man player.

00:19:23.601 --> 00:19:24.901
All right.

00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:26.133
Germick:
That's the only secret

00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:27.133
I think you're actually
going to hear today.

00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:28.267
Wichary:
Yeah. All right.

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:29.868
But, after a while,
something else happens.

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:32.200
Each ghost now has
a different tile to target.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.868
So you see, Blinky
is trying to target the tile

00:19:34.868 --> 00:19:37.167
I'm currently at.
Right?

00:19:37.167 --> 00:19:40.300
Let me slow it down.
The red one, right?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.434
Pinky is trying to target
the tile in front of me,

00:19:42.434 --> 00:19:45.167
except if I go up,
there's a bug and it ta--

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:47.968
it targets a tile that's,
you know, up.

00:19:47.968 --> 00:19:50.501
But, otherwise, it's four tiles
in front of me.

00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:53.701
The other guy, Inky,
is just trying to, kind of,

00:19:53.701 --> 00:19:55.834
extrapolate
between those two guys.

00:19:55.834 --> 00:20:01.801
And Clyde, let's try if we can
get him out of the pen.

00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:03.067
This is kind of hard,
by the way.

00:20:03.067 --> 00:20:04.801
Oh, no!
Oh, nooo!

00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:07.267
Ohhh!
[laughter]

00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:10.234
Can I get
some points for it? No.

00:20:10.234 --> 00:20:11.501
So let's see.

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.434
So anyway, what happens is
it otherwise beha--

00:20:14.434 --> 00:20:18.167
behaves like Blinky, but once
I get close to Clyde,

00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:20.334
it actually runs away to--
[laughter]

00:20:20.334 --> 00:20:21.634
Germick: Do you need
a pinch hitter?

00:20:21.634 --> 00:20:22.634
Wichary: Do you want to play?
Germick: Okay, sure.

00:20:22.634 --> 00:20:24.200
Wichary:
[laughter]

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.234
Anyway, it actually
runs away from--

00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:29.634
from me to its corner.

00:20:29.634 --> 00:20:30.734
Which is kind of,
you know,

00:20:30.734 --> 00:20:32.501
makes him a little bit
unpredictable.

00:20:32.501 --> 00:20:34.801
But here's--here's a great
story for me, personally.

00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:38.434
So I--you know, I started
implementing the game,

00:20:38.434 --> 00:20:41.834
and one day I'm playing it
and accidentally I make--

00:20:41.834 --> 00:20:43.634
you know, I converted
my whole game play

00:20:43.634 --> 00:20:46.267
from floating point to integers
to make it a little bit faster,

00:20:46.267 --> 00:20:48.234
but I forgot to multiply
something by eight

00:20:48.234 --> 00:20:50.133
in one place, and the way
I found out about it

00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:52.868
was not by looking
at the code--

00:20:52.868 --> 00:20:54.167
and I don't do unit testing

00:20:54.167 --> 00:20:55.167
because I'm
a terrible programmer.

00:20:55.167 --> 00:20:56.467
Germick: Ha ha.
[laughter]

00:20:56.467 --> 00:20:59.234
Wichary: I did it because
the ghosts felt funny

00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:00.701
when I played it.

00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.100
And I recognized that they're
doing something weird,

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.968
and I added this mode
that I could actually see

00:21:04.968 --> 00:21:07.434
what they're doing as the--
the bugging had from me--

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:08.667
and that's
how I found out.

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:09.968
Oh, okay.
They're doing something funny.

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:11.467
I forgot about "times eight,"
I added in--

00:21:11.467 --> 00:21:12.801
Germick: Things are getting
pretty hot over here.

00:21:12.801 --> 00:21:14.167
Wichary: And it worked.
Germick: Do you want to see it?

00:21:14.167 --> 00:21:15.701
But there it is.
There it is.

00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:17.067
Ghost of Clyde.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:18.834
So--so the great thing
about it is that's--

00:21:18.834 --> 00:21:21.334
that speaks volumes about
that actually, you know,

00:21:21.334 --> 00:21:22.834
it actually worked.
Right?

00:21:22.834 --> 00:21:24.767
You could actually feel
the differences in personalities

00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:26.067
of the ghosts.

00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:28.167
And, you know, they had
literally very little.

00:21:28.167 --> 00:21:30.701
And so this is the--
these are the algorithms

00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:33.067
I put together,
essentially recreated

00:21:33.067 --> 00:21:34.934
from scratch in JavaScript.

00:21:34.934 --> 00:21:37.100
We didn't do any sort of
emulation or anything.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.934
They're very simple, right?

00:21:38.934 --> 00:21:40.834
If--Blinky's just, like,
targeting the tile.

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:43.033
The other guy's a little bit
more complicated.

00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:48.601
Inky is--just kind of trying
to offset these two guys,

00:21:48.601 --> 00:21:50.367
and Clyde is a little bit
more complicated.

00:21:50.367 --> 00:21:52.801
But really, those are incredibly
simple things, right?

00:21:52.801 --> 00:21:55.234
Nothing fancy, no machine
learning, no A.I.

00:21:55.234 --> 00:21:57.100
And it worked,
and I think this is brilliant,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.167
and I think this talks about
how amazing Pac-Man was

00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:02.601
that it has so much nuance
and so much details

00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:04.901
that I wasn't even aware of
when I started on this project.

00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:06.100
Germick: All right,
Team Pac-Man,

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.067
and Pac-Man captain
what was your name?

00:22:09.067 --> 00:22:10.167
man: Morgan.
Germick: Morgan.

00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:12.100
Wichary:
Crazy Morgan also.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.868
Germick: Okay.
Let's vote on a question.

00:22:13.868 --> 00:22:15.501
Okay. Decisively want to
get on the board

00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:16.701
with "Technology" for 1,600.

00:22:16.701 --> 00:22:17.901
Am I--are we in accord there,
Morgan?

00:22:17.901 --> 00:22:19.634
Morgan: Sure.
We'll do that.

00:22:19.634 --> 00:22:20.634
Germick:
Thank you.

00:22:20.634 --> 00:22:21.968
Morgan: I mean,
we can only go up.

00:22:21.968 --> 00:22:23.100
[laughter]
Germick: Yeah.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.534
I believe in you.
Wichary: All right.

00:22:24.534 --> 00:22:26.234
So we have this one question,
which is,

00:22:26.234 --> 00:22:29.334
"How many different
graphic elements were used

00:22:29.334 --> 00:22:32.501
for Pac-Man doodle?"

00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:34.200
Might be a tricky
question at 1,600.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.267
Nobody really knows.
Is it one?

00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:38.000
Germick:
Ha ha.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.567
Wichary:
Is it 56?

00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:45.567
Is it 89?
Or is it 123?

00:22:45.567 --> 00:22:46.901
Germick:
What have you got, Morgan?

00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:50.767
Wichary: Vote now,
and let's see what happens.

00:22:50.767 --> 00:22:52.567
[indistinct chatter]

00:22:52.567 --> 00:22:53.934
Morgan:
We're going to go with one.

00:22:53.934 --> 00:22:55.400
Germick: Okay.
Wichary: Let's see--

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.000
Let's see what
I mean after you answer.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.467
[laughter]
Ha ha ha ha.

00:22:58.467 --> 00:22:59.834
Germick: Morgan has spoken.

00:22:59.834 --> 00:23:01.400
[electronic tones]
That is correct.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.601
Wichary:
That is kind of correct.

00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:03.734
[clapping]

00:23:03.734 --> 00:23:04.734
Germick: I--
we could use the points,

00:23:04.734 --> 00:23:05.868
we could use the points.

00:23:05.868 --> 00:23:06.834
Wichary:
We'll give you some points.

00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:07.901
Ha ha ha ha.

00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:08.934
Germick:
I will give you 15--

00:23:08.934 --> 00:23:09.934
since you got it right,

00:23:09.934 --> 00:23:13.801
I will give you
1,599 for the one.

00:23:13.801 --> 00:23:15.033
Seems fair to me.

00:23:15.033 --> 00:23:16.033
Seems fair to me.
I have no bias on this.

00:23:16.033 --> 00:23:17.033
Wichary:
I can add points,

00:23:17.033 --> 00:23:18.367
so it seems
a little bit unfair.

00:23:18.367 --> 00:23:22.267
The actual answer is
123 elements in one sprite.

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.267
You had the right,
you know, so--

00:23:23.267 --> 00:23:24.767
that's why you got points.

00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:26.901
Because somebody was thinking,
and probably more of you, right?

00:23:26.901 --> 00:23:29.067
So you know how sprites work,
right?

00:23:29.067 --> 00:23:30.434
This is one big image

00:23:30.434 --> 00:23:32.901
and we just cut the respective
slice out of it

00:23:32.901 --> 00:23:36.634
because first of all it--
it saves us bandwidth.

00:23:36.634 --> 00:23:38.567
Right? We don't have
to download 123 images.

00:23:38.567 --> 00:23:40.467
We just download one,
and it's much faster.

00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:42.634
And also once we have one,
we have all of them.

00:23:42.634 --> 00:23:43.801
So you don't have
this stupid flickering

00:23:43.801 --> 00:23:45.167
when you hover over things,
you know.

00:23:45.167 --> 00:23:46.868
Sometimes you see it
on the websites.

00:23:46.868 --> 00:23:49.434
So we did that.

00:23:49.434 --> 00:23:50.901
We also do this on Google,
right?

00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:52.567
And for--
this is kind of where it--

00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:53.667
where it started for us,
probably.

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:54.701
This is a sprite
from Google.com

00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:56.534
and we do it everywhere else.

00:23:56.534 --> 00:23:57.767
Let me actually show you
how it works.

00:23:57.767 --> 00:24:01.033
It's kind of fun to see,
to visualize this.

00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.300
So you know, again, let me
play a game really badly.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.234
Germick:
Ha ha.

00:24:05.234 --> 00:24:06.701
Wichary: Let me kind of
slow it down.

00:24:06.701 --> 00:24:09.434
And, you know, if you
take away the sprites,

00:24:09.434 --> 00:24:11.901
it's actually just diff
elements running around.

00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:13.033
It looks kind of
like "Tron."

00:24:13.033 --> 00:24:14.701
It's actually kind of cool
to play.

00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:16.300
You know, let's focus
on Pac-Man,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.567
and this is what
Pac-Man does.

00:24:17.567 --> 00:24:19.901
But really, you know,
if you just get rid of CSS

00:24:19.901 --> 00:24:23.067
overflow hidden,
that's what's happening, right?

00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:26.400
Just one sprite
and the same with, you know,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.033
every ghost has two, kind of,
movements to--

00:24:29.033 --> 00:24:30.901
so they're, you know,
[indistinct],

00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:32.267
et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:32.267 --> 00:24:35.167
This other guy--we can also
just show all of them

00:24:35.167 --> 00:24:37.000
if we want, which is,
you know--

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.601
[laughter]

00:24:39.601 --> 00:24:40.868
Let's try to get killed

00:24:40.868 --> 00:24:42.701
because that actually
looks kind of cool.

00:24:42.701 --> 00:24:46.100
I always get a kick out of it.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.701
Wait!
[laughter]

00:24:47.701 --> 00:24:49.868
So yeah.
That's the story.

00:24:49.868 --> 00:24:53.200
And--and this is actually
a technique that we--

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.634
that we used somewhere else.
Can you talk about this doodle?

00:24:55.634 --> 00:24:57.400
Germick:
All right, sure.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.167
So you know, we try to honor
different holidays,

00:24:59.167 --> 00:25:02.033
different notable birthdays,
and sometimes there's conflicts,

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:03.968
and Rube Goldberg
was one such conflict

00:25:03.968 --> 00:25:06.734
where there's no way
we can't honor Rube Goldberg.

00:25:06.734 --> 00:25:09.167
He's a cartoonist,
he was an inventor,

00:25:09.167 --> 00:25:10.734
he was hilarious, he--

00:25:10.734 --> 00:25:12.801
and he was also born
in San Francisco,

00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:15.868
and his birthday happens to be
on the Fourth of July.

00:25:15.868 --> 00:25:17.901
So we thought, hey,
instead of, you know,

00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:20.100
instead of, like, you know,
letting this one go,

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.868
maybe we can combine the two
and we created what we now call

00:25:22.868 --> 00:25:24.033
a "tandem doodle."

00:25:24.033 --> 00:25:28.133
So in--in--
in Flash I animated this--

00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:29.601
this doodle to kind of show,
you know,

00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:32.100
what a Rube Goldberg device
that was excessively patriotic

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.167
might look like.

00:25:34.167 --> 00:25:35.634
But we didn't want to use Flash
on the homepage because,

00:25:35.634 --> 00:25:38.367
you know, it wouldn't work
on iPads,

00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:40.567
it would, you know, potentially
could be security issues

00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:42.934
and, you know, we just try
to find the technology

00:25:42.934 --> 00:25:44.801
that's right for the occasion,
and at this point,

00:25:44.801 --> 00:25:46.400
we thought we could
try a little harder.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.167
Wichary: Yeah, so Flash
is out for, you know,

00:25:48.167 --> 00:25:50.534
obvious reasons,
even though we love it for,

00:25:50.534 --> 00:25:52.701
you know, working on--
on some of the animations-

00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:54.033
Germick: And we use it
in Pac-Man actually.

00:25:54.033 --> 00:25:55.100
The sound is done--

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.267
Wichary: Yeah.
Spoiler alert.

00:25:56.267 --> 00:25:57.267
Just another question
like this--

00:25:57.267 --> 00:25:58.701
Germick:
Helps with Pac-Man--

00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:00.734
Wichary: [laughter]
There's the--there's the--

00:26:00.734 --> 00:26:02.267
Germick: It's a memory
retention question.

00:26:02.267 --> 00:26:05.234
There's all kinds of--
Wichary: I hope it's my team.

00:26:05.234 --> 00:26:06.801
We can't do
animated gifs because, you know,

00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:08.067
they look kind of weird

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:09.334
and we're not really
in control, you know.

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:10.901
We don't know
if it's solid or not.

00:26:10.901 --> 00:26:12.334
We could load each frame
individually,

00:26:12.334 --> 00:26:14.000
but that's a lot of bandwidth.
Right?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.734
So what I did, I wrote
this little program--

00:26:15.734 --> 00:26:18.167
again, I actually wrote it
in Canvas and JavaScript,

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:21.100
which analyzes the differences
between each frames

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.968
and just try to find as small
as possible rectangle to,

00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:26.400
you know,
cover the differences.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.300
So you see,
it created this sprite

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.934
just for this animation.
All right?

00:26:31.934 --> 00:26:34.334
Germick: So now you're starting
to see why I talk to Marcin

00:26:34.334 --> 00:26:36.033
when we have a technical
challenge on the doodle--

00:26:36.033 --> 00:26:37.501
on a doodle.
Wichary: And--

00:26:37.501 --> 00:26:38.567
Germick: And--and I think
it's worth mentioning

00:26:38.567 --> 00:26:40.701
you did this on a bus
in 45 minutes.

00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:42.434
Wichary: Oh, that's almost
exactly not true.

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:45.033
But--ha ha.
[laughter]

00:26:45.033 --> 00:26:47.968
No. So--so now it's--
that you kind of have

00:26:47.968 --> 00:26:51.901
this sprite in mind,
this is how it looks, right?

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:54.834
So we overlay a new diff
which every frame would adjust

00:26:54.834 --> 00:26:55.934
the proper sprite.

00:26:55.934 --> 00:26:58.100
And if you can
visualize it this way,

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.200
it may be easier to do it
this way.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.734
Ohhh! Ahh!
man: Ahh!

00:27:01.734 --> 00:27:03.534
Wichary: We--and this is--
this--this part--

00:27:03.534 --> 00:27:06.234
[applause]
man: Whoo!

00:27:06.234 --> 00:27:08.534
Wichary: This part
is three extra lines--

00:27:08.534 --> 00:27:10.100
Germick: I'm going to give
Pac-Man team 20 points

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.300
just because that was
so exciting.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.267
[laughter]

00:27:13.267 --> 00:27:16.167
[scattered applause]

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:18.601
Their question.

00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:20.734
Wichary: This is three
or four lines extra CSS

00:27:20.734 --> 00:27:22.067
just for this effect.

00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:23.934
So that's really,
really fun.

00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:25.667
Again, I get really--
I get a kick off, you know,

00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:27.133
and it just compresses
into this guy.

00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:28.801
So I get a kick out of trying
these kind of things and--

00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:31.868
and the fact that they are
possible now.

00:27:31.868 --> 00:27:36.100
This is the code to just
animate the Zulu.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.033
I call this technique
"The Crushinator."

00:27:38.033 --> 00:27:40.968
Anybody knows what
the reference is?

00:27:40.968 --> 00:27:42.267
Germick: Nobody knows
what the reference is, Marcin.

00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:43.834
man:
"Futurama."

00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:45.200
Wichary: "Futurama,"
yes, thank you!

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.567
Can I get some points?
Germick: Yeah, sure.

00:27:47.567 --> 00:27:50.200
In your honor, I'm going
to award Pac-Man team 20 points.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.334
[laughter, applause]

00:27:55.334 --> 00:27:57.067
Wichary:
Ah. All right.

00:27:57.067 --> 00:28:00.467
We also have this
other Google--

00:28:00.467 --> 00:28:03.133
Germick: Wahm!
Wichary: Yeah. Buckyball.

00:28:03.133 --> 00:28:05.334
And this is the original
prototype in Canvas that--

00:28:05.334 --> 00:28:08.267
that Chris Holm did, another--
another person on our team.

00:28:08.267 --> 00:28:11.567
But, you know, Canvas
still is not really accessible

00:28:11.567 --> 00:28:15.701
everywhere, so what we did
was essentially just created

00:28:15.701 --> 00:28:19.601
a sprite with all the possible
lines in the sprite.

00:28:19.601 --> 00:28:21.634
Here's a reference
from the same show.

00:28:21.634 --> 00:28:25.234
You gotta do what
you gotta do, right? So--

00:28:25.234 --> 00:28:26.868
All right.
Germick: And--and one--

00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:28.400
one more spoiler
while I'm spoiling.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.334
If you guys--for those of you
who don't have your homepage

00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:32.434
set to Google.to,
the Tong--

00:28:32.434 --> 00:28:34.968
Tonganese version
of our website,

00:28:34.968 --> 00:28:36.300
the doodle
that's going to be live

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.167
starting 9:00 P.M. Pacific Time
in the U.S.

00:28:39.167 --> 00:28:41.734
uses the Crushinator and it's
more sophisticated animation,

00:28:41.734 --> 00:28:44.067
but you can say you know
how it was done.

00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:45.934
Wichary: Is that--so
team Ms. Pac-Man right now--

00:28:45.934 --> 00:28:47.667
Is the voting--
is the voting working?

00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:49.033
It looks kind of funny.
Germick: Yeah.

00:28:49.033 --> 00:28:50.334
Wichary: It's a little bit--
okay.

00:28:50.334 --> 00:28:51.501
Germick: So it looks like
"Use feedback" for 200

00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:52.734
for Team Ms. Pac-Man?

00:28:52.734 --> 00:28:53.801
Wichary: No!
Germick: All right.

00:28:53.801 --> 00:28:55.167
Wichary:
Let's do the right thing.

00:28:55.167 --> 00:28:57.200
Germick: Okay.
[laughter]

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.701
Wichary:
It was very competitive.

00:28:58.701 --> 00:29:01.801
Okay.
[laughter]

00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:03.334
Wichary: Which of those
was the most--

00:29:03.334 --> 00:29:04.334
Germick: But you could
just score this,

00:29:04.334 --> 00:29:06.234
because this is
totally subjective.

00:29:06.234 --> 00:29:08.167
Wichary: But since all of you
know me already--

00:29:08.167 --> 00:29:10.868
we've spent 29 minutes together;
let's try to answer this.

00:29:10.868 --> 00:29:12.734
These are
the actual bug descriptions

00:29:12.734 --> 00:29:14.300
I wrote for myself.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.267
"The eyes of the ghost
should betray next move."

00:29:18.267 --> 00:29:21.567
"Proper death
for Ms. Pac-Man."

00:29:21.567 --> 00:29:24.567
"Some people
can't change directions."

00:29:24.567 --> 00:29:26.601
Germick: These sound like
critiques of actual people.

00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:28.167
Wichary: Ha ha ha.
[laughter]

00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:30.701
"Could stop
with mouth open."

00:29:30.701 --> 00:29:32.000
I'll explain all of them.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.534
"Ghosts feel funny."
You already know what that was.

00:29:35.534 --> 00:29:38.234
"Eyes should travel home
even during ghost eating--"

00:29:38.234 --> 00:29:39.567
English is a second language,
by the way.

00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:41.501
Germick: Ha ha.
[laughter]

00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:42.868
JavaScript is your
first language, I'm assuming?

00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:44.133
Wichary:
Yeah, really.

00:29:44.133 --> 00:29:46.033
Okay.
[laughter]

00:29:46.033 --> 00:29:53.534
Let's--let's try voting if--
if we can.

00:29:53.534 --> 00:29:54.767
Let's--How--
how--eh.

00:29:54.767 --> 00:29:58.234
Some votes are, okay,
coming through.

00:29:58.234 --> 00:30:00.834
Try to think the way I think.
Does this help any?

00:30:00.834 --> 00:30:01.834
Germick:
This is working.

00:30:01.834 --> 00:30:03.968
This is good.
Wichary: Okay.

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:06.467
Well, it might be the
responsibility of Team Captain.

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:08.367
man:
Ha ha ha ha.

00:30:08.367 --> 00:30:13.234
Germick:
Wow. That count--

00:30:13.234 --> 00:30:14.367
Killingsworth: Yeah,
let's go with number five,

00:30:14.367 --> 00:30:15.701
"Ghosts feel funny."

00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:17.534
Wichary:
That's not the right answer.

00:30:17.534 --> 00:30:19.434
Germick: Ohhhh.
man: Whooo!

00:30:19.434 --> 00:30:20.667
[applause]
Wichary: Okay.

00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:21.701
But let--let me--
so the "Ghosts feel funny,"

00:30:21.701 --> 00:30:22.901
you already know
what it was.

00:30:22.901 --> 00:30:24.467
It was actually an interesting
bug to fix,

00:30:24.467 --> 00:30:26.567
but I like this one much more,
which was

00:30:26.567 --> 00:30:28.200
"Some people cannot
change directions."

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.667
Germick:
Yeah.

00:30:29.667 --> 00:30:30.667
Wichary: But I'm going to talk
about it in a second.

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:32.067
Let me talk about
everything else.

00:30:32.067 --> 00:30:35.267
So in Pac-Man, one of those
many, many little details

00:30:35.267 --> 00:30:37.968
is that the ghosts kind of
change their eyes' direction

00:30:37.968 --> 00:30:39.901
just a moment before
they change directions,

00:30:39.901 --> 00:30:41.968
so you can see where
they're going to go for,

00:30:41.968 --> 00:30:44.801
like, you know,
100 milliseconds.

00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:46.100
And, of course, we wanted
to have that too

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.367
because we wanted to pay
proper tribute to Pac-Man.

00:30:48.367 --> 00:30:49.367
Right?
Proper, that--

00:30:49.367 --> 00:30:50.701
so Ms. Pac-Man
when she dies,

00:30:50.701 --> 00:30:52.300
she does a little bit
of a different animation

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.667
with a different
sound effect.

00:30:54.667 --> 00:30:55.934
Germick: So it sounds
like a funeral or something.

00:30:55.934 --> 00:30:57.767
Wichary: "Could stop
with mouth open."

00:30:57.767 --> 00:31:02.033
Pac-Man, when he hits the wall,
never stops like this.

00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:03.501
A profile.

00:31:03.501 --> 00:31:06.000
It always kind of just, like,
does a little bit or nothing,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.601
which is, again,
never documented anywhere

00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:09.067
but I noticed it
and I wanted to add it in.

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:10.901
"Ghosts feel funny,"
you already know.

00:31:10.901 --> 00:31:12.901
"Eyes should travel home even,"
blah, blah, blah.

00:31:12.901 --> 00:31:17.734
This is when Pac-Man eats
a ghost, everything pauses.

00:31:17.734 --> 00:31:19.968
The whole game pauses for, like,
a couple hundred milliseconds

00:31:19.968 --> 00:31:22.701
or a second or so,
but if another ghost

00:31:22.701 --> 00:31:25.634
is already on its way home,
it's still going.

00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:27.934
So again, one of those things
that I wanted the game

00:31:27.934 --> 00:31:31.100
to be as--as true to the--
to the original as possible.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.400
"Some people can't
change directions."

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.100
That was actually
the most interesting one

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.501
because--this is the story.

00:31:36.501 --> 00:31:39.901
About one and a half weeks,
or something ridiculously close

00:31:39.901 --> 00:31:42.100
to the launch date,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.434
some people who
are testing the doodle at--

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:47.300
at the--you know,
at work are messaging me

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.400
saying, "Hey,
sometimes I changed--

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.834
I wanted Pac-Man to go up
and it doesn't go up,"

00:31:51.834 --> 00:31:54.901
or, you know, "Anyway, sometimes
it doesn't register it."

00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:58.067
One of these guys right here,
Jonathan, another bug test--

00:31:58.067 --> 00:32:00.300
bug, you know, reportee,
and--and I'm like,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.467
"This is not the kind of bug
I want to hear about

00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:04.501
one and a half weeks
before the launch."

00:32:04.501 --> 00:32:05.801
Germick: Some people
can't change directions.

00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:07.267
Wichary: Yeah.
It seems pretty serious.

00:32:07.267 --> 00:32:08.767
So I'm kind of trying
to investigate,

00:32:08.767 --> 00:32:11.033
I'm with Jonathan
on a mailing thread,

00:32:11.033 --> 00:32:14.434
and what happens,
what we find out is this:

00:32:14.434 --> 00:32:15.968
when you play a game
for as long as--

00:32:15.968 --> 00:32:18.334
you know, when you're a kind
of a good player,

00:32:18.334 --> 00:32:20.701
what you want to do is
you want to tell Pac-Man

00:32:20.701 --> 00:32:23.133
to change directions
much in advance, right?

00:32:23.133 --> 00:32:25.033
So for example, I'm going--
I want to go up.

00:32:25.033 --> 00:32:27.767
I'm going to press "up"
right now,

00:32:27.767 --> 00:32:29.434
and Pac-Man remembers
it is going to go up

00:32:29.434 --> 00:32:30.868
at the first possible
moment.

00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:32.968
He's actually going to
cut the corner a little bit,

00:32:32.968 --> 00:32:34.234
so it saves you
a couple of pixels,

00:32:34.234 --> 00:32:36.067
and the ghosts
don't do that.

00:32:36.067 --> 00:32:37.300
That's pretty great, right?

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.067
That's one of those little,
you know, "left"

00:32:39.067 --> 00:32:40.567
and it goes left.

00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:41.701
But if you're not
a good player

00:32:41.701 --> 00:32:43.000
or if you're not used
to video games,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.567
what you're going to do
is you're going to wait

00:32:45.567 --> 00:32:48.968
and press, right,
"left" here. You know.

00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:50.200
Okay, that's pretty solid.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.901
Except, sometimes
you're going to miss.

00:32:51.901 --> 00:32:53.734
Sometimes you're going to be
one pixel too late,

00:32:53.734 --> 00:32:55.767
or two pixels too late,
and the game's going to be,

00:32:55.767 --> 00:32:56.801
like, "Well, it took you
too late."

00:32:56.801 --> 00:32:58.267
Right?

00:32:58.267 --> 00:33:02.000
So I'm a usability person.
This is a usability problem.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.701
That's a pretty simple fix,
right?

00:33:03.701 --> 00:33:05.133
I thought about it
a little bit.

00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:06.367
Well, what I can do is,

00:33:06.367 --> 00:33:07.934
even if you're one
or two pixels too late,

00:33:07.934 --> 00:33:10.400
I can implement a check
that would, you know,

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.567
like, forgive you.

00:33:11.567 --> 00:33:13.601
You know, like, pretend
you did it in time

00:33:13.601 --> 00:33:16.434
and just put you back in the,
kind of, original way.

00:33:16.434 --> 00:33:17.968
Right?

00:33:17.968 --> 00:33:20.133
I added it, I sent it to people,
people were like,

00:33:20.133 --> 00:33:21.901
"Yeah, it works great now."
Awesome.

00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:23.667
Right?
Problem solved.

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:27.067
Except now I'm changing Pac-Man.
Right?

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:29.100
Do I want to be the George Lucas
of Pac-Man?

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.934
Right? Do I want to--
[laughter]

00:33:31.934 --> 00:33:33.801
Do I want to start
revisiting the old game

00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:35.534
and making it better?

00:33:35.534 --> 00:33:37.033
Germick: Does that make me
the Jar Jar--?

00:33:37.033 --> 00:33:38.367
Wichary: Yeah.
[laughter]

00:33:38.367 --> 00:33:40.400
You know, the only two things
we changed about Pac-Man

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.567
is Ryan created the board

00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:43.701
because it needed
to spell "Google"

00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:45.000
and I wanted to add
Ms. Pac-Man.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.367
But, as I already mentioned,
I did it in a--

00:33:46.367 --> 00:33:48.601
I tried to be respectful
to the original game.

00:33:48.601 --> 00:33:50.734
Right?
So we have a problem.

00:33:50.734 --> 00:33:53.033
What do I do?
Well, I go and play Pac-Man.

00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:54.868
I go, we have a Pac-Man game
at the campus

00:33:54.868 --> 00:33:59.067
and I start playing it,
and as I played I realized,

00:33:59.067 --> 00:34:02.534
somebody's already done
the same thing 30 years ago.

00:34:02.534 --> 00:34:05.901
They implemented exactly
the same fix I was thinking of.

00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:07.868
That's not documented
anywhere on the web.

00:34:07.868 --> 00:34:09.567
I never found
a mention of it.

00:34:09.567 --> 00:34:11.033
But, back in the 1980s,

00:34:11.033 --> 00:34:13.534
when nobody cared about
human-computer interaction,

00:34:13.534 --> 00:34:15.801
somebody was actually thinking
about stuff like that

00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:18.167
and implementing the fixes too.
It was amazing.

00:34:18.167 --> 00:34:19.934
It was, like, you know,
this is like a--

00:34:19.934 --> 00:34:22.667
like an anthropologist
or whatever or an archaeologist

00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:25.000
finding a dinosaur,
like, for me.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.667
Because this is like
intersection of computer history

00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:27.934
and human-computer
interaction,

00:34:27.934 --> 00:34:29.534
and somebody's already
thought about it.

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:31.467
So this is the code
that I added.

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:34.634
Right? It's--
it's very simple.

00:34:34.634 --> 00:34:36.634
I skipped some boring details,
but, you know,

00:34:36.634 --> 00:34:38.634
it was a simple fix,
but it was heartening to see

00:34:38.634 --> 00:34:43.400
I'm just really re-creating
what they've already done.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.934
Just as a side note,
you can read the comment.

00:34:45.934 --> 00:34:47.467
It's an actual comment
from the resource.

00:34:47.467 --> 00:34:49.701
We were playing Pac-Man
with Ryan for awhile

00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:52.801
and, you know, I thought
the code was rock-solid

00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:56.901
and at some point Ryan
went through the--the wall.

00:34:56.901 --> 00:34:58.133
Germick: I'm just that good.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:34:58.133 --> 00:34:59.601
Germick: I think
that's the issue.

00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:00.968
Wichary: I'm like, "Holy crap,
why did that happen?"

00:35:00.968 --> 00:35:03.501
And I had no idea why,
so I eventually added a check,

00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.300
not to prevent going
through the wall

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.300
but to detect if you're
going through the wall

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.801
and then, like,
putting you back,

00:35:08.801 --> 00:35:09.934
you know,
because I had no idea

00:35:09.934 --> 00:35:12.267
what to do,
and hopefully it helped.

00:35:12.267 --> 00:35:13.701
Nobody reported a bug that--
that--

00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:15.567
that went through the wall.

00:35:15.567 --> 00:35:17.234
But, you know, again,
sometimes you just have to do

00:35:17.234 --> 00:35:18.868
what you--what--
what's--what's the--

00:35:18.868 --> 00:35:22.834
the only thing possible.
All right. Team Pac-Man.

00:35:22.834 --> 00:35:23.968
Germick: All right.
Team Pac-Man.

00:35:23.968 --> 00:35:25.234
Morgan, what do you say?

00:35:25.234 --> 00:35:26.334
Morgan:
I know.

00:35:26.334 --> 00:35:27.667
I'm--I'm waiting
for two seconds.

00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:28.868
Germick:
Okay.

00:35:28.868 --> 00:35:30.467
man: How about
"Users feedback for 1,600"?

00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:32.434
We need it.
Morgan: Okay.

00:35:32.434 --> 00:35:34.234
Guy in the green shirt
says 1,600, "User feedback."

00:35:34.234 --> 00:35:36.234
Germick: All right.
Morgan: We're doing that.

00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:37.334
Wichary: Wow,
everybody's 1,600.

00:35:37.334 --> 00:35:38.334
Okay.
Germick: Way to--

00:35:38.334 --> 00:35:40.200
way to represent.
Okay.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.834
Wichary: This is one
of the tweets we got.

00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:43.634
We got a lot of tweets.

00:35:43.634 --> 00:35:45.400
We're very happy with
a lot of the feedback.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.200
This is one of the tweets
we got, that Pac-Man in HTML5

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.434
works great on Opera and Wii,
which was amazing

00:35:51.434 --> 00:35:53.934
because we never tested it
in Opera and Wii. Right?

00:35:53.934 --> 00:35:55.801
[laughter]
There's only so much you can do,

00:35:55.801 --> 00:35:58.501
but because we use HTML5,
you know,

00:35:58.501 --> 00:36:00.634
it worked everywhere
that supported HTML5.

00:36:00.634 --> 00:36:03.434
Except did we really use
HTML5?

00:36:03.434 --> 00:36:05.901
Well, here's a question
for you.

00:36:05.901 --> 00:36:07.567
What was the only aspect
of Pac-Man

00:36:07.567 --> 00:36:09.267
where we actually used HTML5?

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:12.667
[indistinct]
Wichary: All right.

00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:18.100
So was it "audio,"
was it "visual composition,"

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:23.267
was it "user interface,"
or was it "networking"?

00:36:23.267 --> 00:36:25.400
So what do you think?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.701
What's the only part of Pac-Man
we actually did use HTML5?

00:36:28.701 --> 00:36:33.067
Everything else was just
all solid HTML4.

00:36:33.067 --> 00:36:34.868
[indistinct chatter]

00:36:34.868 --> 00:36:36.434
Germick: Lot of talk,
lot of talk.

00:36:36.434 --> 00:36:38.434
Wichary:
Ha ha ha.

00:36:38.434 --> 00:36:42.100
Germick: Wow.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.167
This is a good,
like, memory game here.

00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:46.634
Morgan: Okay, have we heard
from this side?

00:36:46.634 --> 00:36:49.567
Is it three or four?
What do you guys think?

00:36:49.567 --> 00:36:51.067
man: Three.
Morgan: Three?

00:36:51.067 --> 00:36:53.601
We're going to go with three,
"User interface."

00:36:53.601 --> 00:36:54.968
Wichary: That is correct.
Germick: That's correct.

00:36:54.968 --> 00:36:56.968
Wichary: All right.
[laughter, applause]

00:36:56.968 --> 00:36:59.167
Give them some points.

00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:01.133
Germick: But I'm not proud
of what was done.

00:37:01.133 --> 00:37:02.667
[laughter]

00:37:02.667 --> 00:37:03.701
So again
I'll go for 1599.

00:37:03.701 --> 00:37:09.934
[laughter]
Wichary: All right.

00:37:09.934 --> 00:37:11.334
This is among the few lines

00:37:11.334 --> 00:37:13.000
that actually had to do
with HTML5.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.467
There was the touch, you know,
the swiping on any touch devices

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:20.167
that--that we added, and
we did test it extensively on--

00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:22.000
on those that we had
running around,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.567
laying around,
or whatever--

00:37:23.567 --> 00:37:25.067
but not Opera and Wii,

00:37:25.067 --> 00:37:26.400
and it was pretty fun
actually.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.067
You could tap to move or
you could swipe to move and--

00:37:30.067 --> 00:37:32.801
and then we got, you know,
nice feedback like this.

00:37:32.801 --> 00:37:34.100
Again, we didn't really
announce it.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.501
People discovered it
on their own.

00:37:35.501 --> 00:37:37.267
And that was part of
what we wanted. Right?

00:37:37.267 --> 00:37:39.868
We wanted to just delight
the users by adding things

00:37:39.868 --> 00:37:41.701
that they didn't think
were possible.

00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:43.734
Germick: I mean, I think in
general what gets us excited

00:37:43.734 --> 00:37:45.868
when we make a Google logo
is when, you know,

00:37:45.868 --> 00:37:48.634
somebody has a--
an emotional reaction to it.

00:37:48.634 --> 00:37:51.167
And one emotional reaction is,
like, desire.

00:37:51.167 --> 00:37:53.167
So you see Google Pac-Man,
you want to play it.

00:37:53.167 --> 00:37:55.801
When that desire is met, I think
we've done a really good job.

00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:58.367
Wichary: Yeah.
So here's another thing,

00:37:58.367 --> 00:38:01.434
for example, that gets me
excited about HTML5,

00:38:01.434 --> 00:38:02.767
and hopefully
we're going to be able

00:38:02.767 --> 00:38:05.400
to incorporate it more
and more in--in--in--

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.400
in all the doodles that we do
that are maybe interactive

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.634
or animated.
This is a doodle that--

00:38:10.634 --> 00:38:12.667
Germick:
Mike Dutton did.

00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:16.567
And it's for Nam June Paik,
a--a Korean video artist.

00:38:16.567 --> 00:38:18.300
Wichary: And I was thinking,
you know, what would it--

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.834
you know, how could we improve
it just as a--

00:38:19.834 --> 00:38:21.234
as a kind of, a,
you know,

00:38:21.234 --> 00:38:24.868
playing around with HTML5,
right?

00:38:24.868 --> 00:38:28.901
So we can just take--
take the doodle, stop it,

00:38:28.901 --> 00:38:31.701
we can just, you know,
we can zoom it in using CSS3,

00:38:31.701 --> 00:38:33.968
right, because now
it's kind of easy.

00:38:33.968 --> 00:38:37.067
And here's a video tag.
Right?

00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:39.133
HTML5 video tag,
and everybody want--

00:38:39.133 --> 00:38:41.567
knows why they love
HTML5 video. Right?

00:38:41.567 --> 00:38:44.567
Because it's, you know,
it's not as slow as Flash,

00:38:44.567 --> 00:38:46.701
it's integrated,
it lets you go about your life,

00:38:46.701 --> 00:38:47.968
et cetera, et cetera.
Right?

00:38:47.968 --> 00:38:50.434
We all have heard it,
but what excites me

00:38:50.434 --> 00:38:55.467
about HTML5 video is that
it's now a first-class citizen

00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:56.968
on the page.
Right?

00:38:56.968 --> 00:38:59.133
I can do with it whatever I can
do with any other diff

00:38:59.133 --> 00:39:00.601
or any other element
lying around.

00:39:00.601 --> 00:39:02.467
So that's only to silo
that doesn't care

00:39:02.467 --> 00:39:04.334
about z-index or Flash
is around.

00:39:04.334 --> 00:39:05.467
So what I can do,
you know,

00:39:05.467 --> 00:39:07.400
I can do a scene-to-scene
transform

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.400
to do it something like this.
Right?

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.901
It also respects
the alpha channel,

00:39:11.901 --> 00:39:13.234
which is amazing.

00:39:13.234 --> 00:39:14.734
It didn't use to happen,
and now it's here.

00:39:14.734 --> 00:39:17.868
And--and I can also just add
little CSS3 transformations

00:39:17.868 --> 00:39:20.067
and transitions
to make it just kind of,

00:39:20.067 --> 00:39:22.033
you know, power off--
man: Ah!

00:39:22.033 --> 00:39:24.734
Wichary: And power up.
Right? Like old TV.

00:39:24.734 --> 00:39:26.234
And--so this is
the demo put together.

00:39:26.234 --> 00:39:27.300
And now on top of this,

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.467
you still see
all of these effects

00:39:28.467 --> 00:39:30.167
that the presentation does.
Right?

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:31.834
With the interlace
and the flickering, and the--

00:39:31.834 --> 00:39:34.100
and the kind of banding
and ghosting and all of this.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.601
All works really well.

00:39:35.601 --> 00:39:36.868
And I think
that's pretty amazing.

00:39:36.868 --> 00:39:38.734
Again, that--that makes me
happy as a designer

00:39:38.734 --> 00:39:41.801
because I can do interfaces
that don't look like interfaces

00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:43.133
of the old days.

00:39:43.133 --> 00:39:44.834
They are really exciting
and they, you know,

00:39:44.834 --> 00:39:49.934
some of them, you know--
pretty nice.

00:39:49.934 --> 00:39:51.200
Yeah, so--

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.701
Germick: All right.
Team Ms. Pac-Man.

00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:56.534
Wichary:
Team Ms. Pac-Man.

00:39:56.534 --> 00:39:58.000
Germick: Chad?
We need a comeback.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.667
man:
Oh, yeah.

00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:01.868
man:
Programming for 3,000.

00:40:01.868 --> 00:40:04.300
Wichary: Ha ha!
Germick: Ha ha!

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.300
Wichary:
What's going on?

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.701
Germick:
Executive decision?

00:40:06.701 --> 00:40:08.400
Killingsworth: Let's go with
"Technology" for 800.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.868
Germick:
Sounds fair.

00:40:09.868 --> 00:40:12.234
Wichary: I like how people,
like, readjust their--

00:40:12.234 --> 00:40:13.534
Germick:
Okay.

00:40:13.534 --> 00:40:14.534
Wichary:
Oh, this is a nice one.

00:40:14.534 --> 00:40:15.834
This is--
this is a tricky one.

00:40:15.834 --> 00:40:19.167
What was the frame rate
of the Pac-Man doodle?

00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:25.267
Was it 30 frames per second?
45--Is this thing on?

00:40:25.267 --> 00:40:32.667
45 frames per second?
Was it 60? Or was it 90?

00:40:32.667 --> 00:40:34.834
What do you think?

00:40:34.834 --> 00:40:37.868
woman: 60.
man: 90.

00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:41.834
Germick: Little help from
your friends on Team Pac-Man?

00:40:41.834 --> 00:40:44.267
Wichary: [chuckles]
Germick: Or was it--?

00:40:44.267 --> 00:40:47.033
We haven't been the straightest
of shooters, have we?

00:40:47.033 --> 00:40:50.133
Wichary:
Hmm, interesting.

00:40:50.133 --> 00:40:54.334
Germick: Might have to make
a tough call, Chad.

00:40:54.334 --> 00:40:57.000
Wichary: I think--yeah.
What do you think?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.400
Killingsworth:
I have pretty adamant users

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.767
that it's three, "60."
Wichary: Okay.

00:41:01.767 --> 00:41:04.467
It is actually not three.
[electronic tones]

00:41:04.467 --> 00:41:06.734
Wichary: It's actually every
other answer, but three.

00:41:06.734 --> 00:41:09.234
Germick: Ha ha!

00:41:09.234 --> 00:41:11.267
Wichary: So--
Germick: Wow.

00:41:11.267 --> 00:41:12.901
I'm going to give you guys
some points

00:41:12.901 --> 00:41:15.767
because that was
amazing coincidence--

00:41:15.767 --> 00:41:17.067
like, odds you played against.

00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:19.567
I'll give you
three points for that.

00:41:19.567 --> 00:41:21.467
We're representing
for number three.

00:41:21.467 --> 00:41:22.701
Wichary: And--
and this is, again,

00:41:22.701 --> 00:41:24.400
just because I am
a kind of lazy programmer,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.801
so 90 goes into 45 divided by 2,
goes into 30 divided by 3.

00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:30.734
So we had this, you know,
procedure that said, you know,

00:41:30.734 --> 00:41:32.968
if you can do 90,
just cut it in half

00:41:32.968 --> 00:41:34.901
or cut it in three times
or whatever. Right?

00:41:34.901 --> 00:41:36.834
60 doesn't really fit
neatly anywhere,

00:41:36.834 --> 00:41:39.200
even though it's a standard
thing you would think of,

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.834
except
if you're in Europe.

00:41:40.834 --> 00:41:43.267
But, so this is the kind of--
and you know,

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:46.601
now we have the request webkit
animation frame or whatever

00:41:46.601 --> 00:41:49.033
or moz animation frames,
so it's kind of a nicer thing.

00:41:49.033 --> 00:41:50.534
We don't have to worry too much
about stuff like this,

00:41:50.534 --> 00:41:52.868
but this was the original
Pac-Man.

00:41:52.868 --> 00:41:55.133
And, since this is Google
homepage, right,

00:41:55.133 --> 00:41:57.267
we really have to worry about,
you know,

00:41:57.267 --> 00:41:59.567
things not eating too
many cycles when people just,

00:41:59.567 --> 00:42:01.601
you know, open Google.com
and leave it there.

00:42:01.601 --> 00:42:02.834
Right? And--

00:42:02.834 --> 00:42:05.167
and doesn't consume
too much battery life.

00:42:05.167 --> 00:42:06.868
So this is a--

00:42:06.868 --> 00:42:08.601
a Jules Verne doodle
that we did.

00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:09.667
When did we do it?

00:42:09.667 --> 00:42:11.868
Germick:
On February 7, 2011.

00:42:11.868 --> 00:42:14.033
Wichary: Yeah. So--so, you
remember this guy, maybe.

00:42:14.033 --> 00:42:16.267
You know, it could go up,
go down,

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.734
and if you kind of
leave it alone, you know,

00:42:18.734 --> 00:42:20.200
it's kind of like
going back to the surface

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.634
and it's kind of bobbing
on the surface,

00:42:21.634 --> 00:42:23.934
but all of this kind of
consumes energy. Right?

00:42:23.934 --> 00:42:26.167
So we had a couple of things
that we changed.

00:42:26.167 --> 00:42:29.601
For example, you know,
if nobody's interacting

00:42:29.601 --> 00:42:30.834
with the doodle--
hovering over it,

00:42:30.834 --> 00:42:32.000
playing with it--

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.334
at some point,
it's just going to stop.

00:42:33.334 --> 00:42:34.667
Right?
So it's in the--

00:42:34.667 --> 00:42:36.300
if it's the homepage
in the background.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.767
it's not going to do anything
to your processor.

00:42:38.767 --> 00:42:41.968
And we even--you know,
we care even enough to--

00:42:41.968 --> 00:42:43.767
to make sure that if you hover
over something,

00:42:43.767 --> 00:42:45.767
we throttle the hovering so,
you know,

00:42:45.767 --> 00:42:47.334
it's only as fast
as we need it to be.

00:42:47.334 --> 00:42:50.133
Right? So it doesn't fire too
often because some browsers

00:42:50.133 --> 00:42:51.968
are firing a lot of
hover states, you know,

00:42:51.968 --> 00:42:54.234
when you move mouse--
move around.

00:42:54.234 --> 00:42:55.567
So we just kind of
"time out" it,

00:42:55.567 --> 00:42:57.100
and it actually works
pretty well.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.400
So there's a number
of those techniques

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.968
that we have to develop
to make sure that, you know,

00:43:00.968 --> 00:43:05.067
that we don't kill browsers
of innocent people, I guess.

00:43:05.067 --> 00:43:06.200
All right.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.167
Germick: Okay,
Team Pac-Man, back up.

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:09.734
What do you got?

00:43:09.734 --> 00:43:10.901
man:
Programming for 800.

00:43:10.901 --> 00:43:12.167
Wichary:
Why is your team winning?

00:43:12.167 --> 00:43:14.367
Morgan: We're going for
"Programming" for 800.

00:43:14.367 --> 00:43:17.000
Germick: Okay.
Wichary: Yeah, like--

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.267
Germick:
Leader has spoken.

00:43:18.267 --> 00:43:20.300
Wichary: It's--
it's correlation and causation.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.300
The guide to storing--

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.534
Germick:
So which of the following

00:43:22.534 --> 00:43:25.567
is not a proper way
to control Google Pac-Man?

00:43:25.567 --> 00:43:27.968
And again, "proper."
Wichary: Yeah.

00:43:27.968 --> 00:43:32.167
Germick: "Arrow keys,"
"W-A-S-D,"

00:43:32.167 --> 00:43:35.267
"Clicking," or "Swiping"?

00:43:35.267 --> 00:43:36.868
Those are your--

00:43:36.868 --> 00:43:38.367
Wichary: Yeah. Not--
Germick: Options.

00:43:38.367 --> 00:43:41.400
Wichary: What's the only way
you cannot control Pac-Man?

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.634
man: Ah-choo!
Wichary: Bless you.

00:43:44.634 --> 00:43:47.033
[indistinct chatter]

00:43:47.033 --> 00:43:49.334
Germick: Debate--there's some
fervor and debate going there.

00:43:49.334 --> 00:43:50.701
man:
It's got to be "Clicking".

00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:51.701
Morgan: We're going
with "Clicking" because

00:43:51.701 --> 00:43:53.767
everybody
likes that answer.

00:43:53.767 --> 00:43:55.200
Germick: That's a no?
Wichary: No.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.367
You can actually--you can
control Pac-Man by clicking--

00:43:58.367 --> 00:43:59.734
Germick: This is what we call
a "trick question."

00:43:59.734 --> 00:44:01.167
Wichary:
Yeah.

00:44:01.167 --> 00:44:06.334
It is--it is a trick question
because "W-A-S-D" is the one

00:44:06.334 --> 00:44:07.601
where you can't
control Pac-Man,

00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:09.000
you can only control
Ms. Pac-Man. Right?

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.200
Germick:
But I kind of feel like--

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.767
that was unfair.
audience: Ohhh!

00:44:11.767 --> 00:44:14.033
Germick: And you deserve
some points.

00:44:14.033 --> 00:44:16.901
Wichary: Let's--
so--so that's the thing.

00:44:16.901 --> 00:44:19.567
But, here's--
here's the funny thing.

00:44:19.567 --> 00:44:24.267
So once we started doing
all those interactive doodles,

00:44:24.267 --> 00:44:26.834
we kind of have to worry
about people understanding

00:44:26.834 --> 00:44:28.267
how to interact with them.
Germick: Right.

00:44:28.267 --> 00:44:30.000
Because it's not like peo--
we as a company try

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.434
to get people off our search
page as quickly as possible.

00:44:32.434 --> 00:44:35.167
You know, our strategy is
to be useful and, you know,

00:44:35.167 --> 00:44:36.434
not to suck up your time
but to get you

00:44:36.434 --> 00:44:38.634
to where you're going
as quickly as possible.

00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:40.033
Wichary: Yeah.
Germick: So we--and we--

00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:41.567
you know, we've--
we don't--we don't--

00:44:41.567 --> 00:44:43.567
we don't anticipate people
sitting there for a long time

00:44:43.567 --> 00:44:45.000
trying to click
and figure out what's going on,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.501
so we try to have
our user interfaces

00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:48.601
on our Google doodles
as intuitive as possible.

00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:49.934
Wichary: Yeah.
And the other thing is that,

00:44:49.934 --> 00:44:52.133
you know, many of the people
who come to--to--

00:44:52.133 --> 00:44:53.701
to see the homepage,

00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:55.334
you know, they're not--
they don't play video games.

00:44:55.334 --> 00:44:56.734
They don't use, you know,
they're not used

00:44:56.734 --> 00:44:58.534
to some of the convention
that we might be used to.

00:44:58.534 --> 00:45:01.167
So for example, this was
the Jules Verne doodle.

00:45:01.167 --> 00:45:03.601
This is the original sketch
that came from illustrator

00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:05.133
Jennifer Hom,
and you know,

00:45:05.133 --> 00:45:06.834
originally it was just
meant to be an illustration

00:45:06.834 --> 00:45:08.234
and then we thought, you know,
we could do something

00:45:08.234 --> 00:45:09.767
more exciting about it
since, you know,

00:45:09.767 --> 00:45:11.801
Jules Verne
loved exploration.

00:45:11.801 --> 00:45:13.434
Maybe we could do something
with exploring as well.

00:45:13.434 --> 00:45:18.000
And this is the first prototype
that we had.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.033
So it's very simple
and it operates

00:45:20.033 --> 00:45:22.767
exactly the same way
that Pac-Man did.

00:45:22.767 --> 00:45:24.334
You can use arrow keys
to move it around.

00:45:24.334 --> 00:45:26.901
We actually don't have
left/right, just up and down.

00:45:26.901 --> 00:45:29.968
But nobody's going to
figure out that that's possible.

00:45:29.968 --> 00:45:31.400
Right?
It doesn't look like--

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.067
you would--wouldn't--
with Pac-Man, it's easier

00:45:33.067 --> 00:45:34.300
because it's Pac-Man.
Right?

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.667
You kind of know
what it's going to do.

00:45:37.667 --> 00:45:39.767
So we're going to try
something new. Right?

00:45:39.767 --> 00:45:41.334
So we wanted to do
this interface

00:45:41.334 --> 00:45:45.100
that was a little bit more,
you know, "Jules Verne-y,"

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.567
if you will.
And, you know,

00:45:46.567 --> 00:45:49.734
try to do this guy where
you kind of like rotate it,

00:45:49.734 --> 00:45:51.734
but it's kind of
a weird thing. Right?

00:45:51.734 --> 00:45:53.167
It's kind of like--
doesn't feel--

00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:55.934
it's kind of circular
but it's directional

00:45:55.934 --> 00:45:57.334
and it's a little bit confusing.
Right?

00:45:57.334 --> 00:45:59.367
So we weren't
very happy with that.

00:45:59.367 --> 00:46:03.067
The next iteration was,
you know,

00:46:03.067 --> 00:46:06.267
we wanted to add
this regular joystick--

00:46:06.267 --> 00:46:09.000
try to make it look a little bit
more, you know, again,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.501
like it belonged to the--
to the--to the era,

00:46:11.501 --> 00:46:14.133
but otherwise,
it's just a standard thing.

00:46:14.133 --> 00:46:15.868
And it was the first time
actually we ran usability tests

00:46:15.868 --> 00:46:17.133
on our doodle.

00:46:17.133 --> 00:46:18.567
It was just, you know, like,
grab some Googlers

00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:20.801
in the corridor or whatever,
but we did it.

00:46:20.801 --> 00:46:22.534
And what we found out,
a couple of interesting things.

00:46:22.534 --> 00:46:24.234
First of all,
nobody figures out

00:46:24.234 --> 00:46:26.100
that you can actually
interact with this thing.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.467
It looks like a joystick,

00:46:27.467 --> 00:46:29.434
but otherwise it's not
very exciting, right?

00:46:29.434 --> 00:46:31.801
And the other thing was
that people inexplicably tried

00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:33.834
to click on the dials.

00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:35.501
We never really found out why,
but it's kind of

00:46:35.501 --> 00:46:37.934
one of those things that
you just find in usability.

00:46:37.934 --> 00:46:39.434
Right?
Usability--

00:46:39.434 --> 00:46:40.701
usability won't answer
some questions,

00:46:40.701 --> 00:46:42.734
but at least it will give you
the problems.

00:46:42.734 --> 00:46:46.167
So what we ended up doing
was this guy. Right?

00:46:46.167 --> 00:46:48.400
You can see it evolved
quite a bit from the original,

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.367
and first of all,
this looks like a huge lever.

00:46:51.367 --> 00:46:52.467
So you kind of
want to mess with it.

00:46:52.467 --> 00:46:53.634
It has up and down.

00:46:53.634 --> 00:46:55.067
It's a little bit more
pronounced,

00:46:55.067 --> 00:46:57.634
so you know that, you know,
that this is the thing to do.

00:46:57.634 --> 00:47:01.033
And check out what happens
when I click on those guys.

00:47:01.033 --> 00:47:02.234
The lever actually
lights up.

00:47:02.234 --> 00:47:04.801
It's a kind of like
a cheap trick, you know,

00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:07.434
but, you know, gets your
attention where it needs to be.

00:47:07.434 --> 00:47:09.434
Right? And then of course
you can still do--

00:47:09.434 --> 00:47:12.434
you can still do up and down
with arrow keys.

00:47:12.434 --> 00:47:14.033
And what we also added--

00:47:14.033 --> 00:47:16.868
and it's hard to demonstrate
here because this is all wired--

00:47:16.868 --> 00:47:19.667
but we also added the thing
on browsers that's supported,

00:47:19.667 --> 00:47:22.734
you can lift it up
and kind of tilt it.

00:47:22.734 --> 00:47:24.167
And it would use
accelerometer,

00:47:24.167 --> 00:47:26.834
not unlike what I did
with the Power Glove before to--

00:47:26.834 --> 00:47:28.133
to get it running.

00:47:28.133 --> 00:47:30.200
It was so new that,
you know, we actually had,

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.601
like, three different
code files,

00:47:31.601 --> 00:47:33.634
depending if you're running
Mozilla or Chrome

00:47:33.634 --> 00:47:34.868
or IOS devices,

00:47:34.868 --> 00:47:37.133
because they all report
very different numbers,

00:47:37.133 --> 00:47:38.767
which was really,
really interesting.

00:47:38.767 --> 00:47:42.634
But what this allows us--
what it allowed us to discover,

00:47:42.634 --> 00:47:46.534
you know, got some really nice
feedback like this.

00:47:46.534 --> 00:47:49.000
You know, people didn't realize
they have acceler--

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.801
It was great. Right?

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.834
It's like, we're at this--
we're at the point in time

00:47:52.834 --> 00:47:54.467
where, like, people are finding
out in their browsers

00:47:54.467 --> 00:47:55.934
that they have new hardware
or something.

00:47:55.934 --> 00:47:58.000
Germick: This--and it was also
probably the largest deployment

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.567
of CSS3 on any single project
ever on the web.

00:48:01.567 --> 00:48:03.701
Wichary: Yeah. So this was
really, really exciting for us

00:48:03.701 --> 00:48:06.767
because, you know, we could--
we could--

00:48:06.767 --> 00:48:08.167
and that's what
we're trying to do.

00:48:08.167 --> 00:48:09.734
We--we have, you know,
we have new ideas

00:48:09.734 --> 00:48:11.868
for other things that are
in HTML5 that are really,

00:48:11.868 --> 00:48:13.534
really experimental,
but, you know.

00:48:13.534 --> 00:48:15.567
I guess, stay tuned.
Germick: Yeah.

00:48:15.567 --> 00:48:17.834
Wichary: I think this is the--
yeah.

00:48:17.834 --> 00:48:19.901
Germick: Great.
Oh, there we go.

00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:21.968
All right.
Team Ms. Pac-Man.

00:48:21.968 --> 00:48:23.601
Hurting over there.
Wichary: Should we do--

00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:25.200
should we do one more
and Q&amp;A?

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.567
Germick: One--one more--
Well, do we have a finale?

00:48:27.567 --> 00:48:28.734
Wichary: Yeah. We have to do--
we have to do something.

00:48:28.734 --> 00:48:30.234
Germick: Do you guys
want to go for a finale?

00:48:30.234 --> 00:48:31.434
man:
Finale for sure.

00:48:31.434 --> 00:48:32.434
Germick: All right.
Wichary: All right.

00:48:32.434 --> 00:48:34.033
Germick: I think
we bring Chad up.

00:48:34.033 --> 00:48:35.634
I think what we have to do
is bring Chad up.

00:48:35.634 --> 00:48:37.200
Wichary: So what's happening
in the finale,

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.834
we need to one person from--
It's very, kind of,

00:48:40.834 --> 00:48:43.634
by coincidence
worth 1819 points.

00:48:43.634 --> 00:48:45.033
Germick: Wow.
Wichary: And we need somebody--

00:48:45.033 --> 00:48:46.801
Germick: Wow,
that really works out.

00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:48.334
Wichary: Seriously,

00:48:48.334 --> 00:48:51.067
it's just very, very, very,
very weird that it happened.

00:48:51.067 --> 00:48:52.901
Germick: Chad, Morgan, you guys
did a great job standing up.

00:48:52.901 --> 00:48:54.467
First of all, round of applause,
no matter what happens.

00:48:54.467 --> 00:48:57.467
[applause]
Earned your hats.

00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:00.100
Sir, please come to the stage.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.534
You're going to play
for your team

00:49:01.534 --> 00:49:03.667
and for the grand prize
of honor,

00:49:03.667 --> 00:49:05.734
because we don't really have
any more prizes.

00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:10.701
Wichary: But--so it's actually
incredibly simple.

00:49:10.701 --> 00:49:12.767
You have to survive
15 seconds of Pac-Man.

00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:14.634
Germick: To the keyboard,
my friend.

00:49:14.634 --> 00:49:15.634
Wichary:
Anybody can do it.

00:49:15.634 --> 00:49:17.367
Right?
So yeah.

00:49:17.367 --> 00:49:19.200
You guys are ready
for, like, applause?

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.200
You know, giving some--
Okay, 15 seconds.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.400
Germick: All right.
Wichary: Arrow keys.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.534
Germick: There you go.

00:49:25.534 --> 00:49:28.434
Wichary: All right.
Let's make it happen.

00:49:28.434 --> 00:49:30.434
Germick:
One small twist.

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:32.934
It's first player
Pac-Man.

00:49:32.934 --> 00:49:34.100
Wichary: Yeah.
Germick: We're good, we're good.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.434
Fifteen seconds
is all you need.

00:49:35.434 --> 00:49:36.434
Wichary: Yeah, let's--
let's give it up.

00:49:36.434 --> 00:49:37.968
Come on, come on.
[cheering]

00:49:37.968 --> 00:49:39.934
Wichary: Go, go!
Germick: All right, ten--

00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:41.367
[cheering]
Nine, eight--seven--

00:49:41.367 --> 00:49:42.868
Ohhh! Oh! Six.

00:49:42.868 --> 00:49:44.501
Wichary: Go, go.
Five, four, three--

00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:46.400
Germick:
There's also no energizers.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.734
man: No!
Wichary: Whoo!

00:49:49.734 --> 00:49:50.801
Germick: Oh, he got it.
Congratulations.

00:49:50.801 --> 00:49:51.868
Great job.
Wichary: Nice.

00:49:51.868 --> 00:49:56.701
[applause]
Nice. All right.

00:49:56.701 --> 00:49:57.968
Germick:
There it is. Wow.

00:49:57.968 --> 00:49:59.501
Wichary: Sweet.
Germick: So close, so close.

00:49:59.501 --> 00:50:01.634
And Team Ms. Pac-Man,
again, congratulations.

00:50:01.634 --> 00:50:02.701
Wichary:
Yeah.

00:50:02.701 --> 00:50:06.067
[cheering, clapping]

00:50:06.067 --> 00:50:07.300
Wichary: Thank you so much.
Germick: Wow.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.901
Wichary: We have
about ten minutes for Q&amp;A

00:50:09.901 --> 00:50:11.367
if anybody wants
to ask us questions.

00:50:11.367 --> 00:50:12.567
Germick: Yeah.
Wichary: We have mics.

00:50:12.567 --> 00:50:13.567
Germick:
There's mics on either side.

00:50:13.567 --> 00:50:15.033
Come on.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:50:15.033 --> 00:50:16.634
man: [indistinct]
Wichary: Sorry?

00:50:16.634 --> 00:50:18.400
man: Are you hiring?
Germick: Google's always hiring.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.734
Wichary: Yeah.
Germick: I think that's true.

00:50:19.734 --> 00:50:21.567
Wichary: Are you hiring?
Germick: I'm hiring.

00:50:21.567 --> 00:50:22.734
Wichary: Yeah.
Germick: I mean--

00:50:22.734 --> 00:50:23.801
Wichary: We--we--
Germick: Depends--

00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:24.968
I mean,
depends on the work, I guess.

00:50:24.968 --> 00:50:25.968
Wichary: We're definitely
hiring for the--

00:50:25.968 --> 00:50:27.534
I'm on the User Experience team.

00:50:27.534 --> 00:50:28.901
We're definitely hiring,
so you know.

00:50:28.901 --> 00:50:30.067
Germick: Doodle--
Doodle Team is hiring as well.

00:50:30.067 --> 00:50:31.467
If you guys are illustrators
or even--

00:50:31.467 --> 00:50:33.167
we have a [indistinct]
for Google engineers,

00:50:33.167 --> 00:50:34.200
so if this stuff
sounds fun to you,

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.334
let me know.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:50:35.334 --> 00:50:36.567
And this is
kind of what I do.

00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:38.801
Like, this is my work.
Right here, what I do.

00:50:38.801 --> 00:50:40.367
This presentation stuff--

00:50:40.367 --> 00:50:43.701
not all of it, of course.
But it's--it's a lot of fun.

00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:45.100
Any--any--
Yes, sir?

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.901
man: Yeah, did you guys
do any analytics

00:50:46.901 --> 00:50:49.267
on how many collective
person hours

00:50:49.267 --> 00:50:51.701
were consumed
by the Pac-Man doodle?

00:50:51.701 --> 00:50:54.133
Germick: We didn't--we don't
have any numbers to share,

00:50:54.133 --> 00:50:58.067
but there was an outside company
that estimated, I think,

00:50:58.067 --> 00:51:01.267
4.8 million man hours
spent on Google Pac-Man doodle.

00:51:01.267 --> 00:51:03.400
Wichary: Billion--
billions.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.601
Yeah.
Germick: Yeah, so...

00:51:04.601 --> 00:51:06.100
Rome wasn't built in a day,

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.400
and it definitely wasn't
built on Friday, May 21, 2010.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.334
Wichary: Yes, sir?

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:13.167
man: All right.
I have two questions for you.

00:51:13.167 --> 00:51:19.033
One is, why didn't you
look at the code

00:51:19.033 --> 00:51:21.300
when you were doing
your Pac-Man doodle?

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.801
I know it's kind of cheating
and all that,

00:51:22.801 --> 00:51:24.467
but I find it interesting.

00:51:24.467 --> 00:51:29.100
And the other question is--
It's--it's--

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.667
it's more a reflection
than a question,

00:51:30.667 --> 00:51:33.701
but I love the doodles and
I don't see them much anymore

00:51:33.701 --> 00:51:35.367
because Chrome
has the omni-bar

00:51:35.367 --> 00:51:37.334
so you never go
to the homepage unless--

00:51:37.334 --> 00:51:38.601
Germick: Chrome Team!
man: Somebody tells you,

00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:39.868
"There's
a great doodle today."

00:51:39.868 --> 00:51:41.067
So how do we solve this?

00:51:41.067 --> 00:51:43.167
How do I get Google doodles
back in my life?

00:51:43.167 --> 00:51:44.434
Germick: You do two--two ways.
All right.

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.334
So we'll answer
your questions in reverse.

00:51:46.334 --> 00:51:47.701
One, you set Google
to your homepage,

00:51:47.701 --> 00:51:49.767
and two, in the search results
of every doodle,

00:51:49.767 --> 00:51:52.200
the logo changes as well.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.267
So if you click on that logo,

00:51:53.267 --> 00:51:54.300
it'll take you back
to the homepage

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.300
and you can have the--
man: Okay.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:56.467
Germick:
Full immersive experience,

00:51:56.467 --> 00:51:58.033
and--and stay tuned
for other features

00:51:58.033 --> 00:52:00.200
we're working on where those
might be more visible to you.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.734
Wichary: Yeah. We--we--we're
doing some experimentation.

00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:03.200
man: All right.
And then the code.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.434
What--why--
why weren't you able

00:52:04.434 --> 00:52:05.634
to just use the code?
Wichary: Yeah.

00:52:05.634 --> 00:52:07.067
So--so there's
a couple of things.

00:52:07.067 --> 00:52:10.734
One--one was that, like, Namco,
they were incredibly supportive

00:52:10.734 --> 00:52:12.467
and they gave us
a lot of feedback on--

00:52:12.467 --> 00:52:14.367
on the thing, but they're kind
of guarding the code, you know.

00:52:14.367 --> 00:52:16.400
It's their secret source,
and--and--

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.200
but also, like, I'm...
like, you know,

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.868
I programmed in Assembly
like many, many years ago

00:52:22.868 --> 00:52:24.067
and I don't really, you know,
I couldn't--

00:52:24.067 --> 00:52:25.200
couldn't read it.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.868
But the thing is that--
what was amazing is

00:52:26.868 --> 00:52:29.133
the number of people
on the Internet that essentially

00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:32.033
reverse-engineered,
like, 80% of Pac-Man.

00:52:32.033 --> 00:52:34.234
There are, like, websites
like the Pac-Man Dossier

00:52:34.234 --> 00:52:35.934
where they'll, like,
show you all the numbers

00:52:35.934 --> 00:52:37.501
and all the techniques.

00:52:37.501 --> 00:52:39.434
So it was easy
to just look at them and,

00:52:39.434 --> 00:52:40.834
you know--
man: Mm-hmm.

00:52:40.834 --> 00:52:42.167
Wichary: And try to--try to--
try to figure it together

00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:43.434
and recreate it in JavaScript,
which we wanted to do

00:52:43.434 --> 00:52:46.133
because, you know,
it felt like a proper tribute.

00:52:46.133 --> 00:52:49.100
Right? It wouldn't be a tribute
where we just emulated it.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.400
We wanted to do it using
technologies that we believe in.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.000
Germick: I think it's similar
in the way we did

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.300
the Rube Goldberg doodle.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.234
Marcin basically built
this entire contraption of,

00:52:57.234 --> 00:52:59.167
you know, CSS3 and Canvas
and JavaScript

00:52:59.167 --> 00:53:01.067
to create the sprite,
and it was almost like,

00:53:01.067 --> 00:53:02.634
you know, a mousetrap
or something itself.

00:53:02.634 --> 00:53:05.167
Or, we did a Charlie Chaplin
video, you know,

00:53:05.167 --> 00:53:07.300
and we did it, you know,
we shot actual video and--

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.467
in Niles just across
Dumbarton Bridge.

00:53:09.467 --> 00:53:10.467
Wichary:
Mm-hmm.

00:53:10.467 --> 00:53:11.467
Germick: And, you know,
we did it--

00:53:11.467 --> 00:53:12.934
we released it
as a YouTube video

00:53:12.934 --> 00:53:15.067
'cause we thought that was
the most fitting tribute.

00:53:15.067 --> 00:53:17.300
Wichary: Yeah.
man: Thank you.

00:53:18.734 --> 00:53:21.100
man: Hi. I actually used to
work on the Calendar Team

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.300
and one thing we had way back
then for a short period of time

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.667
was a calendar that actually
showed the doodle--

00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:28.167
Germick: Yeah.
man: Every day.

00:53:28.167 --> 00:53:30.234
And I was wondering--
actually kind of Josh's point--

00:53:30.234 --> 00:53:32.634
I started it because I didn't
see the doodles much anymore--

00:53:32.634 --> 00:53:33.901
Germick:
Sure.

00:53:33.901 --> 00:53:35.067
man: Is there any chance
that that could come back?

00:53:35.067 --> 00:53:36.067
Germick:
There's definitely a chance.

00:53:36.067 --> 00:53:37.434
That's a great idea.
Yeah.

00:53:37.434 --> 00:53:38.968
And like Marcin said,
there's--there's a--

00:53:38.968 --> 00:53:41.601
a lot of exploration and ideas
around how to bring this up

00:53:41.601 --> 00:53:43.601
because we--we're very
flattered that people enjoy them

00:53:43.601 --> 00:53:46.334
and we'll certainly keep
making them as--

00:53:46.334 --> 00:53:47.968
as long as people are
interested to see them.

00:53:47.968 --> 00:53:49.000
Wichary: Yeah.
Thank you.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.133
Germick:
Yeah. Thanks.

00:53:50.133 --> 00:53:51.133
Wichary: I love Calendar,
by the way.

00:53:51.133 --> 00:53:52.267
Germick:
Yeah. Me too.

00:53:52.267 --> 00:53:53.734
man: I was just wondering
how many hours

00:53:53.734 --> 00:53:55.734
and how many people worked
on the Pac-Man doodle.

00:53:55.734 --> 00:53:56.968
Wichary: Ha ha!
Germick: Ah, well--

00:53:56.968 --> 00:53:58.334
Wichary: We actually had
all of these questions

00:53:58.334 --> 00:54:00.100
that you're asking
as part of the presentation,

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.400
but we just ran out of time.

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.801
man: Oh, it's in there.
So I know. Exactly.

00:54:02.801 --> 00:54:04.534
That's why it sucks
that you guys had to stop.

00:54:04.534 --> 00:54:06.300
We should just go on
through the I/O and--

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.300
Germick: Let's go drinkin',
and we'll play a little game.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.000
Wichary: Should--should we try
to find this question?

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.267
Germick: Ha. Sure.
Well, I mean.

00:54:14.267 --> 00:54:18.100
But--but--but your answer on
both fronts is kind of "a lot."

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:21.200
But, you know, it wasn't really
tallied in terms of man hours.

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.033
It's basically [whistles]
a little crazy

00:54:23.033 --> 00:54:25.834
and just does whatever it takes
to get it done,

00:54:25.834 --> 00:54:27.801
which is awesome to work
with somebody like that.

00:54:27.801 --> 00:54:30.567
It's actually something I have
to take great responsibility for

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:33.734
because if I suggest something
that would maybe improve it,

00:54:33.734 --> 00:54:37.300
like, he's compulsively--
will do it.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.767
So you know, I'm careful
with my suggestions.

00:54:39.767 --> 00:54:42.567
But, the question here is--
you know, yeah, we didn't--

00:54:42.567 --> 00:54:43.801
this is another trick one,

00:54:43.801 --> 00:54:45.234
and since we didn't
really tally.

00:54:45.234 --> 00:54:48.133
It was a labor of love and,
I mean, I had to fly to Japan

00:54:48.133 --> 00:54:50.100
to negotiate rights
to work with Namco.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:52.133
I mean, do I get
to tally the hours

00:54:52.133 --> 00:54:54.200
where I spent watching "Beowulf"
on the flight?

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.734
I don't know.
Wichary: Ha ha!

00:54:55.734 --> 00:54:58.167
Germick: I certainly would like
those hours back in some way.

00:54:58.167 --> 00:55:00.634
But...yeah.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:55:00.634 --> 00:55:02.033
Germick: In terms of
collaborators, I mean,

00:55:02.033 --> 00:55:05.267
Marcin can tell us, like,
a lot of people helped.

00:55:05.267 --> 00:55:06.567
Wichary: Yeah.
This is--

00:55:06.567 --> 00:55:09.100
the is the progress
that we had after one hour.

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:10.701
So not very exciting.

00:55:10.701 --> 00:55:13.200
This was actually still
when it was a vector game.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.434
Because I didn't know
any better.

00:55:14.434 --> 00:55:16.367
I had to rewrite it
two times after that.

00:55:16.367 --> 00:55:18.234
One when I set, you know,
floating to integer

00:55:18.234 --> 00:55:21.901
and one when I went from
vector to actual bitmap.

00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:24.968
So that's one thing.
This is--but this is--

00:55:24.968 --> 00:55:27.000
Germick: This is a version
I made on my Trackpad

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.934
in about 15 minutes, and Marcin
said, "Okay I'll do it.

00:55:28.934 --> 00:55:31.133
Just give me a damn mock-up."
And--

00:55:31.133 --> 00:55:32.400
Wichary: Sorry.
Germick: Ha ha. No.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.734
He said it in
the friendliest way.

00:55:33.734 --> 00:55:35.534
When--with the Polish accent,
it just comes across

00:55:35.534 --> 00:55:39.701
as a regular speaking voice.
But--but--yeah.

00:55:39.701 --> 00:55:42.801
man: [indistinct] Oh, you just
drew it yourself by hand.

00:55:42.801 --> 00:55:44.300
Germick: I made it on, like,
my Trackpad in Adob--

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:45.300
in Illustrator.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.701
man: Ah.
Germick: No. Yeah.

00:55:46.701 --> 00:55:47.968
Wichary: Yeah, and I just--
I just made this quick mock,

00:55:47.968 --> 00:55:49.267
and actual--like,
the ghost in Pac-Man actually,

00:55:49.267 --> 00:55:50.767
are like rounded-corner diffs.

00:55:50.767 --> 00:55:52.767
They're not even graphics,
you know.

00:55:52.767 --> 00:55:54.200
Germick: But, yeah,
this was enough for us

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.434
to sign a share with Namco

00:55:55.434 --> 00:55:57.601
and share with
our internal stakeholders

00:55:57.601 --> 00:55:59.167
to get a green light
to make it happen.

00:55:59.167 --> 00:56:02.501
Wichary: Yeah. And this was
still the same day. So--so--

00:56:02.501 --> 00:56:04.000
man: Same day
you had the idea?

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.801
Germick: It was actually also
his birthday, which I forgot.

00:56:05.801 --> 00:56:08.300
It's a touchy subject.
Wichary: Yeah. Ha ha ha ha.

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.934
This is actually the page
that I talked about, you know.

00:56:09.934 --> 00:56:13.067
This guy, Jamey Pittman,
who just put together

00:56:13.067 --> 00:56:16.667
all of these things about
Pac-Man, including the--

00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:19.300
I'm going kind of fast--
but, you know, numbers,

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.667
algorithms,
and stuff like this.

00:56:20.667 --> 00:56:23.200
Essentially, 80% of the game
is right here.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.667
And we got a lot of
feedback from Namco

00:56:24.667 --> 00:56:26.367
and, you know, I just
played the game a lot as well

00:56:26.367 --> 00:56:28.767
and I had this, like,
running tally of--

00:56:28.767 --> 00:56:31.100
This--
we got some cool feedback.

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:33.467
Some people thought
that we actually emulated it--

00:56:33.467 --> 00:56:36.767
which was-- I--it was--like,
I was very happy. Right?

00:56:36.767 --> 00:56:39.934
Of course, there were
other people who thought

00:56:39.934 --> 00:56:42.968
the exact opposite.
Ha ha.

00:56:42.968 --> 00:56:44.801
Germick: No. Stings.
Still stings.

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:48.400
Wichary: Yeah.
Germick: Yeah.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.367
We sympathize with
the Atari Pac-Man people.

00:56:50.367 --> 00:56:52.734
man: Worse than the Atari one?
Wichary: Yeah.

00:56:52.734 --> 00:56:54.601
man: Everybody at-reply
to this person right now.

00:56:54.601 --> 00:56:57.834
Wichary: Yeah. Ha ha.
I--I like this one.

00:56:57.834 --> 00:56:59.434
You know, with--
with a lot of volume

00:56:59.434 --> 00:57:00.801
and we got really
a lot of feedback.

00:57:00.801 --> 00:57:02.767
It was really very flattering
and--and--and--and--

00:57:02.767 --> 00:57:04.067
and very touching.
Germick: Yeah.

00:57:04.067 --> 00:57:05.767
Wichary: There's always,
you know, a long--

00:57:05.767 --> 00:57:08.567
a huge variety of--
of tweets or comments

00:57:08.567 --> 00:57:11.467
you're going to get.
Okay.

00:57:11.467 --> 00:57:14.567
Who was--who's on first?
Germick: Ah, what time--?

00:57:14.567 --> 00:57:15.968
You were standing
the longest, sir.

00:57:15.968 --> 00:57:17.234
Why don't you give us
your question.

00:57:17.234 --> 00:57:20.868
man: So my question
is actually--the Google doodles,

00:57:20.868 --> 00:57:23.000
they serve as really great
technology demos

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.734
for doing things without Flash
and for a while without HTML5

00:57:26.734 --> 00:57:30.601
or CSS3, but when you go
to view source on that,

00:57:30.601 --> 00:57:32.400
of course, all the Google stuff
is completely packed

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.834
and you can't
see any of that.

00:57:33.834 --> 00:57:35.100
Do you guys have any plans
to show off

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.000
any of your source code
as technology demos?

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.634
Germick:
That's a great idea.

00:57:39.634 --> 00:57:42.100
So for the U.I. experiments
that Marcin showed

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.934
for Jules Verne, you actually
posted on your blog

00:57:44.934 --> 00:57:46.968
pretty robust examples
of how we did that,

00:57:46.968 --> 00:57:48.467
and I think the code there
is not packed.

00:57:48.467 --> 00:57:50.467
Wichary: Yeah.
This--this is--

00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:51.767
yeah, this is your chance
to look at the Pac-Man code.

00:57:51.767 --> 00:57:53.834
We will scroll it
really quickly.

00:57:53.834 --> 00:57:57.267
Unfortunately,
we can't share this one

00:57:57.267 --> 00:57:59.601
because, you know,
part of it belongs to Namco.

00:57:59.601 --> 00:58:01.100
Germick: Yeah.
Wichary: Right?

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:04.434
So that's a little bit tricky.
But we do have, you know--

00:58:04.434 --> 00:58:05.434
Germick:
We can show you the code

00:58:05.434 --> 00:58:06.734
behind our first
interactive doodle.

00:58:06.734 --> 00:58:09.033
man: Wait,
what part belongs to Namco?

00:58:09.033 --> 00:58:10.434
man:
The crusher.

00:58:10.434 --> 00:58:12.367
Wichary: Well, the--the--
the algorithms that go over

00:58:12.367 --> 00:58:14.834
and the way that, you know,
that the game behaves.

00:58:14.834 --> 00:58:16.901
man: Oh, so they--they didn't
give you that part?

00:58:16.901 --> 00:58:18.167
Wichary: They didn't, but--
Germick: They--

00:58:18.167 --> 00:58:19.534
they gave us our--
their blessing to emulate it.

00:58:19.534 --> 00:58:20.701
Wichary: Yeah.

00:58:20.701 --> 00:58:22.100
man: Oh, it belongs, like--
Wichary: Yeah.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.434
man: The intellectual
rights belong to--

00:58:23.434 --> 00:58:24.567
Germick: Right.
Wichary: Yeah, you--

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.067
Germick: They let us reuse it,
though.

00:58:26.067 --> 00:58:27.267
man: Oh, I see.

00:58:27.267 --> 00:58:28.434
Wichary: This was--
as Ryan mentioned,

00:58:28.434 --> 00:58:31.434
this was the first
interactive doodle.

00:58:31.434 --> 00:58:32.868
It was actually--
when was it? 2000?

00:58:32.868 --> 00:58:35.300
Germick: 2010, January.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:39.167
It was back when we actually--

00:58:39.167 --> 00:58:40.434
Somebody did it by hand.

00:58:40.434 --> 00:58:42.033
Germick: Yeah, Chris Holm,
one of--

00:58:42.033 --> 00:58:45.367
another doodle engineer, yeah,
actually wrote it all by hand.

00:58:45.367 --> 00:58:46.701
Wichary: Yeah.
But of course now--

00:58:46.701 --> 00:58:49.601
now we have JS optimizers
and compilers that--

00:58:49.601 --> 00:58:54.100
This is Pac-Man code again,
just, in a way, you know--

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.200
We don't really do it
as much to obfuscate the code

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.133
but to make sure--you know,
the compiler also does

00:58:58.133 --> 00:58:59.434
a number of checks,
and of course the code

00:58:59.434 --> 00:59:01.634
is more compact,
so the latency is lower,

00:59:01.634 --> 00:59:02.968
et cetera, et cetera.
Germick: Yeah.

00:59:02.968 --> 00:59:05.234
And you can--and--and--
and you can imagine with,

00:59:05.234 --> 00:59:07.133
you know, hundreds of millions
of views of this stuff--

00:59:07.133 --> 00:59:08.400
Wichary:
Yeah.

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.667
Germick: You know,
latency becomes an issue.

00:59:09.667 --> 00:59:11.501
Wichary: But I--
I've been trying to convi--

00:59:11.501 --> 00:59:13.167
convince these guys to have
a, like, a proper blog where

00:59:13.167 --> 00:59:14.267
they could share some
of the techniques and--

00:59:14.267 --> 00:59:15.434
Germick: Yeah,
would you guys read it?

00:59:15.434 --> 00:59:16.434
If we had a blog,
would that be interesting?

00:59:16.434 --> 00:59:18.801
[cheers, applause]

00:59:18.801 --> 00:59:20.701
Good to know.

00:59:20.701 --> 00:59:24.133
'Cause I need a place
to talk about my feelings.

00:59:24.133 --> 00:59:26.167
Twitter just doesn't--
140 characters--

00:59:26.167 --> 00:59:27.400
Wichary: Can I have, like,
that Power Glove picture

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.834
on top in the masthead?
Germick: Sure.

00:59:28.834 --> 00:59:30.534
Wichary: Like--like in Face--
Facebook there?

00:59:30.534 --> 00:59:32.067
Germick: Yeah, yeah.
Wichary: Okay.

00:59:32.067 --> 00:59:34.300
man: Yeah, I had a question.
I came in late for the talk,

00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.467
but I love the--
the way that your--

00:59:37.467 --> 00:59:39.501
the users can all interact
with the--

00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:41.000
the actual presentation.
Wichary: Yeah.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.767
man: So is--is that, I--
I mean, I saw you used appspot.

00:59:43.767 --> 00:59:45.133
How does that work?

00:59:45.133 --> 00:59:46.968
Did you explain that
in the beginning, or--?

00:59:46.968 --> 00:59:48.434
Germick: We explained that
it probably wouldn't work

00:59:48.434 --> 00:59:50.033
in the beginning,
but then it kind of did.

00:59:50.033 --> 00:59:52.601
Wichary: It--it--so--
it's--so--I'm actually,

00:59:52.601 --> 00:59:54.901
so--so for this guy
I'm using web sockets, right,

00:59:54.901 --> 00:59:57.367
and no JS, and--
and it's very exciting

00:59:57.367 --> 00:59:59.501
because it's--
it's--it's very fast.

00:59:59.501 --> 01:00:03.534
For this guy, it was
just polling essentially.

01:00:03.534 --> 01:00:05.734
So every time you--
you use your device, it--

01:00:05.734 --> 01:00:07.934
you know, every two seconds
it asks, you know,

01:00:07.934 --> 01:00:09.567
"Should I display
a question or not?"

01:00:09.567 --> 01:00:12.167
And this guy, every one second
asks the server,

01:00:12.167 --> 01:00:13.868
you know, "What's--what's
the tally on the answers,"

01:00:13.868 --> 01:00:15.334
et cetera, et cetera.

01:00:15.334 --> 01:00:17.300
It's--it's not even like
a hanging get or anything,

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.734
it's just regular gets.

01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:21.834
So predominantly because
I'm, like, super lazy

01:00:21.834 --> 01:00:24.868
and it worked, the--

01:00:24.868 --> 01:00:27.133
there's something
really exciting about--

01:00:27.133 --> 01:00:29.767
in App Engine now called
"Channel API,"

01:00:29.767 --> 01:00:32.901
and I would hope to rewrite it
using that maybe for next time.

01:00:32.901 --> 01:00:34.133
Germick:
Mm-hmm.

01:00:34.133 --> 01:00:35.133
Wichary: Does this answer
the question how--?

01:00:35.133 --> 01:00:36.300
man: Yeah, yeah.
It does.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.667
Wichary: I know how technique
actually does--

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.467
man: And--and so the--
your whole presentation is a--

01:00:39.467 --> 01:00:41.534
is an app unto itself as well.
Wichary: Mm-hmm.

01:00:41.534 --> 01:00:43.100
It's--yeah,
it's an HTML5 website.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.200
man:
Yeah.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.601
Wichary: It's like
a huge website.

01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:47.868
You could actually--I know some
of you maybe not noticed it,

01:00:47.868 --> 01:00:51.067
but it was kind of running--
started running kind of slow--

01:00:51.067 --> 01:00:52.067
Germick:
Choppy, yeah.

01:00:52.067 --> 01:00:53.367
Wichary: After
about 50 minutes,

01:00:53.367 --> 01:00:54.767
so I had to refresh it
quietly as it--so it's--

01:00:54.767 --> 01:00:55.734
you know, so it's
still a little bit tricky,

01:00:55.734 --> 01:00:57.267
but, you know,

01:00:57.267 --> 01:00:58.767
it's--it's--it's kind of
"cutting-edgey," if you will.

01:00:58.767 --> 01:00:59.767
man: Mm-hmm.
Is there--

01:00:59.767 --> 01:01:01.067
is there source code
for part of it--

01:01:01.067 --> 01:01:02.434
Wichary: Ah--
man: Or all of it?

01:01:02.434 --> 01:01:03.834
Wichary: We might--I kind of
want to expose some of it.

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:05.534
man:
Mm-hmm.

01:01:05.534 --> 01:01:07.234
Wichary: Again, like, a--
a lot of what we have there is,

01:01:07.234 --> 01:01:09.067
you know, kind of proprietary--
Germick: Yeah.

01:01:09.067 --> 01:01:11.501
Wichary: Like the Atari
and Namco pictures and whatnot--

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.601
man:
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:01:12.601 --> 01:01:13.934
Wichary:
And--and--but--you know--

01:01:13.934 --> 01:01:15.334
man: But maybe in--
maybe even just the framework

01:01:15.334 --> 01:01:17.000
of what you used
to create this,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.400
so we could--because
I'd love to use this for,

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.434
you know, my own presentations
or things.

01:01:20.434 --> 01:01:21.868
Wichary:
Cool. Yeah.

01:01:21.868 --> 01:01:23.100
man: It'd be a really cool
way to do it.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.400
Wichary: Yeah, the--we--
we're also dabbling

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.901
with HTML5 slide decks,
you know,

01:01:25.901 --> 01:01:27.901
like some other
I/O presentations

01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:31.667
use HTML5 slides that I--
that I helped put together

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:33.267
and--and, you know, so--

01:01:33.267 --> 01:01:34.534
Yeah, you can--
you can--

01:01:34.534 --> 01:01:35.868
Germick: Somebody set up that--
HTML5rocks.com?

01:01:35.868 --> 01:01:37.167
Wichary: Yeah.
So--so--

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:41.000
you know, it--it--
if you could like, ping me--

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.601
We used to have a--
Germick: Yeah.

01:01:42.601 --> 01:01:44.234
Wichary: We should--
we should pull up the--

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:45.834
Germick: Final slide?
Wichary: The final slide.

01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:49.701
Now it's worth 10 points.
Okay. Yeah.

01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:51.267
Feel free to, like,
ping me to remind me,

01:01:51.267 --> 01:01:54.100
because one of the great things
about working at Google is that,

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.501
like, there's always
so many cool things to do

01:01:55.501 --> 01:01:57.267
that I'm always behind on--
man: Mm-hmm.

01:01:57.267 --> 01:01:58.267
Wichary:
What I'm--

01:01:58.267 --> 01:01:59.801
man: Okay,
thank you very much.

01:01:59.801 --> 01:02:00.868
Wichary: Yeah.
Anybody else?

01:02:00.868 --> 01:02:03.934
We're, like, one--

01:02:03.934 --> 01:02:05.534
man: You've got two minutes
left. Go over another question.

01:02:05.534 --> 01:02:07.000
Germick:
We're two minutes over.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.367
Wichary: It's actually counting
backwards, so we already--

01:02:08.367 --> 01:02:09.801
Germick:
But we're the last talk,

01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:11.567
I think, so I--unless
they're going to throw us out?

01:02:11.567 --> 01:02:13.767
All right.
We've got one more encore.

01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:17.601
"Free Bird."

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:19.834
Wichary: Wait, so do you--do you
guys want to do other ones?

01:02:19.834 --> 01:02:23.167
man: Yeah!
Wichary: Wow. Okay.

01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:27.400
Okay, here's--I'm going to--
I'm going to tell you a secret,

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.267
and you might hate me for it.
Germick: Ha ha.

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:31.634
Wichary: But, the order
of the questions was rigged,

01:02:31.634 --> 01:02:33.434
so every question--
every first question

01:02:33.434 --> 01:02:34.868
in a given category
was the same

01:02:34.868 --> 01:02:37.033
because we wanted
the cool one to be first.

01:02:37.033 --> 01:02:40.133
So it was worth 200 or 1,600
depending--it doesn't matter.

01:02:40.133 --> 01:02:41.934
[laughter, applause]

01:02:41.934 --> 01:02:43.467
Germick: Basically everything
about the game was rigged.

01:02:43.467 --> 01:02:46.667
Yeah.
Wichary: Yeah.

01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:48.100
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.267
man: So like, there's not
that many questions,

01:02:49.267 --> 01:02:50.667
or--are there--is there--
is there that--

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.033
Wichary: Yeah, we--
we have many--

01:02:52.033 --> 01:02:53.501
Some of them
are just kind of lame.

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:55.133
Germick:
Ha ha.

01:02:55.133 --> 01:02:56.968
Wichary: Okay, so you saw
this guy, right?

01:02:56.968 --> 01:02:59.000
Okay, what do you want to do?
Which one?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.100
Germick: Call it out.
Team choice.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.367
man: Technology.
Wichary: Technology.

01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:05.067
man: [indistinct]
Wichary: So we did this one.

01:03:05.067 --> 01:03:07.400
So no matter what order I--
I do, it's going to con--

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.000
I have to go through them.
Okay.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.701
man: [indistinct]
Wichary: All right.

01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:14.634
Germick: This is a good one.
Wichary: This is a tricky one.

01:03:14.634 --> 01:03:15.767
I don't know
if you can still vote.

01:03:15.767 --> 01:03:17.334
You probably might have to
refresh your--

01:03:17.334 --> 01:03:19.334
your client if--
if you can't connect.

01:03:19.334 --> 01:03:23.200
Was it Internet Explorer
or was it Google Chrome?

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.734
[laughter]

01:03:25.734 --> 01:03:28.133
Germick: This might seem
self-serving.

01:03:28.133 --> 01:03:29.400
Wichary: I--
there might be more browsers.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.367
I keep hearing about it,
but--but I--I don't--

01:03:31.367 --> 01:03:32.801
No, I'm joking.

01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:38.100
I don't know if you can vote,
but what do you think?

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.501
man: Someone voted for Chrome?

01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:41.567
man: You're nuts!

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:43.133
Germick:
Ha ha ha!

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:45.868
man:
Hey, why did one go away?

01:03:45.868 --> 01:03:47.200
Wichary:
Someone changed their vote.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.734
So yeah.
I don't know if voting works.

01:03:49.734 --> 01:03:53.067
It's actually a trick question
in that it's kind of both.

01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:54.868
Ha.
In a very different way.

01:03:54.868 --> 01:03:58.501
So--so there--there's--
there's some, like,

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.000
old Internet Explorer bug
that, you know,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.100
the background position
when you have to do,

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.100
like, exit command,
whatever--

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.367
I don't know
how many of you know it.

01:04:06.367 --> 01:04:08.934
So I kind of have to,
like, for some older IE

01:04:08.934 --> 01:04:12.033
I had to use--
not even use CSS but, like,

01:04:12.033 --> 01:04:14.133
I invented this other technique
that you just put an image

01:04:14.133 --> 01:04:17.901
and you crop it
using a diff on top of it.

01:04:17.901 --> 01:04:20.767
So that was just required
from--from IE.

01:04:20.767 --> 01:04:23.400
But for Chrome, for example,
when we did Jules Verne doodle,

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.601
right, we had this thing
where you could lift it up

01:04:25.601 --> 01:04:28.968
and kind of move it around
to use accelerometer, right,

01:04:28.968 --> 01:04:29.968
which was great.

01:04:29.968 --> 01:04:31.267
Many people got
quite a kick out of it,

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:34.300
but the thing is that it was
just reverse-engineered

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.434
by us on Chrome Team.

01:04:36.434 --> 01:04:37.801
So we literally
had this situation

01:04:37.801 --> 01:04:40.300
where my friend Chris and I,

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.667
we got our identical MacBook
Pros in the air,

01:04:43.667 --> 01:04:45.634
we turned left,
and his doodle went left

01:04:45.634 --> 01:04:48.701
and my doodle went right,
and I had no idea why.

01:04:48.701 --> 01:04:50.501
And it turned out
that his model of MacBook

01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:52.467
had a little bit different chip
to do the--

01:04:52.467 --> 01:04:54.033
the gyroscope or whatever,

01:04:54.033 --> 01:04:56.801
and we actually gave feedback
to the Chrome team,

01:04:56.801 --> 01:04:58.434
to the engineers,
and they fixed it for us in--

01:04:58.434 --> 01:05:00.067
in--in the actual Chrome.

01:05:00.067 --> 01:05:03.000
So in both cases it's kind of
funny because you're--

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.300
you--you're--you're book--
you know, bookended by,

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.934
kind of, old technology
and new technology

01:05:06.934 --> 01:05:09.968
and they both cause trouble.
Right?

01:05:09.968 --> 01:05:11.434
It's easier sometimes
for old technology

01:05:11.434 --> 01:05:14.667
because you're used to it
giving trouble, but still,

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:16.100
it's--it's--it's--
it's funny.

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.834
Do we have anything else here?
I don't know.

01:05:18.834 --> 01:05:20.200
Yeah. Oh, here's
an example of--

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.200
for example how Google Verne
doodle breaks down.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.467
So this is the optimal
CSS3 experience, right,

01:05:26.467 --> 01:05:28.067
where it rotates around.

01:05:28.067 --> 01:05:31.767
You can see the dials on the
left kind of rotating, right?

01:05:31.767 --> 01:05:33.133
Again, just CSS3.

01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:35.200
This is how it kind of
looks on the other browser.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.801
Right?
It just moves around.

01:05:36.801 --> 01:05:39.868
The alpha channel
is a little bit different.

01:05:39.868 --> 01:05:41.868
Germick: It's all--it's all--
no--yeah, there's no alpha.

01:05:41.868 --> 01:05:43.801
There's just bitmap.
Wichary: Yeah.

01:05:43.801 --> 01:05:45.634
Germick: Hard edge--
Wichary: There's no transitions

01:05:45.634 --> 01:05:46.734
between frames,
so it's a little bit more,

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:48.033
you know, choppy.

01:05:48.033 --> 01:05:49.667
And the bottom one
is just a static image

01:05:49.667 --> 01:05:52.667
for those browsers that--
or users that don't use JS.

01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:55.000
But it's another thing
that we want to do. Right?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.501
We have--we--do you want
to talk about it a little?

01:05:56.501 --> 01:05:57.701
Germick: Well, I think--
I mean--

01:05:57.701 --> 01:05:59.100
a question we always
ask ourselves is, like,

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.033
you know, we want to just
surprise and delight users,

01:06:01.033 --> 01:06:03.501
like I--that's sort of our
mantra at the Doodle Team.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:05.267
And we always ask ourselves,
like, you know, how--

01:06:05.267 --> 01:06:08.567
you know, if we try to cut--
do cutting edge, like, so far,

01:06:08.567 --> 01:06:09.868
like, you know,
if we use Canvas,

01:06:09.868 --> 01:06:11.567
we're cutting out,
like, "X" number of users.

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:13.634
If we use WebGL, we're cutting
out "X" number of users.

01:06:13.634 --> 01:06:15.133
So we're always
trying to push the edge

01:06:15.133 --> 01:06:16.968
and push ourselves further,
but it's al--

01:06:16.968 --> 01:06:18.767
it's also a judgment call
for what we want to do,

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:20.634
and I think one thing that's--

01:06:20.634 --> 01:06:22.334
one thing I like about the way
that these guys--

01:06:22.334 --> 01:06:26.501
that our engineers work is that
we don't filter out browsers.

01:06:26.501 --> 01:06:27.767
We filter out features.

01:06:27.767 --> 01:06:30.067
So we ping your browser
and see, like, okay,

01:06:30.067 --> 01:06:31.634
if you're using IE6 to,
you know, can--

01:06:31.634 --> 01:06:33.834
do CSS3 transitions work?

01:06:33.834 --> 01:06:35.000
We don't look
at the browser type,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.767
we just see
is that capability there,

01:06:36.767 --> 01:06:38.167
and I think that's cool
'cause it's, like,

01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:41.267
hopeful that maybe one day
IE6 will use CSS3.

01:06:41.267 --> 01:06:42.601
You never know.

01:06:42.601 --> 01:06:44.467
But, you know, that would be
future-proof in the--

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:46.834
in the sense that it would work
on a future date.

01:06:46.834 --> 01:06:47.968
Wichary: Yeah,
so just one example,

01:06:47.968 --> 01:06:49.367
that we just detect
the feature and we--

01:06:49.367 --> 01:06:51.434
we try to do the best
and we know that translates 3D

01:06:51.434 --> 01:06:52.601
even though it's not 3D.

01:06:52.601 --> 01:06:53.801
It's sometimes
hardware accelerated.

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.367
So we try to do that first.
Germick: Yeah.

01:06:55.367 --> 01:06:57.501
Wichary: If it doesn't work,
we do regular CSS transforms.

01:06:57.501 --> 01:06:58.701
If it doesn't work,

01:06:58.701 --> 01:07:00.033
we just move the object
the old-fashioned way.

01:07:00.033 --> 01:07:01.634
Germick: And--it--
and we really aren't, like,

01:07:01.634 --> 01:07:03.801
technology agnostic--it's just
about what the best solution

01:07:03.801 --> 01:07:05.801
is for the problem at hand.
So we--we've--

01:07:05.801 --> 01:07:08.133
we did a doodle, we did a--
a doodle for Robert Bunsen

01:07:08.133 --> 01:07:10.834
in March, which used--
it was subtle,

01:07:10.834 --> 01:07:12.334
but it used Canvas.

01:07:12.334 --> 01:07:14.300
So if your browser
didn't use Canvas,

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.634
we just showed you
a static doodle.

01:07:15.634 --> 01:07:17.100
And we've, you know,
made decisions where

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.100
we've dumbed-down things,

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.467
so we--
'cause we wanted to see

01:07:20.467 --> 01:07:22.367
if we could make it work
all the way back to IE6.

01:07:22.367 --> 01:07:24.434
Like, Pac-Man is an example
where, you know,

01:07:24.434 --> 01:07:25.767
we didn't do some things
we maybe were able to do

01:07:25.767 --> 01:07:28.734
in I--in CSS3 or--
Wichary: Yeah.

01:07:28.734 --> 01:07:30.467
Germick: You know,
HTML5 because we wanted

01:07:30.467 --> 01:07:32.033
as many people
to play as possible.

01:07:32.033 --> 01:07:33.067
Wichary: Yeah,
this is another example.

01:07:33.067 --> 01:07:34.734
We had this little
particle doodle

01:07:34.734 --> 01:07:38.367
that led up to Google Instant
when it launched a while back,

01:07:38.367 --> 01:07:40.234
and the original
implementation, kind of,

01:07:40.234 --> 01:07:43.834
on the left was--
just wasn't fast enough

01:07:43.834 --> 01:07:46.634
in some of the browsers, right,
some of the older browsers.

01:07:46.634 --> 01:07:51.667
And we actually had Chris Holm
just reach out to every--

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.000
Germick: Yeah, he basically
sent an e-mail to a list,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.267
like, he would--
he had--

01:07:54.267 --> 01:07:55.567
Wichary: He'd tell--
Germick: "Help me."

01:07:55.567 --> 01:07:57.133
So we had mailing lists
at Google for [indistinct]

01:07:57.133 --> 01:07:58.601
and we have--a lot of
interesting people said,

01:07:58.601 --> 01:08:01.234
"Help me write a program
that says how can I spell

01:08:01.234 --> 01:08:04.133
the Google logo
in the minimum amount of balls."

01:08:04.133 --> 01:08:07.400
And--and it came back--

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.834
it came back like this.
Wichary: Yeah.

01:08:09.834 --> 01:08:11.434
And some people
got really excited

01:08:11.434 --> 01:08:13.767
because it's essentially like an
algorithm/math kind of question.

01:08:13.767 --> 01:08:15.300
Right?
So we got a lot of--

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.000
a lot of help from,
you know,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.534
people who are much smarter
than--than we are, I guess.

01:08:20.534 --> 01:08:21.968
Okay.
Anything else?

01:08:21.968 --> 01:08:23.501
We can do, like,
one more maybe?

01:08:23.501 --> 01:08:24.868
Right? Some--
Germick: Yeah, yeah.

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:25.901
Wichary:
Technology?

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:26.968
man: Could I ask you
real quick--?

01:08:26.968 --> 01:08:28.434
Could I ask you
a doodle question?

01:08:28.434 --> 01:08:29.534
Germick:
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

01:08:29.534 --> 01:08:30.601
man:
You had a doodle a while back

01:08:30.601 --> 01:08:34.400
that had a number
of words in--

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.901
bounded within the word
"Google."

01:08:36.901 --> 01:08:39.601
Germick: Right. It's the
anniversary of JFK's famous--

01:08:39.601 --> 01:08:40.801
man: Yeah, exactly.
Germick: Speech, yeah.

01:08:40.801 --> 01:08:42.067
man: Was that hand-drawn,
or was that--?

01:08:42.067 --> 01:08:43.467
Germick: Yeah, that was--
that was very low-tech.

01:08:43.467 --> 01:08:46.400
Yeah. That was just, like,
Mike Dutton doing--

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.868
doing the Lord's work and--
Wichary: Yeah.

01:08:47.868 --> 01:08:49.234
Germick: And plotting
those images to get a--

01:08:49.234 --> 01:08:50.701
to get a visual.
Wichary: Yeah.

01:08:50.701 --> 01:08:52.100
And I--and I think that's--
that's a little bit of--

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.801
of a choice we have to make
as well.

01:08:53.801 --> 01:08:55.200
We don't--
Some people are voting.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.634
This is funny.
Germick: Ha ha ha.

01:08:58.634 --> 01:08:59.968
Wichary: The--like--
you know--it's--

01:08:59.968 --> 01:09:01.434
it's easy to get on this
like slippery slope, like,

01:09:01.434 --> 01:09:02.868
everything's going to have
to be interactive now,

01:09:02.868 --> 01:09:04.234
and animated--
Germick: Yeah.

01:09:04.234 --> 01:09:06.000
Wichary: And crazy
and exploding, and, you know.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.300
Like, I kid you not,
my internal title at Google

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.601
is "The Michael Bay of Doodles."
Germick: It's true.

01:09:12.601 --> 01:09:15.300
Wichary: Which is, like,
half kind of complimentary--

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.601
Germick:
Flattery?

01:09:16.601 --> 01:09:17.934
Wichary: And half kind
of derogatory, because, like,

01:09:17.934 --> 01:09:19.334
I don't want to be
the Michael Bay of doodles.

01:09:19.334 --> 01:09:21.167
I don't want, like, every doodle
to be crazy, right?

01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:23.100
Germick: Well, who do you--
you said you had somebody

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.501
you wanted to be.

01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:26.167
You--you wanted to be the
Leonardo DiCaprio of doodles?

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:27.334
Was that--?

01:09:27.334 --> 01:09:28.767
Wichary: I--I actually like
Michael Bay.

01:09:28.767 --> 01:09:30.801
Ha ha.
man: [indistinct]

01:09:30.801 --> 01:09:32.501
Germick: Dexter of doodles?
Kidding.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:36.000
Wichary:
The J-Lo of--? Okay, so--

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.501
Oh, this--
this is kind of fun.

01:09:37.501 --> 01:09:40.200
Okay, which of these Pac-Man
doodle features were first?

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.467
So Pac-Man, you know,
some of the things that we did

01:09:42.467 --> 01:09:44.100
were the first for doodle.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.067
So remember,
this was a year ago.

01:09:46.067 --> 01:09:47.767
So "a doodle with sound,"

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.701
"a doodle that ran
for 48 hours,"

01:09:49.701 --> 01:09:53.501
"an interactive doodle,"
"an animated doodle,"

01:09:53.501 --> 01:09:56.901
or "a doodle using Flash"?

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.601
So which one of those
we did for the first time

01:09:58.601 --> 01:10:04.100
with Pac-Man doodle?
man: Five.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.868
Wichary: Yeah.
man: Two sounds good.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.234
Germick:
So the answer is actually--

01:10:09.234 --> 01:10:11.734
it actually is
one, two, and five.

01:10:11.734 --> 01:10:13.467
man: Ah.
Germick: Yeah.

01:10:13.467 --> 01:10:15.033
man: Always cheating.
Germick: Always cheating.

01:10:15.033 --> 01:10:16.300
So this is our--

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.868
this is actually our first
interactive doodle,

01:10:18.868 --> 01:10:21.834
and this was something I did
in 2009 for Halloween,

01:10:21.834 --> 01:10:23.167
because we'd done--
we looked back

01:10:23.167 --> 01:10:24.467
at all the doodles
we'd done for Halloween--

01:10:24.467 --> 01:10:26.734
we've done Halloween
every year since two--

01:10:26.734 --> 01:10:28.834
since 1999--and--
and it was like,

01:10:28.834 --> 01:10:30.300
what have we not done yet?

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.534
We've done, like, costumes
and ghosts and scary stuff,

01:10:33.534 --> 01:10:35.801
but I was like, but candy
is the best part of Halloween.

01:10:35.801 --> 01:10:37.901
Wichary: Heh heh.

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:39.667
Germick: That's how I felt.
Does it--do--could we--so--

01:10:39.667 --> 01:10:41.434
So the way it works
is, I was like, okay,

01:10:41.434 --> 01:10:42.834
for those that are curious,
you'll just get

01:10:42.834 --> 01:10:44.767
simple piece of candy
on the homepage

01:10:44.767 --> 01:10:47.334
and then it'll entice you
to click and then, you know,

01:10:47.334 --> 01:10:49.767
very simple, it'll swap out
an image for the whole--

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:51.901
with the whole--We didn't use
an algorithm for this. The--

01:10:51.901 --> 01:10:53.534
Wichary:
Ha ha.

01:10:53.534 --> 01:10:55.267
Germick: We would then have,
you know, candy appear

01:10:55.267 --> 01:10:57.067
in the shape of the--
of the logo.

01:10:57.067 --> 01:10:59.868
Clicking again just made
a big candy mess,

01:10:59.868 --> 01:11:01.767
and for the curious
clicking final times

01:11:01.767 --> 01:11:04.868
was like the hangover of,
when you just, you know,

01:11:04.868 --> 01:11:06.167
ate so much candy--
Wichary: Ha ha.

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:07.267
Germick: So it was another
type of way to,

01:11:07.267 --> 01:11:08.467
like, have a connection
with the user.

01:11:08.467 --> 01:11:10.133
Just a little, cute,
you know, story arc of--

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:13.300
of, you know, the process of
Halloween candy overconsumption.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.534
Wichary: You click again,
you have, like,

01:11:14.534 --> 01:11:16.634
antacids or something.
Germick: Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:16.634 --> 01:11:17.868
man: Can I just ask
a quickie question?

01:11:17.868 --> 01:11:19.167
Wichary:
Oh, sure, please.

01:11:19.167 --> 01:11:21.834
man: So I mean, the original
Google homepage, right,

01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:24.133
was supposed to be this
super quick, like,

01:11:24.133 --> 01:11:26.501
nothing's on the page
but the Google logo.

01:11:26.501 --> 01:11:31.000
So how has your--
how has this--

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.968
I mean, as this is getting
more and more intricate,

01:11:32.968 --> 01:11:35.501
you've got this--
the whole video.

01:11:35.501 --> 01:11:37.734
How does, I guess,
Google or your bosses

01:11:37.734 --> 01:11:41.000
or whoever respond to the fact
that you've got now,

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.367
like, YouTube videos--
Germick: Uh-huh.

01:11:42.367 --> 01:11:43.868
man: You've got,
you know, all of this,

01:11:43.868 --> 01:11:45.067
you know, Pac-Man.

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:47.934
Surely this is not the simple,
plain webpage--

01:11:47.934 --> 01:11:49.167
Wichary: No.

01:11:49.167 --> 01:11:50.868
man: That the original--
I don't know.

01:11:50.868 --> 01:11:52.100
I was reading blog posts
about this,

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.067
so this isn't really
my question, but--

01:11:54.067 --> 01:11:55.667
Germick: Sure it is.
man: Do you--

01:11:55.667 --> 01:11:56.868
do you know what my question is,
though?

01:11:56.868 --> 01:11:58.400
Germick: Gotcha journalism,
yes.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.501
No, yeah.
No, cool.

01:11:59.501 --> 01:12:01.400
Yeah, so we--
so a couple things.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:05.000
One, you know, the first--
Here's a factoid for you guys.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.234
The first doodle
appeared on Google.com

01:12:07.234 --> 01:12:09.167
before Google
was incorporated.

01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:14.334
So September 4, 1998,
Google became a company,

01:12:14.334 --> 01:12:17.400
officially in the eyes
of the law, and--

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.834
August 30, 1998,
there was the first doodle

01:12:20.834 --> 01:12:24.434
of--Burning Man logo
appeared on Google.com

01:12:24.434 --> 01:12:27.067
when Larry and Sergey went--
went to--went to Burning Man.

01:12:27.067 --> 01:12:29.400
And, so you know,
we have--like,

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.167
we do have, like,
high-level support

01:12:31.167 --> 01:12:32.534
to do fun stuff
on the homepage.

01:12:32.534 --> 01:12:34.734
And, that said,
we care a lot

01:12:34.734 --> 01:12:36.534
about users seeing stuff
really fast.

01:12:36.534 --> 01:12:37.767
And you'll notice,

01:12:37.767 --> 01:12:39.667
if you look into
any of the doodles that we do--

01:12:39.667 --> 01:12:41.667
like the Chaplin video
or Pac-Man,

01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:44.167
that are more resource-intense--
resource-intensive

01:12:44.167 --> 01:12:47.601
or require something to,
you know,

01:12:47.601 --> 01:12:49.100
download in the background
or whatever--

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.567
we always show
a static image first.

01:12:50.567 --> 01:12:52.367
So the Chaplin doodle,
for instance,

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:53.634
was a slide play
on the YouTube player

01:12:53.634 --> 01:12:55.667
where the mustache
was the shape of,

01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:57.434
a play button was in the shape
of a mustache.

01:12:57.434 --> 01:12:59.434
That's actually a static image
that clicked through

01:12:59.434 --> 01:13:01.667
to the video,
then loaded later.

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:04.467
Or if you look at the doodle
that appears in--

01:13:04.467 --> 01:13:08.300
now in Tonga and other parts
of the world as time rolls on,

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.467
we show first a static image
that will then swap in

01:13:11.467 --> 01:13:13.267
with a much larger sprite
that cycles through.

01:13:13.267 --> 01:13:14.534
Wichary: Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:14.534 --> 01:13:16.901
We have--we have--
so there's obviously,

01:13:16.901 --> 01:13:19.434
you know, part of it
is user experience. Right?

01:13:19.434 --> 01:13:21.534
But, yeah, we have very specific
rules about, you know,

01:13:21.534 --> 01:13:23.934
I think we have like 300K--
we can't exceed--

01:13:23.934 --> 01:13:25.167
Germick:
Yeah.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.167
Wichary: On the initial
page load. Right?

01:13:26.167 --> 01:13:27.300
300K.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.367
Germick: But even then
we always try to--

01:13:28.367 --> 01:13:29.868
We--the--the--
we work very closely

01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:31.934
with our team that serves
the homepage,

01:13:31.934 --> 01:13:33.934
and it's a pretty complicated
and sophisticated structure

01:13:33.934 --> 01:13:35.501
to serve
that many pages,

01:13:35.501 --> 01:13:37.634
so there's a lot of security
checks and that kind of stuff,

01:13:37.634 --> 01:13:39.901
and we take fun, you know,
very seriously.

01:13:39.901 --> 01:13:44.667
And--and--and they--they--
they are very clear, and--

01:13:44.667 --> 01:13:46.067
and we totally
agree with them,

01:13:46.067 --> 01:13:47.934
that we want to get pixels
to the page as soon as possible.

01:13:47.934 --> 01:13:49.234
So we don't want--
Wichary: Yeah.

01:13:49.234 --> 01:13:51.267
Germick: Be sure a page
doesn't look broken,

01:13:51.267 --> 01:13:52.667
but then we can load
all kind of fun stuff

01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:54.467
once the user, you know--
Wichary: Yeah.

01:13:54.467 --> 01:13:55.467
Germick: You know,
shows their intention

01:13:55.467 --> 01:13:56.534
that they want to play.

01:13:56.534 --> 01:13:57.834
Wichary: And--
and we did actually,

01:13:57.834 --> 01:14:00.300
on a couple of occasions,
had to pull the doodle

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.901
because we--we--
we realized it's--it's--

01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:05.100
you know, it's not fast enough,
or it's--

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.334
power co--
consuming power or whatever.

01:14:06.334 --> 01:14:07.467
Germick:
Right, no. So yeah, we--

01:14:07.467 --> 01:14:09.467
we definitely--
yeah, we listen to users.

01:14:09.467 --> 01:14:12.133
So for instance, Google Pac-Man
played on auto-play with sound

01:14:12.133 --> 01:14:14.767
after 10 seconds
in the initial--initial launch.

01:14:14.767 --> 01:14:18.567
And it was probably hilarious
in some meetings, you know,

01:14:18.567 --> 01:14:20.100
where people were not
really paying attention

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.234
and Google Pac-Man
started playing.

01:14:22.234 --> 01:14:25.100
But, users also didn't like
that that was happening--

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.601
[siren whoops]

01:14:26.601 --> 01:14:29.067
For example, and so
you know, within, you know--

01:14:29.067 --> 01:14:30.601
in that--in that span
of the first day,

01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:32.767
we actually
re-launched it quietly

01:14:32.767 --> 01:14:36.400
where sound wouldn't auto-play
if--if you didn't im--im--

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.567
if you didn't
implicitly say--

01:14:37.567 --> 01:14:40.100
you know, click and say,
"play the doodle."

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.167
Wichary: Okay.
Should we wrap it up?

01:14:42.167 --> 01:14:43.167
We're 15 minutes over time.

01:14:43.167 --> 01:14:44.400
Okay?
Germick: Yeah.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400
I think we're good.
Thank you guys so much.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.400
Wichary:
Thank you for coming.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.334
[applause]
