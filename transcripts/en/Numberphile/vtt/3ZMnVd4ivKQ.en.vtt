00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
DR. JAMES GRIME: We're going
to talk about vampires.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.600
Yes, math and vampires.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.540
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: Well, my
youngest daughter, today is

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.980
having two teeth out.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.310
So she probably won't like
this one very much.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.610
A vampire number is where--

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.590
DR. JAMES GRIME: You have
two numbers that

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.100
are the same length--

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.310
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: --a
number with an even number of

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.300
digits, split into the product
of two numbers--

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.210
DR. JAMES GRIME: And
the result has

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.650
to use all the digits--

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.370
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: 4 digits
of the original number,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.780
you must use the same digits.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.180
2 numbers, each with 2 digits,
of the 4 digits of the 2

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.740
numbers multiplying
them together.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.470
Yeah, not great.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.930
I wasn't ready.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.415
Maybe, I'll write it down.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:36.000
BRADY HARAN: Gonna
write it down?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.410
Yeah, let's write
it next to it.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.610
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: 1260,
that's a 4 digit number.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.420
OK?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.980
And I can write it as
a product of 2 digit

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.760
numbers, 21 times 60.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.210
And you can see that the same
4 digits that make up the

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.570
original number appear
in the new numbers.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.985
These are my 2 fangs.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.140
And this is my original
vampire.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.700
DR. JAMES GRIME: Let's
try another one.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.360
125,460, this is a
vampire number.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.490
Let's have a look
at its fangs.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.140
That's 204 times 615.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.760
But I like this one because
there's 2 ways to do it.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.770
So we could have done
246 times 510.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.840
So let's have a look
at the numbers.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.060
So what have we got?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.710
We've got 2, 0, 4, 6, 1, 5.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.880
Do that again.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.980
2, this time 4, 6, 5, 1, 0.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.270
Same six numbers also but used
in a different order.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.200
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: There are
also three fang numbers.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.120
Shall we do that?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.260
1, 3, 0, 7, 8, 2, 6, 0.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.990
OK?

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.340
That can be split in
the following ways.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.190
1, 6, 2, 0, times 8, 0, 7, 3.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.840
Here's another way.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.610
1,863 times 7,020.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.040
2,070 times 6, 3, 1, 8.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.480
There are numbers with 4 pairs
of fangs known, five pairs of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.820
fangs known.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.360
I bet you can keep going.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.250
DR. JAMES GRIME: This
is the one I like.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.130
All right.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.390
This one, now I think kids,
is really cool.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.370
I won't tell you its name yet.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.130
But it's this, so it's 117,067
and the fangs are

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.090
1, 6, 7, times 701.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.910
And these fangs are
prime numbers.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.570
So this is a prime vampire
number, and the fangs are its

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.700
prime factorization, which is
this hugely important thing in

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.670
math, when you can break
it into primes.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.930
So when you break into primes,
you get the fangs.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.370
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: When
you're writing down these

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.990
numbers, you're not allowed to
have pairs of numbers which

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.520
are trailing zeroes
at the end.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.670
You see, if we just look back
here, you'll see these numbers

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.130
there's one 0 at the end of one
number, but not at the end

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.130
of the other.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.690
In each case here there's one
0 here, but not here.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.630
So you're not allowed to have
combinations where this is a 0

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.220
at the end of each number.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.372
They don't count.

00:03:36.372 --> 00:03:37.820
DR. JAMES GRIME: Why not?

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.400
PROFESSOR ED COPELAND: It's to
do with the way that you can

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.420
create a whole series of extra
numbers that don't fit into

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.510
this category.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.270
DR. JAMES GRIME: In traditional
folklore, one of

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.450
the weaknesses of vampires is
that they suffered from

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.430
something called arithmomania,
and this is the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.740
compulsion to count.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.200
It might of made a good name
for "Numberphile." We could

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.290
have done that.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.870
It's a type of a OCD though.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.190
It's a real condition, but in
traditional folklore, this is

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.430
what the vampires were
said to suffer from.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.150
I think it came from other
tales, like when you're sent

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.769
to hell, and you're damned,
and you're forced to count

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.990
grains of sand on an
infinite beach.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.860
It's a torture.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.800
It's one way to avoid
the vampire.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.290
So when they're chasing you,
if you throw sand on the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.960
floor, some grains of wheat,
they'll be compelled to stop,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.300
and count the grains of sand.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.670
The most famous sufferer,
though, of arithmomania would

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.560
have to be to the Count
from "Sesame Street".

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.090
Yes?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.790
Because he counts the
candle on the shelf.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.026
And when he's alone
he counts himself.

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:48.720
BRADY HARAN: You've got
another favorite?

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.300
DR. JAMES GRIME: I've got
my most favorite.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.240
Now this, I love.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.950
Alright, I'll do here.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.370
Because you can do with Roman
numerals, as well.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.700
This is my favorite.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:09.000
2 in Roman numerals times
4, is equal to 8.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.390
So do we have 3 eyes and
a V on each one?

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.440
Yes, we do.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.820
We've got the V there,
and I, I, I. Perfect.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.325
So you can do it with Roman
numerals, as well.

00:05:20.325 --> 00:05:20.730
BRADY HARAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.000
DR. JAMES GRIME: Ah huh,
it's fun isn't it?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.670
BRADY HARAN: What's
that called?

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.010
DR. JAMES GRIME: What
shall we call it?

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.530
Let's name it.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.800
We'll call it a Caesar
vampire number.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.410
Done.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.730
Sam and Neil have devised,
what to me, is a new

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.980
experiment for Halloween.
