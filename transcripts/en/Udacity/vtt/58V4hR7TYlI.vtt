00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.928
Let's try our second problem using area and perimeter. This time we're going to

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:07.890
fence in a garden. You want to enclose a rectangular garden with 36 feet of

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.843
fencing. So, this would be the fencing around your garden. If you need 72

00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:17.235
square feet of garden to grow all the vegetables you want to plant, what should

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:22.070
be the dimensions of the garden? Now, I don't want to find the dimensions of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.406
the garden just yet. Let's do this problem in a couple steps. Start solving

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:31.654
this problem by writing two equations for the perimeter and the area. Since you

00:00:31.654 --> 00:00:35.380
want to write two equations, these boxes need to have an equals sign in them.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.210
Some expression on the left, and then some expression on the right.
