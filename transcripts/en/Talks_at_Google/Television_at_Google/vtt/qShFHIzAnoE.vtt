[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.644
SPEAKER: Please give a warm
Google welcome to Phil Keoghan.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.536
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:17.384
CINDY HALVORSEN: Oh.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.134
PHIL KEOGHAN: I wore
the same watch today.

00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:19.900
CINDY HALVORSEN: Oh, nice.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.150
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah,
the lucky watch

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.310
that was there at the
finish line for you guys.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.270
CINDY HALVORSEN: That
is a lucky watch.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.610
Great.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.250
Well, thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.345
We're really excited to
have you in our office.

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:30.720
We got to be in your office
for three weeks as we filmed,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.940
and now you're in our office.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.856
PHIL KEOGHAN: So is
everybody called Googlers?

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:36.690
Is that what you call everybody?

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.282
Well, thanks for having me.

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:40.740
CINDY HALVORSEN: So for those
of us who have maybe not seen

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.490
the show and just
pretend to see the show,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.450
can you do a quick recap
of how the show works?

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.165
PHIL KEOGHAN: So the show's now
been going 17 years, for those

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:49.290
of you who haven't seen it.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.580
And 29 seasons, we just went
to air with the 29th season.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.620
And essentially, the
idea is that normally we

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.300
have 11 teams of two in
preexisting relationships--

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.950
grandparents, best
friends, husband

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.160
and wife, engaged
couples, brother/sister.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.600
Whatever that
combination is there

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.433
in a preexisting
relationship, and then they

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:11.841
race around the world
following a series of clues

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:12.840
from country to country.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.714
The slower races get
eliminated along the way

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:17.590
until we end up with the fastest
three, fastest three teams.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.370
CINDY HALVORSEN: Or
the luckiest three.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.078
PHIL KEOGHAN: Or
sometimes we've actually

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:22.320
had four teams run
in the last leg.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.200
And then they race to the finish
line to win that $1 million

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.830
prize.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.040
This season we just
changed things up to--

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.660
that's just to mess
up my explanation

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.040
about how this all works.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.590
Normally it's 11 teams of two
people who know each other.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.030
This season what
we decided to do

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.050
was take 22 complete
strangers and pair them up

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.730
at the starting line
so they literally

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.200
didn't know each other's names.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.300
And that's proved to be
a little interesting.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.920
You've seen the season so far?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.550
CINDY HALVORSEN: Of course!

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.100
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, no,
I just wanted to check.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.390
I thought maybe after you won,
you thought, all right, we won,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.930
we're out of here.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.340
We're going to watch
something else.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.830
Now it's "The Voice" we're
going to watch or something

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.380
like that.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.510
CINDY HALVORSEN: We
do watch that too.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.340
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, you do?

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.560
That's good.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.643
CINDY HALVORSEN: How did
the dynamics of strangers

00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:02.940
being on "The Race" together
change the storytelling

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.690
process?

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.260
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, you know--

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.540
let's put that down there.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.166
Normally, when you're in an
existing relationship, if you--

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:12.540
there's sort of
no filter, right,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.630
when you're with somebody
in an existing relationship.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.212
And sometimes people just--

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:21.420
they bicker at each other,
let's be honest, you know.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.841
And sometimes that
makes for good TV.

00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:25.590
And sometimes you're
more polite to people

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.000
that you might meet as a
stranger in a supermarket

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.880
than you are
sometimes to somebody

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.580
you're apparently meant to love.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.400
And so at the starting
line, everybody

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.290
was very polite to
each other because they

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.370
didn't know each
other's names, they

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.390
didn't know where
they came from.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.370
And suddenly they found
themselves paired up

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.230
with a complete stranger.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.850
And one of the first
things-- after I

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.630
said go, one of the first
things that happened was it's

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.790
like, oh, hi, I'm Phil.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.350
What's your name,
and where do you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.790
come from, and all
that sort of stuff?

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.490
But the show is shot
12 shows in 21 days.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.500
And it's a pressure
cooker, as you know.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.160
And so it took about
80 hours before it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.190
went from being polite to
strangers or the stranger

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.550
that you were with to no filter.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.220
Listen, dude.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.030
This is a team.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.070
I don't know how you
operate ordinarily,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.530
but I will not be
spoken to like that.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.500
You will pull your head in, and
I'm as much a part of this team

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.982
as you are, and so we
need to work together.

00:03:20.982 --> 00:03:22.940
And some of the people
that have been paired up

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.700
are people that you would
just normally not-- like,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.640
they would not normally choose
to be with a person like that.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.620
This is like the
unwanted relative

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.700
that you have to
have at Thanksgiving

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.400
who says all those
obnoxious things

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.962
and spills food all
over themselves.

00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:38.420
And the only reason that you
have to get together with them

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.420
is because they're family
and it's Thanksgiving.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.620
So some of the pairings work.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.370
Some of the pairings don't work.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.870
And the end result is we
end up with a great show.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.120
CINDY HALVORSEN: That's great.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.040
That's--

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.080
PHIL KEOGHAN: Makes
for entertaining TV.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.910
CINDY HALVORSEN: So
over the 29 seasons

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.594
you've raced a
million 68,000 miles.

00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:58.010
PHIL KEOGHAN: I
did not know that.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.610
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yeah, I just
did the math for you today.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.952
PHIL KEOGHAN: Wow, I love that.

00:04:00.952 --> 00:04:03.410
CINDY HALVORSEN: So Google Maps
obviously covers the world.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.106
How do you think Google Maps
plays into "The Amazing Race"?

00:04:07.106 --> 00:04:08.480
PHIL KEOGHAN:
Well, Google Maps--

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.417
I mean, I'm a huge, huge fan.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:11.750
I have a great story about that.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.900
When we talk about my film and
how I used Google in general,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.640
just the technology.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.488
But think about
how much technology

00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:20.779
has changed since "The Amazing
Race" first went to air.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.510
You know, we had our
first show in 2001.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.580
And you could travel the
world and you could hide away

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.890
in countries and people
wouldn't know where you were.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.200
And now people are
like live broadcasting

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.300
us running through the airport.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.650
And that's just crazy, right?

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.670
I mean, it's like people
have their own broadcasting

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.620
capabilities.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.870
And people can
obviously use Google.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.680
If they get access
to a computer,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.090
they can look up certain things.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.710
And I do believe that that
might have been something

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.570
you might have
done in your time,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.890
look up a few things in Google?

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.181
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yes, actually.

00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:57.216
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah?

00:04:57.216 --> 00:04:58.464
Tell the story.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:00.630
CINDY HALVORSEN: So we have
a few points in our race

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.088
where we definitely used Google
Maps to get us from point A

00:05:03.088 --> 00:05:05.495
to point B. The one
time we didn't, we

00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:07.280
used this random Dutch web site.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.370
We got super lost,
and we lost the cars.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.080
We went from first
place to third place

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.370
and lost those cars.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.500
Bummer.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.750
But it actually helped
us in the very final leg

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.070
that you saw here.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.180
This is-- we raced
six years ago.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.680
The four--

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.660
PHIL KEOGHAN: Has
it been that long?

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.620
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yeah,
it was that long.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.410
PHIL KEOGHAN: And you've had
two children since then, right?

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.360
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yeah.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.800
We have had two.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.841
PHIL KEOGHAN: Time flies.

00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:29.842
CINDY HALVORSEN: I know.

00:05:29.842 --> 00:05:32.174
PHIL KEOGHAN: I was in my 30s
when we started this show.

00:05:32.174 --> 00:05:32.990
Now-- now I'm--

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.630
CINDY HALVORSEN: Now you're 35.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.750
PHIL KEOGHAN: Now
I'm not in my 30s.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.935
I'm a little older.

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:38.070
And you've got two kids.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.820
How'd that happen?

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.090
CINDY HALVORSEN: I know.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.970
Yeah, so it was the
age of flip phones.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.930
And so we texted Google the
clue to the final pit stop,

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.405
and it texted us the answer.

00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:47.030
It was awesome.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.790
PHIL KEOGHAN: Don't
you love that?

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.090
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yep.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.647
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yay for Google.

00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:51.230
Is that why you ended
up working here,

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.855
because you figured
you've got to give back?

00:05:52.855 --> 00:05:53.190
Got to give back?

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.260
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yeah.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.020
I think it helped us win.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.470
PHIL KEOGHAN: This is your debt?

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.260
It worked out.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.460
CINDY HALVORSEN: Now I
give my service to Google.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.043
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah,
no, I'm a big fan.

00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:04.010
And in this film that
I shot, I reached

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.830
out to Google and Google
Maps, and hugely helpful.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.850
I mean, it's just changed the
way that we see the world.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.490
Because I love maps.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.090
I really love tactile maps.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.180
I love putting them up
on the wall and looking.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.560
But there's
something amazing now

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.900
just about being able to
drop in and really explore

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.780
a place before you get there.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.170
And it's sort of the trip before
the trip that you can now take.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:31.010
Also just writing the
scripts for "Amazing Race,"

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.750
I'm constantly on Google to
look up fascinating facts

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.430
and figures--

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.010
real facts, not false facts--

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.320
to put into the show.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.030
You know, the audience
love the little facts

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.410
that we give along the way.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.660
So I'm always looking for
the really interesting ones,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.510
like how many thousand islands
there are in Indonesia.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.430
And people are always
surprised by that.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.010
And fascinating facts
about the deepest lakes

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.990
and all those sort of stuff.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.050
So I like it.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.770
CINDY HALVORSEN: That's great.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:59.311
That's great.

00:06:59.311 --> 00:07:01.370
So take us actually to
the production room.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.170
So there's lots of
conversation that

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.310
happens before you plot out the
show and actually go and film.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.660
Take us to the table where
you're having conversation

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.820
with Bertram, Elise,
whoever else is in the room.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.860
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, yeah,
I mean, Bertram and Elise,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.560
you know, they work
with a fantastic team.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.990
And Bertram takes the
first hand at sketching out

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.790
where he wants to go.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.970
And then from there,
everybody supports him

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.320
and looking for great
stories and great ideas.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.260
Supported by a really
great group of people.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.320
And what's good about the show
now being on as long as it has,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.080
a lot of people have
come to us inviting us

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.240
to come to their countries too.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.890
And then ultimately,
CBS is the one

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.310
that signs off on
not only where we go

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.660
but who we have on the show.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.340
So Les Moonves still has--

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.050
Les Moonves, for those of
you who don't know, runs--

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.320
I mean, the guy is
very successful.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.642
But he really does take
a hand on everybody

00:08:01.642 --> 00:08:02.600
who goes on "The Race."

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.540
And then ultimately CBS signs
off on the route that we go to.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.025
Do you say "root" or
"rowt" in America?

00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:10.525
"Rowt"?

00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:11.460
CINDY HALVORSEN:
"Tomayto," "tomahto."

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.230
Probably both.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.350
PHIL KEOGHAN:
"Tomayto," "tomahto."

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.120
What would you say,
"root" or "rowt"?

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.600
AUDIENCE: "Rowt."

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.475
PHIL KEOGHAN: "Rowt."

00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:17.390
So Les Moonves signs
off on the "rowt"--

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.180
--that we take.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.200
And then from there, we've been
to some just incredible places.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.170
And what I love about our show
is, unlike a stage show or so

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.530
many shows that
are on television,

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.580
the background is
always different.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.280
You know, you never
see the same background

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.500
twice on "Amazing Race."

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.450
It's harder, I think,
for other shows,

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.960
whether they're staged
shows like, you know,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.119
a singing competition show.

00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:49.160
I think it's harder for
them to stay fresh season

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.129
after season just because--

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.420
one of the things-- just
because the stage is the same.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.711
They can change the lighting
and do a few things there,

00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:59.570
but we have the ability
to really radically change

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.042
the look of the show,
not only by where they go

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:03.750
but what they do.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.580
And of course,
like all shows, we

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.050
change the people who
come on every season.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.950
CINDY HALVORSEN: So let's talk
about the different locations.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.481
You had mentioned it's like
traveling before you travel,

00:09:13.481 --> 00:09:13.980
right?

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.840
When you're--

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.590
PHIL KEOGHAN: With the
research, you mean?

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.256
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yes,
with the research.

00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:20.130
So talk about in today's
political climate,

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.320
where people maybe don't
feel as comfortable

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.220
traveling the world.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.890
How does "Amazing Race"
play in that conversation?

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.290
PHIL KEOGHAN: That's a
really good question.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.020
A lot of people assume
that America is the safest

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.210
country in the world.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.860
America is a very safe country.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.990
It's not the safest
country in the world.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.920
And so then you ask people,
well, where does America rate?

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.870
You guys can Google
it right now.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.445
Where does America rate in
terms of being the safest

00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:46.320
country in the world?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.870
And it's way further down
than a lot of people realize.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.240
Now we'd all agree that
America is a safe country.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.070
So if America is
as safe as it is--

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.400
and it's not even
in the top 10--

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.410
then, gosh, there's
a lot of safe places

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.400
to travel to in the world.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.700
The reason that a lot of
people who haven't traveled,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.400
which is why I
really love stressing

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.900
the importance of travel,
particularly for young people,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.460
is that their
perception of the world

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.376
is that wherever you go
in the world something

00:10:12.376 --> 00:10:13.670
is going to be going wrong.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.500
Because when they see
the rest of the world

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.470
normally, in network primetime
television or on the news,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.680
something is going wrong because
of that old news adage, which

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.690
is, if it bleeds, it leads.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.090
So generally
speaking, if somebody

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.180
sees something
about Spain, they'll

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.780
see when there's been a riot or
there's been some big protest

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.680
or something has gone wrong.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.670
And so people, if they start
to hear that over and over

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.710
and over and over
again, they just assume,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.660
why would I want
to get on a plane

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.020
and leave this safe country of
mine, this safe neighborhood,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.140
this safe state that I
live in and go to a place

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.520
where things are going wrong?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.590
So what we get to
do is to juxtapose

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.559
that with, hey, look at
all these safe places

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:55.850
you can travel to in the world.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.500
Look at all these
amazing people.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.416
Look at all these wonderful
things you can do.

00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:02.750
So we really are the antithesis
of what the news is doing.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.850
We are celebrating
what's right in the world

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.850
as opposed to amplifying
and playing up

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.490
and selling what's wrong.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.160
So I think it is
hugely important.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.430
And you know, just seeing
different cultures,

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.150
seeing the ways that different
people live around the world,

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.650
it's important for all of us
to be exposed to that, I think.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.680
And so our show,
network primetime show,

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.990
millions of people,
literally, watching.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.049
You know, appointment viewing.

00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:31.340
I love being involved in
something that, again, there's

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.070
enough of the celebration
of what's wrong.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.325
I love that our show really
does focus on, all right,

00:11:36.325 --> 00:11:38.200
we're going to show you
something really cool

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.765
that maybe you
haven't seen before.

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:41.015
CINDY HALVORSEN: That's great.

00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:43.080
So similarly, let's talk about--

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.260
at Google, we believe
a diverse team

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.890
can lead to better results.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.490
Let's talk about the diversity
that you've shown on "The Race"

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.740
in terms of the cast and what
qualities of these diverse cast

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.120
members make a better team.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.710
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well,
diversity is key.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.300
And I mean, I come
from New Zealand.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.840
One of the reasons I came to
America is I saw it as a place

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.890
where you could make
anything happen.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.070
And coming from New
Zealand and growing up,

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:12.590
what you read about America
is it's always sold and taught

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.200
as the land of opportunity.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.540
And this is a country
of immigrants.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.370
This is a country
where people came

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:24.770
from all corners of the world to
find a better life in America.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.420
And that's why I
like living here.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.290
I love my country, New Zealand.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.590
But the opportunities
that are here far

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.330
exceed what is available
in New Zealand.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.660
And so I also feel like
in America there's always

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.040
been a celebration of success.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.320
And that success has come
from such a myriad of people.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.860
We have prided ourselves in
always casting a diverse cast

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.120
to represent the plethora
of the American people.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.000
If you remember the
Guidos in season 1

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.250
where they were openly
affectionate with each other

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.630
as a gay couple.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.880
That was in 2001.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.480
It was kind of radical.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.120
People weren't that comfortable
with seeing that sort of thing

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.900
on television.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.670
So we are trying to perpetuate
the idea of acceptance

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.460
and difference and
that with difference

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.070
comes a more
interesting country.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.760
And so if ever there was a
time to celebrate difference

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.860
and to focus on the fact
that difference is good

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.020
and diversity is
good, it's right now.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.930
Because if we
polarize-- if we start

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.980
getting more and more
polarized, we will get division.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.450
There's misunderstanding
that comes from all of that.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.375
So I obviously-- I don't
know this for a fact,

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:41.000
and I don't want to
give a false fact--

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.460
but I would venture
to say that--

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.500
nobody wants to do that.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.189
I don't want to do fake
news or anything like that.

00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:49.730
But I would venture
to say that we've

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.850
had probably the most diverse
cast of any reality show.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.090
If you think about it, even if
you look at all the competition

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.970
shows, they're all
singers who are diverse.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.310
They're all designers
who are diverse.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.250
They all do one particular
thing and they're diverse.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.810
They dance and they're diverse.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.730
Or they're celebrities
and they dance.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.100
Or whatever the show is.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.320
But we have a cast,
particularly this season

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.290
with 22 individuals.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.960
They are black, they're white,
they're tall, they're short,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.150
they're fit, they're unfit.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.736
Rich, poor, Democrats,
Republicans.

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:24.110
CINDY HALVORSEN:
Limbs, no limbs.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.380
PHIL KEOGHAN: Limbs-- exactly.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.820
Some people-- we've had amputee.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.970
Remember we had Sarah, who's
an unbelievable athlete.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.140
We had Luke, who was deaf.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.180
We've tried to have as much
diversity as we possibly can.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.740
At the end of the
day, we're still

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.950
casting interesting people.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.620
We have to have
interesting people.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.990
But I feel like the net
that we can throw out

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:49.110
to find interesting people
is a much bigger net than,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.410
oh, we're going to throw
a net out but, by the way,

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.797
you all have to
sing really well.

00:14:52.797 --> 00:14:54.380
You know, we're not
about that at all.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.171
These people come in and, trust
me, some of them cannot sing.

00:14:57.171 --> 00:14:57.920
They cannot dance.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.660
CINDY HALVORSEN: That's me.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.120
And me.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.000
PHIL KEOGHAN: They come into it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.950
And do you remember Dandrew?

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.910
Do you remember that
when they were in Russia

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.210
and he was trying to march?

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.835
For any of you who remember that
season in Russia, and he was--

00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:08.960
[COUGHING] excuse
me-- trying to march

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.214
and he just could not do it.

00:15:10.214 --> 00:15:11.630
And you know people
who don't know

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.580
that they don't have rhythm.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.780
They're worse than anything
because they are adamant that

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.550
they're in step, but they're--
no, oh, it was hysterical.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.294
So diversity is a
big part of, I think,

00:15:24.294 --> 00:15:25.460
what has made our show work.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.620
Because people at home identify
with somebody on the cast.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.500
There's somebody there
that is their uncle

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.380
or they feel like
they see themselves

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.879
emulated in that person so.

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:36.920
CINDY HALVORSEN: Awesome.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.980
Well, you've also
had many YouTubers.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.020
We have one here today who's
going to be visiting us.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.069
You've had many
YouTubers on the cast.

00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:48.110
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, we
had a season of YouTubers.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.320
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yes.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.153
PHIL KEOGHAN: Right?

00:15:49.153 --> 00:15:51.950
And what we were
trying to do there was,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.360
again, just embrace the fact
that the world has changed

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.540
so much, the way that
people communicate,

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.450
the fact that Tyler Oakley
can reach as many people as he

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.440
had or--

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.060
the idea that anybody
now can find a platform

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.980
to be able to share
something that they do.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.010
Maybe they're amazing at
embroidery and they have--

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.914
there's a guy online
who ties flies.

00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:18.830
And I think he has, like,
a million followers.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.290
And he literally sits
and tells people how--

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.840
flies that you make for
fishing, fly fishing?

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.820
He literally is-- his--

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.960
yeah, I guess I didn't--

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.580
CINDY HALVORSEN: I thought you
were talking about flies flies.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.190
PHIL KEOGHAN: He ties flies.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.100
Oh, yeah, no, no.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.140
Flies flies.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.050
Although some guys do use
live flies on their flies.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.657
Did you know that?

00:16:36.657 --> 00:16:37.240
No, it's true.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:37.830
CINDY HALVORSEN: I know
nothing about fishing.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.500
PHIL KEOGHAN: No, they've tied
live flies on their flies.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.500
Because they look like--

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.670
I mean, because they
are flies, and then

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.045
they put it on
the hook, and then

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:46.420
the fish sees the
real fly, and then

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.870
the fish eats that live fly.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.050
And the live fly is on a fly.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.015
And then that fly gets the fish.

00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:53.140
CINDY HALVORSEN: Excellent.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.640
PHIL KEOGHAN: You
think I'm kidding.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.260
I'm not.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:55.500
Anyway--

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.180
CINDY HALVORSEN: I
kind of follow you.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.140
PHIL KEOGHAN: I'm just saying
that anybody can do anything,

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.090
and they can be online.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.800
And so we wanted
to embrace that.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.160
And so we tried it,
and it was interesting.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.710
I think, you know, we
also thought, well,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.280
maybe those people who follow
those particular people

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.960
online will come
and sample our show

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.624
and get a look at our show.

00:17:16.624 --> 00:17:18.040
But I think you
have to stay-- you

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.859
have to try to stay current
with the zeitgeist of what's

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.089
going on, right?

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.130
Which is-- I mean, you guys
are doing it every day.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.410
You guys are--

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.291
I mean, the changes.

00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:30.790
Think of how-- I mean, you were
talking about just six years

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.710
ago with flipout phones and--

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:33.310
right?

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.226
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yeah.

00:17:34.226 --> 00:17:37.090
PHIL KEOGHAN: I mean, it's
changing all the time.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.080
I love living in--

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.110
I love technology.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.910
I love living in the future.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.640
So I love embracing change.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.310
And I have a daughter who's
about to graduate college.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.674
And growing up-- her
growing up in the house,

00:17:48.674 --> 00:17:51.090
it was great because I always
wanted to know, what are you

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:51.631
listening to?

00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:52.780
What are you watching?

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.640
What are you guys talking about?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.410
What are the things that you--
you know, when Heelys were in.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.120
Do you remember Heelys, the
shoes with the little wheels?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.070
My daughter had those,
and we traveled a lot.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.780
So she would use those and she
would be zooming all around.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.906
And she loved traveling
because we'd go to airports

00:18:07.906 --> 00:18:09.988
and there were all these
long, long hallways where

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:11.850
she could just be like,
you know, launching.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.936
Especially in Chicago, where
you've got those great long--

00:18:14.936 --> 00:18:16.810
and she used to do all
kinds of crazy things.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.090
And so then she got me on a
pair and I almost broke my leg.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.420
And they're hard to
use, if you ever--

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.360
No, I love staying current.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.840
I think you can't dig
your head in the sand

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:36.534
and just sort of continually
look at putting VHS

00:18:36.534 --> 00:18:37.700
cassettes into your machine.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.474
You got to kind of evolve.

00:18:39.474 --> 00:18:40.890
CINDY HALVORSEN:
Yes, that's good.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.120
Did you know that your
most searched about season

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.050
was your season
of internet stars?

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.980
PHIL KEOGHAN: Another
fact that I didn't know.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.282
I love another fun fact.

00:18:50.282 --> 00:18:50.990
Another fun fact.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.320
CINDY HALVORSEN:
Here's another one.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.480
What do you think is
the most watched YouTube

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.329
video from "The Amazing Race"?

00:18:55.329 --> 00:18:56.120
PHIL KEOGHAN: Ever?

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:56.510
CINDY HALVORSEN: Ever.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.860
PHIL KEOGHAN: It would
be the watermelon video.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.049
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yes.

00:18:59.049 --> 00:18:59.840
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.170
And that, for those
of you who don't know,

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.460
I think it was season 17.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.630
We were in England.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.990
We had the teams
catapult watermelons.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.410
And these watermelons
were on like a giant--

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.680
we used like a giant
catapult system going back

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.777
to the old medieval times.

00:19:18.777 --> 00:19:21.110
That was sort of designed on
one of those old catapults.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:26.005
Anyway, we had a team, and
they were from a home shopping

00:19:26.005 --> 00:19:26.630
network, right?

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.780
Am I right?

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.240
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yes.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.560
Yeah, Brook and Claire.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.850
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah, Brook
and Claire, that's right.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.570
So they got the
watermelon, put it

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.150
in a little leather pouch
with the big rubber bands,

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.067
and they pulled it back
and pulled it back.

00:19:36.067 --> 00:19:38.400
She's pulling and pulling and
pulling, pulling, pulling.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.360
And then boom!

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.080
She lets it go.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.700
And somehow, the watermelon went
out, and the piece of leather

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.830
flipped around the watermelon.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.590
And then with all
that force, boom!

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.650
And came right back, hit
her right in the chin.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.590
And you just see her,
like, reel backwards.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.010
And that video went to
like a million views.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.290
CINDY HALVORSEN: 11 million.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.460
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, in the
day it went to a million.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.150
It's now 11?

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.300
CINDY HALVORSEN:
It's 11 million.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.100
PHIL KEOGHAN: OK,
that's substantial.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.510
CINDY HALVORSEN: The one time
was probably enough for Claire.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.260
11 million is the internet.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.070
PHIL KEOGHAN: And
that was an old video.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.990
Had that happened
today, that would

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.420
be like 100-million-view video.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.330
But I mean-- and quite
frankly, we were really lucky

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.615
that she didn't get hurt.

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:17.240
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yes.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.198
PHIL KEOGHAN: But that's
one of those anomalies

00:20:19.198 --> 00:20:22.490
that you just-- you know, made
for good TV, though, didn't it?

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.300
Are you OK?

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.030
OK, great.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.910
That was great TV.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.105
Don't do it again.

00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:30.980
CINDY HALVORSEN: Keep
going, keep going, yep.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.887
But I'm sure she did
not want that hitting

00:20:32.887 --> 00:20:33.970
her face 11 million times.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.800
The slowmo is the best, if you
go back to YouTube and watch

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.530
the slowmo.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.030
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh,
yeah, you're sick.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.519
You watched that in slow motion.

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:42.060
CINDY HALVORSEN:
It's so fascinating.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.520
The watermelon just--

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:42.885
PHIL KEOGHAN: It is fascinating.

00:20:42.885 --> 00:20:44.180
I did watch it in slowmo too.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.000
It's like--

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.737
Yeah.

00:20:48.737 --> 00:20:50.070
CINDY HALVORSEN: That's awesome.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:55.050
So the show films over-- each
episode is a couple of days.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.070
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah, so
it's 12 shows in 21 days.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.730
Which a lot of people don't
realize, is it's nuts.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.490
I mean, you think about that.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.570
Right now we're on episode 3.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.980
So those teams, those strangers
have known each other about 85

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.240
hours.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.140
And people, because we're
spread out week after week,

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.530
people assume that, you know,
there's all this downtime.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.170
And I often get people
who say, oh, Phil, you

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.480
must just, like, hang out at
the pool and drink pina coladas.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.000
And I'm like, dude,
you have no idea.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.220
I'm trying to race ahead of
these people who are hell

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.470
bent on racing ahead of me.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.102
And they're fast.

00:21:34.102 --> 00:21:38.190
You get winners like you
around, it gets challenging.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.940
CINDY HALVORSEN: So
what is the best thing

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.700
left on the cutting room floor?

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.000
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, I am going
to tell you this categorically.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.600
If there's anything
that is that good,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.230
there's no way
it's on the floor.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.780
I mean, that would be
like, oh, yeah, well, it

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.290
was this great scene where the
watermelon came back and hit

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.165
the girl in the face.

00:21:57.165 --> 00:21:58.390
We left it on the floor.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:59.350
No, trust me.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.910
If it's good, it's in the show.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.340
We will find a way to
put it in if it's good.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.580
So no.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.910
Yeah, no.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:10.180
We're lucky that we have
so many great moments.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:15.700
And it all starts
with great ideas.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.150
And you know, the great ideas
filter down from the top,

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:24.730
from Bertram and his
vision of what he wants

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.410
and then other people injecting
great ideas into the show.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.060
And it's a huge
collaboration, you know,

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.540
because it's one thing to
have an idea for something.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.910
It's another thing to
execute it, as we all know.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.460
We've seen so many great
ideas poorly executed.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.110
"Amazing Race" is
a great idea that's

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.660
been beautifully executed.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.032
It was originally Elise
Doganieri's idea for a show

00:22:49.032 --> 00:22:50.740
because Bertram
challenged her to come up

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.930
with a good idea for a show.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:57.250
And she had been backpacking
in Europe and thought, well--

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.650
and I guess there were a few
sparks with her traveling

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.275
partner, and maybe she felt that
would make for a good TV show.

00:23:02.275 --> 00:23:04.930
And so it started with
the gem of an idea.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.440
But again, at the time
that "Amazing Race"

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.150
was being pitched,
there were about four

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.060
race-around-the-world-type
shows being pitched.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.570
And interestingly, I
was actually interviewed

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.820
for another show that was--

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.440
I think it was Fox Family,
which was later ABC Family.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.540
I was in for an
interview for that show

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.030
when I heard about "The
Amazing Race" show.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.610
And they're working
title was, you

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.510
know, "80 Days Around the
World" or whatever it was.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.690
And so they were pitching
them all at the same time.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.520
But again, the
idea is one thing.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.360
It's the execution.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.050
And so what I'm proud
of with "Amazing Race"

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.750
is that I'm really proud
to be a part of a team that

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:53.150
has continued to execute
this great idea very well

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.107
and consistently for 17 years.

00:23:56.107 --> 00:23:58.190
CINDY HALVORSEN: So let's
talk about the logistics

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.690
of the show.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.020
One of the things that really
amazed me when we set off in LA

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.020
was just the production
value, right?

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.840
So the number of people
traveling with us,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.530
the security, all the producers.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.020
What's one thing
that viewers would

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.540
be really interested to know
from behind the scenes, other

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.080
than you've mentioned a couple
times the 21 days of filming?

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.590
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, some
interesting information.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.890
For instance, every team has a
cameraman and a sound person.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.830
The team is never allowed
to leave that sound person.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.780
The sound person
and camera operator

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.587
are completely independent.

00:24:31.587 --> 00:24:33.170
They have all the
batteries they need.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.560
They have all the tape
stock or recording device

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.090
that they need.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.812
They really do operate
like an independent unit

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:42.020
when they're with you, right?

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.600
And there's quite
a bond that forms

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.610
between the teams and the crew.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.070
Out of fairness, we do swap
up the crews and the teams

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.990
so that one team doesn't always
have the same camera crew.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.560
When the teams
book their flights,

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.310
they're booking for
four people, you know.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:02.690
There has to be room for
people to go onto the flight.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.270
Again, just the logistics
of 12 shows in 21 days.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.640
It's less than
two days per show.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.090
We want the teams
to be well fed,

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.980
so we do feed them
at the pit stops.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.140
And you know, we want
them to be highly

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.220
functioning human beings.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.000
CINDY HALVORSEN: Pit
stops were every two days.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.391
We were not well fed.

00:25:18.391 --> 00:25:19.266
PHIL KEOGHAN: Really?

00:25:19.266 --> 00:25:21.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.340
Well, what--

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.140
CINDY HALVORSEN: I,
like, really remember

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.390
Jeremy eating someone's
hamburger from the airport

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.020
cafeteria.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.220
He just stopped
someone and said,

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.428
are you going to finish that?

00:25:29.428 --> 00:25:31.520
And he ate their burger.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.990
Because we were starving.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.890
PHIL KEOGHAN: The other
thing you should know

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.080
is that "Amazing Race"
is a great diet plan.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:36.160
So--

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.118
CINDY HALVORSEN: It is!

00:25:37.118 --> 00:25:38.660
Look how skinny I
was in the race.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.530
PHIL KEOGHAN: If you
want to lose weight,

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.526
you can come in at 200
and you'll leave it 100.

00:25:43.526 --> 00:25:44.740
Yeah.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:45.240
Yeah.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.100
OK.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.560
Well, we try to feed them
really well at the pit stops.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.390
CINDY HALVORSEN: At the pit
stops, we get fed really well.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.510
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.500
And then you get to sleep.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.220
CINDY HALVORSEN:
Stuff our pockets.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:52.700
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.150
You get to sleep.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.410
CINDY HALVORSEN:
Like six hours before

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:55.280
your next interview
has to start.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:55.988
PHIL KEOGHAN: OK.

00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:58.400
Well, we get to sleep
less than you, actually.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.900
CINDY HALVORSEN:
Oh, man, really?

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.560
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, yeah, as
crew, I mean, yeah, absolutely.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.570
So I always say that the
experience that you guys have

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.970
is kind of like doing
interval training,

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.000
where you sprint like crazy
and then you stop down

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.990
and then you sprint like
crazy and stop down.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.710
So for us, it's just nonstop.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.554
So only three teams go from
the beginning to the end.

00:26:18.554 --> 00:26:19.970
We as production,
obviously, we go

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.594
from beginning to
end, the whole thing.

00:26:21.594 --> 00:26:25.340
And as soon as we're
finished with the teams,

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.860
then we're already on to
trying to get to the next place

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.690
to start shooting to stay ahead.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.510
And one of the reasons
that I started doing those

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.420
live updates that I
do, which I wasn't

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.512
doing when you were there.

00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:39.470
But one of the reasons
I started doing it was I

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.260
was always just trying to
stay ahead of the teams

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.430
to explain the challenges.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.710
So I had to go
everywhere they went.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.080
But a lot of times the
teams would turn up,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.908
and then I would have to
get out, get out of the way.

00:26:50.908 --> 00:26:52.407
So I was, like, so
frustrated that I

00:26:52.407 --> 00:26:56.234
was missing a lot of
explaining to the audience

00:26:56.234 --> 00:26:58.400
that I just said, all right,
just roll with the team

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.930
running through
and I'll just say,

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.185
you know, Ernie and Cindy
are the first to arrive

00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:02.810
at this detour.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.577
And what they have
to do is X, Y, and Z.

00:27:04.577 --> 00:27:06.410
So that's where those
live events came from.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.887
And then I had one shot to get--

00:27:07.887 --> 00:27:09.470
and the audience
loved the idea that I

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.540
had one take to get it right.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.090
But you know, there
are times, I mean,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.280
in the history of
"Amazing Race" when

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.610
the Globetrotters were on in
season 18, I think it was.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.070
We were in Prague.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.280
Was that-- no, it was 17.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:22.840
I'm sorry.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.990
We were in Prague.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:32.150
And I was there in Prague at
the pit stop for about 5 o'clock

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.630
for the first team.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.500
I saw the sun set.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.810
I waited all night.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.480
I saw the sun rise,
and the Globetrotters

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:45.830
arrived in the daylight
after I had been on a mat.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.160
And that was all we had was
a mat on a piece of grass

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.530
out on the end of a
little island in Prague.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.170
And I was out there
for about 16 hours

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:58.490
or whatever it was total to
wait for them to eliminate them.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.960
But that was not the record.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.190
The record was season 11
when I waited for the Guidos

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.660
for 19 hours.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.430
I was at the pit stop
outside in the snow.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.970
CINDY HALVORSEN: You don't get
to go into a warm tent or van

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:12.470
or--

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:13.553
PHIL KEOGHAN: Not in-- no.

00:28:13.553 --> 00:28:17.120
There are some situations like
when we were in the Botswana--

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.680
we were in the salt
pans in Africa.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.030
And there was no respite.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.710
The only respite you got
from the sun was an umbrella.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.860
And we were out there
for about 12 hours.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.120
So you get cooked.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.940
And there have been
times where I'm still

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.210
waiting for the
last team to come in

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.740
and the first team has gone
on to the next leg, which just

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.310
throws everything into chaos.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.760
So we never shut down.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.510
Like this season, for
instance, is typical

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.530
that we won't get to a hotel
for the first six, seven days.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.290
So this season, for
instance, I never got--

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:51.950
we left Los Angeles, we
flew overnight to Panama,

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.770
we shot all day, we flew
overnight to Brazil,

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.320
we shot all day, we flew
overnight to Africa,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.890
we shot all day.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.700
And so we were up to
day six and we still

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.190
hadn't been-- none of
us had been to a bed.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.800
So a lot of times I
get home and people

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.515
say, Phil, you looked
like crap last night.

00:29:09.515 --> 00:29:10.140
I saw the show.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.060
You looked so bad.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.392
And I go, yeah, I know, I know.

00:29:15.392 --> 00:29:17.600
And they go, like, you looked
like just like a wreck.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.800
And I'm like, yeah.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.440
So of course, it's just me,
a cameraman, and a sound guy.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.980
I don't have a makeup person
or anyone looking after me.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.770
And occasionally the crew will
forget to tell me, you know,

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.870
that my hair is sticking
up on some weird angle.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.840
And I wash my hair on the road
when I don't get to hotels.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.690
So I carry a little thing
of Johnson and Johnson

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.570
shampoo, which is very
gentle on the scalp.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.460
I use that when I'm traveling.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.690
So I have crazy photographs
of me having my hair

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.660
washed outside the Terracotta
Warriors in China, you know,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.000
or--

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.260
yeah.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.960
It's a really, really tough
gig, but it's a great gig.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.670
And it's a gig that
a lot of people, I

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.211
don't know if they
really understand.

00:29:57.211 --> 00:30:00.440
Then I write the scripts with
one of the producers, Pat,

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.490
before I leave.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.940
So then as we're going,
everything is changing.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.860
So I'm having to
write the scripts.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.526
So a lot of times I'm on a plane
and I just want to go to sleep,

00:30:09.526 --> 00:30:11.630
but I'm having to
rewrite scripts.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.850
Or the last show isn't
written before we take off,

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.380
and then I'm
exhausted, and then I'm

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.990
writing that on the last
flight in to the end city.

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.610
Like what happened this time.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.270
So I'm not complaining, by
the way, because I love it.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.890
I'm just saying that
that is the gig.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:30.630
It's not 70 degrees
in an LA studio

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.075
doing a show where people sing.

00:30:34.075 --> 00:30:36.450
CINDY HALVORSEN: So I shouldn't
complain about our eating

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.620
every two days because
you didn't eat for six?

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.620
PHIL KEOGHAN: No, because
it's-- no, no, no, no.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.520
I'm not saying--

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.430
I'm not comparing it that way
because I think it's tough.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.050
I think it's just a tough gig.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.580
It's tough for the racers.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.520
It's way tougher
than people realize.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.730
But I also think that a
lot of people who are not--

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.950
who haven't been out, they
don't understand just also

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.240
how hard it is for the crew.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.823
I mean, you think about the crew
running around after you guys

00:30:59.823 --> 00:31:00.900
and what they do.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.650
It's pretty crazy.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.060
You getting a shot there, Ernie?

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:03.809
ERNIE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:03.809 --> 00:31:05.180
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah, just--

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.359
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:06.900
There you go.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.470
All right.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.230
CINDY HALVORSEN: So if you
could host any other show,

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.440
what show would you host?

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.148
PHIL KEOGHAN: Uh.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.370
I like my show.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:16.480
I like this show I do.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.146
CINDY HALVORSEN: Not
even like the Emmys

00:31:18.146 --> 00:31:20.684
or "The Bachelor," all
your pretty ladies now?

00:31:20.684 --> 00:31:22.850
PHIL KEOGHAN: That's the
last show I'd want to host.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.960
I find it so depressing.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.470
Oh, god.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.320
I just watch what some people
do and I just think, oh, no,

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.000
please don't.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:31.830
Don't put that on.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.210
I find it-- like, I really
feel myself cringing for them.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.770
I'm just, oh, no, don't
do that, no, don't.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:43.300
No, I think maybe
shows that I really--

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.330
reality shows that
I really like.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.990
I love-- has anybody seen
"Chef's Table" at all?

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.720
Beautifully shot,
beautiful show.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.750
I love Anthony
Bourdain, you know.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.097
Some people, you
know, really love him.

00:31:58.097 --> 00:31:59.180
Some people don't get him.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.880
But I like him, and
I like that show.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.050
I find it fascinating.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.240
Ironically, every
time he does anything

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.550
to do with food and
cooking, I can't watch.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.500
I don't like it
because my pet peeve

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.679
is watching people eat on TV.

00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.220
CINDY HALVORSEN:
But you make us eat.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.820
Well, we didn't eat in
our season, thankfully.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.310
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, that's
when it's a challenge.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.200
But the thing I hate
more than anything

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.660
is when people eat on TV
and then they do the whole--

00:32:22.999 --> 00:32:24.057
oh, that's good.

00:32:24.057 --> 00:32:24.851
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:25.811
It's like, no.

00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:27.310
And what I love
about "Chef's Table"

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.726
is they don't--
if you look at it,

00:32:28.726 --> 00:32:30.820
they don't show people eating.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.240
It's all about the story behind
the food, behind the person,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.830
and the passion for the food.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.350
And they prepare the food
and they show the food,

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.540
but they don't do the
gratuitous, like, people just

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:41.530
eating food.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.200
So anyway, why am I
even talking about this?

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.410
Because I would never be
able to do a show about food

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:50.440
because I just love eating
food, not on camera.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.040
And I don't know how to cook.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.700
But I think those sort
of shows, I love that.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.050
I love-- you know, if you're
talking about nonfiction,

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.860
I love any documentary.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.760
Really fascinated with
real-life stories.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.720
I love "60 Minutes."

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.337
It's like my staple.

00:33:04.337 --> 00:33:06.670
If I was stuck on an island
and I had to watch one show,

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.211
I'd probably watch that because
you're going to see Lady Gaga

00:33:09.211 --> 00:33:12.160
on one end and then you're going
to see some really heavy piece

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.040
about really understanding
what's going on in Iraq

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.690
or where they--
you're always seeing--

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:19.711
I love-- I love real stuff.

00:33:19.711 --> 00:33:22.210
That's why I think I find it
hard to watch, like, "Bachelor"

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.709
because it's just
like, oh, no, just

00:33:23.709 --> 00:33:26.020
go meet some people
in real life.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.640
Don't do that to yourself.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.180
It's OK.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.791
You don't need a rose.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.166
I do want to take a moment
to share the preview

that it's only

the borders of suffering

00:35:37.928 --> 00:35:40.844
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.470
- Man, do I have some
respect for the riders who

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:51.596
rode in 1928.

00:35:51.596 --> 00:35:54.464
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.350
The most challenging
parts are yet to come.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.170
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.009
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:06.009 --> 00:36:07.050
CINDY HALVORSEN: Awesome.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:07.990
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.810
It was a long ride.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.083
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:11.245 --> 00:36:13.620
CINDY HALVORSEN: So tell us
a little bit about the movie.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.320
Where did you get the
inspiration to do this movie?

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.410
PHIL KEOGHAN: Well, I love
stories about underdogs.

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.630
I think that's why I always
root for the underdogs

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:22.880
on "Amazing Race."

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.770
I just find-- it's
like the Cubs, right?

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.430
It's like that story,
that story of people

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.910
doing something that
is so well deserved

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.300
after so much hard work.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.660
And I always read
books about underdogs,

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.230
like the guy who came up with
the clock that could keep time

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.630
for Captain Cook when he was
traveling over the oceans

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.040
to be able to map the world out.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.220
They needed to have Greenwich
Mean Time on the ship,

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.870
and they needed to
have a clock that

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:52.260
would withstand the rigors
of being at sea on a ship.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.600
And this one guy who
was a carpenter, who

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.360
wasn't a scientist,
spent his lifetime

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.280
making five clocks
before he finally

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.140
came up with a clock
that could keep time.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.940
And all the scientists couldn't
believe that a carpenter

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.350
came up with the solution.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.157
So I always love those
kinds of stories.

00:37:07.157 --> 00:37:09.490
And I found a book about the
first English-speaking team

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.310
to ride in the Tour
de France, which

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.860
happened to be the tour
with the highest attrition

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.000
rate of any tour in history.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.690
And I thought, wow.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.010
How do I not know this story?

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.630
I love the Tour de France.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.680
I'm from New Zealand.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.680
There's one New Zealander
and three Australians.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.300
So I decided I would
tell the story,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.780
bring it to life somehow
in a documentary.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.730
And of course, all
those riders are

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.980
all gone, and all the people
who remember those riders

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.919
and remember that
time, they're all gone.

00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:38.460
And so I thought,
rather than telling

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.590
the story in a traditional
documentary style

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.410
where I would be on
the outside and show

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.870
a bunch of archival
footage and tell the story,

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:49.140
researching and being more
of a spectator, if you like.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:54.030
If I put myself in the story
and I rode a 1928 Tour de France

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.100
bike that weighs twice
as much as a modern bike,

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.130
that has no gears, I went
over every single road,

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:00.990
I went to every--
over every single--

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.049
to every single town and
over all the mountains,

00:38:03.049 --> 00:38:04.590
I could have a
different perspective.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:10.050
And we could juxtapose 1928 with
when we rode it in modern times

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.610
and try to bring
the story to life.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.760
And it's one of the more
stupid things I've ever done,

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.980
but it's--

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.410
because you cannot
take on a physical--

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.800
we were riding an average
of 150 miles a day.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.770
We had seven stages
over 200 miles.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.350
We had one day that took
us 23 and 1/2 hours.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.660
And the idea of trying to
take on a physical challenge

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:37.120
like that while you're making a
movie is just not a good idea.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.710
However, I mentioned before
that I love technology.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.750
I love new technology.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.120
Sony heard that I was
going to do this--

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.309
have a good friend at Sony--

00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:47.850
and they said,
listen, would you like

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:52.590
to try out our brand-new F55
4K camera on your documentary?

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.260
And no documentary had
ever been shot in 4K

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.270
with an F55 camera
at that point.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.670
So I said, absolutely.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.010
And then Angenieux, which is
a French lens company that

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.070
make beautiful
lenses, they loaned us

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.227
$400,000 worth of beautiful
French fast lenses.

00:39:09.227 --> 00:39:11.310
Really, for any of you who
know about photography,

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:14.130
super fast lenses that allow
you to shoot in really low light

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:14.970
conditions.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.280
So we had this
incredible technology.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.600
And then one of our--

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.109
one of my best friends who
I've known for 30 years, way

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:22.650
before "Amazing
Race" but he ended up

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.000
working on "Amazing Race"--

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.530
he's this incredible shooter.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.720
When I rode across America
to raise money for MS

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.390
a few years ago, he sat
on a motorbike backwards

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.231
for 3,500 miles.

00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:34.230
And I called him up and
I said, hey, Scott, I've

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.657
got a great idea.

00:39:35.657 --> 00:39:36.990
We're going to go around France.

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:39.000
We're going to retrace
the 1928 Tour de France.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.624
How would you feel
about shooting that?

00:39:40.624 --> 00:39:42.887
And he goes, do I have to
sit on a motorbike backwards

00:39:42.887 --> 00:39:43.470
to shoot that?

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.136
And I went, yes.

00:39:44.136 --> 00:39:46.274
And he went, OK, I'm in.

00:39:46.274 --> 00:39:47.940
So he's seen America
backwards, and he's

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.280
seen all of France backwards.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.140
And so we shot this film.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.690
And we couldn't get funding
in the beginning for it,

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.160
so it's all self-funded.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.260
It took five years to make.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.590
And the Google connection
here with the film,

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.510
if you saw in the trailer where
we come zooming in out of space

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.460
and we go into the
Arc de Triomphe

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.870
and into the Champs-Elysees.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:10.410
So Craig Manning,
who works in your--

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.510
worked for Google in
New York and now is

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:16.150
working on another project
in conjunction with Google--

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.930
I called him up.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.096
He's a fellow New Zealander.

00:40:18.096 --> 00:40:18.960
And I said, listen.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.660
I'm using Google right now
to retrace the 1928 Tour

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.160
de France.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.920
And I'd love to use one
of your maps to, like,

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.880
fly in to the Arc de Triomphe.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.816
Can you help me?

00:40:28.816 --> 00:40:30.690
So he hooked me up with
some guys in Boulder,

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.520
where my daughter
is at university.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.730
So I went to the Google
office in Boulder.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.260
And I worked with a guy there.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:42.940
And then there's two maps in the
film that you'll actually see.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.410
And we rendered them all
to be able to match 4K

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.600
so the quality is really good.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.030
The other Google connection
is, I decided that I really

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:56.090
needed to have aerials of France
in order to bring this to life.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:59.670
And so I went on Google Maps
and I'm starting to, like,

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.080
fly around on Google Maps.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.867
And what I realized was
that I could actually fly--

00:41:03.867 --> 00:41:05.700
because I didn't have
a whole bunch of money

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.220
to spend on helicopter time--

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.420
I could fly at a certain
speed from point A to point B

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.057
and save KMZ files of
each of the plot points

00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:18.390
and work out where I wanted
to shoot the Col d'Aubisque.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.014
I wanted to be 500
feet off the ground.

00:41:20.014 --> 00:41:21.600
I want to be in
this position right

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.725
here to get the mountains
at that level and the Col

00:41:23.725 --> 00:41:25.150
d'Aubisque and see the road.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:28.020
And so I saved all
these KMZ files.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.270
Then I gave all of those
files to the pilot.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:34.170
I said-- and then I made
a video of the route.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.930
And then I put it all
in electronic form,

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:37.980
give it all to him.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.930
He pulled it up on his computer.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.360
We got the helicopter
out of Spain

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.580
to fly across the
Pyrenees into France.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.326
And he literally just
followed the KMZ files

00:41:47.326 --> 00:41:48.450
that I made in Google Maps.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:49.675
And then he knew exactly--

00:41:49.675 --> 00:41:52.050
like, I didn't have to explain
to him, go a little lower.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.150
Go a little to the right.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.500
He had the exact spot.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.015
So I did all of
that in Google Maps

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:58.890
before we got up in the
air and we're burning

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.230
expensive helicopter fuel.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.630
So saved me a tremendous amount.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.180
And then just recently
I did a project

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.400
for the Smithsonian
Channel, which

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.750
is all aerials of New Zealand,
like, every single shot,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:16.330
an aerial shot of New Zealand.

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:18.390
And I did exactly
the same thing.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.314
And I went and I was able to see
exactly where and how to do it.

00:42:21.314 --> 00:42:22.980
And it's all because
of that technology,

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.901
which is such a great
tool now for filmmakers.

00:42:25.901 --> 00:42:27.150
CINDY HALVORSEN: That's great.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.660
PHIL KEOGHAN: So thank you.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.250
I don't know, are there any
Google Maps people in here?

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:30.750
No?

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:31.740
CINDY HALVORSEN: We
all use them, probably.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.095
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:42:32.095 --> 00:42:33.178
It's great, though, right?

00:42:33.178 --> 00:42:34.564
I mean, how amazing.

00:42:34.564 --> 00:42:37.230
CINDY HALVORSEN: We are going to
invite some of the other racers

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.820
up here and do a
quick Q&amp;A with them,

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.305
and then we will be open for
questions from the audience.

00:42:41.305 --> 00:42:43.512
So Ernie, do you want to come?

00:42:43.512 --> 00:42:44.970
Ernie, if you guys
don't know, this

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.430
is my husband from season 19.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.890
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.940
And Idries we have
from season 22, who

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.260
raced with his twin brother.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.210
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: I did.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:57.543
CINDY HALVORSEN: And then
we've got Kurt from season 28.

00:42:57.543 --> 00:43:00.660
He was on the internet
all-star season with Brodie.

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.353
They play Frisbee.

00:43:02.353 --> 00:43:04.875
KURT GIBSON: Yeah.

00:43:04.875 --> 00:43:07.500
CINDY HALVORSEN: So we're going
to do a lightning round of Q&amp;A.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.320
Do you want to--

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.111
PHIL KEOGHAN: Sure.

00:43:09.111 --> 00:43:10.970
CINDY HALVORSEN: --now
ask us the questions?

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:11.510
PHIL KEOGHAN: All right.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:13.610
Do you want all of you to
answer every single question?

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:13.880
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yes.

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.570
And we're going to go speedy.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:15.380
PHIL KEOGHAN: OK.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.430
OK.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:18.670
Favorite place that you
went to on "Amazing Race"?

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.120
KURT GIBSON: Chamonix, France.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.970
Got [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.485
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Oh,
we were in Jakarta.

00:43:24.485 --> 00:43:27.660
Jakarta was probably my
favorite, in that cave.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.660
CINDY HALVORSEN: No,
the cave was not.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:30.235
It was scary.

00:43:30.235 --> 00:43:31.610
ERNIE HALVORSEN:
It wasn't scary.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.290
CINDY HALVORSEN: It was scary.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:33.873
PHIL KEOGHAN: Not
your favorite place?

00:43:33.873 --> 00:43:36.110
CINDY HALVORSEN: It was
a massive grave site, no?

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:36.720
ERNIE HALVORSEN: But
that was awesome.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.403
CINDY HALVORSEN: That
place in Indonesia?

00:43:37.403 --> 00:43:38.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.853
PHIL KEOGHAN: I don't even want
to start an argument with you.

00:43:40.853 --> 00:43:41.637
This is great TV.

00:43:41.637 --> 00:43:42.770
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Oh,
it's good [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:43.420
What about you?

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.200
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
I guess Bora Bora.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.000
PHIL KEOGHAN: Bora Bora?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.500
OK.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.070
Well, how cool was that, right?

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:47.740
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
Oh, that was phenomenal.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.830
PHIL KEOGHAN: Although
the search in the sand.

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:50.985
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
That was hell on earth.

00:43:50.985 --> 00:43:51.117
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:43:51.117 --> 00:43:51.440
That was hell on earth.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:51.966
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: I'm sorry.

00:43:51.966 --> 00:43:52.924
That was hell on earth.

00:43:52.924 --> 00:43:53.640
PHIL KEOGHAN: OK.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.617
Biggest fear going
into "Amazing Race."

00:43:56.617 --> 00:43:57.783
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: Losing.

00:43:57.783 --> 00:43:58.750
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.790
CINDY HALVORSEN:
And how'd you do?

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:00.270
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: We lost.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.307
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:01.307 --> 00:44:03.390
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah, It's
a lot tougher than people

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.030
think, though, right?

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.105
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: It is.

00:44:04.105 --> 00:44:04.560
Oh, my god.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.870
You know, when you watch it
on TV, like, do this, do that.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:07.860
It looks like it's so easy.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.693
When you're there, it's
like, this is crazy.

00:44:09.693 --> 00:44:10.390
This is so hard.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.530
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.520
I know, it happens so quick.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.600
What about you, biggest fear?

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.665
Did you have any fears?

00:44:13.665 --> 00:44:15.420
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Probably what
my friends thought about me.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:15.720
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.605
And what do your friends
think about you now?

00:44:17.605 --> 00:44:18.230
Have they said?

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.180
ERNIE HALVORSEN:
They've given up on me.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.471
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, they give up.

00:44:20.471 --> 00:44:21.450
What about you?

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:21.990
KURT GIBSON: I
think it's probably

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.690
looking really
bad on television,

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:24.612
looking really dumb.

00:44:24.612 --> 00:44:25.570
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, yeah?

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:27.150
KURT GIBSON: Sometimes,
you know, I mean,

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.640
I kind of have this
brace on right now,

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.098
so I know I kind
of look dumb but--

00:44:30.098 --> 00:44:32.640
PHIL KEOGHAN: You should explain
what happened to you, Kurt.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.181
KURT GIBSON: I was
in the Philippines

00:44:34.181 --> 00:44:36.330
and on this island
called Bellarocca.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.670
And me and my buddy
thought it was a good idea

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.730
to go to this aerial point,
have a cool beach day, whatever.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.950
And there's these cliffs
there and there's like a 5--

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:44.510
PHIL KEOGHAN: And you
wanted to jump off it.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:45.930
KURT GIBSON: --8- ,
and 15-meter dive.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.930
No, but the funny
thing was my buddy

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.971
was trying to get me to
go off the 15-meter dive.

00:44:48.971 --> 00:44:49.689
And I'm like, no.

00:44:49.689 --> 00:44:50.730
I don't want to get hurt.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.040
You can do that but
I'm not doing that.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.744
So I was going off the middle
one with all the kids and all,

00:44:55.744 --> 00:44:56.910
like, the parents and stuff.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.640
And my fourth jump I land
and my arm goes like this,

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.970
and I tore my pec.

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:02.190
So lovely.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:03.290
That's a lovely story.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:04.700
PHIL KEOGHAN: And you're going
to be like that for six weeks,

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:04.890
right?

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.550
Which is not good
if you play Frisbee.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:06.890
KURT GIBSON: No.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:07.260
PHIL KEOGHAN: No.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:07.926
KURT GIBSON: No.

00:45:07.926 --> 00:45:10.380
PHIL KEOGHAN: Did you have
a fear going into the race?

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.838
CINDY HALVORSEN:
Crying, which that

00:45:11.838 --> 00:45:13.980
broke in the first
episode, so I don't know.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.440
PHIL KEOGHAN: Crying
is like eating on TV.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.830
It can be a good look sometimes.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:20.430
The most useful thing
that you guys packed.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.440
What would you say?

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.955
Frisbee?

00:45:23.955 --> 00:45:26.080
KURT GIBSON: No, we lost
that on the first cab ride

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:26.650
at the airport.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:26.800
PHIL KEOGHAN: Did you really?

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.540
KURT GIBSON: We
wanted to bring it.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.890
We had these grand
plans of, like,

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:31.050
throwing it to the mat when
we finished, but we lost it.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:32.466
We don't know what
happened to it.

00:45:32.466 --> 00:45:33.090
No.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:35.089
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Probably
under clean underwear.

00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:37.610
But I would say on the race, I
learned about this new, like,

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:39.610
stick that they use, what
that thing was called?

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:40.320
The--

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.670
PHIL KEOGHAN: The stink stick?

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.128
ERNIE HALVORSEN: It's kind of
like a stink stick, you know.

00:45:44.128 --> 00:45:46.090
They rubbed it in areas
to make it nice and--

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:47.760
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, oh.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.120
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: Wait, what?

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:48.950
PHIL KEOGHAN: No,
you're talking about--

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:49.540
ERNIE HALVORSEN: You know
what I'm talking about?

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.070
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah, no, I know
what you're talking about.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:51.977
Yeah, no, it's--

00:45:51.977 --> 00:45:52.810
AUDIENCE: Deodorant?

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:53.369
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:53.369 --> 00:45:54.910
ERNIE HALVORSEN:
It's like deodorant,

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:56.430
but it's like a non-cake stick.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.555
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah, no, no.

00:45:57.555 --> 00:45:58.409
It stops chafing.

00:45:58.409 --> 00:45:58.950
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:59.741
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:45:59.741 --> 00:46:00.390
And--

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.600
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Body.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.140
Body Glide.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.020
But they called it
something different.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:02.950
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:03.787
There's a name.

00:46:03.787 --> 00:46:04.620
I'll tell you later.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.880
I think it's a little rough.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.550
ERNIE HALVORSEN:
Don't say it here.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:07.420
PHIL KEOGHAN: Might be rough.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.920
I think I probably
shouldn't say it.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.120
But it's just-- needless
to say, the name of it

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.980
involves a certain
part of the anatomy.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.650
And it's actually a legit
name that you can buy.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:19.890
If you googled it and you
put the name of an anatomy

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.470
and then put cream,
it'll come up.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:24.603
So what about you with--

00:46:24.603 --> 00:46:25.350
CINDY HALVORSEN: Idries.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:25.903
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:46:25.903 --> 00:46:26.170
Go ahead.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.220
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
No, that's all right.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.719
Actually, it sounds strange,
but, like, a compression shirt.

00:46:29.719 --> 00:46:33.102
It kept, like, all the sweat
from actually going places.

00:46:33.102 --> 00:46:35.060
It's absorb-- and I'm
actually wearing one now.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.290
PHIL KEOGHAN: Lot of
hygiene things, right?

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.150
I guess, you know,
you miss that, right?

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:40.260
KURT GIBSON: Frisbee's
good for hygiene too.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.680
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yeah,
toothbrush for sure.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.600
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Toothbrush.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.040
CINDY HALVORSEN: I will
say the least useful thing

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.623
we packed was a compass because
we didn't know how to read it.

00:46:46.623 --> 00:46:48.330
So what a waste of
space in our bag.

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:49.500
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah,
compass, really?

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.880
CINDY HALVORSEN:
We got really lost.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.440
PHIL KEOGHAN: What
talent would you

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.960
have liked to have had
to help you on the race

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.150
that you maybe didn't have?

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.470
Is there any talent?

00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:59.010
ERNIE HALVORSEN: I
think it was language.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:46:59.280
KURT GIBSON: Language.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.080
ERNIE HALVORSEN: I think
language is the easiest thing.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:01.460
KURT GIBSON: Yeah.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.440
ERNIE HALVORSEN: You
know, if I could speak it.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.920
We tried to learn
Russian, but that's tough.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.980
It didn't really work.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:07.481
Yeah.

00:47:07.481 --> 00:47:09.396
PHIL KEOGHAN: I know a
guy who knows a guy who

00:47:09.396 --> 00:47:10.540
could teach you Russian.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.967
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Let's do it.

00:47:11.967 --> 00:47:13.300
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: Google him.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.180
PHIL KEOGHAN: What about you?

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.030
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
Swimming, obviously.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.080
Obviously I'm not
a good swimmer,

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.280
and that's why we lost.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.880
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah, that was
challenging, though, right?

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.175
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
It was challenging.

00:47:20.175 --> 00:47:20.580
It was--

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.840
PHIL KEOGHAN: But
when you filled out

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.430
the form to come onto
the show, did they

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:24.210
ask you if you could swim?

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:24.280
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: They did.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.280
I can swim, but I'm
not a good swimmer.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:26.570
PHIL KEOGHAN: Right.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:27.580
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: When
they put you in the ocean,

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.163
you're kind of like,
I'm going to die.

00:47:29.163 --> 00:47:30.210
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:31.200
I get that.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.820
I mean, it's a fear
for some people.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.440
You know, they get in the ocean.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.273
I was just talking to
a guy who didn't learn

00:47:36.273 --> 00:47:37.630
how to swim until he was 36.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.630
And he said it was the
biggest thing in his life

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.200
to try to learn how to do that.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:41.640
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: Yeah.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.263
It's still kind of a--
it's a big thing for me.

00:47:43.263 --> 00:47:44.880
I have my kids in swimming
because, you know, I'm like--

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.250
PHIL KEOGHAN: You should
just keep going at it.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:47.850
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
I'm going to.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:47.940
PHIL KEOGHAN: Don't give up.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:48.140
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
I'm going to.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.320
PHIL KEOGHAN: Don't give up.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.070
What about you?

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.790
KURT GIBSON: I think
arts and crafts.

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:53.790
I know it sounds
silly, but we basically

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.670
got eliminated because
we got towards the back

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:58.800
when I had to tie those
little tiny, like, salt

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.350
bags and my fingers couldn't
really get around it.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.282
And then Brodie building a
kite really put us far back.

00:48:04.282 --> 00:48:06.240
So if we could just kind
of build these things.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:06.840
PHIL KEOGHAN: But
you're not-- let's

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.980
be honest-- you're
not going to go out

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.834
and do macrame class,
you know what I mean?

00:48:09.834 --> 00:48:11.500
KURT GIBSON: Hey, for
a million dollars?

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.510
PHIL KEOGHAN: No,
but I mean now.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.160
It's not like you're
rushing out to go do--

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.060
KURT GIBSON: Oh, no, now, no.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:15.610
No.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:16.180
PHIL KEOGHAN: You're
not doing arts and--

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:16.800
KURT GIBSON: No, no, no.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.670
PHIL KEOGHAN: With
you, anything?

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:18.330
Was there--

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.080
CINDY HALVORSEN: I
think the only thing is

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.600
I wish I was a little taller.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.710
PHIL KEOGHAN: How
would that have helped?

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:24.230
CINDY HALVORSEN: Everyone
was so tall in the race

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.640
and they could run faster
because their legs were longer.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.181
They could climb
those ladders faster

00:48:28.181 --> 00:48:30.016
because their arms were longer.

00:48:30.016 --> 00:48:31.140
It really was an inhibitor.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:31.270
PHIL KEOGHAN: Do
you think we should

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.380
standardize the height
for all the amazing races

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.894
to make it fair?

00:48:34.894 --> 00:48:35.730
CINDY HALVORSEN: Hm.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:36.240
It might be a good one.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.020
PHIL KEOGHAN: But you won.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:37.380
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Right?

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:37.963
She still won.

00:48:37.963 --> 00:48:39.601
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:40.007 --> 00:48:42.090
PHIL KEOGHAN: The tall
people are probably saying,

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.370
you know, I wish I was shorter.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:47.259
All right, what surprised you
most once you were on the show?

00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:49.550
Like, what was the one thing
that really surprised you?

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:50.841
CINDY HALVORSEN: The logistics.

00:48:50.841 --> 00:48:53.880
I feel like the moment we hit
that first mat and everything

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.600
just popped up.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.820
It was like bounce
boards, cameras.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.350
Everyone scooped on in.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:48:59.351
That was really amazing.

00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:00.183
PHIL KEOGHAN: Right.

00:49:00.183 --> 00:49:02.220
But the stuff you don't
see behind the cameras.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.880
Was there something
that surprised you?

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.920
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
For me, it was the pace.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.755
I mean, you know, it
was just going so fast.

00:49:06.755 --> 00:49:07.080
PHIL KEOGHAN: It's relentless.

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.621
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN:
Just relentless.

00:49:08.621 --> 00:49:09.940
I was like, wow, this is crazy.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.815
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Yeah,
it was definitely more

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:14.060
about the production,
going out there and just--

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.420
you were just left on your own.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.461
Like, I thought there was
going to be more, like,

00:49:17.461 --> 00:49:18.110
scripted stuff.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:19.710
There's going to be more like,
here's what you're going to do.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:20.190
Blah, blah, blah.

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.190
PHIL KEOGHAN: All right.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:22.820
Here's a great dramatic moment.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.820
What I want you to see--

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.420
ERNIE HALVORSEN:
They just drop you!

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.885
And I'm like, OK,
what do I do now?

00:49:25.885 --> 00:49:26.760
Cindy, what do we do?

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.140
PHIL KEOGHAN: You guys
have all been on the show.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.840
And you will attest to the fact
that we really pride ourselves

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.800
in trying to make the race
as authentic as possible.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.440
You hear people say,
oh, was that fake?

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.370
Was that scripted?

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:40.090
Was that set up and whatever?

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:40.680
No.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.660
And we pride ourselves in,
you guys are like our writers.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.970
You write the content,
meaning whatever you do

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.550
becomes the script, the
transcript of the show, right?

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:53.250
So we set up the circumstances,
and we throw you out there

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.390
to go do it.

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:56.550
And how you react
to that stimulus

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:58.187
is what creates the show.

00:49:58.187 --> 00:50:00.270
ERNIE HALVORSEN: I just
wasn't expecting that, so.

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.080
PHIL KEOGHAN: You
know there are shows--

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.790
there are shows that do
manipulate and, like,

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:06.390
you know--

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:08.490
we really pride
ourselves in trying

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:12.000
to make a fair race as
much as possible, you know?

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.590
And man, one of the things I get
the most from fans is they'll

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:19.507
say, why didn't you say
something to that teen?

00:50:19.507 --> 00:50:21.840
Like when the Twinnies moved
the money, do you remember?

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.360
IDRIES ABDUR-RAHMAN: Um-hm.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.910
PHIL KEOGHAN: And there was
a season where the Twinnies--

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:24.400
CINDY HALVORSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.230
PHIL KEOGHAN: And I didn't know.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.710
Like, I don't see in real time
what the audience is seeing.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:32.734
But they see this happen,
and then they see me.

00:50:32.734 --> 00:50:34.900
And they think that somehow
I'm meant to know, like,

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.100
every little detail.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:36.850
I haven't seen it.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:38.750
It's all just raw
footage at that point.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.750
So it's always, I have
to explain to them, well,

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:41.770
hold on a second.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:45.070
At the point when I was
talking to them, first of all,

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:45.730
I didn't know.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:48.880
But you've seen way more about
what just happened on that leg

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.964
than I have at that point.

00:50:49.964 --> 00:50:50.921
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Right.

00:50:50.921 --> 00:50:53.080
PHIL KEOGHAN: Like later,
yeah, I catch up but--

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.760
KURT GIBSON: I think that's part
of what makes the show so fun

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.640
to watch too is, I mean, one
of our episodes in Chamonix,

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.300
our favorite, we had to go zip
line to get that first clue.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.932
And so it's not really,
like, clear directions,

00:51:03.932 --> 00:51:06.140
but they're kind of like,
hey, you got to go do that.

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.130
So Brodie starts going over
the ledge to go get hooked up.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:11.330
And he's like, all right,
what do I need to do?

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:12.621
And the guy's like, no, no, no.

00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:13.300
Just one of you.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.676
And so Brodie kind of like looks
and is like, Kurt, you do this.

00:51:16.676 --> 00:51:17.800
I'm going back over, right?

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.820
So it's just like,
we're dreading

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:19.650
that moment, like, wait.

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.350
I don't want to do that.

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:21.266
You do that, you know?

00:51:21.266 --> 00:51:23.540
But just those kind of
moments make it fun.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.080
ERNIE HALVORSEN: The vagueness.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:24.880
You're like, you're
not sure if you're

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.150
doing the right thing exactly.

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.800
You're like, is this--

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.133
PHIL KEOGHAN: But when you
think about the circumstances

00:51:29.133 --> 00:51:33.490
that you guys all end up in,
right, it takes a while when

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:37.990
you get back to kind of process,
oh, my god, we were in Chamonix

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.840
and we were about to
leap off a mountain.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:46.150
And it all, for me, it
takes me about two weeks

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.280
to, like, process
everything that's happened.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.280
Because it's all happening
so fast and there's so much.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.072
So much so quickly.

00:51:52.072 --> 00:51:53.821
KURT GIBSON: And even
in the downtime too,

00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:55.550
you're like thinking
about the next leg.

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:58.154
You're just like,
downtime, but you're

00:51:58.154 --> 00:52:00.070
getting ready to stress
for the next 24 hours.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.180
PHIL KEOGHAN: And then
we're interviewing

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:02.254
you guys and [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:02.254 --> 00:52:03.670
CINDY HALVORSEN:
Well, and we tore

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:05.770
through every hotel room
looking for any clue

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:06.760
about the next day.

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.730
PHIL KEOGHAN: Really?

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.450
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yeah,
we showed up one day.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:09.635
ERNIE HALVORSEN: You guys pulled
the TVs out of every room.

00:52:09.635 --> 00:52:10.420
CINDY HALVORSEN: Yeah.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:12.190
Did you know that, the
TVs are not in the rooms?

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.070
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah,
no, I know that.

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:14.755
But you went with four TVs?

00:52:14.755 --> 00:52:15.420
ERNIE HALVORSEN: You
did that on purpose.

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:16.230
CINDY HALVORSEN: No, we were
looking for any information.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.950
ERNIE HALVORSEN: They
were all in Phil's room.

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:18.430
PHIL KEOGHAN: Don't make me
take that million dollars

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:19.800
back when you tell me--

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:20.720
CINDY HALVORSEN: We
didn't break any rules.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.610
PHIL KEOGHAN: I mean, that's
going to disqualify you.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.070
CINDY HALVORSEN: We
didn't break any rules.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:26.028
PHIL KEOGHAN: We had this
question come up here

00:52:26.028 --> 00:52:27.450
like that.

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:29.860
CINDY HALVORSEN: OK, so this
is an audience question.

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.521
What's the scariest
moment for you

00:52:31.521 --> 00:52:32.770
in "The Amazing Race" history?

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:33.730
PHIL KEOGHAN: Is this
from somebody here,

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.880
or is that someone--

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.550
you could just talk to me.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:38.030
KURT GIBSON: Wow,
this is awesome.

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:40.390
PHIL KEOGHAN: I mean, come on.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.609
I love technology, but,
dude, you can talk to me.

00:52:42.609 --> 00:52:43.692
CHARLES: No, I'm happy to.

00:52:43.692 --> 00:52:44.080
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:44.530
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah,
what's our name?

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:45.450
KURT GIBSON: No,
that was awesome.

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.366
PHIL KEOGHAN: Charles.

00:52:46.366 --> 00:52:48.580
OK, Charles is in
the audience here.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.507
Charles, I love how
you use technology.

00:52:50.507 --> 00:52:52.840
CHARLES: I didn't know how
crowded it would get in here.

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.140
PHIL KEOGHAN: OK.

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:55.223
So you're saying, yeah,
what's the scariest moment

00:52:55.223 --> 00:52:56.691
in "The Amazing Race" history?

00:52:56.691 --> 00:52:58.440
CHARLES: Yeah, mine
was the watermelon one

00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.164
that you talked about.

00:52:59.164 --> 00:53:01.705
But I don't know if there was
any other ones that you thought

00:53:01.705 --> 00:53:03.910
were, like, pretty terrible.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:07.060
PHIL KEOGHAN: You know, I think
a lot of what the teams do

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.420
is perceived danger, you know.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.860
All the challenges that they do.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.100
We're so ridiculous
about making sure

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:19.970
that they're run stringently
and that the teams are safe.

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:22.420
The part I worry about
the most is when a car--

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:26.020
they get in a car, in a taxi,
and the car is driving fast.

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:29.710
And maybe the teams ask
the driver to slow down.

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:31.994
We've had cars, accidents
on the show before.

00:53:31.994 --> 00:53:33.910
And those are the calls
you don't want to get.

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:36.130
When you get a call
and we find out a team

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.830
has been in an accident.

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:41.260
And Chip and Reichen
rolled a car in season 4.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.550
In season 1 we had
a team go over.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:46.300
I'm trying to think
of who was in the car.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:48.050
I think it was the
Guidos might have been.

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.990
There was an accident.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:52.980
So yeah, that's the
scariest thing for me.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.260
I worry about them the
most when, like you said,

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.910
when you guys are on your own.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:00.070
Even little things like
just crossing the road.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.410
Like, sometimes they'll
be in a crazy place,

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:04.572
they might be in
India, and they're

00:54:04.572 --> 00:54:06.280
in a really busy
intersection, and that's

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.363
where things can go wrong.

00:54:07.363 --> 00:54:10.720
Because they're out of
our control, you know.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.490
And that's the
part I worry about.

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.940
For me, personal
scary moment was--

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.330
not scary, but kind of surreal
moment-- was I was in Ukraine

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:20.080
and we flew in in the
middle of the night.

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.390
And I had a New
Zealand passport.

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.752
And I was told I
didn't need a visa,

00:54:25.752 --> 00:54:28.210
but for whatever reason this
guy thought I did need a visa.

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:30.280
So I was separated
from everybody.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.960
And the crew-- the
teams, sorry, were

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.543
going to be arriving
the next morning,

00:54:33.543 --> 00:54:35.729
so I had a little bit
of a head start on them.

00:54:35.729 --> 00:54:37.270
So I was going to
be getting up early

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.850
to go shoot all the
introductions to the challenges

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:40.900
before the teams came in.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.400
And we were expecting
the first team

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.620
to arrive at the mat at
10 o'clock in the morning.

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.690
That was the estimated time.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:49.760
And anyway, they pulled me away.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.090
It was 1 o'clock
something in the morning.

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:55.611
And they took me to this little
room and then left me there.

00:54:55.611 --> 00:54:56.860
And they didn't speak English.

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.500
And I was like, OK.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.540
So I waited there
and waited there.

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.300
And I had a sense that there was
something going on in the room

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.370
but I wasn't really sure.

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:07.390
And there was light
only at one end.

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:10.270
And it smelt like people in
there, but I wasn't sure.

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.310
And there were
four plastic seats

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:15.400
with the handles that go over
like that, kind of like this.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:19.000
So I stayed, waited
there all night.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.780
And I didn't have
phone service so I

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.280
didn't know what was going on.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.750
And I thought, oh, I'm
going to try to sleep.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:28.420
So I put my body through
the plastic handles and I

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.220
lay along the plastic seats.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.500
And then the next morning
someone woke me up.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:38.110
And I looked and I realized
I was trapped in the seat.

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:40.370
And then I looked back
and then I saw the room.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:41.950
There was all this light
and there were a whole bunch

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:42.640
of people in there.

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.750
And I had been
asleep and I didn't

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:46.140
realize that there were
like 50 people in the room.

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.090
And then the guy says, you know,
(RUSSIAN ACCENT) come with me.

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.980
So I got up and I left.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:54.400
And a woman who worked with
the American government,

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.310
was a huge "Amazing Race" fan
and had stayed up all night

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:59.740
to get me the appropriate
visa that I needed.

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:03.580
So I got put into a room, got a
stamp, ran out of the airport,

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:04.687
jumped in a car.

00:56:04.687 --> 00:56:06.770
Didn't have time to shoot
any of the standups that

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:08.920
introduced the challenges,
went straight to the mat.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.140
Got to the mat, and the
first team came in 10 minutes

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.206
after I arrived at the mat.

00:56:13.206 --> 00:56:14.650
Yeah, it was not scary.

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:16.240
It was just sort
of like, all right.

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.320
I hope everything's OK.

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:23.177
I hope Mr. Putin is not coming
to take over Ukraine right now.

00:56:23.177 --> 00:56:24.010
CINDY HALVORSEN: OK.

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.825
We've got one--

00:56:24.825 --> 00:56:25.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:26.890
Thanks for stopping by.

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.020
"The Amazing Race" is
syndicated in other markets.

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.600
There's an international
version of the show.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.002
Of course, without Phil
so not quite as cool.

00:56:34.002 --> 00:56:36.460
But is there any coordination
between the various versions,

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.460
like a list of places to go that
you'd look at where "Amazing

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.490
Race France" went or "Amazing
Race Japan" or something

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:43.010
like that?

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:45.950
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah,
so the franchise

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:47.800
has been very popular
around the world.

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.030
The show plays--

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:52.030
"The Amazing Race" US version,
plays in 140 countries,

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:53.320
I believe, around the world.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:58.450
And then the show's been
copied in Australia and Canada,

00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:03.970
in Israel, South America,
a few different places.

00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:06.250
And they use all
the same graphics.

00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:07.780
They use a lot of
the same ideas.

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.630
They've repeated a lot
of the same challenges.

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:13.700
And then they've also come up
with some of their own as well.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.470
So it's part of the
format of "Amazing Race."

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:19.360
There isn't like a
direct connection

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.670
between one and the other.

00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.820
But absolutely, it's
all based on that format

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.500
of "Amazing Race."

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.220
Yeah.

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.730
And I like your fish hook.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:30.850
Is it from Hawaii
or from New Zealand?

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:31.300
AUDIENCE: It's New Zealand.

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.100
It's the first thing I
bought when I got there.

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:33.610
PHIL KEOGHAN: Oh, nice.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:33.880
OK.

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.110
CINDY HALVORSEN: Is that where
you get all of your necklaces?

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:35.901
PHIL KEOGHAN: Yeah.

00:57:35.901 --> 00:57:40.070
So forever-- yeah.

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:43.870
It's a New Zealand
Maori fish hook.

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:46.600
The Maori are the indigenous
people of New Zealand.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.852
And the way they do
their fish hooks--

00:57:48.852 --> 00:57:50.560
I seem to be talking
a lot about fishing.

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.850
Not even a fishermen.

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:56.200
But anyway, the fish hook, they
put bait over the fish hook

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.050
and then the fish swallows
the whole fish hook,

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:01.140
swallows it whole, and
then it gets stuck.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.760
And the Maori people wear them.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.789
And if you wear a
greenstone one--

00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:06.330
actually, you're
not meant to buy it.

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:08.900
You're meant to be given it.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:10.140
And I've always worn one.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.950
It's meant to give
you safety over water.

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.340
So I've always worn
it on "The Race."

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.670
Thank you for hosting.

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:16.840
You did a great job.

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.250
CINDY HALVORSEN: Thanks.

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.440
PHIL KEOGHAN: Thank you,
Google, for having me and--

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.040
CINDY HALVORSEN: Thank you.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:20.610
PHIL KEOGHAN: Thank you, guys.

00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:21.735
ERNIE HALVORSEN: Thank you.

00:58:21.735 --> 00:58:23.660
[APPLAUSE]
