00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.370
BEN LECOMTE IS SWIMMING MORE THAN 5,500 MILES
ACROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN —

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.079
AND FROM THE GET-GO, THIS WAS NEVER GOING
TO BE EASY.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.420
IN ORDER TO COMPLETE HIS JOURNEY,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.540
BEN NEEDS A MAP TO NAVIGATE STRONG CURRENTS,
EDDIES, AND EVEN TO ADJUST

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.940
FOR THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE EARTH.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.080
JEREMY: The further north you go, the circumference
of the Earth is less and less,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.120
so that can help shorten the overall voyage.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.540
If he stays too far south for too long, those
winds and seas are gonna be going against him,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.300
which will end up slowing him down.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.540
BEN’S TEAM HAS BEEN PLANNING THIS ROUTE
FOR OVER THREE YEARS,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.000
WITH THE HELP OF JEREMY DAVIS.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.390
IT’S HIS JOB TO PROVIDE DIRECTION FOR ANYONE
CROSSING THE OCEAN — FROM COMMERCIAL VESSELS,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.560
TO CRUISE SHIPS, TO ROWBOATS —

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.149
AND NOW,
BEN.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.420
So we've been tracking Ben.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.720
He's been able to swim at about 20 or 30 nautical
miles per day.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.580
It just all depends on his own energy levels,
time of the day, visibility, all those factors

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.880
can play into it.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.420
We wanna make sure they're on the best possible
route to try to help shorten it as much as

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.899
possible and give the most favorable conditions.

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.060
The weather is gonna be a major factor on
the success of this voyage.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.820
SO FAR, WINDS AND EXTREME CONDITIONS HAVE
MADE THE INITIAL SWIM GRUELING FOR BEN.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.060
AT THAT RATE, IT WOULD TAKE BEN OVER THREE
YEARS TO CROSS THE OCEAN, SO, JEREMY AND THE

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.650
CREW ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OCEAN BEHAVIORS
AND BATHYMETRY TO SPEED THINGS UP.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.860
Once they head little bit farther offshore,
they get into the Kuroshio current.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.000
That's a major boost for him for swimming,
so he can cover a lot more ground in a shorter

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.420
period of time.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.940
THE KUROSHIO IS A WARM-WATER CURRENT THAT
FLOWS OFF OF THE COAST OF JAPAN AND THEN

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.320
PEELS OFF TO THE EAST, DRIVEN BY THE CIRCULATION OF THE NORTH PACIFIC GYRE,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.140
A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE MOVING CLOCKWISE.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.580
TAKING MAXIMUM ADVANTAGE OF THE KUROSHIO CURRENT HAS ACCELERATED BEN’S SWIM MILEAGE

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.540
TO AS MUCH AS 45 MILES A DAY.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.680
BEN: I am finally in the Kuroshio current, so right
now I know I am getting a good push whenever I swim.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.060
I am very happy about that.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.870
PAUL: Like every good highway, we have maps.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.040
Instead of going straight to San Francisco
we have to do a curve, like this, meeeeow,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.400
and go down, and after that we probably have
to go up, like this.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.760
If we just headed straight east we wouldn’t
have all that push, so it’s not instinctive

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.870
but we have to trust the weather team, we
have to trust the scientists, and so far it's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.459
working very well.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.739
UNFORTUNATELY THE KUROSHIO IS NOT GOING TO
LAST MUCH LONGER.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.020
SOON, BEN WILL FIND HIMSELF OUT OF THIS CURRENT
AND ON HIS OWN.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.300
BEN: I am happy to be in the current but I'm not like,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.640
“Oh yay, I made it, I'm in the current now!”

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.440
I still have a lot to conquer.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.019
FOR THE NEXT LEG OF THE JOURNEY, HE'LL BE
SWIMMING AT A MUCH SLOWER PACE,

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.049
LIKELY ALONGSIDE EDDIES: TEMPORARY LOOPS OF SWIRLING WATER BRANCHING OFF FROM CURRENTS.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.939
THESE COULD GIVE HIM A SMALL BOOST, OR PUSH
HIM BACKWARDS.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.709
JEREMY: Ben's route's gonna be changing quite
frequently, and sometimes on an every three-

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.920
or four-day basis we're gonna be making minor
changes to the route.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.000
WHILE BEN’S CREW CAN MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS
TO HIS ROUTE, THERE ARE MANY UNPREDICTABLE

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.940
FACTORS THAT COULD THROW 
EVERYTHING OFF-COURSE.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.900
JUST AS BEN WAS FINDING HIS STRIDE IN THE
KUROSHIO CURRENT, THREE LARGE STORMS CONVERGED

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.139
ON THE BOAT, FORCING THE CREW 
TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISION.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.280
JEREMY: So, Ben and the crew were about 500
miles east of Japan in the Kuroshio current

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:18.770
when we detected the development of the tropical
storm 14W to the south, another one, 15W,

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.860
that would be developing right after that
and moving off to the north up towards Japan,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.900
and a third one, developing in the southeast
of Japan.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.601
So with all of this activity, the decision
had to be made to send them back to Japan

00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.700
to keep them safe and out of harm’s way
with all this tropical activity.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.080
WITH HEAVY HEARTS, BEN AND THE CREW HAVE RETURNED TO PORT TO WAIT OUT THE STORMS

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.100
UNTIL THEY GET THE GREEN LIGHT TO CONTINUE.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.460
JEREMY: So it’s going to be a little more
difficult for Ben to get back out and restart

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.790
the swim for at least the next week and a
half; hopefully at that time we’ll start

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.440
to get a break in the weather and he be able
to head back out to the east.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.980
ACCORDING TO METEOROLOGISTS, STORMS AND TYPHOONS OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHEAST ASIA

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.960
HAVE BECOME MORE FREQUENT, POWERFUL AND DESTRUCTIVE OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES;

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.840
SO IT’S CRITICAL THAT BEN AND THE CREW DON’T TAKE ANY UNNECESSARY RISKS.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.419
LUCKILY, TYPHOONS THAT STAY OVER THE OPEN
OCEAN ARE LESS LIKELY TO INCREASE IN INTENSITY.

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.940
SO ONCE THEY GET THE ALL CLEAR, THE SEEKER
CREW WILL RACE BACK TO BEN’S LAST GPS POINT

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.900
AND CONTINUE THE SWIM,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.700
