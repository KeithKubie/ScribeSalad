What is another
name for angle CPA?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.900
So we have C, we have
P, and we have A.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.480
So angle CPA is going to be
this angle right over here.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.070
So what's another name for it?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.730
Well, I could start off with A,
and I could call it angle APC.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.110
So this is the same
thing as angle APC.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.130
Now is that any
one of my choices?

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.070
Yeah, that's this
choice right over here.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.200
If someone said angle P,
that wouldn't give you

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.190
a lot of information.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.744
That kind of says, well, that's
only giving me one point.

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:38.160
I don't know, maybe
it's referring

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.599
to that angle, that angle,
that angle, that angle.

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:42.640
So that's really not giving
me enough information

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.030
to specify this angle
right over here.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.450
Angle PAC would be an angle
formed if you actually

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.640
had a line here, if you
had a line between AC.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.990
Angle PAC would be
this angle right

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.060
over here, which is
clearly a different angle.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.629
Angle FPA would be
this angle right

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.150
over here, which is also
clearly a different angle.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.389
So the only choice that
makes sense is angle APC.
