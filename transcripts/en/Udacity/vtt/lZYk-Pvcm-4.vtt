00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.700
The way decibels work are, each ten decibel decrease in volume corresponds to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.752
half the volume.

00:00:06.752 --> 00:00:11.434
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, 50 decibels is half the volume of 60 decibels?

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:15.168
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. And that would mean that 40 decibels is
