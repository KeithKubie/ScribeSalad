00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.930
Sierra Vista is the
location of our campus

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.910
here where we
started this program.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.570
One third of [? CyberCom ?] is
on Fort Huachuca, about five

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.190
miles from us right now.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.620
The network command is a
large defensive component

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.410
of cyber command
for the US military.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.850
So we do have folks there.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.360
But we also have
a pool of people

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.790
where we can draw from here.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.950
So [? Cyberopolis ?]
is our virtual city.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.060
We have about 15,000 virtual
personas, 15,000 residents that

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.320
are completely run by software.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.860
So we have water
companies, power companies,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.100
online news media.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.640
We have large retailers,
banks, hospitals.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.840
We have small retailers.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.760
We have our own Facebook
called Social Park.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.770
We have our own Twitter
called Chirpy Hub.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.290
And every one of those
are used specifically

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.980
either to teach a concept,
or to practice on a concept,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.430
or to test on a concept.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.640
And that class and its
learning objectives

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.670
are tied back to the specific
knowledge units from NSA.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.260
I have students in Afghanistan.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.760
I have students in
Djibouti, Africa.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.070
I have students all over
Europe, all over Canada,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.770
in South America, and
in the United States.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.140
The way we deliver
our content online

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.710
is live lectures
with hands-on labs,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.350
and the ability to bring
all of those students

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.820
together regardless
of where they

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.150
are and still interact with
the professor synchronously

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.080
as they need to so they can get
that true face-to-face quality

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.570
of education with the
same learning environment

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.210
even though they're
remoting in online.
