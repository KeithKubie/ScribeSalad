00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.620
Hello, I'm Simon Whistler and your watching the TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.960
And in the video today we're looking at the Great Stink of 1858.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.679
Now, everyone poops and that’s okay.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.520
What’s less okay though is when there’s
nowhere for that poop to go- something people

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.090
in Victorian era London found out first hand
when all of the sewage they’d pumped into

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.020
the Thames dried up and caused a stench that
spurred London’s City Press to note- “Gentility

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.300
of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso
once inhales the stink can never forget it

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.440
and can count himself lucky if he lives to
remember it.”

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.790
To begin with, let’s talk a little about
the Thames, or more specifically, all of the

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.470
stuff Victorian Londoners dumped into it.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.050
While the tons of raw, unfiltered sewage was
probably the most noticeable thing being pumped

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.489
into the river, the Thames was also where
waste water from breweries and paper mills,

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.290
refuse from slaughterhouses, and tons of ordinary
household waste ended up being unceremoniously

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.290
dumped.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.200
If you’re wondering why Londoners had been
so short-sighted as to think dumping tons

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.360
of excrement and refuse into a river that
also provided much of their drinking water

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.530
was a good idea, it was generally thought
that since the Thames flowed out into the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.060
sea, all of the things dumped into it would
similarly be swept out to sea where it would

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.000
become Poseidon’s problem.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.640
However, this didn’t exactly work out as
planned.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.960
You see, the Thames is a tidal river, meaning
the tides invariably ended up pushing the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.159
rotted sewage back up river where it collected
and started to turn stagnant.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.380
It was also believed that the water from the
Thames, even when sewage was being dumped

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.930
into it, wasn’t dangerous, but we’ll get
to that in a moment.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.250
Of course the blame couldn’t be placed squarely
on the shoulders of Victorian Londoners because

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.080
it’s noted that pretty much as far back
as anyone can remember, the Thames has been

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.220
used as a place to store human waste.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.670
That said, it’s also noted that as early
as the 17th century people were aware that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.450
the pollution affecting the river was pretty
bad and they still continued to do approximately

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.610
nothing about it for about two centuries straight.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.149
The pollution became a public concern in the
early 19th century when thousands of London

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.790
citizens began connecting their overflowing,
ill-constructed cesspits to London’s many

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.730
surface water drains; basically creating a
system in which tons of raw sewage was not

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.050
only being washed through the streets, but
directly into the city’s main source of

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.230
“clean” water.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.849
For those not dumping their waste into the
streets, another method to avoid cesspits

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.210
filling up too quickly was to simply collect
bodily expulsions and carry them off to be

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.680
dumped into the river.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.129
This, coupled with the industrial revolution,
saw a river that was already known for being

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.560
a bit dirty become one of the most polluted
on Earth.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560
 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.190
This wasn’t without consequence with several
well-known outbreaks of cholera in 1832, 1849

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.959
and 1854.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.090
In regards to the 1849 outbreak, at its peak,
it’s recorded that over 2000 Londoners were

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.810
dying from the disease per week.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.060
The leading theory amongst the majority of
the population at the time was that the illness

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.640
was caused by “bad air” or “miasma”;
while this belief certainly made some people

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.230
avoid going near the stinky river, it didn’t
stop them from drinking the putrid water or

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.930
from contaminated wells.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.030
Enter “the father of epidemiology”, Dr.
John Snow, who came to the surprising conclusion

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.459
that drinking water laced with human excrement
was probably causing people to get sick rather

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.830
than an invisible cloud of filth.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.290
To begin with, Snow reasoned that since cholera
seemed to affect people’s bowels instead

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.390
of their lungs, cholera was probably caused
by something they’d eaten or drank.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.400
After coming to this realisation, Snow quickly
put two and two together and penned a pamphlet

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.530
called, “On the Mode of Communication of
Cholera” in 1849, in which he explicitly

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.920
linked the transmission of cholera to imbibing
of polluted Thames water.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.810
Snow’s theories went largely ignored.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.270
Until, that is, Snow found an unlikely ally
in a reverend called Henry Whitehead who worked

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.459
with Snow to map out where in his parish people
had contracted cholera in 1854.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.840
This allowed them to zero in on a single water
pump causing the problem on Broad Street (today,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.129
Broadwick Street), thus confirming that cholera
was somehow linked to tainted water.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.049
It turns out, the well had accidentally been
dug mere feet from a cesspit.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.139
With his research in hand, Snow managed to
convince the local council to disable the

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.139
well pump.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.849
The outbreak stopped almost overnight.

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.939
Despite this, Snow’s theories were still
largely panned and ignored- people didn’t

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:35.580
want to believe they had been causing the
problem and had been inadvertently consuming

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.650
their own filth.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.949
Though Snow’s work was important to the
eventual clean-up of the Thames and the realisation

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.559
that tainted water is kind of dangerous, he
died in July of 1858 and never lived to see

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:47.849
himself proven right.

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.789
Snow’s death coincided almost exactly with
the start of the event that would eventually

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.199
see his theories taken more seriously- The
Great Stink.

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.270
You see, the summer of 1858 in London was
unnaturally warm- so much so that the Thames

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.240
water level dropped significantly, exposing
decades of rotted sewage to the baking Sun.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.229
The resulting smell was so bad that it was
reported at the time to cause people miles

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.129
away to throw up when the wind changed.

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.719
Even the upper echelons of London society
were unable to escape, up to and including

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:25.039
the merry ol’ Queen of England, who famously
had to endure a very brief cruise along the

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.159
Thames with a bouquet of flowers shoved in
her face, before ordering the boat be re-docked

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.349
within minutes of it setting out, so she could
get away from the stench.

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.629
Papers across the country covered the story
with glee, dubbing it “The Great Stink”.

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:43.629
The most deserving people forced to endure
the noxious fumes of decades of scorched fecal

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:48.499
matter, however, were undoubtedly members
of Parliament, who for many years repeatedly

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:54.119
ignored pleas from their subjects to do something-
anything- about the pollution in the river.

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:58.629
For instance, Charles Dickens had stated in
his Little Dorrit novel, that the Thames was

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.449
“a deadly sewer … in the place of a fine,
fresh river.”

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.439
He later stated in a letter to a friend about
the Great Stink, “I can certify that the

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:12.039
offensive smells, even in that short whiff,
have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.039
nature.”

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.309
Legendary English scientist Michael Faraday
openly criticised the government for letting

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:22.689
the Thames become so filthy in his open letter
entitled “Observations on the Filth of the

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.499
Thames” published in 1855 in The Times newspaper.

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:31.169
In it he noted, “Near the bridges the feculence
rolled up in clouds so dense that they were

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.809
visible at the surface, even in water of this
kind.

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:39.409
… The smell was very bad, and common to
the whole of the water; it was the same as

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.930
that which now comes up from the gully-holes
in the streets; the whole river was for the

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.199
time a real sewer.”

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.849
He went on to (apparently) look into his crystal
ball and note that,

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.919
“if we neglect this subject, we cannot expect
to do so with impunity; nor ought we to be

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:59.719
surprised if, ere many years are over, a hot
season give us sad proof of the folly of our

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:00.719
carelessness.”

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:04.879
Faraday’s prescient observation wasn’t
lost on critics who after the Great Stink

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:05.879
noted:

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:10.800
“In 1855, the condition of the Thames appalled
the eminent scientist but three years later,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.339
in 1858, the hottest summer on record reduced
it to a state in which it offended a more

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:21.499
influential body: the politicians whose recently
rebuilt houses of Parliament stood upon its

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:22.499
banks.

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:26.520
This proximity to the source of the stench
concentrated their attention on its causes

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.429
in a way that many years of argument and campaigning
had failed to do…’”

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:35.009
Indeed, the recently constructed Parliament
building MPs held meetings in just so happened

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:37.300
to border the foul smelling river.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.789
The underlying problem could no longer be
ignored by the government.

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:42.149
But they tried.

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:46.349
Initially, beyond the predictable “not my
jurisdiction,” responses from individual

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:50.809
politicians in response to letters from the
citizens of London, MPs tried coating the

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:55.550
curtains to the rooms they held meetings in
in chloride of lime to quell the stench.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.590
When that didn’t work, they tried to move
the seat of government to nearby Oxford- out

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.589
of sight, out of mind once again.

00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:05.999
This attempt was ultimately shot down as they’d
just spent a fortune building a brand new

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:08.189
building that they had to use.

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:12.629
True to a form that would make politicians
from any era proud, it wasn’t until thousands

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:16.879
of pounds (in 19th century money) had been
spent fruitlessly trying to mask the smell

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:21.789
by spreading yet more chloride of lime over
the exposed sewage that a bill was proposed

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:24.119
to fix the underlying problem.

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:28.039
As proof of how fast government can work when
it’s about an issue that actually has some

00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:32.399
impact on the life of those in power, after
years of ignoring complaints about the Thames,

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:37.510
a sweeping bill authorising £3 million to
“refurbish the entirety of the River Thames,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:42.159
was created, passed, and signed into law”
in a matter of a few weeks once the stench

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.159
began bothering Parliament.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.959
NPG x646; Sir Joseph William BazalgetteThe
man put in charge of the refurbishment was

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:50.769
Joseph Bazalgette, who two years before had
drawn up a detailed plan for fixing the problem

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:52.399
of sewage in the Thames.

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:57.520
The famed civil engineer’s design not only
included a system of sewers and means of supplying

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.420
fresh water to the city, but also proposed
a series of embankments along the river to

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.660
help it flow more smoothly in order to prevent
future build-ups of waste.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.890
The effect of Bazalgette’s sewerage system
was felt almost immediately, with the death

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.389
toll across London dropping rapidly.

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:18.300
In the 20 years it took to finish construction,
London suffered only one more cholera outbreak

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.790
that was limited to a small area of the city
in 1866 that had yet to be connected to the

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.790
new system.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:30.550
Bazalgette’s system was so remarkably well-designed
that it is still in use today, thanks in part

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.910
to Bazalgette’s tremendous forward planning.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.800
For example, after working out exactly how
wide London’s sewers would need to be to

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.509
support its population, Bazalgette went right
ahead and made them twice as big, knowing

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:44.370
that as London grew, it would need the additional
space.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.090
It’s noted that if Bazalgette hadn’t done
this, “London’s drainage system would

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.890
have been overwhelmed by the 1950s”.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:55.850
For his service to the country and for constructing
a sewerage system that saved countless lives,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.699
and more importantly stopped all of London
smelling like, well, crap, Bazalgette was

00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:14.579
knighted in 1875.
