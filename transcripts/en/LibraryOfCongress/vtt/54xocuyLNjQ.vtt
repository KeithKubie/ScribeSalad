00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:10.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.950
&gt;&gt; Susan Vita: Good evening and
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.370 position:56%
I'm Susan Vita, the Chief of the
Music Division, and we are delighted

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.020
to gather tonight for another
presentation in a series of lecture

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.100
that we co-sponsor with the
American Musicological Society.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.950
The Music Divisions
collections include more

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.750
than 20 million items related
to music, theater and dance.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.520
Collections that draw researchers
from all over the world in search

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.320
of rare and unique material.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.890
This lecture series affords
society members the opportunity

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.920
to share research that
stems directly

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.680
from their own work
in our collections.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.830
And since beginning the series
in 2008, we've been treated

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.250
to a fascinating -- to fascinating
papers on a wide array of topics

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.260
and composers from Beethoven
to Ruth Crawford Seeger

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.920 position:56%
to Irving Berlin to Louis Armstrong.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.780
Tonight we will here from
Dr. Banagale and learn more

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.960
about the ever popular Rhapsody in
Blue composed by George Gershwin

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.060
and arranged by Ferde Grofe.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.870
The Music Division is fortunate to
hold the papers of both Gershwin

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.480
and Grofe together documenting
the creative process behind an

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.740
iconic work.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.150
Again, I welcome those of you here
tonight to the Madison Building

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.890
as well as those of you who will
watch the lecture via the Library

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.300
of Congress Youtube channel.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.530
The performing arts
reading room is home

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.890
to the Music Division located
just downstairs from us

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.840
on the first floor of
the Madison Building.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.520
It is our great hope that these
lectures will inspire others

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820
in the musicological community,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.960
especially young scholars
beginning their studies and careers

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.720
to visit the Library of Congress
and explore the great riches

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.340
of our collections first hand.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.750 position:56%
Those of you who might be interested

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:35.370 position:56%
in giving future lectures can either
see staff at the outside of the room

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.010
and out there or can
contact us directly,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.220
and we can let you
know how you do that.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.830
For your information, the
book being discussed tonight,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.770
Arranging Gershwin, is on sale here
just outside the Montpelier Room

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.620
and a book signing will
follow the lecture.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.010
And now before we hear
from Dr. Banagale,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.620
I would like to introduce Dr.
Ellen T. Harris, Professor Emeritus

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.700
from Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and President

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.210
of the American Musicological
Society

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:20.750
who will offer greetings
from the Society.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.550
Ellen.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.340
&gt;&gt; Ellen T. Harris: Thank you, Sue.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.440
For many members of the
American Musicological Society,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.140 position:56%
the Music Division of the Library of
Congress is a home away from home.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.210
It is a privilege and
a pleasure for scholars

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.600
to work in these collections.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.710
Music historians are
indebted to the Library

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.450
and the Music Division not only

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.080
for making their rare materials
available for study but also

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.800
as co-sponsors with the
AMS of this lecture series,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.790
which provides the opportunity
for us to share the riches

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.990
of these collections
with a wider public.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.900
Tonight's lecture, the
first to be scheduled

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.930 position:56%
in the lovely Montpelier Room -- and
I do hope if you've not been here

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.640
that you look out the
window before you go

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.200
where they haven't
drawn the curtains

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.940
yet of the Madison Building.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.630
This is the 16th in the
ongoing sequence of lectures.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.910
Our speaker tonight is Ryan
Banagale, an Assistant Professor

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.180
of Music at Colorado College
where he offers classes

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.830
on American music topics
including musical theater, jazz,

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.360
popular music and media studies.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.600
He received his Ph.D. at
Harvard University in 2011

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.360
with a dissertation
on the arrangements

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.290
of George Gershwin's
Rhabsody in Blue.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.590
This research was supported

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.720
by the American Musicological
Society's AMS 50

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.470
and Howard Mayer Brown fellowships.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.770
In the fall of 2014,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.920
Oxford University Press
published his first book titled,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.460 position:56%
Arranging Gershwin, Rhapsody in Blue
and the Creation of an American Icon

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.830
with support from AMS 75 PAYS
Publication [inaudible] award.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.980
His scholarly articles appear in
such journals as Jazz Perspectives,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.970
and the Journal of the
Society for American Music.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.580
He currently sits on
the editorial board

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.430
of the George Gershwin
Critical Edition

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.280
and is almost finished
editing the first

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.750
of four separate arrangements
of Rhapsody in Blue.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.260
In his spare time -- I just love
that -- that was his phrase.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.980
In his spare time, he is co-host
of the monthly radio program,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.420 position:56%
Critical Karaoke, a show about music
and the ideas it inspires as well

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.330 position:56%
as a regular contributor to Critical
Karaoke's daily two minute modules,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.350
a day in the life.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.570
Both programs can be accessed
at criticalkaraoke.com

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.570
or as a podcast from iTunes.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.690
Tonight, Professor
Banagale will talk to us

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.170
about the compositional
history of Gerswhin's Rhapsody

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.650
in Blue using documents from the
Music Division of the Library

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.640
of Congress to discuss the
musical genesis of the composition

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.340
and it's continuing adaptations

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.730
and arrangements while
illuminating the significant role

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.320
of musicians beyond Gershwin
in the lifespan of this work.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.080
His paper is entitled The Ongoing
Composition of Rhapsody in Blue.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.510
Please help me welcome
Ryan Banagale.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:30.010
[ Applause ]

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.740
&gt;&gt; Ryan Raul Banagale:
Thank you very much.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.990
It is really wonderful to
be back here in Washington,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.760
D.C. as President Harris mentioned.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.630
The Library of Congress really is
a home away from home for a lot

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.660 position:56%
of us musicologists, especially the
ones that work in the holdings here.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.840
This is actually part of what's
almost become an annual pilgrimage

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.140
to Library of Congress.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.100 position:56%
So thank you all so much for joining
me here this evening for the talk.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.870
Before I begin my remarks, I'd like
to offer a few acknowledgements.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.280
First, thank you President
Ellen Harris

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.390
and the American Musicological
Society

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.130
for not only making
this lecture possible

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.870
but for supporting this
research in numerous forms,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.970
much of which you heard about
during her introduction.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.400
None of this research
would have happened

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.410
without the incredible staff of
the Music Division in the Library

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.710 position:56%
of Congress over the course of many,
many years and it's nice to see

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.750
so many faces out here that I've
worked with in the collecions.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.490
Susan Vita became chief of the
vision just as it's research began.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.460
And I'm particularly indebted
to the efforts and observations

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.860
and insights of Mark
Horowitz and Raymond White.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.160
Thank you also to Kate
Miller and Nick Brown

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.670
for their assistance organizing
and producing tonight's event.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.830
I'd also like to publicly
thank Colorado College,

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.400
my home institution, for
making additional research

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.240
in the Music Division possible.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.860
I'd like to thank the Bernstein
office for granting me permission

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.570
to share some of the images and
music that you'll see tonight.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.590
And also Alfred Publishing and
the state of George Gershwin

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.320 position:56%
for additionally granting permission
for me to share these images

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.330
with you and for supporting
my scholarship as a whole.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.110
Those of us that work with music

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.790
under copyright are particularly
aware of the potential pitfalls

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.280
of working with the states.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.630 position:56%
And I've been fortunate to have the
support of the George Gershwin heirs

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.480
who at no time challenged
my general thesis

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.780
or approach to Rhapsody in Blue.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.060
And actually, I have to admit to
you, it isn't really my thesis

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.500
but rather one that I've
borrowed from Leonard Bernstein.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.160
A little over 60 years ago in
1955, Bernstein published an essay

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.640
in the Atlantic titled,
A Nice Gershwin Tune."

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.560
Within this essay, he declares
that Rhapsody in Blue is

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.860
"not a composition at all."

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.270
Now, I'll explain in greater
detail what I think he meant

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.920
by that later in my talk.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.900
But for the moment, I want
to also declare that Rhapsody

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.430
in Blue is not a composition.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.130
It is an arrangement, and
as I hope to convince you,

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.580
it has been an arrangement
from it's origins

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.250
and it remains an arrangement
in the present day.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.680
The version of Rhapsody in Blue
that you were listening to prior

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.430
to the start of my talk which
featured Leonard Bernstein

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.530 position:56%
as pianist -- he was also
conducting the New York Philharmonic

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.640
from the piano -- this
is also an arrangement.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.970
Well, technically it's an
arrangement of an arrangement.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.120
But I'll explain that to you
a little bit later in my talk.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.510
The point I want to make
clear here at the outside is

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.500
that I consider arrangement
to be a form of composition.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.710
As such, the compositional history
of Rhapsody in Blue emerges only

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.810
over the course of time and
through the contributions

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.970
of a multitude of musicians.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.480
Specifically, arrangers.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.220
And it's through this
process of arrangement

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.530 position:56%
that the Rhapsody has secured it's
iconic standing in American culture.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.270
Without arrangers including first

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.650
and foremost a man named Ferde
Grofe, without arrangers,

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:44.250 position:56%
whose to say that we would have ever
even heard about Rhapsody in Blue?

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.200
Now, if that question is a bit
dubious to you, don't worry.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.500
You're in good company.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.950
George Gershwin himself would
have been doubtful as well.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.320 position:56%
So in the board room of the American
Society of Authors, Composers

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.640
and Publishers which is more
commonly referred to as ASCAP,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.790
hang framed letters from
it's notable members.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.900
One of these letters from George
Gershwin to J. C. Rosenthall,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.670
the general manager of ASCAP
is where my story begins.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:18.030
In August of 1928, George
Gershwin wrote, "Mr. Jerome Kern

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.210
at lunch the other day
brought to my attention

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.200
that Ferde Grofe had listed among
his compositions The Rhapsody

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.570
in Blue.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.880 position:56%
Mr. Kern said he objected to this at
the last meeting and he advised me

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.810
to write to you about it.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.260
Mr. Grofe made a very
fine orchestration

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.990
from my completed sketch

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.350
but certainly had no
hand in the composing."

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.000
And just above the
salutation, he adds,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.300
"Hoping you will straighten
this out."

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.190
Now, over the course of the
last 80 years, various critics

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.210
and scholars have attempted
to straighten out the extent

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.930
of Grofe's contributions
to the piece.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.580
We know that Gershwin did not
orchestrate Rhapsody in Blue due

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.730
to time constraints,
inexperience, convention

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.600
or some combination thereof.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.590
Rather, the task felled to Ferde
Grofe who was the primary arranger

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.680
for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.530
And the Paul Whiteman Orchestra,
of course, is the ensemble

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.970
that premiered Rhapsody in
Blue on February 12, 1924.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.840
Whiteman's ensemble was neither a
typical symphonic orchestra nor a

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.460
standard jazz band.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.650
Each of the three reed
players, for example,

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.250
doubled on a multitude
of instruments.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.660
Ross Gorman who performed the
infamous opening clarinet glissando

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.410
and swoop also played
obo, base clarinet,

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.330
alto saxophone and
sopranino saxophone.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.560
The other two reed players
rotated between baritone, tenor,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.040
alto and soprano saxiphones.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.710 position:56%
Additionally, Whiteman's ensemble
featured two trumpets and trombones,

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.550
a tuba player that also
played the string bass.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.590
There was a pianist,
a celeste player,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.600
a banjo player and a percussionist.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.280
For the premiere of
Rhapsody in Blue,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.360
the ensemble also added four
additional violins as well

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.850
as two French horns and the
photo that you're seeing here

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.090
on the screen was taken
just prior to the premere

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.830
of Rhapsody in Blue in 1924.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.720
Now given the complexity
of the Whiteman Orchestra,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.150
it should not be surprising

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.430
that Gershwin did not
orchestrate the original version

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.080
of Rhapsody in Blue.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.740
So when the American public
first experienced the Rhapsody,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.690
it was through Ferde
Grofe's arrangement.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.100
Although the role of Grofe in
the initial creative process

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.180
of the Rhapsody has
never been denied,

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.420
the extent of his contributions
to the origins and ongoing life

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.360
of the piece have been sidelined
due to his status as an arranger.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.580
Grofe began arranging Gershwin's
so-called completed sketch

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.450
from a performance by the Whiteman
Orchestra before Gershwin had even

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.260
finished composing it.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.030
As often repeated in historical
literature on the piece,

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.210
Grofe apparently traveled
daily to Gershwin's apartment

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.900
on West 110th Street in
New York City to pick

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.180
up newly composed pages
of the Rhapsody.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.780
The original jazz band version
of Rhapsody in Blue came together

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.000
in this way page by page leading
up to it's much celebrated debut

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.520
at Paul Whiteman's
experiment in modern music.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.370
The completed sketch to which
Gershwin refers in his letter

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:13.240
to ASCAP survives as a 56 page
two piano short score manuscript

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.540
in pencil.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.220
And that's seen here on the screen.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.670
As with all the manuscripts
incorporated into my talk tonight,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.330
it is housed within the Music
Division's holdings here

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.610
at the Library of Congress.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.830
This completed sketch contains 26
specific instrumental assignments

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.370
in a variety of hand and writing
implements that have resulted

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.550
in divided assessments on
Grofe's overall contributions

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.250
to the Rhapsody.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.030
Some scholars such as Howard
Pollack concluded that Grofe

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.790
"scrupulously honored
Gershwin's intentions."

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.660
Others such as Jerome Schwartz

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.380
and Don Reno assigned
greater agency to Grofe.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.420
However, scholars on both
sides of the divide arrived

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.750
at their conclusions under the
assumption that Grofe indeed worked

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.340
from this pencil document.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.360
And I believe that he did not.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.710
Rather, it appears that Grofe
worked from a fair copy manuscript,

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.370
a crucial third source document
that's previously unconsidered

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.650
in literature on Rhapsody in Blue.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:16.410
Seen here, the manuscript is
compiled in ink by various copyists

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.030
as Gershwin completed portions
of this two piano pencil score.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.840
As I will discuss, manuscript
evidence suggests that Grofe worked

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.110
from this fair copy ink manuscript
when he began his arrangement

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.050
of Rhapsody in Blue not
from the pencil manuscript

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.170
as previously believed.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.820
This fair copy ink manuscript
bears only 13 specific instrumental

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.310
assignments and more than
half of these Grofe ignored.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:43.260 position:56%
And that is significant for a work
that contains more than 22,000 notes

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.220
over the course of 500 measures.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.920
Accordingly, with respect to
the original sound of the piece,

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.880
it was seen that Grofe played
a significantly larger role

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.950
in the genesis of the Rhapsody
than previously acknowledged.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.750
So there may indeed be merit

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.850
to arrange Ferde Grofe's
compositional claims.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:05.010
As a means of exploring this
claim, I want to introduce

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.050
to you this evening this new fair
copy document and it's situated

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.260
between the two known Rhapsody
in Blue source manuscripts.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.390 position:56%
Gershwin's aforementioned two piano
pencil score and Grofe's arrangement

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.130
for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.900
And from this point
forward, I'm going to refer

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.030
to these documents using
the nicknames given

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.170
in figure one of your handout.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.460
That is, pencil for the
original pencil manuscripts

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.930
in George Gershwin's hand, ink
for this fair copy manuscript

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.230
and then Grofe Whiteman

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.890
for the orchestral score
that Grofe prepared.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.720
The previously unconsidered
ink fair copy manuscript serves

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.480
as an intermediary document.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.100
It provides a snapshot of the
Rhapsody in the midst of creation.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.380 position:56%
So considering these three documents
side by side sheds new light

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.890
on the complex and creative process
that ultimately brought Rhapsody

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.890
in Blue to the concert hall.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.040
And before we delve into this any
further, I'd also like to mention

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.070
that I'm going to be referring
to different melodic themes found

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.020
within Rhapsody in Blue by the
names that are listed in figure two

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.900 position:56%
of your handout and provided a
little [inaudible] different melodic

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.200
lines there.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.180
As a refresher, should we
sing through those real quick?

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.610
Dare we? Let me get my copy.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.510
So, the first them, the [inaudible]
theme, this is the opening theme.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.800
[ Singing ]

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.440
Okay. The next theme
is the strive them.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.240
It goes --

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.100
[ Singing ]

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.510
The train theme is --

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.100
[ Singing ]

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.650
That kind of sounds like a train.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.510
The shuffle theme.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:46.900
[ Singing ]

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.180
That was one of Bernstein's
favorites.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.640
We'll get back to that.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.510
Then there's the famous
andantino love theme.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.040
[ Singing ]

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.220
And then of course the tag
which also sounds a little bit

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.510
like good evening friends.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.690
[ Singing ]

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.050
So those are the main themes.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.350
So we'll come back to those.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.340
But you want to keep that
handy because I'll just refer

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.890
to these by their name here.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.710
And these names are given by
David Schiff who wrote a handbook

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.760
on Rhapsody in Blue
in the late 1990's.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.530
So over the course of
the past 20 to 30 years,

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.940
the ink fair copy manuscript
has been the most accessible

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.160
of the manuscripts located within
the Music Division archives.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.200
Here we see a picture of the
manuscript in a publicity photo

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.910
of Ferde Grofe taken in 1967.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:43.160
The document remained in Grofe's
possession until his death in 1972

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.610
and eventually arrived at the
Library of Congress in two stages.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.970
And it can now be found in
the Ferde Grofe collection.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.030
Most of the pages in ink
score have been separated.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.520
However, they can be reconstructed
into distinct groupings as seen

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.010
on figure three of your
handout and for those of you not

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.960
in the musicological world,
groupings basically is a set

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.590 position:56%
of nested pages of manuscript paper.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.680
So we can take two or three
pages and put them together

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.980
and see how they line up.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.640
We can see the groupings are the
size of the passages of music

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.660
that Gershwin was handing
off to Grofe

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.980
when he was passing music along.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.530
From a compositional
standpoint, passing along a copy

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.190 position:56%
of the score rather then an original
pencil manuscript makes a great deal

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.490
of sense.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.170
It seems questionable
that Gershwin would want

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.560
to continue composing the
Rhapsody without being able

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.670
to reference what he
had already written.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.290
But for some reason no one seems
to ever question this aspect

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.490
of the Rhapsody's creation
story until now.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.570
One story that has been told about
the creation of the Rhapsody time

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.440
and time again is that
George Gershwin had forgotten

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.720
about his commission from
the Paul Whiteman Orchestra

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.870
until his older brother Ira
Gershwin pointed out a news item

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.590
about the supposed jazz concerto
that Gershwin was writing

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:56.740
in a New York Herald Tribune
article on January 4, 1924.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.540
Now this article on January 4
apparently spurned George Gershwin

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.210
into action.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.290
Based on this, most scholas
agree that the date at the top

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:09.410
of the pencil manuscript, January
7, 1924 indicates the start

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.540
of Gershwin's work on the Rhapsody
as opposed to his completion.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.290
Since Grofe's full manuscript

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.180
for the Whiteman Orchestra bears
a February 4 date of completion,

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.470
received wisdom is that it took
slightly less than four weeks

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.990
to compose Rhapsody in Blue
once pen was put to paper.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.350
The ink manuscript, however,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.160
suggests an even more
compressed compositional timeline.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.820 position:56%
The first grouping of ink manuscript
seen here on the screen corresponds

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.270
to measures one through 29 or
the introduction of the Rhapsody

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.370
until just before the start
of the first piano cadenza.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.860
Although many that are here tonight
are familiar with the Rhapsody,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.350
here's what this first
grouping sounds

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.040
like in it's original
1924 arrangement.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.000
It's a very different
sound world than that

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.120
of the more ubiquitous
symphonic arrangement.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:21:21.090
[ Music ]

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.700
So that's the first grouping.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.260
Now, if we look at
Gershwin's pencil score,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.910
we see that this opening
passage is the most fully flushed

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.890
out of the entire manuscript.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.900
There are instrumental assignments
for the melody, articulation

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.290
and accent markings throughout

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.490
and dynamic specified
for individual lines.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.560
Gershwin dutifully wrote out staves
for the presence of both the piano

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.680
and the jazz band even though he
ultimately only employed the piano

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.880
in the -- I'm sorry, only
employed the jazz band

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.690
in the first three systems.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.770
Such care suggests
greater attention paid

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.570
and perhaps greater time allotted
to these opening passages.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:01.050 position:56%
Accordingly, the ink score for these
first 29 measures appears almost

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.960
identical to the pencil score
from which it was copied.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:09.780
Now if Gershwin did indeed begin to
notate Rhapsody in Blue on Monday,

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.370
January 7 as the pencil score
indicates, his progress appears

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.560
to have been interrupted just
a few days later by other work,

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.830
namely Sweet Little Devil,

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.210
a new musical for which
he had composed the score.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.760 position:56%
Now, Sweet Little Devil had
previously been named A Perfect Lady

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.990
and had completed it's out of
town tryout run in Boston later

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:32.630
that same week either on
the 10th or 11th of January.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.940
Somewhere between that
show's Broadway run and --

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.590
I'm sorry, somewhere
between the show's Boston run

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.240
and ti's Broadway premiere some ten
days later the opening sequences

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.080
for the second and third acts were
rewritten, and Gershwin contributed

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.010
at least two new songs
to this effort

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.600
and possibly provided
additional dance material

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.540
for the dance sequences as well.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.670
And we don't know exactly when
this additional music was written,

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.740
but if Gershwin did take time
away from Rhapsody in Blue to tend

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.620
to the opening preparations of his
musical even just for a few days,

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.620
upon his return to the
Rhapsody the pressure

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.470
to compose quickly would
have been even greater.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:11.070 position:56%
Such haste appears to be
documented in the pencil manuscript.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.620
We see a clear shift in Gershwin's
notation between the careful outlay

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.760
of music in the first
grouping and that

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.930
which followed in the
second grouping.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.740
When Gershwin returns to his
notation of Rhapsody in Blue,

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.370
he began with what became
the first piano cadenza.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.970
It started out confidently
enough, and then Gershwin appears

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.610
to have struggled with
exactly how to proceed.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.000
He notes a rapid chromatic ascent
in the right hand of the piano

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.640
over repeated pedal bass and
this dramatic segway leads

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.490
to the re-emergence of the
opening [inaudible] theme played

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.720
by a fortissimo marked
and jazzy full ensemble.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.180
As you can see, Gershwin
crossed this out.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.500
He opted for a more subtle
pianissimo conclusion

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.150
to the first piano credenza.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.480
And this leads into the first piano
statement of the [inaudible] theme

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.980
so instead of having the jazz band
come in full on at the beginning

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.060
of the piece, he has a
piano introduce the theme

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.690
for the first time instead.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.990
Now given that Gershwin
seems to have had little plan

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.180
as to what would be coming next,
it should come as no surprise

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.970
that Ferde Grofe was
in the same boat.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.030
Grofe's full score manuscript of
the Rhapsody bears the markings

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.870
of an experienced and
methodical orchestrator even

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.810
at this relatively early
stage in his career.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.860
Grofe laid out his
staff systems prior

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.500
to entering any music
on a given page.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.240
Instruments and brackets
were done in ink first,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.400
and then he added evenly
spaced measure lines in pencil.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.980
And it was only after
taking these steps

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.340
that he began to enter the music.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.990
As mentioned previously,
the first grouping

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.480
of the ink manuscript represents
the first 29 measures of Rhapsody

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.730
in Blue and Grofe likely scored
through these rather quickly.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.620
On the screen here, we
see measures 23 through 28

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.900
of his full score a
little bit obscured

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.310
by the reflections off the
hermetically sealed plastic

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:02.050
enclosure that was put around
it during preservation process.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.440
Now, eager to continue, you
can see on the next page

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.190
of Grofe's manuscripts that he had
prenotated systems and bar lines

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.530
for the continued presence
of the full ensemble.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.220
And these have been erased.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.770
You can see the erase
lines that are faded there

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.120
between the darker black lines.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.720
The double bar line that you
see there, the two lines,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.250
that represents the end of grouping
one and the start of grouping two.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.090
So when Grofe received the
second grouping of the ink score

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.920
which began with the piano cadenza
instead of the continued presence

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.390
of the full orchestra, he had to
remeasure his page accordingly

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.380
to make room for the plethora
of arpeggios that unfolds

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.970
at the outside of that
first piano cadenza.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.940
And this is not the only
such instance where Grofe had

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.540
to rebar a section of the Rhapsody
because of an unexpected change

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.940
between groups received
from Gershwin.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.280
Another example can be found
at the end of grouping three

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.290
of the ink manuscript which
corresponds to page 25

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.480
of the Grofe Whiteman score.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.550
Once again, we see the
erasure of prenoted bar lines

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.670
to accommodate the start
of a piano cadenza.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.500
I'd like to turn my attention here
to a little bit closer examination

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.100
of this third grouping because it
holds a great deal of information

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.470
about the genesis of Rhapsody in
Blue including further evidence

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.490
that Grofe used this ink
manuscript as well as evidence

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:20.340
about the compressed
compositional timeline.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.170
At least four different hands, at
least four different people writing

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.940
in the manuscript can be
found in this ink score.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.620
And you can look at
figure four on your handout

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.410
or the slide on the screen.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.250
Each scribal hand, each musician
who is copying this ink score

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.040
from the pencil manuscript
had a distinguishable method

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.140
of forming note heads, clefts,
accidentals and letters.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.180
The first change in copy
[inaudible] directly

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.990
onto the first and second grouping.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.430
The second copyist appears
on the start of grouping two

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.150
and it continues on to the
first page of grouping three.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.590
Then all of a sudden at the bottom
of the first page of grouping three

00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.380
in the middle of a new theme,
right there highlighted in blue,

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.300
music notated by Gershwin
suddenly appears.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.950
The clearest indication we have
of this change is in addition

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.990
to the change of pen are the shapes
of the note heads and flat signs

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.580
as well as a loosening
of the vertical alignment

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.610
between and within the staffs.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.700
Now, given the constraints under
which Gershwin composed Rhapsody

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.070
in Blue, it's curious that
he took time away to copy

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.610
out this portion of
the score on his own.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.320
I believe that Gershwin did this
because he was under pressure

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.890 position:56%
to deliver additional pages to Grofe

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:33.810
and he'd only just completed
composing this passage himself.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.700
Gershwin's notation begins in
the middle of the appearance

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.380
of the stride theme
where the descending line

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.170
in the base cleft moves
it into the subdominant.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.300
Assuming that the copyists
that have been working

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.270
with him had copied all available
music prior to taking a break,

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.720
this implies this particular
theme remained uncompleted

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.650
by Gershwin at the time.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.100
And so Gershwin appears himself to
have taken a break in the middle

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.040
of writing the stride theme.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.470
The pencil score supports
this supposition as well.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.320 position:56%
You can see in there a slight yet
visible shift in the pencil notation

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.120
that suggests Gershwin
indeed returned

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.660
to complete the stride
theme at a later point.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.370 position:56%
Now, Gershwin appears to have
crafted portions of Rhapsody in Blue

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.020
to avoid cliches of typical
jazz band arrangements.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.260
Such cliches from this time period
include the standard unfolding

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.940
of verse and refrain with
minimal development of the themes.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.770
And it attempts to break this kind
of -- and attempt to put in rather,

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.710
a set of compositional variations
occurs at this very moment

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:33.500
where Gershwin took a break from
completing the stride theme.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.950
Up to this point throughout
the first eight measures

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.660
or so of the theme, it resembles
a standard what we call an AABA

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.960
[inaudible] song form.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.560
That is, we have the
first four measures

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.490
and then the next four measures
are repeated so it's kind

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:50.570
of the same thing, A
then A and then this is

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.130
where he takes the break right
at the end of that red box there.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.160
He begins sort of what
becomes the B theme.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.500
Now, instead of repeating
the A theme after the B theme

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.090
as we would expect
in an AABA song form,

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.910
Gershwin takes a little
bit of a detour.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.220
The rhythmic post and block
chord melody that's heard

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.830
in this A theme evaporates into
a thrice repeating linking theme.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.130
See that here.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.150
One, two and three.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:22.580
And then this is punctuated by
four chords and a simple crash.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.880
I'm going to play this
for you in a minute

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.580
so you can hear what
I'm talking about.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.740 position:56%
But the most important point here is

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.430 position:56%
that these compositional choices
result in an ellision, an avoidance,

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:35.590
of standard [inaudible] song form
and they move the piece forward

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.450
with a rhapsodic finesse
so to speak.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.510
So here's what this
passage sounds like.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:51.090
[ Music ]

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.890
Here's the B section.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:30:16.120
[ Music ]

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.890
And then a cymbal crash there is

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.700
where you would take the
78 rpm record and flip it

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.180
over for the second
half of the recording.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.310
Now, a small yet revealing
moment in this portion

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.750
of the third gathering provides an
important piece of written evidence

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.620
in support of my argument
that Grofe depended

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.530
on the ink score rather
then the pencil score.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.440
In the midst of transferring
music from the pencil

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.360
to the ink manuscript for this
portion of Rhapsody in Blue,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.180
Gershwin introduced
various revisions.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.200
Other copyists involved
in the preparation

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.260
of the ink score did
not revise such.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.950
So consider for example
a modification

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.520
that occurs at measure 145.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.020
This measure links
the A and B sections

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.470
of the so-called shuffle theme and
in pencil manuscript you see here,

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.970
the transition consists only
of a D7, a dominant 7 D chord

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.760 position:56%
and the treble cleft on the first
beat, and it's followed by this kind

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.160
of ascending eighth note
scale on the base cleft.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.920
If you look at the ink manuscript,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.700
you can see that Gershwin added
three ascending eighth note diads

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.490
to the treble cleft.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.720
These notes subsequently become
a brief trumpet [inaudible]

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.590
in the Grofe Whiteman score.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.250
Had Grofe been working from the
pencil manuscript rather then the

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.590
fair copy ink manuscript
at this point,

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.170
no such [inaudible] would have
appeared in his final score

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.470
for the Whiteman Orchestra.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:43.960
Additionally, Grofe mentions in
an interview from the early 1960's

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.060
that such a fair copy
manuscript was in use.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.600
Grofe stated that at some point
in the process the preparation

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.230
of his fair copy manuscript
became impractical because

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.040
"time was getting short."

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.120
I'd like to pause over
Grofe's observation

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.570
that time was getting short and
return to my proposal that Rhapsody

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:06.000
in Blue was composed even more
rapidly then previously considered.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.590
Although we cannot conclusively
align particular passages

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.770
or groupings with specific dates,
a comparison between the pencil,

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:15.110
ink in Grofe Whiteman scores
makes clear that Gershwin

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:18.870
and as a result Grofe encountered
a lot of starts and stops

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.510
in the process of setting
Rhapsody in Blue down on paper.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.270
I've already suggested that after
Gershwin began notating Rhapsody

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:29.600
in Blue on January 7 that he got
as far as page 3 before attending

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.970
to the premiere of
Sweet Little Devil.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:36.100
Assuming a return to work after
his Broadway premiere on the night

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.230
of January 21, Gershwin would
have had only seven days

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.750
to work before traveling to Boston
for a recital with Eva Gauthier

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.420
on the evening of Tuesday,
January 29.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.390
Now, it's possible that Gershwin's
impending departure prompted the

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.380
appearance of his hand
in that ink manuscript

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.730
in that section that
I just showed you.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.440
And this also might coincide
with Grofe's subsequent demand

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.460
that he stop waisting time
with a fair copy manuscript.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.920
Irregardless of what point
on the timeline Grofe began

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.060
to use the pencil manuscript
instead of the ink manuscript,

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.710
they were both clearly feeling
pressure to compose the Rhapsody

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.170
in Blue and complete it
before it's premiere.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.920
The third and final public
rehearsal for Whiteman's experiment

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.910
in modern music took place on
February 5, exactly one week

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.470
after Gershwin's recital in Boston.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.600
So by my estimation, Rhapsody
in Blue was created in less

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.950
than 14 days, about half as
long as we previously assumed.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:31.410
If Grofe's recollection is correct,

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.900
then copying out the ink
score became impractical.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.390
It would explain the sudden
end of Gershwin's notation

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.390
in the ink score of measure 174.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.190
The blue box here on
the screen shows you

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:44.530 position:56%
where the new copyist takes over and
Gershwin's hand leaves the document.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:48.510
It seems that whenever Gershwin was
feeling particularly short on time

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.390
that he inserted a piano
solo or a piano cadenza.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.550
We see this every single time
there's a break in the groupings

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.920
or a break in the compositional
process

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.320
where he gets stuck,
he starts a piano solo.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.620
So the next time you
listen to Rhapsody in Blue

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.670
and you hear a piano cadenza
begin, you can think, "Oh,

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:02.990
I know why Gershwin did that.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.290
He was pressed for time."

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:09.460 position:56%
Now, this cadenza marks the onset of
142 consecutive bars of piano solo

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.970
with little instrumental
accompaniment for Grofe to score.

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.220
Clearly, it became more
practical for Grofe just to work

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:18.860
from the pencil manuscript as the
premiere date drew ever closer.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.410
So contrary to previous assumptions
for at least the first 175 measures

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.150 position:56%
of Rhapsody in Blue, Gershwin worked

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.920
from the ink score rather
then the pencil manuscript.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.730 position:56%
Given that only 13 instrumental
indications appear in these measures

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.690
and that Grofe chose
to ignore half of them,

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.590
manuscript evidence suggests that
he was responsible for a majority

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:41.690
of the scoring choices made in
the first third of his piece.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.280
This level of independence
persists even after measure 175,

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.660
the point at which Grofe
began to use the pencil score.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.100
With the exception of a
single solo horn line,

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.160
Gershwin provided no
further indication

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.370
of instruments from
this point forward.

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.060
So, why does all this matter?

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.810
If Grofe indeed scored the Rhapsody
with a significantly greater degree

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.040
of independence then
previously assumed,

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.990
we can more directly address how a
selection of specific instruments

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.370
and the implementation of other
jazz band arranging techniques

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.340
transformed Gershwin's
so-called completed sketch

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.590
into a fully fledged
musically engaging composition.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.480
In his landmark study
on Fletcher Henderson,

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:25.810
musicologist Jeffrey McGee
states that "like a composer,

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:30.300
an arranger gives original shape
to a piece of music creating unity

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.940
and contrast through a
variety of musical elements

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.350
like an improvising
soloist," McGee continues,

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.070 position:56%
"an arranger takes existing material
and uses it as the framework

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.940
for a fresh new inception."

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.250
One reality of the
Rhapsody and indeed one

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.970
of his most frequent criticisms is

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.790
that large passages
offer little more

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:53.200
than AABA [inaudible] style tunes.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.510
The decisions that Grofe made
in transitioning the Rhapsody

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.570
from Gershwin's two
piano pencil score

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.460
to the Whiteman arrangement
lends a piece and necessary level

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:05.910
of coherence and unit for
tectural and tamboral variety.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.640
Thinking back to Gershwin's letter
to the general manager of ASCAP,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:14.520
can we define Grofe's role
as akin to that of Gershwin?

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.690
Gershwin's first biographer,
Isaac Goldberg suggested

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:17.990
that he might, that we might.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:21.010
He said, "The contribution of
Grofe was of prime importance.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.820
It is strange indeed that
he was not represented

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.940
on Whiteman's program
as a composer."

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.890
Gershwin, of course, strongly
disagreed with such a notion.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.850
Gershwin stated that, "The ability

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.220
to orchestrate is a
talent completely apart

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.410
from the ability to create.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.290
The world is full of the most
competent orchestrators who cannot

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.620
for the life of them write
four bars of original music."

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:48.060 position:56%
So for Gershwin then, it was the
themes rather then the overall sound

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:52.180
of the rhapsody that
counted as the "composition."

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.530
His perspective to conform to
his experience as a songwriter

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.450
and as a man of the theater.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.750
In Gershwin's estimation,

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.460
it was seen that orchestrators
offer little more than a paint

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.280
by numbers approach, the
casual addition of color

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.560
to a fully outlined work.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.530
However, as the ink manuscript
reveals, Grofe's contributions

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.510
to the Rhapsody were
anything but casual,

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.830
even given the time constraints
under which he worked.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.810
So this prompts an
important question.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.540 position:56%
If Grofe had been a lesser arranger,

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.880
would the Rhapsody had become
the success that it did?

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.670
After all, this is a work that
not only became legendary during

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.130
Gershwin's lifetime
circulating as an arrangement

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:34.020 position:56%
through life performance, recordings
and sheet music, but also as one

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.960
that maintains a standing as one
of the quintessential examples

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.680
of American concert music.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.240
Both the original Whiteman
arrangement and the arrangement

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.480
for symphony orchestra that we are
perhaps more familiar with today,

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.940
both of these arrangements
were prepared by Ferde Grofe.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.570
The decisions that Grofe made in
transitioning Rhapsody in Blue

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.320
from Gershwin's two
piano pencil score

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.500 position:56%
to the Whiteman arrangement lent the
piece necessary level of consistency

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.970
through it's variety,
through it's novelty.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:04.730 position:56%
This variety and novelty is lost in
a subsequent arrangement of Rhapsody

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.720
in Blue for the symphony orchestra.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.820
And some critics feel
that this arrangement,

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.650
that it makes Rhapsody
suffer because of the result

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.890 position:56%
of it's smoothed over orchestration.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.760
Musicologist, David Schiff, for
example, [inaudible] that it

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.940
"obscures the idiomatic colors of
the original Whiteman arrangement."

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.150
Although a degree of sonic
coherence is expected

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.830
of classical symphonic works,
it was the sonic novelty

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.550
of Grofe's scoring upon
which Gershwin relied

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:34.040
when he originally assembled the
various themes of the Rhapsody.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.820
When the novel scoring for the
[inaudible] and [inaudible]

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.050
of the Whiteman ensemble
are removed,

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:40.530
the piece loses a great
deal of momentum,

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.880
particularly in the often
repeated [inaudible] passages.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:48.680
This is lack of sonic interest that
is what encourages the introduction

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.890
of a lot of cuts into modern
performances of Rhapsody in Blue.

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.380
I'd like to use this phenomenon
of cutting and arranging Rhapsody

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.380
in Blue to turn my attention
to one of the most notorious

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.830
or notable interpreters of
Rhapsody in Blue depending

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:06.730
on your perspective,
Mr. Leonard Bernstein.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.060
Now, Rhapsody in Blue owes
much of it's global popularity

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:14.530
and academic insecurity
to Leonard Bernstein.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.590
He engaged with the work
continually over the course

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.540
of his multifaceted career
leaving his interpretive mark

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.670 position:56%
through copious concerts,
broadcasts, recordings and writings.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.780
His 1959 recording of the piece

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.900
with the New York Philharmonic
remains one

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.740
of if not the best known
recordings of the piece.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.590
Yet, it is also an arrangement.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.780
Or rather it's an arrangement
of an arrangement.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.640
It takes Ferde Grofe's
symphonic setting of the Rhapsody

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.670
and introduces various
cuts and tempo alterations.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.410
We heard Bernstein's
recording of the Rhapsody

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.760
in the background prior
to the start of my talk.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.650
But as a means of putting that
performance back in our ears,

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:53.900
I'd like to contrast this with
George Gershwin's own performance.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.340
So we're going to hear
two brief audio examples.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.230
Both excerpts are of the
same solo piano passage,

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.050
the blues derived shuffle theme

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.390
which is located midway
through the Rhapsody.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.500
First you will hear George
Gershwin's piano role performance

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.960
which he recorded in 1927.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.260
This is followed by Bernstein's
own interpretation of passage

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.770
as played on this 1959 recording.

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.510
So first here's Gershwin.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:47.040
[ Music ]

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.070
As you can hear from this example,

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.690
Bernstein interpretation relieves
much of the jazz age energy

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.100
of the Rhapsody as originally
performed by George Gershwin.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.300
Ironically, much of what makes
Bernstein's 1959 recording well

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.400
liked are the very same features
that critics find problematic.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.450
Bernstein's exaggerated
piano performance is sudden

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.780
and dramatic transitions
between passages is elongation

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.540
of particular melodic motifs.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.370
He has constant tempo fluctuations.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:17.790
Despite the fact that Bernstein
introduces various cuts

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:20.650
which have also been criticized,
his recording of Rhapsody

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.470
in Blue lasts four to five minutes
longer than the version of Rhapsody

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.520
in Blue heard at it's premiere
and indeed his recording is one

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.530
of the longer ones on record.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.470
When considering Bernstein
or Rhapsody in Blue, critics

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:36.340
and scholars typically invoke
the same two documents.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:40.510
This well known recording as
well as his 1955 essay titled,

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.810
Hey Nice Gershwin Tune,

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:46.240
which I mentioned very briefly
at the start of my talk.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.970 position:56%
In this essay, Bernstein [inaudible]
on the similarities and differences

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.250
between himself and Gershwin.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.560
It takes the form of
an imaginary dialogue,

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.670
conversation between Bernstein
and his professional manager,

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.160
though both voices are
ultimately Bernstein's.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.470
Professional managers
refer to as PM for short.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:03.770
In the course of their discussion,

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.220
they consider Gershwin's
compositional abilities vis-à-vis

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.820
Rhapsody in Blue.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.920 position:56%
PM tells Bernstein that Gershwin
was "every inch a serious composer."

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.550
But Bernstein cuts him off,
responding in a passage

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.070
that has since become infamous.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:21.120
"Now PM, you know as well as I do

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.970
that Rhapsody is not
a composition at all.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.770
It's a string of separate
paragraphs stuck together

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.370
with a thin paste of
flour and water.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.590
Composing is a very different thing
from writing tunes after all."

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.390
Gershwin aficionados
are quick to point

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.090
out that Bernstein's subsequent
influence on the reception

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.580 position:56%
of Rhapsody in Blue and of Gershwin,
biographer, Howard Pollack,

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.440
suggests that a nice Gershwin
tune is solely the reputation

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.060
of the work particularly since
it directly informed performance

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.990
decisions made by Bernstein's
1959 recording.

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:54.860
In spite of it's tremendous
popularity,

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.350
David Schiff calls this
recording a "crisis

00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:00.390
in the performance
history of the piece."

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.040
As musicologist, Larry
Starr observes,

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.840
such considerations
typically "function as a kind

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.260
of received wisdom or even
party line on Gershwin

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.210
in academically critical circles."

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.090
Upholding this doctrine, however,
assigns a degree of indifference

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.930
to Bernstein where
one does not exist.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.910 position:56%
It also ignores the more complex
relationship that ultimately existed

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:23.680
between Bernstein, Gershwin
and Rhapsody in Blue.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.830
Bernstein's essay did not simply
beget Bernstein's recording nor did

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.070
either represent a hasty
interpretation of the Rhapsody.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:34.980 position:56%
They both resulted from his
multidecade relationship with piece,

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:39.120
a relationship that emerges from
arrangements of Rhapsody in Blue.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.890
From an early age, Bernstein
had a fervent attraction

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.550
to the music of George Gershwin.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.230
He purchased Gershwin's scores.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.430 position:56%
He staged his musicals with friends.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.150
He even attended the 1935
pre-Broadway tryout production

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.690
of Porgy and Bess in Boston
when he was 17 years old.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.570
Throughout it all,
Rhapsody in Blue stands out.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:03.000
It's unclear when he first heard
the Rhapsody, but at the age

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.880
of 13 Bernstein begged
his father for money

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.580
to buy a copy of the sheet music.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.770
Lifelong friend and colleague,
Syd Raymond [assumed spelling] was

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:14.710
with the 13-year-old, Lennie, the
day that he purchased the $2 score.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.910
Syd Raymond who grew
up with Bernstein

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.440
to become a successful Broadway
arranger on his own right,

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.740
he worked with Bernstein
on Westside Story as well

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.150
as several other Bernstein
works including The Mask.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.760
Recalling the day that his friend,
Lennie, purchased the sheet music

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.260
for Rhapsody in Blue,
Raymond stated,

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.480
"We went back to Lennie's
place, and he opened it.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.200
And at sight, he started
to play it because he was

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.110
as you know a prodigious
sight reader.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:40.650
He could read almost
anything immediately."

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.480
But he got to a certain
point, and he said, "You know,

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.080
I wonder why Gershwin
wrote it in this key."

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.300
And then Lennie started
to play it in another key.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.820
Bernstein purchased the solo piano
arrangement of Rhapsody in Blue

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:57.100
that was first published by
Hermes of New York in 1927.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.750
Remarkably, Bernstein's own
copy of the sheet music survives

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:02.990
in the New York Philharmonic
archives.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:10.100
The score shows signs of
frequent and animated use

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.240
through it's Scotch tape binding
repairs and smudged corners

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.100
from repeated page turning.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.170
There's a taunting remark about
Bernstein's sisters scrawled

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:19.480
across the top of the front cover.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:24.070
It says, "Sure B has a
crush on Clarke Gable."

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.340
Although such remarkings remind
us that this document is a product

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.750
of adolescence, annotations
within the sheet music reveal

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.050
that Bernstein's approach

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:36.680
to the Rhapsody was really
anything but juvenile.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.180
Bernstein himself said of his first
experience with the sheet music.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.070
He said, "We went home and we
played it with tears until dawn.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.370
The excitement.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.430
We made our own sort of arrangement
so that we could do it forehand

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:50.190 position:56%
and try to sound like an orchestra."

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:53.470
So pencil markings found within
this manuscript record one

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.060
such possible arrangement.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:59.980
There's 12 sets of brackets
that mark off the solo passages

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.280
from the orchestral passages

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.410
so that the two boys could have
traded the parts back and forth.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:08.170 position:56%
We also see in the score indications
such as [inaudible] where the piano

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:10.040
and the orchestra would
have been played together

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:13.430
in a forehand piano performance.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:16.640
Significantly, solo piano sheet
music that was acquired by the boys

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:21.000
that fateful day contains a pair
of unique cuts that do not appear

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.720
in previous or subsequent
publications of the sheet music.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:28.400
In fact, this 1927 score is
nearly 60 measures shorter

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.760
than the more common two
piano arrangement of Rhapsody

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.670 position:56%
in Blue published by Hermes in 1925.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.830
So when Leonard Bernstein first
learned to play the Rhapsody,

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:39.240
it was with these cuts
firmy in place.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.160
So as a 13-year-old Bernstein
was already experimenting with

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.970
and arranging Rhapsody in
Blue, and this personal copy

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:50.210
of the sheet music documents many
of these musical explorations.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.600
Five years later, during the summer
of 1937, instead of spending time

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.820
at the family's lakehouse
in Sharon, Massachusetts,

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.980
the 18-year-old Bernstein
took a job at Camp Onota,

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.100
a recently established all boys
Jewish camp in the Berkshires.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:10.010
Bernstein was in charge of a cabin
of campers from New York City,

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.070
and he served as a
swimming counselor.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:16.380
Not surprisingly, he also
organized all musical activities,

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.320
staging productions of Gilbert
and Sullivan's Parrots of Penzance

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.640
and Gershwin's Of Thee I Sing.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.110
He formed small musical ensembles,
and he even wrote camp songs.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:31.800
The text of one surviving example
reads as follows, "Onota Camp,

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.510
the end is near and soon we'll
have to say goodbye to you we fear.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.130
Our hearts are sad.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:42.270
Our eyes are damp because we have
to part with you, Onota Camp.

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:44.150
Adon, adieu, and au revoir.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:46.360
Better time we never saw.

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.680
We got the things that
we came here for.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.800
So adon, adieu, auf
wiederschen and au revoir."

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:58.150 position:56%
Bernstein's lighthearted ditty takes
on a more poignant tune, however,

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:59.450
when considered in the context

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:04.280
of George Gershwin's sudden
death that very same summer.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.220
Gershwin died following
emergency surgery

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:10.600
on an undiagnosed brain
tumor on July 11, 1937.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.900
The event had a profound

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.260
and permanent effect
upon the young Bernstein.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:18.650
He later divulged, "The great
tragedy for me, the musical tragedy

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.280 position:56%
of my life is that I never met him."

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.630
And as a side note, today
actually marks the 25th anniversary

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:30.580
of the passing of Leonard
Bernstein in 1990."

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.060
In what appears to be a
tribute to his musical idol,

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.550
Bernstein created his own
arrangement of Rhapsody in Blue,

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.880 position:56%
which is located here in the
archives of the Library of Congress.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.490
This is the cover of the
Schomer's Harmony Tablet

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.170
in which the arrangement
was located.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:50.060
And here are the first and
last pages of the manuscript.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.760 position:56%
Bernstein completed this arrangement
on August 10, 1937, almost one month

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.330
to the day after Gershwin's death.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:00.870
The instrumentation of this
whimsical interpretation

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.250
of the Rhapsody is notable.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.800
In addition to the
expected piano and clarinet,

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:11.680
it calls for a recorder,
accordion, three male voices

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.430
which also must whistle, two
ukuleles, and a percussion ensemble

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:18.890
that he refers to as rhythm band.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.870
Bernstein's choices appear
to be largely delineated

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.350
by the availability of
particular performers.

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.770
If not performers then
at least instruments

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.120
that we would find in
a camp environment.

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.060
And while there's no record
that this arrangement was

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.230
or was not performed, it does
appear to have been written

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:38.620
with performers from
Camp Onota in mind.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.160
The clearest suggestion of this
appears in a photograph taken

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.670
at camp that very same summer.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:48.700
This is the first known image
of Leonard Bernstein conducting.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:55.560
The caption reads, "Onota Rhythm
Band and Leonard Bernstein 1937."

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.230
And this is the same
Rhythm Band called

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:00.160
for in his Rhapsody arrangement.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:04.190
Dressed in his camp Onota tank
top, Bernstein directs a group

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.480
of seven young musicians
who are playing a battery

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.870
of percussion instruments including
two triangles, [inaudible], chimes,

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.510
cymbals, a tamborine
and even what appears

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:16.890
to be a kalimba or a thumb piano.

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.220
Bernstein's camp arrangement
of the Rhapsody includes some

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.740
of these very same instruments.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.210
So it's possible that
some of the boys seen

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:26.660
in this photograph took part
in a performance of the piece.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.710
I had the pleasure of
editing a performing edition

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:31.370
of this arrangement and with the
permission of both the Gershwin

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:35.290
and Bernstein estates, the work had
it's world concert premiere during

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:39.620
Harvard's Leonard Bernstein Boston
to Broadway festival back in 2006.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.480
It has not been heard
publicly since that time.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.620
So I'm particularly excited
to be able to share an excerpt

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.090
from that performance
with you this evening.

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:53.720
The clip that I'm going to play
begins at rehearsal letter J. It's

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.030
on the second system
of this manuscript just

00:50:56.030 --> 00:51:02.080 position:56%
after the second piano cadenza which
is notated simply as piano cadenza.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.400
Earlier, I played contrasting
versions of the Rhapsody

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.870
by Gershwin and Bernstein.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:09.440
This is the same solo piano
passage but here it's scored

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.000
out for camp instruments and
should provide you with a sense

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.360
of the 18-year-old Leonard
Bernstein's overall approach

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:24.510
to Rhapsody in Blue
in this arrangement.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:52:04.040
[ Music ]

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:27.180
Feel free to sing along
if you'd like.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:00.210
We move into the piano cadenza,
which again is not notated

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:03.050
because he would have
had it memorized.

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.430
Now it's important to reiterate
that Bernstein's instrumentation

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:08.670
in this passage replaces what would
have otherwise been an extended

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:10.600
piano solo passage.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.420
That is, instead of just playing
these measures on the piano,

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:16.400
he arranged them to be
played by his campers.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.180
The choices made here reflect
Bernstein's emerging theatricality.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:24.260 position:56%
The drama of the largo clarinet solo
sets up the playful reinterpration

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.980
of the standard campfire
sing along, which is offered

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:31.320
by disembodied textless
voices and ukuleles.

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.530
In addition to the introduction
of imitative color combinations,

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.890
we have this substitution
of the accordion

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:41.740
for what would have otherwise been
rapid 16th note piano [inaudible].

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:45.690
What this does is it
intensifies the dramatic arch

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.470
of Gershwin's modulating melody to
which Bernstein adds a triumphant

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.750
and newly composed clarinet solo.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:56.210
Such decisions foreshadow
the centrality of showmanship

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:59.680
in Bernstein's future
presentations of Rhapsody in Blue.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:03.140
This excerpt from Camp Onota --

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.800 position:56%
this excerpt from the Camp Onota
arrangement demonstrates Bernstein's

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.160
continued compartmentalization
of Gershwin's themes.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.810
Much in the same way as the
annotative brackets function

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:17.270
in Bernstein's 1927
solo piano sheet music,

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:19.380
Bernstein here demarcates
transitions

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.420
by [inaudible] grand
pauses, dramatic shifts

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:24.400
in dynamic and instrumentation.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.830
And in one particularly striking
instance, he adds a transposition.

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.560
This transposition occurs at
the entrance of the love theme.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.190
In Gershwin's original
Rhapsody, this theme is preceded

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.310
by a B dominant seven
chord which sets

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.490 position:56%
up a dominant [inaudible] five seven

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:47.020
to one transition into
the key of E major.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:53.340
Now, when Bernstein resets it,
letter N in his manuscript,

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:56.250
instead of moving to E major,
he transcribes the love theme

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:59.410
up a third higher in
the key of G major.

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:03.060
So let me play these [inaudible]
so you can hear the difference.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.100
[ Music ]

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.510
This is the original.

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:15.160
[ Music ]

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.510
And this is Bernstein's.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:29.040
[ Music ]

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.070
So why might Bernstein
have done this.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.080
You can hear, this
is very much in kind

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.370
of a Broadway show
tunes style modulation,

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:39.230
the kind that further heightens
the drama of the melody.

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:41.320
But it also echoes Syd
Raymond's recollection

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.960
about Bernstein's first
reading of the sheet music

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.600
where Bernstein questioned why
Gershwin wrote it in one key

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.710
and then proceeded to
play it in another key.

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:53.520
I suspect that this transposition
here reflects that initial impulse.

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.860
These earlier arrangements of the
piece, the solo piano sheet music

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.420
and the Camp Onota arrangement,

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.960
these effected Bernstein's mature
interpretations of the Rhapsody.

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.970
As I mentioned, the
solo piano sheet music

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:08.910
that Bernstein acquired
contains a number of unique cuts.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:12.340
According to an unpublished 1986
interview, this is the version

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:13.640
that Bernstein preferred.

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.700
He stated, "I have
to confess to you,

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.870
and even if this is a public
confession, this is the way

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:23.040
that I've always played it so that
when I do play it with orchestras,

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.520 position:56%
and I've played it with many
orchestras, I have to redo the score

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.060
to fit the way that I learned it

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.260
because that is the
way that I love it.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.860
That is the way I know it,
and I think it works better."

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:36.640
And in fact with the
exception of two measures,

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.800
Bernstein's famous
recording of Rhapsody in Blue

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.100
with the New York Philharmonic
follows the cuts taken

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.810
in this 1927 solo piano
sheet music note for note.

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:49.220
Now it's been said that the
cuts located in this recording

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:53.510
"arguably undermine the
work's structural integrity."

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:58.500 position:56%
However, if we return to Bernstein's
essay [inaudible] Gershwin tune,

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:03.430
we see that Bernstein relished in
structural flexibility of the work.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:07.930
Bernstein states that with the
Rhapsody, "You can cut out parts

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:12.110 position:56%
of it without affecting the whole in
any way except to make it shorter.

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:14.060
You can remove any of these
stuck together sections

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.860
and the piece still goes
on as bravely as before.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.540
You can even interchange
these sections

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:21.130
with one another and
no harm is done.

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:24.320
You can make cuts within a section
or add new cadenzas or play it

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.860
with any combination of
instruments or on the piano alone.

00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.160
It can be a five minute piece

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.100
or a six minute piece
or a 12 minute piece.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:36.810
And in fact, all of these things
are being done to it every day.

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.130
It's still a Rhapsody in Blue."

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:43.740
The considerations advanced
in this 1955 essay, however,

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:45.310
were not recent validations.

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:49.970
Considerations advanced in
this 1955 essay, however,

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:52.780
were not recent revelations
to Bernstein.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.560
Rather, they were observations
formed while growing up,

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.570
observations delineated in his camp
arrangement of Rhapsody in Blue.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:02.730
It makes various cuts,
connects separate sections

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:04.680
and alters the orchestration.

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:06.830
It even goes so far as
to change the key of one

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:08.980
of the works most famous themes,

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.100
something he discovered was a
possibility as early as 1931.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.820
As a recording of his camp
arrangement demonstrates,

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.900
Bernstein's later remarks are true.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.320
Regardless of the alterations
made to the piece,

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:24.060
it remains Rhapsody in Blue.

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:31.020
So on paper, the composite record
made up by the copyright registry,

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.480
published editions of the sheet
music and even the program

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:36.960
for the work's premiere, on paper
George Gershwin remains the sole

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.370
composer for Rhapsody in Blue.

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:43.080
The piece will forever remain
George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.690
But the creation and maintenance
of his iconicity results only

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.070
from the arrangement
of the piece by a host

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:52.060
of other musicians over
the course of time.

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:55.560
In this sense, it's a work in
movement to borrow a phrase

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.770
from [inaudible] and
philosopher, Umberto Eco.

00:58:58.770 --> 00:59:02.970
The Rhapsody remains an open
text for musical interpretation

00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:06.850
in large part because of
it's inherent flexibility.

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:09.440
The notion that anyone can
make something of the piece

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.910 position:56%
in whatever way they choose to do
so is what has made it so attractive

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:16.670
to countless musicians over the
course of the past 90 years.

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:19.320
Now my remarks this evening
have been limited to the roles

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.860
of Ferde Grofe and Leonard
Bernstein, but a multitude

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:25.840
of prominent and little known
musicians have also taken the

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.800
Rhapsody on in their
own unique ways.

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.320
In the jazz world, this includes
figures such as Duke Ellington,

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.180
Ella Fitzgerald and Marcus Roberts.

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:37.350
In the popular world, we see
arrangements by [inaudible],

00:59:37.350 --> 00:59:43.330
and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.950
We also encounter arrangements
of Rhapsody

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:46.250
in Blue on the silver screen.

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:50.670
You see it in Woody Allen's
Manhattan, Disney's Fantasia 2000

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:53.440 position:56%
and Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatspy.

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.950
Let's also not forget
about United Airlines.

00:59:55.950 --> 01:00:02.330
Like a Rhapsody itself,
the story of Rhapsody

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:04.760
in Blue unfolds continually.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.000
It moves from one musician,
venue or conception to the next

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.560 position:56%
without formal design or intent all
the while revealing new perspectives

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.920
on that which has come before
and providing a platform

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.400
for understanding future
encounters with the work.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.370
Arrangements of Rhapsody
in Blue tell the tale

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.320
of it's owngoing composition.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.320
Both with respect to
the music itself

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.480
and the history that surrounds it.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.850
The different collection
of arrangements

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:33.520
and those considered here tonight
would result in different themes,

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.470
raise different concerns and
provide alternate narratives

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.800
about the past and the present.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.950
Nonetheless, the ultimate point
of approaching the Rhapsody

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:45.100
through arrangements would
remain much the same.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.190
Shifting the emphasis away
from a centralized composer

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:51.310
and text does not rescend
the iconic status

01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:54.230
of either George Gershwin
or Rhapsody in Blue.

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:58.960 position:56%
Rather, it provides insight into
why their elevated standing persists

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.540
in American culture today.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.510
Thank you very much.

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:20.420
[ Applause ]

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.040
Thank you very much.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.920
I believe there's some time for
questions if anyone has any.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.000
I think there's a microphone
as well.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.980
&gt;&gt; Not being too personal,
but what year were you born?

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.430
&gt;&gt; Ryan Raul Banagale:
What year was I born?

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.680
The late 1970's.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.330
&gt;&gt; Okay. I met Lennie
Bernstein in '72 in college,

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:47.060
Trinity College, went to Harvard.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.620
He had a good friend
named Dr. Clarence Barber.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:53.500
Barber went off into
[inaudible], and as he used

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:58.170
to say Lennie just went
off and did theatricality.

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:02.420
Lennie used to come by the college
at least two to three times a year.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.780
The time I met him, I was listening

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.630
to his performance
of the [inaudible].

01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:14.020
He banged on the door
of the music room.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.860
I thought it was one of my
friends trying to annoy me.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.670
I couldn't see his face.

01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:22.120 position:56%
I opened the door about to punch him
in the face and there's my chairman

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.430
of the music department and Lennie.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.510
And he says, "Walter Thompson,
this is Lennie Bernstein.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.590
Lennie Bernstein, this
is Walter Thompson."

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:32.780
We became good friends because I
criticized him on his [inaudible]

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.320
in the first movement
of the [inaudible].

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.150
So he knew that I could
criticize him and be good buddies.

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:39.580
Met him many, many times.

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:44.460
I can't believe that this lecture
that you've given is so accurate,

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.600
so well representative
of Lennie's personality.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.900
I assure you.

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.470
Everything you said about
Rhapsody is what we used

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:52.550
to talk about, used to argue about.

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:56.120
And I want to thank you for
giving me his personality again.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.920
I can't believe it's
been over 25 years

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.540
since I used to argue with him.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.840
&gt;&gt; Ryan Raul Banagale:
It's hard to believe.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.640
&gt;&gt; The one major argument, the
[inaudible] tenth symphony.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:07.160
He refused to play
beyond the first movement.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.190
I would say, "Lennie, who else but
you and I arguing about this music?

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.220
Why aren't you going to do it?"

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:17.640
And he refused because he could not
accept [inaudible] interpretation

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.940
of the [inaudible].

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:22.670
Okay? I mean, I used
to almost beat him up.

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:26.800
One time he did the [inaudible]
fifth symphony, the [inaudible].

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:31.070
I was there in the
front row on the left.

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:32.710 position:56%
He closed his eyes while performing.

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:35.520
I conducted with my eyes
closed in the audience.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.150
Later when I ran up to
argue with him again

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:40.280
about [inaudible], his
daughter was there.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.110
And she says, "Oh my God.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.970
He's the guy who conducted
just like you!"

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.370
She swore that our motions were
exactly the same even though our

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:50.030
eyes were closed.

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:59.260
Then finally, last major time I ran
into Lennie was at the [inaudible]

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.010
by the great [inaudible].

01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:02.350
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:04.880
Right. And we met during
intermission.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.480
I had two glasses of
champagne in my hand.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.870
I was about to put one in because
I'm double fisting really quick,

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:13.620
and somebody bumps into
the back of me real hard.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.480
I turn around with my fist.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.820
He turns around with his fist.

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.120
We shout, "Lennie!"

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.420
"Walter!" "Ah!"

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.720
We hugged each other.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.020
We're both totally
drenched with champagne,

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.760
and his daughter says,
"Wow, it's Walter!"

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:28.630
And everybody [inaudible],
"Who's this Walter?"

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:32.900
And she has to explain to him the
weirdness of our relationship.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.340
I just want to say
thank you so very much.

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.710
You brought Lennie
back into this room.

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.010
&gt;&gt; Ryan Raul Banagale: My pleasure.

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:40.340
&gt;&gt; And everything you've said
about the Rhapsody he said

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.380
to me, I swear it is true.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.810
He called it an arrangement,
and you can stick this way

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:50.630
or that way and pop around with it.

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:56.000
When you sit with Lennie, if he's
at a piano, he has at least three

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.680
to five cigarettes going
on at the same time.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.490
So I breathed in his smoke so
many times I can't stand it

01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:05.020
when I think about what he did.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.820
It's like he didn't even
know he was doing it.

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.740
So that's one thing missing

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:13.380
from your talk [inaudible]
with the cigarette.

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.760
&gt;&gt; Ryan Raul Banagale: I'll make
sure to bring cigarettes next time.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.950
Thank you so much.

01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:19.250
Thank you.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.550
&gt;&gt; Great talk.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.570
I don't know if you can give
a concise answer to this

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:26.470
but in the midst of this sort
of view of Rhapsody in Blue

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:30.310
as an arrangement, what does --

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:32.910
you're working somehow
on the critical edition

01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:34.590
which I see as sort of [inaudible].

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:37.200
So how does the notion of a
critical edition fit into this?

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.340
&gt;&gt; Ryan Raul Banagale: It's
a really good question.

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.240
So, those of you that don't know,

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.170
the George Gershwin Initiative is
taking place out at the University

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:46.850
of Michigan as an attempt

01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:50.070
to put together the first
full critical edition

01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:51.370
of George Gershwin's work.

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:55.020
The critical edition is basically
known historically as kind

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.530
of an [inaudible], the definitive
version of a composition.

01:05:57.530 --> 01:06:00.960
And that seems to go a little
bit against what I'm talking

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.860
about here tonight, which is a
really fair observation question.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:09.660
And so when the chief editor of the
edition approached me about working

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:13.590
on the Rhapsody in Blue edition and
actually I'm on the editorial board

01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:15.550
as well, I said, "Well, you know

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:17.440
that I don't think there
should be a single version

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.140
of Rhapsody in Blue, don't you?"

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:20.440
And he said, "Absolutely.

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:24.140
That's exactly why we
want him to do it."

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.440
Because who better than the person

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.950
who doesn't think there
should be one to do it?

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.050
Anyway, so we are doing

01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:32.780
as [inaudible] four
separate arrangements

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.370 position:56%
of Rhapsody in Blue for the edition.

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:38.510
The first arrangement is going
to be as close to as possible

01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:40.560
as the way the Rhapsody
in Blue was performed

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.220 position:56%
at the premiere performance in 1924.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.840
That's the edition that will be
published hopefully this next year.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.860
And that will be the
first edition published

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.720
in the whole critical
edition series.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.850
We're also doing an edition that is
going to be the two piano version,

01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:57.710
which will just be the version
that is probably most familiar

01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:59.670 position:56%
that has the solo piano part as well

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:01.670
as the secondary jazz
band part built into it.

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:04.290
That one's going to be
key as closely as possible

01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:08.470
to existing manuscripts, probably
a combination of the three

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:11.090
that I've been discussing
here tonight.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:15.850 position:56%
The other edition is the symphonic
version because one of the big goals

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:19.200
of this critical edition is to have
clean set of new performing parts,

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.180
orchestras to use around the world.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:26.320 position:56%
So they'll do the symphonic version
and then the version of the Rhapsody

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.720
and arrangement that I didn't talk
about tonight which is another one

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.230
by Ferde Grofe is the
theater orchester arrangement.

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:34.500
And this I think is the
most flexible of all

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.840
of the arrangements that were done.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.850
Grofe completed the theater
orchestra arrangement some time

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:41.950
in 1926 and the score
also is in the Library

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:44.140
of Congress archives here
in the Music Division.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.860
And what that one does is it
allows for ensembles and orchestras

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.590
or jazz bands to play the piece

01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:52.670
if you're not the Paul
Whiteman Orchestra.

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:56.180
If you don't have someone who can
play five instruments and alternate

01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:59.820
between them which most orchestras
wouldn't, most jazz bands wouldn't,

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.470
you can just choose which
parts you want to play.

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:04.110
It's a very flexible arrangement.

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:07.350
So if you don't have someone --
if you don't have a saxophone

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:09.420
or even know what a
[inaudible] saxophone is,

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.160
then you can substitute that out
with someone who plays the flute.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.860
So that arrangement itself
will be very flexible.

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:18.320
What I envision, and I don't know
if this is going to be possible,

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.450 position:56%
is to create digital arrangements so
it's not just a printed bound volume

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:25.740
by itself, but what I would
love to see as happen some time

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:28.520
in the next 30 to 40 years as
we're working on this project is

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.200
that you can say, "You know what?

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.570
I want to play the version of --

01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.610
the symphonic version the
way that Lennie played it."

01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:36.240
And you hit a button, and it
puts all the tempo markings in,

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.540
it changes the arrangement.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.820
It makes all the cuts and then
you've got those digital versions

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.480
of the scores that
you can play them.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.000
So what I'm envisioning for
this edition of Rhapsody in Blue

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.970 position:56%
and for the Gershwin edition as a
whole is a great deal of flexibility

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.650
so it is not just one text.

01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:51.660
I think Gershwin would have
probably hated the idea

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.460
that we had just one text or one
version of any of these works.

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.990 position:56%
Almost everything we hear or we know

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:57.670
of George Gershwin
is an arrangement.

01:08:57.670 --> 01:09:00.410
Any song that you hear performed,
you're not hearing performed just

01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:01.710
as it was published
in the sheet music.

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:03.760
We're not hearing it as it was
performed in the original premiere

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.060
in the Broadway theaters.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.360
It's all been arranged.

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:08.620
Even more recently the
new Porgy and Bess version

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.190
on Broadway is another arrangement.

01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:13.260
It's a whole new orchestration,
the same work.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.700
And I think in that spirit
that is something I hope

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:20.320
that George Gershwin would
enjoy and relish seeing.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.330
Thank you.

01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:23.630
Yes.

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:27.670
That was -- I have to
say I'm a musicologist.

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:30.410
That was the most fascinating
musicology lecture

01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:31.710
that I've ever heard.

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:33.010
&gt;&gt; Ryan Raul Banagale: Thank you.

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:35.490
&gt;&gt; It was wonderful.

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:43.020 position:56%
Anyway, I just was thinking of other
Gershwin tunes like Summertime,

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:51.470 position:56%
which is interpreted 5,000 different
ways by every single band nightly.

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:55.520
And there's just this -- I just
wanted to make this comment

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.600
about Gershwin being
in Paris studying

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.240 position:56%
with [inaudible] -- is that correct?

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.240
And then bringing that training.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.580
She was a stickler for technique.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:15.850
Bringing that European classical
music training back and integrating

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:22.590
that with jazz and creating this
whole style is just fascinating.

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:28.780
And just this improvisatory
style of the jazz component.

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:33.490
I think it makes me think
that perhaps composition

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:39.880
as defined is more of a
classical music [inaudible]

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.360
and arrangement is more in jazz.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.660
&gt;&gt; Ryan Raul Banagale: Right.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.860
and Gershwin certainly was working
within both of those, those mileus.

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:52.500
And as far as Gershwin
goes with [inaudible],

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.820 position:56%
it was more in a passing
relationship then an actual duration

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.580
of study time.

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.980
I think his encounter with
[inaudible] is similar

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:06.800
to his encounter with [inaudible] I
think the story goes where he said,

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.570
"I'd like to study with
you, Mr. [inaudible]."

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:10.540
And [inaudible] apparently
said, "Well,

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:13.260
how much money did
you make last year."

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.500
Gershwin said, oh, something,
150,000 something like that.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.410
And he said, "Well then I should
be taking lessons from you."

01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:21.750
Well, that story is
probably [inaudible].

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:24.520
It's also been assigned
to Stravinsky

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.900
and I think also to Schoenberg.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:29.490
A lot of people apparently had this
same conversation with Gershwin.

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:35.440
Nonetheless, he really did absorb
influences wherever he could

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.740
find them.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.040
He certainly did spend
a lot of time in Paris.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.390
America and Paris is
probably the most famous --

01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:45.470
kind of compositional
result of that as well.

01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:48.040
The primary parts that he
studied was the composition

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.140
after the Rhapsody in Blue
later on is Joseph Schillinger.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:55.710 position:56%
And really if you look at -- there's
been some wonderful studies on Porgy

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:57.930
and Bess and the effect
of Schillinger and kind

01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:02.110
of the rotational compositional
aspects that Schillinger introduced

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:05.900
to Gershwin that we can certainly
see in play in Porgy and Bess.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:10.730
1924, Gershwin still really
hadn't left the country

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:12.760
with Rhapsody in Blue.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:15.080
This is not too long after
he'd had his first big hit

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.380
with the [inaudible].

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.870
1924 is the same year that
Lady Be Good was on stage

01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:21.330
and his first hit musical.

01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:24.450
Things really do take off in
1924, and he does start traveling

01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:25.810
around the world and meeting

01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:27.800
and having a lot of
different influences.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.580
I think we need to cut off
the questions for time,

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.950
but I'm happy to answer questions
as they emerge afterwards.

01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:39.060
Please do sign -- join me outside
for the book signing if you'd like

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.860
and thank you so much for coming.
