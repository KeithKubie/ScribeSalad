00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 Near the arctic circle in Siberia 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.500
 is the world’s coldest permanently inhabited town 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.001
 Its residents deserve our respect 

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.867
 and our sympathies 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.001
 I'm from Minnesota, so I know cold 

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.400
 but it is nothing on the level 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.567
 what the residents of Oymyakon have to deal with 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.767
 So for six months out of the year, from October to March 

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.500
 the temperature is always below freezing 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.967
 to give you some perspective, the average temperatures in January 

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:39.001
 are equivalent to the temperatures on Mars 

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.533
 the coldest temperature ever recorded there 

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.333
 was negative ninety 

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:47.667
  I don’t know what happens at negative ninety. I imagine that, that you just die 

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.867
 If you go outside you just instantly die 

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:52.900
 It has to be negative sixty degrees 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.867
 before they tell the kids to stay home from school 

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:57.834
 This creates all kinds of strange problems 

00:00:57.834 --> 00:00:59.934
 they have to leave their cars idling 

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.600
 batteries just immediately die 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.867
 electronics in general are basically useless 

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:09.001
 the air is actually sucking the moisture out of your body 

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.266
 when someone dies in Oymyakon during the winter

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.200
 they have to light a bonfire, let it burn for half a day 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.667
 dig down about a foot, and then do the same thing over, it can take days

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:22.800
 On the plus side, all it takes to refrigerate you food is a basement 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.934
 can you just throw your carcasses down there 

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:26.467
 they eat a lot of frozen meat 

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.066
 two go snacks are cubes of frozen reindeer blood 

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.700
 and thinly sliced reindeer or horse meat 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.066
 what do the people of Oymyakon do for fun? 

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.767
 Besides drinking, of which they do a fair amount 

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:40.867
 One of the thing they do is participate in something called the Walrus Club 

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:45.100
 which involves finding a river, in the middle of winter 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.900
 and jumping into it 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.834
 and think the part that is fun, is that you don’t die 

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:53.934
  So from a man who grew up in the world’s third coldest place 

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:57.200
 to the residents of the world’s first coldest place 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.266

 We used to do this thing where you could take a cup of boiling water 

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.800
 throw the boiling water into the air 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.367
 and it would never hit the ground 

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:18.567
 it would just disappear into a puff of steam 

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:20.467
 it would sort of sublimate into the air 

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:24.200
 that was awesome, that’s a great thing to do when it’s really cold out 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.066
 what are some other wonders that I should know about! 

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:28.233
 What do you want to hear me talk about, what do you want to tell me about 

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:31.700
 what is the greatest place you have ever been 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.433
 I want to know all of these things
