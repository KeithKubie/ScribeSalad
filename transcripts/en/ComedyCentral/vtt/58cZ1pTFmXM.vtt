00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:05.071
I realized this week that I need
to build a tremendous legal team

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:07.273
to help me
with this investigation

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:09.342
that I'm totally not under.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.277
Wink.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.080
It's time for "Lawyering Up!"

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.015
(dramatic theme music playing)

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:18.151
(applause and cheering)

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.820 line:0%
Well, Gloria,
I'd shake your hand, but

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.423 line:0%
I don't want to get sued for
touching you inappropriately.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.158 line:0%
You would be.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.627 line:0%
I'm in a bit of trouble, Kuby.
I'm not gonna lie.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.429 line:0%
So I understand.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:33.433 line:0%
I am auditioning lawyers to be
on my legal team. First off,

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.436 line:0%
how Jewy are you?
On a scale of one to Jerry,

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.437 line:0%
are you, like, a four or a five?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.672
'Cause we all know
Jewish lawyers

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:40.706
are the best.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.041
I'm very Jewy.

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:43.409
Not very Jewy.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:44.977
I don't even understand
that question.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.446
See? There we go.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.981
A coy Jew.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:52.351
Now, you've defended
con artists,

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.287
foreign agents and mobsters,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.523
but have you ever done
all three at once?

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:00.326
This would be my first
if I took the case.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.527
-Triple Lindy.
-Yeah.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.829
If I hired you,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.431
-would I be your favorite
client? -First of all,

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:08.334
you'd be second
to O.J. Simpson...

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.303
-Love the guy.
-...Klaus von Bülow...

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.404
Great guy, too.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:12.572
...Mike Tyson...

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.408
-Here we go.
-...and Bill Clinton?

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:16.576
-Bill Clinton?
-Yeah.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.544
I don't think
that you remember me.

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.814
I have a-a lawsuit against you.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:25.384
-What?
-On behalf of Summer Zervos,

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:27.153
-Oh, God.
-who is one of the women

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:28.588
that during
the presidential campaign...

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.857
Oh, wow. Is this the way
the interview's going?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.725
...who accused you
of actually doing

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.494
some of the things
that you said...

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.730
-I object! -...you did
on that<i> Access Hollywood</i> tape.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.866
-You're out of order!
-Where you alleged

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.200
you could grab a woman by...

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:43.736
I'm not going to use the word
that you said.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:46.372
-Pussy.
-Genital, and

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:47.940
then you said they're liars.

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:49.609
-Yeah, liars.
-And I filed

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.478
a lawsuit against you
which is now pending

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.881
-in New York City.
-That's the kind of lawyer

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.116
-I want.
-I can't! It's a conflict.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.418
You attended Yale Law School.

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.121
-I did. -And then,
you're a professor at Harvard.

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:04.690
-Mm-hmm. -What, you think
you're better than me?

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:07.393
Absolutely. I have no<i> doubt </i>
that I'm better than you.

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:09.428
Uh, you went
to University of Pennsylvania.

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:11.664
-Wharton. I went to Wharton.
-Fourth or fifth ranked.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.833
-I went to Wharton. Please.
-I went to Yale Law School.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.169
-Number one... school.
Harvard Law School. -Number one?

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.437
-Give me a break, Dershowitz.
-I am much better than you.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.805
-But don't Dershowitz me.
-Don't you want a lawyer

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.440
-that's better than you?
-Don't Dershowitz me.

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:24.243
-You want a lawyer
that's worse than you? -Yes!

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:25.645
We have attorney-client
privilege, right?

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.146
-No, we don't.
-All right, I'm gonna

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.681
-admit some things to test it.
-I'm gonna

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.050
tell everybody everything
you've said here today.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.219
Anything you tell me
is completely confidential.

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:34.687
-I could tell you anything?
-Anything.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.156
I have a small heart attack
four times a day.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.425
-Ah. Okay.
-I think

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.994
about Jeff Sessions in a bikini
all the time.

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:43.863
-Do you?
-I have

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:46.098
Rue McClanahan's brain in a jar.

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:49.135
Are you sure these are things
that I should know?

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.071
I want to hunt and eat
a male ballerina.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:55.608
-Oh, my God.
-I masturbate with both hands.

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.811
Who-who... who doesn't?

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:01.380
Alan,
am I being investigated or not?

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:04.116
You are being investigated-ish.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.018
-Uh,<i> ish.</i> -Is this Yiddish?
Are you speaking Yiddish?

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:07.220
I am speak...

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:09.355
(both speaking Yiddish)

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:10.790
Uh, yeah, yeah.<i> Ish.</i>

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.858
Eh, not quite investigated,

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:15.428
not quite<i> not</i> investigated.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.197
But let's face it, around
The White House, it's<i> mishegoss.</i>

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.032
It is.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:22.902
If I become your lawyer,
will you actually

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.738
do the things I suggest you do?

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:27.807
-No.
-Okay. Will you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.444
<i> stop</i> doing the things
I suggest you stop doing?

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:32.979
No.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:35.281
Okay. Thank you... for that.

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.916
What is my biggest
legal problem?

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.318
Did you ever hear these words?

00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:43.089
-(loudly):
Obstruction of justice?<i> -Ow!</i>

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:45.591
No, I haven't heard them
till you said them.

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:47.159
Can I sue James Comey?

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:51.197
If you tried to get him
to stop investigating you...

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.598
I didn't do it.

00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.333
That's potentially
obstruction of justice.

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:55.735
Ding! Ding! Ding!

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.738
-Did I win something?
-That is an impeachable offense!

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.774
-You can't<i> handle</i> the truth!
-(scoffs)

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.110
You don't know where I'm coming
from. I'm crazy like a fox.

'Cause it makes your job easier.

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.747
No, it makes my job better,
because

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.049
-if you get yourself indicted...
-Right.

00:04:10.082 --> 00:04:13.119
-...or impeached,
I have a real job! -What?

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:15.821
And you're helping me
enormously.

00:04:15.854 --> 00:04:19.058
Everything you say,
everything you do

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.594
makes it more likely
you're going to get impeached.

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:24.397
Resign now
while there's still time.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.932
Do you think
you could keep me out of jail?

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:29.835
If you do
what I tell you to do...

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:32.605
-Yes. -...I can keep you
out of prison.

that-that I want to.

a lot I'd like to do with you.

I'd like to do with you, too.

00:04:41.947 --> 00:04:44.050
-It's all legal, though.
It's all... -Mine's all illegal.
