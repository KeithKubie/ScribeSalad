00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.980
Unless you didn’t quite get enough info
from the title- yes, it is entirely possible

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.790
for a chicken to lay an egg that contains
another fully developed egg, what we now officially

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.429
dub an Xzibit Egg.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.700
A wonderfully bizarre Matryoshka doll made
of protein and disgusting (when you think

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.730
about it) deliciousness.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.789
As you may or may not know, a chicken is capable
of laying hundreds of eggs in a given year

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.900
and the presence of a male isn’t needed
or required for this to happen.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.140
It’s only necessary if you want to have
the eggs fertilised.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.340
As such, hens can happily lay a near endless
stream of eggs throughout their lives with

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.670
no problem, assuming they don’t decide to
start brooding.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.470
To make sure this doesn’t happen, one simply
has to remove the laid eggs regularly.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.040
What you might not know, though, is that a
chicken can’t lay an egg without one key

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.940
thing- light.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.190
It turns out, there is a photo-receptive gland
in a chicken’s eye that, when exposed to

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.720
sufficient light, ultimately triggers the
release of the hormone that in turn spurs

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720
egg production.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.390
Particularly in winter months in certain areas,
depending on the type of chicken, this may

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.140
mean that naturally the chicken will not get
sufficient light in the winter to produce

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.440
enough of the necessary hormone to spur egg
production, conserving the resources of the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.369
chicken in times when food in nature is scarce.

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.549
Luckily for farmers and French Toast lovers
everywhere, artificial light works just as

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.610
well as natural in this case.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.610
(And, note: French Toast Most Definitely was
Not Invented by the French)

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.020
Once the egg has been released into the chicken’s
system, it is joined by a small disk of nutritional

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.049
material better known as the yolk, all while
the chicken’s uterus fills with albumen

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.360
(egg white).

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.460
Once this cocktail is done floating around
in the chicken’s system, a thin, inner membrane

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.200
from the inside of the chicken’s uterus
forms around the egg.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.399
After this, a more sturdy, outer membrane
mostly composed of calcium carbonate forms

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.360
around the whole thing, creating a chicken
egg as we know it.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.360
This ultimately gets expelled from the same
orifice that the chicken poops out of.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.260
Yes, this is what you’re scrambling up and
ingesting in the morning.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.840
All that said, in juvenile chickens, this
incredibly complex and remarkably efficient

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.649
(considering a chicken can lay almost an egg
per day) process can get muddled, and while

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.539
a chicken is in the middle of forming one
egg, their bodies can sometimes send the signal

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.170
to create a second before the first is done
forming.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.750
Eggs formed in this way are characterised
by having two (or more) yolks.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.430
As such, they’re unimaginatively referred
to as “double/triple/etc. yolk eggs”.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.879
We only say unimaginatively because eggs without
a yolk are given a much more inventive name

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.540
of “fart eggs”, or sometimes in polite
company “wind eggs”.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.200
This brings us back to the title of this post.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.770
Double shelled eggs are much more rare than
multi-yolked eggs and, as explained in this

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.560
New Scientist video, occur when abnormal contractions
result in the egg getting pushed back up into

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560
the uterus.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.090
The egg can then potentially stick around
for a second round of full egg development,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:58.740
before ultimately being expelled.
