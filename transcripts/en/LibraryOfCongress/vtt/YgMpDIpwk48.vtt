00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.440
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Hello, I'm Joel Achenbach

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.090
with the Washington Post,
here with Michael Lewis.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.510
Washington Post is a
sponsor of the festival.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.810
Can you hear me?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.110
I'm hearing an echo.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.410
Can you hear me?

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.710
It's all good?

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.460
Okay. We just found out
that Michael is supposed

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.120
to do a PowerPoint presentation,
so that's going to take us

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.860
about 1/2 hour to find the
PowerPoint presentation he forgot

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.160
to bring.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.070
Okay. So, but thank you for being
here, thank you to the Library

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.250
of Congress, thank you
to David Rubenstein,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.830
the chairman of the festival.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.980
And we're going to have
a little chat here,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.230
just a couple of old friends,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.220
along with one million other new
acquaintances here in the Hall.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.010
So Michael and I go way back.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.160
And let's just start
out talking about,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.180
you were an art history
major at Princeton, right?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.530
And then you go off to Wall
Street and you do really,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.160
really well at Salomon Brothers.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.830
And Michael, you could
have been rich.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.060
You know, I mean, you could have
your own plane at this point.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.550
And instead, you went
into the book business.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.470
Now how did that, tell
us why you did that.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.770
How did that come about?

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So you know, Joel
and I were classmates in college.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.140
It is actually just an accident
he was asked to interview me.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.830
They thought we would
be good together.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.970 position:56%
They didn't know we knew each other.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.040
And this is an opportunity for Joel

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.060
to express all the
resentments he feels.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.140
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: That's right.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.740
Yes. This is actually the undoing
project of Joel and Michael.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yes, this
is the undoing project.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.160
Add the fact that, yes.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.460
But so, the question is
why I quit Wall Street.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.950
So I didn't know I
wanted, what I wanted to do

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.250
with my life when I was in college.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.270
Unlike you, you knew you wanted
to be a journalist and writer.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.120
And when I got out, you
know, I didn't have any plan.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.660
I didn't, it didn't occur
to me, I think partly

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.960
because of how I grew up.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.260
I grew up in New Orleans

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.740
where nobody really did
anything for a living.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.800
So it didn't occur to
me that I would have to.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.440
And so hence our history.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.840
Right? I mean it was a place
where careers go to die.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.290
And but it was a great place
to study, and I loved it,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.590
and it did it because I loved it.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.770
When I got out, as a result, I
didn't have any kind of plan.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.570
And job on Wall Street
fell into my lap.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.520
And it was a way to make a living.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.950
But by the time I got it, I had
figured out I wanted to write.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.900
And it was a kind of
two year gap in there.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.200
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: How
did you figure that out?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.500
What made you think?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: You
know, it was when,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.940
you had to write a senior
thesis like I did at Princeton.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.930
You had to basically write a
book to get out of Princeton.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.000
And I immersed myself in that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.650
And I loved it like I loved
no other academic experience.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.800
And I kind of made
the jump in my mind,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.240
well this would be a good thing
to do forever, if you could.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.340 position:56%
The false start I had, was I thought
it would have meant an academic

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.510
career, and the thesis,
the guy who supervised me,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.660
the guy who supervises the thesis
not only told me I wasn't made

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.940
for an academic career,
when I asked him,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.400
at the end of my thesis defense,
because I was feeling a little vain

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.410
about the writing, what he
thought about the writing, he said,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.110
put it this way, never try
to make a living at it.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.410
And.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So his whole life
is now revenge against this one guy.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yeah,
this one guy.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.870
His name, just so you know it,
William A.P. Childs is his name.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.170
If you see that man.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.640
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Yeah, where is he now?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.940
No one's heard about him.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: He
was great, actually.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.600
He was a wonderful professor.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.900
Archaeologist.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.960
So I got out, and I was,
I started to just kind

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.360
of submit willy nilly
magazine pieces to magazines.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.660
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.300
I didn't know anybody
who wrote for a living.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.330
It was a quick-zotic enterprise.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.620
There was a book, I don't
know if you remember that,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.770
I used a book called
the writers market.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.710
And it was about that thick, and
it had the names and addresses

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.590
of all the editors in America.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.180
And for some reason,
I got it into my head

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.070
that the easiest thing
I might be able to break

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.210
into was in flight magazines.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.450 position:56%
And so I started, I was volunteering
at the soup kitchen on the Bowery,

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.780
the Bowery Missions in [inaudible],

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.280
and I thought the street
people were so interesting.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.110
I started to get to know
the homeless people.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.790
And I wrote a piece about New
York homeless people and I sent it

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.230
to all the in flight
magazines in America.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.230
And I remember, I got this
letter back from Delta Airlines

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.220
and it said, you know, we
kind of like the piece,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.420
but you do understand what
we're in the business of doing?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.260
We're trying to get people
to go places, not flee them.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.920
And we don't publish things

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.670
about homeless people
in the United States.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.030
So it took me awhile to
figure out the market.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.400
But eventually I started to
get some things in print.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.890
An editor in Washington,
basically gave me my start.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.070
The Economist in London
gave me my start.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.370
But then Michael Kinsley.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.670
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Michael Kinsley.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: He was
editing in The Republic.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.630
I sent him, I cold called him, I
was a graduate student in London,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.430
I said, I really want to
write for your magazine.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.130
He thought, he gave me a chance,
he published a couple of things.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.980
But then I get this
job on Wall Street,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.230
and the job on Wall
Street promises a fortune.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.500
I mean, it doesn't sound like a
fortune now, but it was, you know,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.470
it was $100,000 a year
the first year.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.770
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Oh my.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: But no,
you put that in today's,

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.370
it's a couple hundred
thousand dollars.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.670
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: And
you were like 25, 26?

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I was
23 when I got the job.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.730
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: 23.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: And you just, I
just thought, this is incredible.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.580
I mean, I have to go do
this just to see what it is.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.820
But by then, I knew I wanted
to write for a living.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.840
So I have a friend who's, from my
Salomon Brother's training class,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.900
and you joke, like, I could
have been rich, but the people

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.820
in my Salomon Brother's
training class pitied me.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.240
They all went and actually
got, they hit Wall Street

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.410
at just the right time, to
get really, really rich.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.190 position:56%
But I have a friend, he says that
when we met, the first day of class,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.790
he introduced himself and said, he
started telling me how he wanted

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.090
to go into mortgage
bonds and whatever.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.240 position:56%
And I said, my name's Michael
Lewis, and I'm here to write a book.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.040
And I'd already had it
in mind that I was going

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.680
to write about this place.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.740
And I might have had that, at
least, in the back of my mind,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.080
and I wrote while I was there.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.620
This is a longer answer
than you want,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.630
but this is how the
book career happened.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.970
While I was there, I
started to write about,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.200
I started to write about, I started
writing, I continued to write

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.870 position:56%
about other things, but I started
to publish things about Wall Street.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.020 position:56%
And I put a piece on the [inaudible]
in the Wall Street Journal,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.010
that had at the bottom
Michael Lewis is an associate

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.760
with Salomon Brother's in London.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.520
And the piece argued that
investment bankers were overpaid.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.240
And, as I said, I was
working in London,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.220
and I came into work the next day,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.700
and the head of Salomon Brother's
Europe was sitting at my desk,

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.200
and he was, happened to be a
great guy, happened to be the guy

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.920
who gave me my job, and
he was ashen, and he said,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.600
do you realize what you've done?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.230
I said, yeah, I got a piece
in the Journal, it's great.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:23.160
And he says, no, no, no, no, he
says, we've had a crisis meeting

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.590
with the board of directors
of Salomon Brothers to talk

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.380
about how we're going
to deal with this piece,

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.690
because it's being reprinted

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.450
in all these local
newspapers around the country.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.770
And he says, we're getting calls.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.990 position:56%
And I said, okay, wow, that's great.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.710
He said, no, he said, this
is a big, big problem.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.590
He said, he wasn't going to
fire me, oddly, different era.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.740
He wasn't going to fire me, yet.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.810
But he said, he kind of
sat down and he said,

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.520
how are we going to
fix this problem?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.820
And I said, you tell me.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.860
He said, well, the way we could
fix it is you don't write anymore.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.620
And I said, nah, I mean,
that's not going to happen,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.920
I'm going to keep writing.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.440
And he was fond of me, he wanted
me to stay, and he said, well,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.790
what if you wrote under
a different name?

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.450
And I said, instantly, came to
my mind, I said, what if I wrote

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.480
under the name, Diana Bleaker,
which is my mother's maiden name.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.780
He said, perfect.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.410
No one around here will
ever think a woman is a man.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.010
They'll never make the connection.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.310
So do it, fine.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.740
So I started to just
write with abandon,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.140
including stuff I was
seeing right around me,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.830
under the name Diana Bleaker.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.830
And one day, I get home from work,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.130
and Diana Bleaker's
career is taking off.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:33.350
Because people wanted to read
about Wall Street in 1977, in 1987.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.500
I get home from work one day
and there's a phone call.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:42.860
And the actor Chevy Chase,
remember him, his dad, Ned Chase,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.600 position:56%
was an editor at Simon and Schuster,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.070
very distinguished book
editor, and it's him.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.320
And he says, I found out
that you're Diana Bleaker.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.530
And he said, I think
you should write a book.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.690
You don't have to do it for me,
I'd love it if you came in here,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.250
but you should write a book.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.340
And from that moment,
that was in September

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.500
of 1987, I was out the door.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.210
I knew that, I knew
that's what I wanted to do,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.580
and the money didn't matter.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.860
And then what happened
next was kind of funny,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.580
because you're not
going to have to ask.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.390
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: No, no,
I am the pot and plant.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yes.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.990
Yes. Yes.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.290
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: The carrot.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: You're the
carrot in the school play.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:24.110
So, the, what happened
next, was I went,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:30.140
I waited until they gave me my
bonus at the end of the year,

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.640
because I didn't want
to just lose that.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.720
It was a huge pile of money.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.930
And then said, I'm
leaving to write a book.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.960
You know? And they said, you know,
what are you going to write about?

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.810
I said, I'm going to
write about Wall Street.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.900
And I wasn't quite sure how, what
[inaudible] was going to look like.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.130
They took me into a room,
and they didn't care

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.610
that I was writing a
book about Wall Street.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.210
That wasn't what concerned them.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.310
They thought I was out of my mind.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.940
They thought, they said, you
do understand that, like,

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.450
you made 250 this year,
and next year's like 500,

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.050
and then after that it's
millions of dollars a year.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.860
You can, you can stay
here for another decade

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.700
and in 10 years you
won't have to work,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.250
and then you can write
your books, basically.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.560
And they said, don't
do this to yourself.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.250
They felt sorry for me.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.140
And, but I was so out the door,
that it didn't even occur to me

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.440
that that, to listen to it.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.240
I was so enamored with the process
of, I was so amused with myself,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.670
as now, with what happened
when I sat down and wrote

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.430
with a blank sheet of paper.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.820
I mean, when you're 24,
or 25, how old was I?

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.120
I was 26 then.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.920
You know, it's, you kind
of go with your gut.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So this will not
work for everyone, this career path.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.220
[ Laughter ]

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.860
But certainly, being self amused
is a good personality trait

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.600
for this business.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: There's
no question.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.200
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: I
have some props here.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.500
I have a bunch of Michael's books.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.910
And this is The Big Short,
which everyone knows this book.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.210
And.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Thank you.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.190
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Tons of fans.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.710 position:56%
At the end of a book is an actually,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.480
incredibly harrowing
encounter with John Gutfreund.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Now,
may he rest in peace.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.180
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: May he rest
in peace, your former boss.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.810
And just reading that passage, we
read it again this morning, I mean,

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.520
tell us, there's a moment
where your old boss says,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.740
Liar's Poker made your
career and ruined mine.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: He put it
in slightly different terms.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:27.200 position:56%
He said, and the reason I went to go
see him was, it seemed clear to me

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.270
when I wrote that, that
that was a bookend.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.310
That I had come in, that a
lot of the forces that had led

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:38.750
to the financial crisis, had
been set in motion while I,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.240
by Salomon Brothers, in some
cases, while I was on Wall Street.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.070
And we were watching
the end of a process

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.760
that John Gutfreund had
helped put in motion.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.930
And the big one was turning these,

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.590
the Wall Street partnerships
into corporations.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.270
But in any.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.520
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Was it
scary though, to see him?

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: See
what, he was terrifying.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.680
And he booked a table for two
at his favorite restaurant

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.980
around the corner from his house

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.630
when I sent him a note saying
I'd love to sit down with you.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.880
He said, yes, but he didn't
say much more than that.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.730
He said meet me at that table.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.470
And I got there on
time, and he did not.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.200
And the table is one of those
tables where you sit together

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.450
with your legs together,
like you're on a date.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.450
And I sat there and
I started to sweat.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.480 position:56%
I thought, what is he, what is this?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.730
He sat this up so we're going
to sit like this for two hours?

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:33.300
He walks in, and he says, first
thing he says is your fucking book,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.410
your fucking book made your
career and it ruined mine.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.710
And I said.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.130
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: I think you
had a lovely lunch after that.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: No,
I said, that seems,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.950
that seems a misinterpretation
of history to me.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.890
That I don't think my
book ruined your career.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.990
It didn't help, but it
didn't ruin your career.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.520
And then we settled in and I'd see
him from time to time after that.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.390
And after that he was very genial.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.930
And he'd tell me, in fact, that
since Liar's Poker came out,

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.740
he always kept a box of the
books under his desk to sign them

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.800
for people when they
came to his office.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.380
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: That's
a win, okay, that's a win.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yes.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.180
He said something like,
I'm your biggest customer.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.540
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So, you gave
the commencement speech, or the,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.760
at Princeton a few years
back, and you said, you know,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.200 position:56%
you described yourself as lucky, and
said, some people are just lucky.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.530
And those of us who know you well,
you work incredibly hard, right?

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.400
I mean, you're like
a very hard worker.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.730
You have an incredible
gift for telling a story.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.490
You write in the vernacular.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.760 position:56%
And so, lucky, no, you're not lucky.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.270
But what has been your
secret, do you think,

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.780
in terms of finding stories, not
only that people want to read

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.880
but that no one else is, had told.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.390
I mean, The Big Short
being a classic example.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.740
We'd all been writing about
the financial crisis, you know,

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.370
the Great Recession, and
you come in with something

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.470 position:56%
that no one else had really written.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.230
So how do you find this stuff?

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: All right,
so I'll answer that question.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.530
But it's not true that
I'm not lucky.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.830
I mean, it's an incredible
serendipity in my career.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.210
The fact that I wanted to be
a writer, and I got this job

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.340
in the very best place
on earth to write

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.260
about Wall Street in the 1980's.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:29.110
I was not only in the firm,
but the place in the firm.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.240
The you know, I was, I was given
the leisure by my parents to fart

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.150
around for two or three
years after college.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.330
If they hadn't done that, I doubt
I would have become a writer.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.810
I have.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.370
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Okay,
you had some advantages.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Huge advantages.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.750
And the point of that
speech was, you have people,

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:53.370
there's this odd conceit in our
culture that once you've made it,

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.410
that it was inevitable
because the virtue of you.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.100
And that, in fact,
that's not how it works.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:06.510
Obama was right when he
said, you didn't build it.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:12.950
That it's, you are so, you are
such the recipient of benefits

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:18.630
that this culture bestows on you,
and not to, and to tell the story

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.250
without a high level awareness
of that, that's what I was trying

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.860
to get across to these Princeton
kids, because it's getting harder

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.840 position:56%
and harder to see how lucky you are.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.300
Anyway, so the story is.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.600
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Okay.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.900
I think we left the question.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.180
So yes, you had a lot of advantages
and you had the freedom to kind

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.290
of look around and improvise.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.850
But you know, you also found these
stories that no one else saw.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.840
The classic on, I think,
is The Blind Side.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.600
Tell us about how you, a friend
of yours told you such and such,

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.640
and suddenly you've
got an incredible book

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.940
that becomes a movie.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So The Blind Side.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:59.630
It is typical of how I find
stories, in that you'll see

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.230
that it's just I chance
into stories.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.620
Big Short is slightly different.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.730
But The Blind Side, what happened,
it started with a bottle of wine

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.330
and a New York Times Magazine
editor named Jerry Mazaratti.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.130
And we were sitting in New York,
and I remember the restaurant,

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.360
and he says, we're trying to decide
what I'm going to write next,

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.340
cover story for the New
York Times magazine.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:24.700
And it was whatever it was,
2005 or 4, or around there.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.810
And he was thinking, you
know, important people.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.460
He was thinking Jamie Diamond.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.640
He was thinking, never
really interested me.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.150 position:56%
And I said, you know, if you want me
to write about something important,

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.950
let me write about the
teacher who changed my life.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.400
I mean, nobody knows who he is.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.770
Put him on the cover of the
New York Times magazine.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.550
And he happened to be my baseball
coach, but he was a teacher.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.750
And so he said, okay, go do it.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.100
And while I was doing that, I
thought, well, I'm going to write

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.310
about this, this personal story
about this coach, I've got to talk

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.810
to some of the people on my team.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.160
I was the pitcher on the team.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.520
Sean Tuohy, who's played
by Tim McGraw in the movie,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.050
The Blind Side, was the catcher.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.160
So I went to see him, and I
hadn't seen him since high school.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.620
And he picks me up at the Memphis
airport, he being this poor boy,

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.510 position:56%
I mean, in high school he
sometimes had not had enough to eat.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.790
He made great good of himself.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.650
He was a wonderful athlete.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:18.950
He was drafted.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.250
Played in the NBA.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.400
He was drafted by the
Cincinnati Reds in high school.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.020
And he'd gone on to make a
fortune in the fast food business.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.250
He wanted to show me his mansion.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.200
He took me to his mansion.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.930
And we spoke for two hours
or so about our old coach.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.970
And the whole time, in his living
room, there was 6 foot 5 inch,

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.560
350 pound black kid
who didn't say a word

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.630
and who was not introduced to me.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.460
He was like you were
when I was monologuing.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.930
He was the carrot in
the school play.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:59.410 position:56%
And on the way back to the airport,
I said, Sean, who was the black kid?

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.040
And he said, oh, that's Leigh
Anne's project, her new project.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.570
And he started to get
a little teary.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.840 position:56%
He said, we saw him, he was standing
on the bus stop in the snow,

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.970
in a t-shirt and shorts, and
she recognized him as somebody

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.060
who had just come to the kid's
school, and she stopped and said,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.130 position:56%
what are you doing out there in
shorts and a t-shirt and she put him

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.690
in the car and she drove him
home, and he hasn't left.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.860
And it turned out that
he had no family,

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.210
he was living on the streets,
nothing to eat, was illiterate.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:36.720
And Leigh Anne Tuohy, rich, white,
evangelical Republican living

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.130
on the outskirts of a very
racially divided city said,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.930
I'm going to fix him and I'm
going to make him a rich,

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.880
white, evangelical Christian.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.140
And that's when she, and
Sean was just amused by it.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.100
He's just, don't get in her way.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.150
She's going to do it,
she's going to do it.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.050
And I just started following,
that's, and I though, that's odd,

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.270
it's Pygmalion, it's
Pygmalion in Memphis.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.160
And I thought, I'll
just follow that.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.180
So, can I finish how the book comes
about, because that's not a book.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.000
I just thought, that's interesting.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.530
Curious thing.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:13.810
And I just want to know more.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.900
Flash forward a few weeks.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.960
Money Ball had come out
not that long before.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.160
I got to be friends with the
brain trusts, such as they were,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.530
in several NFL front offices.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.280
Some of them actually
were brain trusts,

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.170
some of them you wouldn't
trust their brains.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.930
But the brain trust at
the 49ers was great.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.720 position:56%
And he and I started to have a money
ball conversation about football.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.900
And he said, you know,
there's not a money ball story

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.250
in football that's the same story,

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.640
because everybody has basically
the same amount of money to spend.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.330
So there aren't the rich
teams and the poor teams.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.350
It's not about thinking
how to do more with less.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.540
Because what it is about
is figuring out how

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.100
to distribute your
money across the field.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.400
And I say, well, can you get me
a history of how that's happened

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.660
since free agency created a market?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.230
And he pulled it out.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.360
And it was really remarkable
that you had this character

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.180
on the offensive line,
the left tackle,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.000
who protected the quarterback's
blind side, whose salary had gone

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.240
from the lowest paid on the
field, lonely yellow lineman

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.740
that no one knew, to the second
highest after the quarterback,

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.470
because he was the insurance
policy on the most valuable asset.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.660
Because if the quarterback
got hit from that side,

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.540
he'd get hurt in a way
that he wouldn't normally.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.700
And I thought, huh,
that's interesting.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.800
Flash forward 6 or 8 months.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.530
I'd been hearing about
Michael Oher down in Memphis

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.050
and the stories are
getting rich and emotional.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.020
But it's not my story, it's my
old high school friend doing

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.970
something odd.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.280
And Sean calls me and he
says, you're not going

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.600
to believe what just happened.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.900
There was a lot of that.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.570
He'd call and say, you're not going
to believe what just happened.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.390
Nick Saban, Nick Saban, Alabama.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.690
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Alabama head coach.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: But he was then,

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.290
LSU head coach, came
through his school.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.560
He was looking at some players
in our school, and he saw Michael

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.740
on the basketball court,
and Sean knew that,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.680
and he said, Sean, who is that kid?

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.650
That's a future NFL left tackle.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.190
You can see just by the way he
moves, he's an NFL left tackle.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.880
And I said, Sean, do you
know what they get paid?

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.710
And he said, no, he just
said that's what he was.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.290
And I told him the story
about, the NFL financial story.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.100
And then I started to think,
well, there's a story here.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.950
And the story is, because
the kid then went,

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.740
the moment he was identified
as the future NFL left tackle,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:23.940
which he indeed became, he
went from, he went to be,

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.410
he was like the most
prized kid in the universe.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.610
He'd gone from the least
valued 15 year old on earth,

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.490
to the most valued 17
year old in a flash.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.670
And I thought, there's a story that
can be organized along these lines?

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:43.350
What are the forces in this kids
life that changed his value?

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:48.270
And one of those forces is stuff
that happened in NFL strategy.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.200 position:56%
But one of those forces is a mother.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.070
And once I realized
that, I had a story.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.070
And this always happens.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.340
I had it for 6 months before
I had the nerve to say,

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.780
yeah, I'm going to write it.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.720
Because I thought, I often
think there's someone better

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.920
to write this, someone
who actually has empathy,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.520
or someone who actually knows
emotions, or someone who knows

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.310
about psychology, or someone who
knows, there's always someone,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:20.170
there's some part of the story
where I think, it's alien to me,

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.540
so I really shouldn't
be the one to do it.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.770
But the truth is, the
fact that it's alien

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.860
to you is why you should do it,
because it enables you to get

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.160
across to other people to
whom it's alien the stuff

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.840
about it that's interesting.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.250
So what pushed me over the edge,
was Sean came out, he was the,

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.550
he was a commentator for the
Memphis Grizzlies and he came out,

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.080
they were playing the
Warriors, and we went to dinner,

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.910
and he started telling my wife and
I some of the stories, you know.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.100
The one he, so he mentioned
to my wife and said to me was,

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.620 position:56%
it was interesting when Michael came
into the house, because we took him

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.260
into a room and Leigh Anne showed
him his bed, and he just stared

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.560
at it, and she said what?

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.970
And he says, I've never had a bed.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.180
He was 15 years old
and never had a bed.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.700
And my wife started crying,
and then she got in the car,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.470
and she said afterwards,
you're an idiot

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.700
if you do anything
but write this book.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.920 position:56%
And so, I started to write the book.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.670
But that, it sounds like
a one off kind of thing.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.140 position:56%
But that's happened to me in various
forms over and over and over.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:23.040
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: You have a
common theme of unrecognized value

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.340
in several of your books.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:29.380
I mean, is that a conscious thing
you shoot for, think to yourself,

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.190
every business person in
America is going to buy my book

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.270
at the airport for the next flight.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:39.560
Because what it's sort of saying
is, you know, with Money Ball,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.590
The Blind Side, The
Big Short is, you know,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.330
and really with the new
book, The Undoing Project,

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.510
think differently about this.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.840
There's value out there
if you can recognize it.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.410
Is that a conscious theme you have?

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:53.710
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: No.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.360
It is a theme, what is, what
does seem to happen a lot,

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.810
and I don't quite know why, I
mean, I can guess why, I mean,

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.200
the books do come back
to markets a lot,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.300
and the way markets
don't function very well.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.800
Markets are miraculous in a
lot of ways, but so value comes

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.500
from market, the value
that the market assigns.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.940
So a lot of the stories do kind
of have a market angle to them.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.580
I think I've always been,
since I left New Orleans,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.650
always been bemused by
what gets valued and why.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.940
Because I left, because
I came from a place

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.550
that was a very charming
place to grow up.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.080
It was a really rich,
interesting childhood.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.970 position:56%
I loved it and I love the people, I
love the culture, I love the people,

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.040
I love the place, and
it was a fail place.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.470
It was not valued.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.400
And so the fact that they're
all, you see this over and over,

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.940
people who are special who
don't get valued properly.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.410
And there are people who
are distinctly not special

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.180
who get valued very highly.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.190
And that, so that has
always interested me,

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.590
since I was a little kid,
really interested me.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:03.430
My father, my father told me, no
that long ago, he introduced me

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.780
to the stock market, which
I never had an interest

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.250
and still don't have
much of an interest.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:13.060
And he's obsessed with it, like
he likes to watch his portfolio.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.870
Just watch it.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.640
And I don't get it.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.670
I don't get that, right?

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.420
But, so he's watching his
portfolio and he's saying,

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.100
I'm going to give you, I'm
giving you 10 shares of a stock

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.480
so you can learn how to
watch it, too, you know?

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.140
And I was 13 or 14 years old.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.940
And he gave me a little black
book in which to keep the record

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.810
of what I saw when
I was watching it.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.280
And he gave me 10 shares
of Char House,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.590
which was a restaurant company.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.540
And I think there was some,
he gave it to me because I,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.220
it's a New Orleans restaurant
that was owned by Char House.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.520
And I looked at it.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.120
It was $20 a share,
but he paid $220.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.660
And I said, well, it's 10 shares
and it's $20 a share, so it's $200,

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.960
what's the other 20 bucks.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.210
And he said, well that's
what we had to pay

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.730
to Sandy Villary [assumed
spelling] to buy the stock.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.110
And I said, I'm going to go egg
his house, that's outrageous.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.410
And it's just outrageous.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:12.760
He charges 20 bucks
for us to go buy,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.920
what does he do, just
makes a phone call.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.220
How did that happen?

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.440
And I remember being
outraged at the value assigned

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.180
to that role, even back then.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.770
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: And then you
invented online trading, right?

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:30.510
So we should talk, just as a
novelty, about your new book.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.040
[ Laughter ]

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.340
The Undoing Project.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: You
know it's, yeah.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.140
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So tell
us how you got into that.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.580
It's a little bit different
from your other books.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.740
It's more about psychology,
it's a little more academic.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.040
Is it really fundamentally
a friendship book?

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.340
It's about friends.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I
think it's a love story.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.940
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Love story.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: When, it
actually sold, yeah, love story,

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.320
he's thinking bullshit,
but it is a love story.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:07.670
When I was finished with it, and
it was being sold for a movie,

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.190
the Hollywood reported called me

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.400
and asked me what's the one line
elevator pitch for this book.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.690
Like, new, it's about these two
academics sitting in a room,

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.820
dreaming up ideas about
how the human mind works.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.720
How do you turn that into
a movie kind of thing?

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.000
He's saying, what's your pitch?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.780
And I said, well, it's
Brokeback Mountain,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.930
but they fuck each other ideas.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.630 position:56%
And that's how I think of this book.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:34.930
That's what it is.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.630
And it were, and that's what it is.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.120
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: we can
delete that line somehow, right?

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Nobody, it's
just us here, it's just us friends.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.220
It's just us friends here, Joel.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.520
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Okay.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Nobody will
be offended by that word.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.550
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Okay.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:54.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: And
the, so what happened was,

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:59.850
the way this story came about, it's
about two Israeli psychologists,

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.670
Amos Tversky and Danny Kahneman.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.210
I don't know about you when
you're working on a book,

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.180
I don't like to talk about
it when I'm working on it.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.420
It's amazing how quickly my
books can be described in a way

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.040
that people don't want to
know anything more about them.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.950
Really. So Money Ball,
what are you working on?

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.520
A book about baseball statistics.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.820
No one asks another question.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.500
But if you want to stop a
room cold, if you want to just

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.600
like stop a dinner party,
what you working on?

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.700
It's a book about two
Israeli psychologists.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.000
That just stops it.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.330
Nobody wants to know any more.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.150
But that's what this book is about,
Amos Tversky and Danny Kahneman.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.970
And the way it came about was
it grew out of Money Ball.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.730
Money Ball, a book about
misvaluation of people,

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.620
who happened to be baseball
players, but it's very interesting

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.220
that baseball players get
misvalued the way they did.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.580
And they got misvalued by people
making intuitive judgments

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.880
about their value.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.710
And I thought that was what
the story of the book was.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.170
The book comes out, and it
gets reviewed by Cass Sunstein

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:04.640
and Richard Thaler, a
distinguished legal scholar

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.980
and behavior economist.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.380
And they say, in The New
Republic, and they say, nice story,

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.720
but Mr. Lewis has missed the
point of his own story, basically.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:21.930
That these, what he's told is
a kind of, is a case study.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:27.190
He's given us a case study in the
ways the human mind leads us astray

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:32.920
when it is operating from the
gut, you know, human intuition.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:38.330
And the ways in which the human
mind leads us astray were mapped

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.480
by these two Israeli
psychologists, Amost Tversky

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.910
and Danny Kahneman,
in the late 70's.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.880
And I went, oh shit,
I missed the story.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.180
I didn't know.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.480
I'd never heard of.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.780
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Just like when
your thesis adviser said don't be

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.080
a writer.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Right.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.680
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: You get one bad
review, or a questionable review

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.100
in the New Republic, you
write an entirely new book.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Well, so it
was more complicated than that,

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.780
obviously, that, but that,
I'd never heard of these guys,

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.740
even though the year
Money Ball was written,

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.460
Kahneman won the Nobel
Prize in economics.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.180
And he didn't even
know any economics.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.480
And that's impressive.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:18.800
But he, so he, I just, it bothered
me that I missed this trick.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.770
But it's a great, I
like to think, you know,

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.340
people say that an explanation
is where the mind comes to rest.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.960
And the books are explanations.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.100
And where you do, what you
do with your story is kind

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.800
of where your mind came to rest.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.080
And I like to think I've kind
of exhausted the material.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.590
I've mined out the material.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.170
That no one else can come behind
me in my material and do it,

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.590
find something really
great that I didn't find.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.660
But this was something really
great that didn't even occur to me,

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.540
that there's something, they
were wired in certain ways

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.900
and people had actually
figured out how we're wired

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.800
that explains the whole
Money Ball story.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.240
It just bothered me, for
years I thought about it.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.310
I mean, not constantly, not the way
my father watched the stock market,

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:03.470
but just every now and then
I'd think, and I mentioned it

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.940
to a psychologist friend, and he
said, in Berkeley, where I live,

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.130
and he said, Danny Kahneman
lives 1/2 a mile from your house,

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.170
you can go talk to him about
this, get it off your chest.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.470
So that's what I did.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:18.350
I went and knocked on his door,
and we developed a relationship.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.770
We've gone on long walks
through the hills in Berkeley.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:25.790
And he would talk about his
now dead colleague, his lover,

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.180
it wasn't his physical lover,
but in every other way,

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.260
they were just passionately
involved with each other,

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.280
and tumultuously involved
with each other, Amos Tversky.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.610
And then I thought, I'm don't
know when this penny dropped,

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.290
I taught for a term,
taught's a strong term,

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.330
but it was called a class, at Cal.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:47.420
I was supposed to teach
writing, which you don't, I mean,

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.530
I didn't do a very good job at it.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.290
But the, but one of my favorite
students was a kid named

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.590
Oron Tversky.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:57.190
And it turns out he
was Amos' oldest son.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:02.100 position:56%
And very quickly I saw I had access
to both sides of this collaboration.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.380
And the material just
got, I kept thinking,

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.680
I'm not the one to write this.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.610
This is really interesting,
but I don't know.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:09.910
I'm not Jewish.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.850
This story takes place
in Israel, a lot of it.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.310
That's the back drop, is the birth

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.490
of the Israeli state
and early Israel.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.640
I have no, I didn't
even take psych 101.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.600
I have no, and no particular
interest

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.990
in psychology, up to that point.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.110
So it was all alien.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:31.180
So it took me forever to
talk myself into a place

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.680
where I thought I should
be the one to do it.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.160
And what caused me to, what
led me to this point, what,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.190
8 years after I first
started walking in the hills

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.620
with Danny Kahneman,
is that the people

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.540
who knew the story
were starting to die.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.060
And it was getting clear that if I
didn't tell it, it would be gone,

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.150
that it just wouldn't be.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.270
And I saw how, I thought, I think
it's an incredibly important story.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.360
I think their work is
incredibly important.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.660
It's for the ages.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.800
And it's a very emotional
story between these two men.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.100
So I know it was an unusual story.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.660
So, at that point, I turned
to Danny Kahneman and said,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.960
it's going to seem odd to you,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.860
because you know I
don't know anything,

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.930
but I want to write
a book about this.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.840
And he kind of hemmed and hawed,
and he didn't like the idea of it.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.220
And so I made a case.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.170
I said, you guys, your
work is too important.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.490
Someone's got to write a book
about it, and it's probably,

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.440
in your view, going
to be a bad book.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.130
And if anyone should have the right
to write a bad book about you,

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.170
it should be me, because I've
spent all these years walking

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.830
through the hills with you.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.220
And so that's how it started.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: But he, himself,
wrote a book, or did you ghost write

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.710
that book for him,
Thinking Fast and Slow?

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.090
I mean, because at the
very end of the book,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:43.360
you mention that you
saw some early chapters

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.720
of that book, it became
a best seller.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I saw it on
its way to the garbage can.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.940
He was, when I met him, among the
first things out of his mouth was,

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.970
you come at a good time, because
I've just decided, they've asked me

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.130
to write this book and it's
such garbage it's going

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.430
to ruin my reputation so
I'm not, it's going to go

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:59.730 position:56%
in the garbage can where it belongs.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.160
And I said, could I
see a chapter or two?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.870
And he gave me a chapter
or two, and I'm,

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.680 position:56%
don't throw this in the garbage can.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:12.770
And he, I watched him, I mean, this
is, the quality in Danny Kahneman

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.630
that is peculiar, that he has
to a degree I've never seen

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.350
in any other human being, is doubt.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:24.070
Doubt about everything around
him, including his own thoughts.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:28.940
And he would, he's
like constantly chewing

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.910
up what he creates before
it ever gets out the door.

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:37.820
So he got to a point, after
throwing it away and pulling it

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.250
out of the garbage can, and
throwing it away and pulling it

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.380
out of the garbage can four
or five times, where he said,

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.680
I know what we're going to do.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.730 position:56%
Because he didn't trust my
judgment in the manuscript, he said,

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:51.270
I'm going to give money to a
friend of mine who's a specialist

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:56.830
in my field, and have him
distribute this money in thirds

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.020
to three people he likes, but he's
not going to tell me who they are,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.350
and their job is to trash the book,
to write a negative review for me

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.850
so I can see how bad it is.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.150
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Kahneman's book.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: His own book.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:09.750
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yeah.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: He was, he
paid $5,000 for shitty reviews

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.300
of his own book to talk
him out of publishing it.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.080
So this is a peculiar character.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.260
That's what you're looking for.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.560
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Genius.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Even
better, he thinks he's normal.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.060
So the best characters,
you know this,

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.230
the best characters don't
know they're characters.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.960
The minute someone knows
they're a character,

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.670
they lose altitude on the page.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:35.730
And he just like, he soared
the whole way through.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.960
That he, he was just
a different person,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.250
and he had a lot of
different thoughts.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.960
And he would never
have had the thoughts

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.740
if he'd not had this love
affair with Amos Tversky.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:51.710
So, anyway, that, the, it
was a long, torturous path

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.490
to writing a book, because it
was even more off my beaten track

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:56.790
than usual.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.090
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Right.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Yeah.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So, you had a lot
of other opportunities, probably,

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:06.340
offered to you about, you know,
writing a movie, or you know,

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.980 position:56%
I think, did you write a novel once?

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.280
You've played around with it.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.190
And you know how these movies made
of your books, so what people want

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.270
to know is what is
Brad Pitt really like?

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Do
we want to know?

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.190
Do we want to know?

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.490
I can tell you.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:27.990
Yes. So, so before we get into
the movie thing, we'll do this.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.960
I don't want to create the
impression I had anything

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.050
to do with the movies.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:34.890
I think they're great.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:40.140
But the apropos of this
gathering, that the people

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.330
in Hollywood really prefer
that authors be dead.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:49.610
Because all the living
author does is cause trouble.

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.580
He wants credit, he wants

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:56.430 position:56%
to criticize you taking his precious
work of art and screwing it up,

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.340
he wants to tell you who
to cast in the picture,

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.180
he wants to hang around with you.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.530
They just don't like you live.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:07.750
And so, they convey this.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.110
The other odd thing
about Hollywood is

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.870
that they are fastidiously polite,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.750
that everybody's almost challenging
each other to be the first one

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.350
to be rude when you're
in a conversation

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.260
in Los Angeles in the
movie business.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.060
Like everybody's showing off
how gracious they can be,

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.400
even while they're sticking
a knife in your back.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.280
And it's a, it's not like
Wall Street that way.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.080
And the, so.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.740
[ Laughter ]

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.570 position:56%
What evolves between a living author
who maintains a good relationship

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:45.590
with the movie business, is this,

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.190
they pretend to be interested
in what you have to say.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.900
And you pretend to
believe they're interested.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.410
And as long as no one thinks
there's anything genuine there,

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:57.190
the relationship, it
can be quite lovely.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.740
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Okay.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So that's
what happened with Brad Pitt.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.300
And the relationship
was quite lovely.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.690
I don't know if we're going
to ever be together again.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:11.940
I hope we are.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:17.770
But I'll tell you a story that
encapsulates a part of Brad Pitt.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.980
When you meet him, you're
supposed to think he must be dumb

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.280
because he's so beautiful.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.760
But he's not dumb.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.060
He's very smart.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.430
He's very interested in things.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.010
He's a delight to talk to.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.310
He's easy.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:32.900 position:56%
He's surprisingly, shockingly normal
without being completely normal.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.260
But this is the Brad Pitt story.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.230
Billy Beane, who Brad Pitt
played, wanted nothing to do

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:44.150
with this movie, to the point
where he refused to go to the set.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.360
When they said they were
going to make the movie,

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.960
after I told them he could sell
his life writes without any fear

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.680
of them ever making the movie,
because they were never going

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.220
to make a movie about
baseball statistics

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.200
that would be offering money.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.170
Billy Beane called me up
and he said, you bastard.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.470
He was angry.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:04.070
He said, Brad Pitt just called,
and he's coming to my house,

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:07.410
and my wife is putting on makeup.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.800
[ Laughter ]

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.480
And the babysitter
is wearing a dress.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.320
You bastard.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.260 position:56%
Boom. So in the middle of making
movie, the movie people who want you

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.230
to engage in this false
relationship where you pretend

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.750 position:56%
to believe they care what you think,
were getting very uncomfortable

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.650
that Billy Beane wasn't
playing the game.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:32.310
He wasn't coming to the set.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.860 position:56%
He wasn't returning the phone calls.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.680
He didn't want anything
to do with it.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.370
They were filming in his office.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.050
I mean, they're filming in the
Oakland Coliseum for 3 weeks,

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:44.200
and his office is right there,
and he would refuse to come down.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:50.140
So, one day, they call me,
please, everybody's upset,

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.190
could you get Billy to the set.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.880
So I called Billy, and I said, just
put everyone out of their misery.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.370
Come down for 10 minutes.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.110
Nothing bad will happen.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.990
Just say hi, smile, be
charming, you can leave.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:04.670
And he said, you promise
you'll be there?

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.680
And I said, yeah, I'll be there
[inaudible] hold his hand.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.230
And so I drive out to the set.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.630
Did you see the movie?

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:15.960 position:56%
There's night scenes in the
Coliseum where they recreated a game

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.410
between the Oakland A's
and the Kansas City Royals,

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.490
and they had all these body
doubles, 8,000 people in the seats

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.950
that they'd move around the
stadium and make it look full.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.960
I'd go out with my daughter,
Dixie, who's then, I don't know,

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.810
9 years old or 10 years old,
they just finished shooting one

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:33.880
of these scenes where Brad Pitt is
moodily walking around in the field

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.600
with nobody in the stands.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.940
He comes over, because
that's the kind of guy he is,

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.160
gets down on one knee and
starts talking to Dixie,

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.870
and I leave them alone
for 10 minutes.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:45.030
10 minutes later, Billy
Beane's coming out one door,

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.500
and Dixie's around my leg.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.610
And I look down, and she's got
this look of terror in her eyes

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.510
and she goes, who is
that weird, old guy?

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.340
[ Laughter ]

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.080
And in walks Billy Beane.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.380
Billy comes over.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.690
Brad Pitt's vanished.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:04.190
A production assistant with the
headgear, and a, he's got a folder

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:09.240
with a book in it, comes running
over and he says, Mr. Beane,

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.010
Mr. Beane, thank you
for coming to the set.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.650
We've been waiting
for you all this time.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.100
He says, you're my hero.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.280
You're book changed my life.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.530
Billy looks at me and
he says, it's his book.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.830
And I said, I said, yes, my book.

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:24.150
He says, no, no, the guy refuses,
he says, no it was your book,

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.230
Mr. Beane, it changed
my life, your book,

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.090
and would you just
please sign my book.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.060
And he berates him, right,
all right, I'll sign the book.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.040
So there were two Billy Beane's
in professional baseball.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.420
They played in the same outfields,
on the Twins and the Tigers.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.400
One spelled it with an e on
the end, and one without.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.790
The other Billy Bean came out
of the closet and wrote a book

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.560
about coming out of the closet.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:53.590 position:56%
It was like, it was, Playing for
the Other Team, something like that,

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:57.280
maybe, From the Other Side of the
Plate, I don't know what it was,

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.740
but it was that kind of titles.

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.460
And the young man flips
open the book,

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.650
and it's the gay Billy
Bean's memoir.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.620
And Billy Beane's, he's like,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.030
there's no right answer
at that point, right?

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.330
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Awkward.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: And
over in the dugout,

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.980
Brad Pitt is rolling
around, laughing.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.330
Because he has set the whole
thing up as a practical joke,

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.790
and that was the only
reason he wanted Billy Beane

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.310
to come to the movie.

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:30.060
So that's Brad Pitt.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.360
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: That's
the Brad Pitt story.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: That's
the Brad Pitt story.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.960
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yes.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.260
I'm glad I asked.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.820
Okay.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.070
[ Applause ]

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.770
So we have microphones.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:42.070
We're going to do questions.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.560
So come up and ask a question.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.820
I ask, just don't make a speech
about how much you love Michael,

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.340
we know how much you love him.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.640
Just.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: But that's
better than the reverse.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.720
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So, I think
there's microphones, there you go.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.580
Come ask a question.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:04.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Are the all up
here, or there's some in the back?

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:05.710
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.010
I guess I'll start.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:08.310
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yes, sir.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:12.010
&gt;&gt; So, I've read several
of your books, and it's,

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.970
it seems to me you have a
fairly consistent technique

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:19.390
where you very strongly
personalize sort of a theme.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:23.230
So you're writing about the
emergence of the left tackle

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:27.530
as an important player in
football, and the restructuring

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.550
of the economics of the game,

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:32.500
and so you really drill
down on Michael Oher.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.650
You're writing about the economics
of baseball, it's Billy Beane.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.190
With The Big Short, you have
a couple of main characters,

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:48.610
but still very strongly
personalizing these larger themes.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.630
Clearly there are advantages
to that,

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:55.330
in terms of narrative strength,
talk a little bit about the pluses

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:58.370
and also about the
minuses of that approach.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Of
writing through people?

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.400 position:56%
I don't know any other way to do it.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.200
What I have found from the
very beginning of my career,

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.280
with Liar's Poker, where
I was the main character,

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:13.010
I found myself very
easy to sympathize with.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:14.990
[ Laughter ]

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.290
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: It's a gift.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:17.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: It was a gift.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.650
It was. You know, I felt
everything that character felt,

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:24.220
and approved of almost
everything that he did and said.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.690
He was very quotable.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:32.890
So the trick, such as
it is, it's a trick

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:36.490
and it's also just how I
naturally get interested in things.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:40.700
I get interested through
characters, through people.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.710
And what almost all the
books have in common,

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:46.560
aside maybe from Market
Angle, is their characters,

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.060
interesting characters to me
in interesting situations.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:57.030
So what I, the trick is if you can
attach the reader to the character

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.030
at the beginning of the book,

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.720
they'll follow that
character anywhere.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.650
Trust me that there is no
one in America who would want

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:07.840
to read my description of
collateralized debt obligations.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.610
But once you realize that the lives
of these people who you've come

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.380
to know, turn on knowing what
that is, you want to know.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:21.230
So it's a very, very powerful
device that is, you know,

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.170
the origins of literature.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:29.360
I don't regard it, thought,
as, you say the minuses.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.660
What would be the minuses?

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:38.860
You know, you place, I guess
you could argue that you're kind

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:44.570
of placing undue emphasis on a
single person when you're dealing

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:49.650
with big, but I don't, I never,
I usually pick my characters

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.950
who deserve that emphasis.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:55.720
So Billy Beane deserves to be
the face of the transformation

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.360
of baseball through intellect.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.850
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Let's go over here.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:01.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Anyway.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:06.060
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to
thank you for Flash Boys

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.590
on Wall Street and
the effect that had.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.100
I ended up reading
that, I went to school

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.480
with Ronnie Morgan,
that was a coincidence.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:18.650
I went up to IEX, got
involved in that whole battle.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:22.120
Fidelity ended up closing my
account because I kept insisting

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.680
that I should be able to
directly connect to IEX.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.320 position:56%
Maybe you could talk a little bit
about that, but thank you very much.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.620
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yeah.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.920
Talk about Flash Boys a little bit.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.600 position:56%
Is there a movie of that coming out?

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I don't,
you know, they never die,

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.270
but right now it's close to dead.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:44.030
And the problem, the problem
was revealed in the Sony hack,

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.960
remember that hack of the Sony,
there were emails back and forth

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.530
about how impossible it was to
make a movie with an Asian lead.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:55.000 position:56%
That the problem was Brad Katsuyama.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.550
They've gotten to the
point where they're nervous

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.510
about making an Asian
guy a white guy.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.370
A decade ago they weren't.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.080
They would have just done that.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.870
But they don't have, I think,

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:10.670
a well enough known Asian male
actor, which I think is crazy.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:13.140
But, it's crazy because the
whole point is he's an unknown

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.430
in real life, so you could
echo it in the movie.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.490
You could surround him with,
you could create a person.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:24.460
But the Flash Boys story,
to me, is still very, very,

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.200
very much alive in all of it.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.790
It's not sorted out.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.870
There is a war going on at the
heart of Wall Street, and it's,

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.220
is it going to be properly
regulated?

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:39.400
It's not. Are narrow
vested interests going

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.030
to [inaudible] a regulation in a
way that essentially cause taxes

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.630
to be levied on the rest of us?

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.960
Right now they are.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.010
And Brad Katsuyama and these guys

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:54.590
at IEX are the single
greatest force shining a light

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:57.510
on the whole problem
and trying to fix it.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:01.750
And I think he's, he's a Canadian,
but I think he's an American hero.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:08.120
And I find his story very moving,
but it is, it's one of those things

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.490
that didn't just, 60 Minutes
did their piece, there was a lot

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.070
of screaming and yelling about it.

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.170
A lot of people shouted at me
that I had got it all wrong.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.590
I don't, no one has
demonstrated to me

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.760
that what they're saying
is not true.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.890
And it's shocking that the
problems haven't been repaired.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:28.330
So, I don't know.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:29.870
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
Gentleman over here.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:34.390
&gt;&gt; Sure, Michael, what
are you working at now?

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:37.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Well,
politics has gotten interesting.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:41.950
[ Laughter ]

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:47.040
I was struck, after the
presidential election,

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:55.860
with who got elected president,
and but it was interesting to me,

00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:02.430
and I kind of got interested since
maybe March, April, the vast,

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:06.960
yawning gap between the effort
that Obama administration had put

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.070
into the transition and the
Trump administration had put

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:12.590
into the transition.

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:17.200
And that they, the Obama
administration had created,

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.080
inspired by Bush, Obama had
been very grateful to Bush

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.780
for how much effort he had put into
handing the government over to him.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:31.000
And Obama had deputed 2 or
3,000 people around him,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.480
through his administration,

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:37.740 position:56%
to essentially create a short course
I how the federal government works,

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.700
so that in our crazy system,
when all these people roll

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.340
in who don't really know very
much about what's going on,

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:50.360
and the department of energy, say
they can quickly get up to speed.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:57.630
And the day after, the assumption
was, as in past handovers,

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:00.200
that the day after the
election there'd be 30,

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.410
40 people from the new
administration rolling

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.270
into every government agency,

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:08.740
and cramming for 70 days
until the inauguration.

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.850
Because once the inauguration
happens, there's a lot of people

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:14.440 position:56%
who know a lot scattered in the four
winds that are actually forbidden

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.430
by law from getting in touch
with their old agencies.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:24.040
So you have a very weird need
for a thorough, quick education

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.760
in really a lot of
mission critical things.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:31.530
And Trump people literally
didn't show.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:35.500
So the parking spaces were empty,
the offices that were set aside

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.000
for the education were empty.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.050
And these were not a, it was
non ideological briefings.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:46.210
I think this is, we're
going to pay a big price.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:51.150
This problem is a bomb with a
very long fuse, but the ignorance

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:55.970
and mismanagement, ignorance of
and mismanagement of the government

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.010
that results from this
is a big deal.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:05.060
But, happily, it's made the
material really interesting.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:09.200
I mean, Trump has electrified
the federal government.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.880
Who would want to read about the
Department of Energy a year ago?

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.180
You wouldn't.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.480
But guess what?

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.440
They preside over the
nuclear arsenal.

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.680
And we have a guy on top
who doesn't even know that.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.710
And it's kind of incredible, right?

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:25.900
I mean, you can't make this up.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.200
It's Hollywood comedy after
Hollywood comedy waiting to happen.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.800
So, what I'm doing right now, the
Trump administration didn't bother

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.580
to get the briefings, I'm
getting the briefings.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:41.000
So I did this month's Vanity Fair,
there's 12,000 words where I run

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.070
around the Department of Energy
and, because I didn't know,

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:47.240
but I wasn't pretending to run it.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.410
I went and got the briefings the
Trump people didn't get to figure

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.430
out what the hell this place
does, because we need to know.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:56.230
And I'm going to move through
the government and do it

00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:57.580
for the other departments.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.510
So that's the project that.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a quick
question on the Undoing Project,

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:15.010
and all of these behavioral
economics issues.

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:17.130

and out for a number of years,

are your thoughts about the impact

do I think the impact

&gt;&gt; Yes.

if we lived in a sane world,

does, it wouldn't be doing.

me that the guy charged me 20 bucks

he did also explain to me

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:59.270 position:56%
that Wall Street floats on bullshit.

that people will give the
kind of financial advice

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:11.720 position:56%
that they give with a straight face.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.960
People will claim to
know where things,

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:17.890
the prices of things are going,
or have some insight into it,

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:19.780
and actually direct
people's money on the basis

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.600
of this insight, when
they have no idea.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:28.230
They will construct a story about
their investment career that seems

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:32.540
to demonstrate that they predicted
things, that we're inherently,

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:37.050
not only did they not predict them,
they were inherently unpredictable.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:41.210
Essentially random processes
are being construed as patterns

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:44.040
and the patterns are
being divined by priests,

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:48.410
and the priests get paid
a lot of money for it.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:51.260
That is crazy.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.900
The [inaudible] columnists would
have a lot to say about it.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:59.500
But the truth is that people
don't like taking responsibility

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.910
for managing and making their
own financial decisions,

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:05.820
and so they'll always pay
these priests, I think,

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.530
just to get rid of the problem.

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:12.480
They can't get in their
heads that not only is

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:18.160
that person not an expert, there's
no such thing as the expertise.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.630
They can get in their heads, oh, he
was a bad expert, he lost my money.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.960
They can't get in their heads they
shouldn't be listening to anybody.

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:35.740
And now, so, the damage that
the intellectual work grows

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:39.630
out of behavioral economics
can do to Wall Street,

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:46.020
I think that was minimal, because
Wall Street is, it's responding

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:52.850
to a psychological deep need that
has nothing to do with reason,

00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:56.760
so you can't argue it away.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.630
So, in short, I think the
answer is very little.

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.200
&gt;&gt; Where do you invest your money?

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:09.320
Just curious, because,
is it in a mattress, or?

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So if, saying
you think Wall Street floats

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:18.160
on bullshit is not saying you don't
think the American economy is an

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:23.280
incredible miracle, and an
engine of wealth creation.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.560
The economy is wonderful.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.640 position:56%
This, the American economy is one of
the great miracles of human history,

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.350
and I invest in it, but I don't
invest in it under the direction

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:37.720
of some Wall Street guru.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:41.200
I buy, I think there are
two smart things to do.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.160
The broad thing is, you decide
how much you want to put

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.210
in the stock market, and how much
you want to put somewhere else.

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:51.560
And then after that, how you
put it in the stock market,

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:57.370
I either buy very low cost index
funds, so just a basket of stocks,

00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:59.390
or I give it to Warren Buffett.

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.890
And I do this by buying
Birkshire Hathaway.

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:05.940
And this is a basket of stocks
that he has, but he's got,

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.080
he's the one person on the planet
whose capital has got a different

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.450
value assigned to it, that he,
people pay more for his money

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:14.820
because of his reputation.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.810
And he gets deals that
no one ever gets.

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:20.830
So I have long lambasted him
for being in this situation,

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:24.070
and I just gave up,
and I surrendered.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.920
And I'm so happy I surrendered.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.770
So I own a bunch of
Birkshire Hathaway stock.

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:30.670
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: All right.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:37.240
&gt;&gt; Hi, I wonder, approximately
what percentage

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:41.950
or to what degree you
two, have prepared

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:45.510
or practiced this interview
and a response?

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:48.830
[ Laughter ]

00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:50.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: We were
[inaudible] to ask this question.

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.530
But she asked how much
we prepared this.

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:53.830
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Tomorrow
night we're in New York,

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:55.990
the next night in Boston.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:58.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Where
were we last night?

00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.460
How about Detroit.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.760
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach:
We did this before

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.060
at Politics and Pros up the street.

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:04.000 position:56%
But this is a slightly larger crowd.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: We, so
I had to interview Joel

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:07.890
on stage about his books.

00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:10.860 position:56%
I don't know if you've ever actually
talked to me about my books.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.660
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: This
is, this is fake news.

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:14.940
Okay? I'm always asking
you about your books.

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I believe the
George Washington was the last one.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.230
He wrote a book about
George Washington.

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:19.530
And you should all
buy it and read it.

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.320
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: We only have
a minute, a couple of minutes.

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.630
Real quickly, are you still
the baseball commissioner

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:25.880
or softball commissioner
for your daughter's league?

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: I
retired a year ago,

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:29.730
because my daughter
didn't, she outgrew me.

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:33.290
But I ran the travel,
competitive travel softball program

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:35.760
in the East Bay of the Bay Area.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.440
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: So that
must have been a heady thing,

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.080
the feeling of power as
the softball commissioner.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: Oh,
it was unbelievable.

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.680
It was, half my life was this.

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:44.470
Actually, it was this
fantastic social experiment.

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:45.770
I mean, I'll do this
and we'll wrap it up,

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:47.580
I think we've got to wrap it up.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:51.960
But the, so I live in
Berkeley, which is filled

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.330
with all these liberal people
who don't believe in competition.

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:56.640
[ Laughter ]

00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.220 position:56%
And so the softball league is a
little recreational softball league.

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.520
It's wonderful.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.410
The Albany Berkeley
Girls Softball League.

00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:05.960
And the rule is, if you
coach in this league,

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.010
you have to lose half your games.

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:09.570
[ Laughter ]

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:14.770
So, if you, you go, if you go,
the perfect coach goes 500.

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:18.090
However, someone, years ago,

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:21.440
realized that some people
had a competitive streak

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.480
and so they allowed an
organizational [inaudible]

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.240
to be formed that after the league
concluded, all stars were picked.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:34.510 position:56%
And they would go out into the wilds
of California and play Republicans.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:37.040
[ Laughter ]

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.410
And this was always
a miserable, it was,

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:42.830
every game was Custer's Last Stand.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:45.460
It was a miserable experience.

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:49.870 position:56%
These little girls would be sent off
and they'd get mutilated by these,

00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:53.390
you know, red and tooth
and claw Republicans.

00:58:53.390 --> 00:59:01.410 position:56%
I took over the operation 7 years
ago, and I created liberal warriors.

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:02.710
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Everyone

00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:06.650
in this room has the same
thought, this is his next book.

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:08.770
Go ahead.

00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:10.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: And we went out

00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:13.090
and we really kicked
some Republican ass.

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:14.870
And it was really great.

00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:17.970
And they earned their
respect, for the first time.

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:21.230
So my 15 year old now,
when she was 10,

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:23.260
her team was number
one in the country.

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.070
And we got very, very good.

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:29.580
And the way I got good was by going
outside of the culture of Berkeley

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:35.060
and getting hard ass college women
softball players who did not want

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.370
to hear, we're going to lose.

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:39.110
Can I finish with one little,
cute little story, [inaudible].

00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:42.270
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: You've only lost
a small fraction of the audience.

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:44.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Lewis: So when
my daughter, Dixie's team,

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:51.450
is going like 40 and 1, my son
Walker is 7 years old, 6 years old,

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:53.480
he's in the dugout as the bat boy.

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.130
He's in the dugout as the bat boy
and he's agreed to take this job

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:58.890
with his sister's team, only
because they're winning trophies

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.150
for the first time,
and he gets a trophy.

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:03.990
And he's got his wall filled
with these trophies now.

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:06.390
And Walker was sitting there
with one of these coaches

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:09.690
that I hired the one game
they were going to lose.

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:14.490
They met a team, bad day, superior
force, they're down by runs

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:20.700
after two innings, and he turns
to the coach and he says, Shannon,

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.750
we're going to lose this game.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.640
And she flips, she starts
screaming at him, my little kid.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.680
She goes, you don't sit, if you're
going to sit in this dugout and be

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.340
on this team and be the bat boy,

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.030
you need to think more
positive thoughts.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.050
[ Laughter ]

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:37.460
So Walker sits there for a minute
and thinks about it, and he says,

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.510
Shannon, I'm positive we're
going to lose this game.

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:43.510
[ Laughter ]

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:46.310
And on that note, it
has been a pleasure.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.610
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenbach: Yeah, all right.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:48.910
Thank you for coming.

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:50.710
Thanks everyone.

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:58.700
