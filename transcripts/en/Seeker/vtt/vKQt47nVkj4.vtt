00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.250
Do you have a real or fake Christmas tree?

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.250
Fake?

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.250
Gross.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.630
Don’t you know that most fake trees are
fabricated in China with a bunch of chemicals

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.520
and that you probably hate Christmas.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.289
...I have a fake tree too.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.699
I don’t feel good about it.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.310
It’s just so convenient.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.939
Guys, lets talk about the wonderful world
of Christmas trees and how they affect the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.419
world around us.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.500
According to numbers compiled and crunched
by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.840
Service and the NCTA – that’s the National
Christmas Tree Association – not to be confused

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.719
with the National Cat Tickling Alliance – the
number of trees sacrificed in the name of

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.910
festive merriment each year, in the US alone
is around 25 to 33 million.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.750
Now, these numbers were procured from the
thousands of Christmas tree retailers in the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.309
states, but the stats don’t account for
the rugged traditionalists that trudge through

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.460
mounds of bone-chilling snow in the wilderness,
braving the elements to cut down their own

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.920
dang tree cause that’s how their daddy did
it.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.800
84% of the 33 million trees are of the pre-cut
types found on Christmas tree lots, or inside

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.900
garden centers, or even over the internet
because we live in some weird future society

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.920
where you can do that apparently, while the
remaining 16% fell victim to those who purchase

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.290
their trees from choose and cut lots, which
are tree farms where you choose your wooden

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.750
prize and cut it down with your own two hands.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.750
Exciting.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.549
Now, 33 million sounds like an alarming number
of trees whacked down in the name of presents,

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.220
and it is a lot, but remember, they’re harvested
from tree farms and the stock is constantly

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.479
replenished, 1 to 3 saplings for every timber
cried out into the cold winter night.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.260
In fact, according to the NCTA 350 million
trees are thriving on tree farms from over

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.880
15,000 growers in America right now.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.299
Remember, we’re just talking the United
States, if we add Europe to the arbor carnage,

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.780
that’s an extra 50 to 60 million chopped
for Christmas.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.600
Money-wise, each year, when it comes to x-mas
trees, Americans, on average, drop somewhere

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.649
around a billy.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.860
That’s a lazy way of saying a billion dollars.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.460
Now, it’s important to point out that there
are a lot of pros and cons associated with

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.750
Christmas Tree farming.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.619
Pro x-mas tree farm people point out that
the farms create thriving habitats for wildlife,

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.150
not just with a thick abundance of trees,
but with private ponds and waterways as well.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.850
The trees also stabilize soil and pump out
all sorts of oxygen into the air.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.380
And we like oxygen.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.390
Christmas tree opponents bah-humbug the situation
and highlight the use of pesticides and fertilizers

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.420
that ferry harmful chemicals into surrounding
environments.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.340
That’s not good.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.260
It’s feliz navibad.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.980
There could also be a negative effect on the
biodiversity of an area if all you got is

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.709
just row after row of douglas fir, which happens
to be one of the most popular types of trees

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.220
harvested for the season, along with the fraser
fir, balsam fir, Colorado Blue Spruce, Scottish

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.569
Pine, Virginia Pine, and the Eastern Red Cedar,
but in the end, choice really comes down to

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.920
what region of the world you spend the holidays.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.470
So everyone, what type of tree do you sing
carols around every year?

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.470
Fake?

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.470
Real?

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.470
Spruce?

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.470
Fir?

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.500
Do you do that cool upside down tree thing
that some people do?
