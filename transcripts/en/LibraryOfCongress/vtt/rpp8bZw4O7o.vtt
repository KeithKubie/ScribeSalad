00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.510
Ambassador Figueiredo.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.510

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.040
[ Background Noise ]

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.340
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.640
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.590
&gt;&gt; I'd like to thank you
all very much for joining us

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.790
for this conversation on the life
and work of Clarice Lispector.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.060
I'd like to thank first
Ms. Georgette Dorn,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.490
the chief of the Hispanic
division as well as the poetry

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.220 position:56%
and literature center of the Library
of Congress for hosting us today.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.910 position:56%
I couldn't think frankly of a better
venue to discuss Clarice Lispector,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.180
and I am pleased that we are able
to partner with Library of Congress

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.370
on such an important event.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.370
Last week I had the pleasure
of visiting the Library

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.680
and meeting librarian, David
Mao, and I was introduced

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:01.260
to the beautiful Portinari Murals
that are at the Hispanic division.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.400
For those who haven't been
there, I highly recommend it.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.110
I have also visited
the Maps division,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.690
which kindly organized a very
special exhibit with rare

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:29.420
and antique maps of my country
for what I am extremely grateful.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:37.670
Well, Vivaldo Santos and Benjamin
Moser frankly need no introduction.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.250
I will just say that those who
study Brazil in Washington will

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.180 position:56%
with no doubt have already been in
contact and met Professor Santos due

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:05.950
to his large and strong
work for the benefit

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.480
of the Brazilian culture
in the whole DC area.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.300
And it is indeed a privilege
for the Embassy to be able

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.250
to help bring Benjamin
Moser to Washington.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.310
He is, among many other
things, a celebrated biographer

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.020
of Clarice Lispector and the editor

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.420
of this newly released,
complete stories.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.660
The first comprehensive
English translation

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.380 position:56%
of Lispector's short stories on this
beautiful edition, very quickly,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.860
as you know, made the New
York Times last year's list

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.010
of 100 most notable books.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.290
It truly deserves it,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:13.470
and the attention it got only
reflects the depth and the span

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.880
of both the work of Clarice

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.890
but especially the
work of Benjamin Moser.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:34.370
Mr. Moser states in his biography
of Lispector that, and I quote,

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.290
"She was both Brazil's
greatest modern writer,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.650
and in the profound sense not
a Brazilian writer at all."

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:54.900
In my mind, I must say that
she really belongs to Brazil

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:03.580
as she once said and deserves her
place among the greatest Brazilian

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.470
authors of all times, but at the
same time, her deep understanding

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.960
of the human soul defies
all boundaries.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:24.490
And I am very excited
about the discussion here,

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:31.770
which sadly I will not be
able to continue to attend due

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.260
to other commitments,
but I can't help

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:45.290
but wonder how this mysterious
woman would react if she knew

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.870
that her work was to be discussed
at the Library of Congress

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.630
in Washington, a city
where she lived,

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.310
with such a nice and
interested public.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.060
I think in a certain way
that the answer to this

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:15.700 position:56%
and other questions will emerge in
the context of today's conversation.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:25.340
So without further ado, I simply
would like to thank you very,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.890
very much for your presence,

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.660
and I hope you have a
very interesting certainly

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.390 position:56%
and fruitful conversation about her.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.190
Thank you.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.720
[ Applause ]

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ben will now read some selections

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:52.740
for you before joining
Vivaldo for a conversation.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.380
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] Thank you,
Georgette, and Talia [phonetic]

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.660
and Gian [inaudible] and Vivaldo.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.960
It's great to be here.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.070
It's interesting to think what
Clarice, I'm always too tall

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.450
for these microphones
[laughter], it's interesting

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.960
to think what Clarice would
have thought about being here,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.750
being honored this way in the city
where she did live for the whole

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.970
of the 1950's almost,
and where she wrote a lot

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.180 position:56%
of the stores that are in this book.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.670 position:56%
And they're very -- it's
interesting to say she's a Brazilian

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.970
or she's not a Brazilian.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.490
They're very Brazilian, the
stories are actually more Brazilian

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.960
than the novels.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.540
I mean it's very much, these
women almost always women,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.770
living in a couple of
neighborhoods in Rio,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.670
and almost always doing
pretty much the same thing,

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.800
which is having their
peaceful lives interrupted

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.050
by some violent something.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.560
And it's very rarely a
violent event, like a shooting

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.860
or a murder or something.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.550
It's something that
happens inside them.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.200
It's something that
touches them somehow.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.290
And what's interesting,
I've written about Clarice,

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.240
so this is the first book that I
wrote about here, "Why This World,"

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.940
which is the biography that I
published in 2009, also in Brazil

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.130
and in the United States
and then in lots

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.580
of other countries
throughout the world.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.660
It's coming out in Holland
next week, which is why I have

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.210
to get back there, and
it keeps going on and on.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.510
But it's part of a series that's
now, this is now the seventh book

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.270
of this series, so there's five
of the novels that we've published

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.360
in English, and now the stories,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.660
and then six more coming,
so, you know, get ready.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.960
It's not going to be as fast.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.800
I mean I'm doing one a year.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.850
But having done that for so
long, I got a little bit,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.100
I wouldn't say bored, because I
always love Clarice, but it's a lot

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.770
of work doing other
things, you know,

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.070
I have real job besides
doing Clarice.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.370
It's been more than
12 years of this.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:53.770
And she -- the thing about
working with a truly great artist,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.500
or truly great writer, is
there is always more to say,

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.080
and when I was writing
the introduction to this,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.300
I thought haven't I already
said everything about her?

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.660
But it turns out I hadn't.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.850
And working through these stories
in this way, from her first story

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.840
that she publishes when she's 19
years old, and she's a student

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.630
to the stories that leaves
incomplete as sketches

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.980
on her death bed, which are
very fantastic stories too,

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.950
you see this entire woman's life
being written out in her life,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.120
throughout her life, but
also writing about how women,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.610
specifically change and grow.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.490
And so I wrote a little
thing about this.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.990 position:56%
I discovered this was the first time
a woman had ever done this anywhere,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:38.460
and this is -- if you are
familiar with feminist criticism,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.460
this is something that comes
up a lot, especially, you know,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.760
in the '60's and the
'70's when female cultural

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.880
and intellectual achievement
is starting to be reevaluated

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.460
and starting to be brought
out of the gutter, you know,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.330
where it was always relegated
because it was women.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.630
Even Virginia Woolf,
until the '70's,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.980
was not considered good
enough to be on any curriculum

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.540
in this country or in England.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.570
And so there was this work
for two or three generations

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:09.140
of female scholars who brought this
out of the closet and discovered.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.610
But one of the questions was
why had it not happened before.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.680
So I thought why it's interesting.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.660
She comes from an absolutely
destitute background.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.720
She comes from really
the dredges of society.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.250
I mean she comes from a very poor,
not even an immigrant background

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.170 position:56%
but a refugee background, and she
becomes by the time she's a teenager

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.830
and she's writing this
story, she becomes famous as,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.110
in the literary world of
Rio, but she becomes famous

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.480
as not only the most beautiful
girl in Rio de Janeiro,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.360
which was something, you
know, it's an accomplishment,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.510
but also this woman that
everybody knew was a genius.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.200 position:56%
And so I wrote this thing about her.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.360
I'll just read it briefly,
and then we can talk about it.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.530
This achievement -- oh,
okay, so "The other side

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.390
of silence is speech," and
there are a lot of silent women

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.850
in these stories, women who can't
speak or who are silent forcibly

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.390
by circumstances or by men.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:15.260 position:56%
"Today women as writers and women
as the subjects of women writers are

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.250
so familiar that it is hard to
believe that Clarice's respect

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:22.350
of characters or their lives
ever needed to be discovered.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.780 position:56%
But to see this work from the
perspective of what came after it is

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.010
to miss it's historical novelty.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.820
Clarice was fundamentally
without a tradition.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.930
She was an immigrant, and though
she had the ancient European Jewish

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.880
tradition behind her, that world,
particularly in the tiny shtetl

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.760
where she was born in
the western Ukraine,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.090
was not easily adaptable
to modern urban lives.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.560
In the literature of
the language she wrote,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.660
the subject of modern
women no more existed

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.400
than did woman writers themselves."

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.680
Now this is kind of amazing if you
think about what comes after it.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.980
There were a couple
of Brazilian women

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.780
who had written Cecelia
Morales [phonetic] and,

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.790
but I mean it was very, very tiny.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:09.040
And now I say, "In this respect
Portuguese was no different

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.250
from any other language,
and Brazil was no different

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.560
from any other country.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.280
Clarice was 9 when Virginia Woolf
asked a question Clarice later

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.970
quoted, 'Who shall measure the heat
and violence of the poet's heart

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.870
when caught entangled
in a woman's body?'

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.630
The question, Woolf believed,
applied as much to women

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.620
of her own day as it did
to women of Shakespeare's.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.040
This novelty explains some of
the fascination and confusion

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.160
that early readers of
Hurricaine Clarice,"

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.500
which is a title someone
gave her, a friend of hers,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.050
"one imagines a similar thrill of
discovery among the first readers

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.590
of Dickens and [inaudible] when
literature first cast it's light

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.340
on the working classes or when
gay readers first saw their lives

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.640
written about sympathetically

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.910
or when colonial people exchanged
the condescension of folklore

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.490
for the higher dignity
of literature.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.260
The astonishment her achievement
provoked is still palpable

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.060
in the yellowing scrapbooks
preserving the reviews

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.760
in Clarice Lispector's archives."

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.640
And so I want to just talk,
follow up about this a little bit

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.280
and about other things
too, and you're welcome

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.030
to ask us questions if you'd like.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:23.570
The phenomena of Clarice is
a really emotional thing.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:28.260
We were at Harvard the
other day, and Arthur said

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.170
that he finally understood

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.960
that Clarice is not a
writer, she's a church.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.710 position:56%
And it was really funny because
people, it was kind of a long event,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.630
and I was screaming because
there was no microphone,

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.960
but everybody got up.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.520 position:56%
It was like an evangelistic revival.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.820
Everybody wanted to talk,

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.040
and of course it was a
heavily Brazilian audience.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.710
And everybody wanted
to get up and talk

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.410
about how they have first met
Clarice and what she had done

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.740
to them and how she
had affected them,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.320
and it really did get a
little bit like a church.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.630 position:56%
I mean you felt like this isn't just
a writer that people read in the way

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.120
that you read something
that's outside of yourself,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:11.320
that you read to learn something
about, you know, navigation of,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.380
you know, Ferdinand
Magellan or something.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.480
You know, it's something that you
read because you learn something

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.850
about yourself and because
it affects you in a way

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.270
that is very hard to explain.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.460
It's nice when you have Brazilians
around because you don't have

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.600
to really explain that to people,
because anyone who would come

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.440
to an event who is Brazilian,
who is [inaudible] Portuguese,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.220
is obsessive almost by nature.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.730
So, that's kind of who
we're dealing with.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:37.230
We're not dealing with this iconic
great writer that is, you know,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.170
we're very respectful and you read
it because you have to at school,

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.920
you read it because you have to,
and if you're susceptible to her,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:50.130 position:56%
I think it's very easy to understand
why I would spend this much time

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.980 position:56%
on her, and why despite all the time
I've already put in her I'm excited

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.670
to go forward and publish the
remaining volumes in English.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.510
So, thanks for coming,
and Vivaldo, let's talk.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.510
[ Background Noise ]

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:12.520
[ Applause ]

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.420
&gt;&gt; I just would like to thank
the Library of Congress,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.430
the Hispanic division, for the
invitation and also [inaudible],

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.930
you know, sharing this
space with Ben,

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.190
and I feel very honored to be here.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:30.720
And first thing it is to start
a conversation but also to open

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.400
for comments and questions
as we start talking,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.360
and Ben, do you want to start?

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.710
Because you mentioned something
about this passion for Clarice.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.100
That was one of, as a professor,
having done my homework,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.570
I have all these questions,
but one thing about, for me,

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.890
when I read Clarice, and when I
read Clarice for the first time,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.670
there is something very
special about Clarice.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.350
It has to do with language, but
there is something about love,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.480
but not love in the idea of love
that we use for the romantic love.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.090
There is something
that goes beyond love.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.750
Love for a thing.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.160
Love for existence.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.470 position:56%
The minimum thing, the thing that we
had done, we can see, and there is,

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:17.620
I don't know, something that when I
read Clarice it makes me feel more,

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.230
let's say, more humane.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.660
It touched me in a certain way
that like she has something

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.360
that it goes deep inside myself,

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.690
and maybe you could talk
a little bit about that.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.930
&gt;&gt; Well I think that's a
little bit what I, what I,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.080 position:56%
what has kept me going for all these
years is that there's a feeling

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.830
of love that comes out
of her that's a very --

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.920
it's not this romantic love at all.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:46.790
Clarice is extremely violent, and
she's extremely cruel sometimes

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:51.510
to her characters, and yet there's
a feeling of love that comes out.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.650
And it's not -- she's very
much someone who comes

00:17:54.650 --> 00:18:00.210
out of an experience physically
and where she comes from in Europe.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.780
She comes from a place
of destruction.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.110
She comes from a place where
your life and you, yourself,

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.480
can be absolutely wiped off the map
for no reason with no explanation.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.330
So there's a real refusal
of, you know,

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.610
what's behind romantic is also
an idea of Christian love,

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:22.540
which is a love for an idea of
a world that can be humanized,

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.890
a world that can be
made to look like us

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.240
and to conform to our wishes.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.210
And, you know what they
say in the Baptist Church,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.620
not my will but thy will be done.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.180
She doesn't believe in any of that.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.690
She thinks you're going
to get destroyed

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.890 position:56%
and crushed like a roach [laughter].

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.890
And that is actually true.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.320
That is where we're all going
unless you believe in life

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.690
after death in some religious way.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.300
Physically that's what happens, and
that's what happens to the roach

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.070
in "The Passion According to G.H."

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.370
And that's a symbol for all of us.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:03.050 position:56%
You know, we are all just a bunch
of tendons and veins and gross stuff

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.530 position:56%
that you don't even want to look at.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.910
I mean you often can't look
at, and that's the thing.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.890
I saw, I was interviewing a
photographer the other day

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.170
in connection with my biography
[inaudible] and I'm writing

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.080
about [inaudible], which is,
you know, part of this history

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.610
of photography, and this guy, I was
talking to him, and as he said oh,

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.140
look on my website, and
there's all this stuff.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.650
And he had gone to medical school.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.340
And I said, okay, I'll look on your
[inaudible], so I clicked on it.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.500
And he had taken all
these pictures of surgery

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.280
and what happens in surgery.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.240 position:56%
All very beautifully lit, like the
Rembrandts that you see in The Hague

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.650
or in Amsterdam, of dissections.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.900
And that was actually,
I thought of Clarice,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.800
because you can't actually
look at it.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.760
It is horrifying to
look at, like a brain,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.360
a thing with like blood everywhere.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.170
I mean I guess doctors
get used to this,

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.200
but most people don't
like to look at it.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.500
They don't like to think

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.630
of what they're actually
made of, which is that.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:04.480
And, so she rejects this, this
aestheticized, humanized version

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.800
of life, but at the same time, and
this is a really great richness

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:15.410
of her, she accepts that
status of us as mortal beings,

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.680
and she elevates it in
this absolutely divine way.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.980 position:56%
So she makes the stuff that we don't
want to think about and historicize

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.440
or aestheticize, and she makes
it, she makes it beautiful.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.130
And I think that's maybe one of the
reasons that people are so grateful

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.450
to her, because she gives you
a way of going into your life

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:38.580
and not understanding it in
some mythological fate way

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.710
but in a very real way that accepts

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.690
and that understands
what we really are.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.990
&gt;&gt; And I agree with you.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.790 position:56%
And I also think that it is a, I
think Clarice is different from most

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.150 position:56%
of the existentialists who think
that, you know, [inaudible] nothing,

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.930
and she goes beyond that.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.840
I think you mentioned that in
your biography about [inaudible]

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.130
for example, because I
think for Clarice it seems

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.830
to me there is a need for
confrontation with the self,

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:12.690
for who we are, and in order to
really, is ours like a search,

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:17.730
like daily to the existence, which
it seems to me she always kind

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.330
of [inaudible] what's after
that, what after [inaudible],

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.210
but she really, and the one thing
that really calls my attention

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.430
when I read her, she really,
you know, all those things

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:33.370
that we don't want to see, kind of
objects, that she forces us to look

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.570 position:56%
at them and to learn that we have
this, we also have this very nature,

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:43.390
human but also very close nature to
ourselves, and we need to embrace

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.850
that kind of nature
as a whole being.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.670
&gt;&gt; Well that's interesting because,
you know, it essentially forces you

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.950
to look at things that
you don't want to look at.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.600
That could mean two things.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.740
I'm very much opposed to, and I
very much don't watch, for example,

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.540
violent films or films about
murdering children or this kind

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.700 position:56%
of stuff that I don't want to watch,
and I know this exists in the world.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.660 position:56%
I think we all so, but it's not that
kind of forcing you to look at stuff

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.100
that you didn't want to look
at in a voyeuristic way,

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.420
because that's something that
also comes up in the history

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:21.550
of topography, whether there's
a picture of war that is meant

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:26.070
to educate and spur people to
action, and what is just obscenity.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.370
Clarice is never.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.450 position:56%
I mean Clarice is extremely elegant,

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.780
and her language is extremely
beautiful, and part of the project

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.210
of translating all of
these books, you know,

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.910
I coordinated this project, and
I said it's now the sixth volume

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.900
that we've done, is
getting that language right.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.750 position:56%
Because if you don't get the
language then it can become shocking

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.050
in the wrong way.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.030
It should be shocking
in a right way.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.790
It should be both extremely
beautiful

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.880
and extremely appalling often.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.070
And in these very, you know,
she lived in Chevy Chase,

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.810
Maryland, for many years.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.990
She was a very, she looked like
an upper middle class housewife.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.970
You know, she was married
to a diplomat.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.270
She had really nice clothes.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.320
She had good hair.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.620
She had nice makeup.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.650
And all of the stuff that she
just takes off in these stories.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.790
She just strips it all away, and
she shows what's really happening.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.410
And, but it's never obscene.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.480
It's just a way of, it's, she
thinks, I think she thinks the hair

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.850
and makeup and things like this
are really important to people.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.510
She's not, she thinks
that's it important

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.610
to have a face to present
to the world.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:41.220
You can't walk around with exposed
intestines all the time, which,

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.310
you know, you have to have a
way of getting through your day

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:48.550
and then picking up your kids
and going to the grocery shop,

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.490
and that's what she writes about.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:57.210
And because she situates in these
very ordinary, recognizable parts

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:01.720
of the world, it's even more
powerful than [inaudible].

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.430
&gt;&gt; You mentioned the
question of language.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:09.250
I think it's a very key, language
plays a very key role in the whole,

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:14.400 position:56%
in Clarice's work, and also I think,
[inaudible] my questions has to do

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.330 position:56%
with translation also, you know,
you are challenged to translate some

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.630
of the kind of language in Clarice

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.080
that there is a similar
function, not very direct.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.740
There is always like.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.750 position:56%
I know one thing about when you read
Clarice, for example, you have to,

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.130
I don't want to say force, but
I write, and so for [inaudible]

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.290
to words, words have
different layers,

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.420
and it seems like Clarice is
always trying to reveal something

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:45.090 position:56%
when she chooses a word that makes
us kind of dig and dig for some sort

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.100
of meaning to kind of escape, and
she's always kind of, as I said,

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.360
I go back to the idea of
excavation, and in her literature,

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:57.210
all this digression, interspection,
and how do you deal with that

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.590
in terms of working with
her in translating -- --

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.750 position:56%
Well, I mean, it should be said, I
don't know, I think I'm just looking

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.930
at faces, I would say there's
half Brazilian's here today.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.700
Is that about right?

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.670
I would say if you read her
in Portuguese the funny thing

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.390
about her is that she doesn't sound
like a normal Portuguese writer.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.940 position:56%
I mean there's not a single sentence
in Clarice that's a normal way

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.260
that any Brazilian
would say anything.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.790
And yet it's very readable.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.820
I mean you always know
what she is saying.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.290 position:56%
It's not obscure in a way that like,

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.650
you might [inaudible]
that's obscure,

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.790
that you think, what does she mean.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.090
But, and you'll probably
never know because it's

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.670
like an [inaudible] song
from the middle ages.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.300
But with her you know
what she's saying but then

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.120
when you actually try to
figure out what she's saying,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.740
as a translator does, and so, you
know, I've worked with about six,

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.680
I guess five, six translators,
bringing these works out,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.880
and my job is in a lot of ways,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.440
I mean of course it's
an editorial role

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.970
of like correcting people's
Portuguese if they miss a word

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.430
or that kind of thing, but it's
more trying to get a unified voice

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.890
for her because in Portuguese
it's such a recognizable voice,

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.830
and when you actually go
through it word by word,

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.130
it's extremely difficult.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.710 position:56%
And so my introduction to the story,

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.880
I mean in the biography this is
the whole story of that, of how,

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.720 position:56%
why her language is so strained, but
if you go through it word by word,

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.830
the sentences just fall apart.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:26.060
They actually don't mean
anything, or they mean everything.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.240
But the degree to which you as
a reader are supposed to fill it

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.490
in is really exciting, actually,
and it's one of the things

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.610
that draws you into her because
you want to get closer to it,

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:39.520
and you feel that this is something
really grandiose and spectacular,

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.060
and I don't totally get it.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:46.380
So you have a kind of feeling of
being somewhere and kind of like

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.640
in a museum where you think like
all the other stuff is like right

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.230
in the next gallery but it might
be closed and you might have to go

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.750
around somewhere else,
and you might have to --

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.120
so it kind of sucks you in.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:00.610 position:56%
There's a labyrinth feeling to her,
and she, as I write about it anyway,

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.280
this world, she, her idea

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.450
of language really does
come from Jewish mysticism.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.360
And this becomes very obvious
that she has that tendency,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.290
which is to move words around, to
move things around, to try to hint

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.930 position:56%
at something that you can never see.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.170 position:56%
And the ultimate thing you can
never see and you can never reach it

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.170
in Jewish mystical practice is the
name of God, which is something

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:28.520
that you both are obliged
to seek, while still knowing

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.240
that you'll never find it
because if you speak the name

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.150
of God then you bring about the
end of the world, literally,

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.530
so you shouldn't do it,
and you can't do it.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.830
But you have to do anyway.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.710
So this is -- it has all
these metaphorical extensions

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.380
so you know you have
to put on makeup and go

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.970
to school every day even though
you know you're going to die.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.130
You know, you have to do all these
things in life that are useless,

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.300
and, you know, I have
to write books.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.730 position:56%
And we were at the other side of the
street yesterday, and they showed

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.450 position:56%
that they treat books for a thousand
years at the Library of Congress.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:05.350
So they put them in gas
chambers, and they, and they,

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.010
and they treat them with some
gas, is that right [inaudible]?

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.310
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.610
Okay. I don't know.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:16.250
But, yeah, and they treat them,

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:20.520
and that guarantees them a
life of a thousand years.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.140
Okay. Well even if a thousand
years is a really long time,

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.840
a lot of barbarians
could invade the District

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.320
of Columbia before a
thousand years is up.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.510
I mean a lot of things happen in
the District, so you don't know

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.870
that it will be preserved,
but even if it is preserved

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.170
for a thousand years, you know,

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.840
what is a thousand years
compared to geology?

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.720
So, we all do these things.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.790
I mean, I write these books,
and she wrote these books,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.330
and I'm very positive, and
she was happy about them.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.560
But they're gone, you
know, in a certain time,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:53.640
and so you do all these things
not because you are denying that

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.100 position:56%
but because you are knowing that and
because you want in that short space

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.700
that you're allowed in the world
to make something beautiful

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.270
and to leave something behind and
to make something of yourself,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:10.010
but not in a delusional,
grandiose way, in a humble way.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:14.370
&gt;&gt; You mentioned the idea
of [inaudible] for example,

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:19.620
when I read [inaudible] it starts
with, everything starts with a yes

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.520
and ends with a yes, but you
also kind of [inaudible] sense

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.490
of history, like a
prehistory of time and things,

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.890
there is always this continuous
surge, and you mentioned language.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:35.650
To me it seems very funny, Clarice
is very funny when you read her,

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:39.070
especially like if you
read, Macabea for example,

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.570
the way she uses language,
we kind of laugh

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:44.600
because Macabea is described as
seeming kind of idiot, stupid,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.310
but there is something
about the kind.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.220
She is a deep ignorant.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.090
And Clarice says like there
is a beauty in ignorance

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.540
that she is trying to
create this character

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.830
that doesn't know anything,
that's really learning about life,

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.040 position:56%
that really experiences language for
the first time, kind of preverbal.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.060
It's kind of a child,
almost an animal.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.950
And Clarice is always kind of
going after that kind of character

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.130
and like [inaudible] kind of
preverbal language as you mentioned

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.780
in the Jewish tradition, like
of the mystic, like of digging

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.810
and to reach something
that [inaudible] you.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:26.380
&gt;&gt; Well in Macabea, you know,
this is the character in "The Hour

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.220
of the Star," which is Clarice's
last book where Macabea,

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.960
as you know, if you know anything
about Brazilian literature,

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.260
you know that she is killed,

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.150
and the reason you know this is
there has been all these movies,

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.360
and you know, it's just,
and it's a tiny book,

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.070
so it's not really
giving anything away,

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.540
and she pretty much says
this at the beginning.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.000
Macabea is like this roach.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.440
She just gets smushed.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.130
She gets run over in a car.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:52.020
And yet in that time that
she has, she is still able

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.980
to create something really
beautiful that is behind knowledge.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.170
You know, so it's funny to be
writing about Susan Sontag,

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.420
who is somebody who so believed
in the mind and in the knowledge.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.720
Clarice doesn't.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.020
Clarice was not an intellectual.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.780
She was always looking for --
at the same time we should say,

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.420
she was one of the
most learned women

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.200
of her generation and
not only in Brazil.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.590
I mean she was one of
the first journalists,

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.190
one of the first lawyers
in Latin America.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.490
She was a very, obviously
very intelligent person,

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.440
but she wasn't interested in
book learning and footnotes.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.920
You know, she was interested
in learning

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.430
about what the world
was really like.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.290
I mean that's why my book
is called "Why this World."

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.440
She was interested in
these much bigger questions

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.460
that could be obscured by all this,
what she would call sophistication,

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.470
which, so it's, you know,
I have a lot of views

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.470
of why she calls the first
title is [foreign language],

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.770
you know beyond the [inaudible].

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:44.140
She is interested in that and
not what's on the surface.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.190
So that's reflective
[inaudible], and it's very fun.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.660
I mean I have to say it's
really fun to work with her

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.020
because you always are seeing
something that you wouldn't see.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.950
And it's often really stupid stuff.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.750
That's what's great about
Clarice, it's so obvious

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.480
that you would never have
thought of it [laughter].

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.600
And that's really something that
I have found time and again.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.110
I think, God, I can't
believe I never thought

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.450
of that, it's so obvious.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:13.100
But it's almost the kind of stuff
that children say, for example.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.170
And you think, wow,
that was really well put

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:16.470
for a three-year-old [laughter].

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.890
And like a grownup would
never have said it.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.190
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] what
you just mentioned,

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.500
if I think Clarice
said someone asked her

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:29.470
like she has the reputation of
[inaudible] I understand myself.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.070
&gt;&gt; And it's very interesting
what you are saying

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.090
because when I read
Clarice it does, you know,

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.780 position:56%
the first time you think she's
talking about something like is hard

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.930
to understand, but basically
if she is looking at things,

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.160
basically through like
a lamp that makes things

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.460
like really reveal things
to you, the basic things,

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.310
like an egg that breaks when in
shopping, and we start, you know,

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.470
this is like [inaudible], things
that happen in daily life,

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:59.000
and the way she presents it,
it makes us do, you know,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.490
it's like this is basic life,
and she's very grounded.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.020
There is a [inaudible]
botanic garden [inaudible] one

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:10.700
of her short stories, you know,
you think she is talking about kind

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.890
of Eden garden, something
very obscure,

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:19.980
like she says describing
how things really are.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:26.350 position:56%
Just emphasizing nature for example,
so there is nothing existential,

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:31.610
thinking about existentialist,
like [inaudible] for example,

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:35.710 position:56%
but when you read, it's like this is
just her way of looking at things.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:39.130
It's very direct, and it's very
[inaudible] like the chicken,

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.690
for the chicken and
the egg, for instance.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.220
It was very simple, very direct.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.530
&gt;&gt; It's very simple, and then it's
very, very, very sophisticated.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:49.910
I mean that's what fun about
going through it as an editor,

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.280
as a translator, as a
philographer, is you get a chance

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.020
to read her not only from A to
Z, which is always interesting,

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.980
I think in any writer,

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.610
to read everything they wrote
is really a great experience.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:01.910
I mean if it's a good writer.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.210
If it's a bad writer, it's
a horrible experience,

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.540
but you know it's somebody
that was worth talking

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.560
about in the first place,
you see this evolution,

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.340
and you see how the
directness is there,

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.430
and the obscurity is there too.

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:15.850
It's fun to be able to
both understand something

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.730
and not understand something, and
with her, and a lot of the stories,

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:24.400 position:56%
especially they're very much on the
surface, they're very direct stories

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.900 position:56%
of some, you know, like I don't know
who he was talking about coming back

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:32.800 position:56%
from the grocery store, and she has
these eggs, the tram kind of shifts,

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:41.590
and the eggs break in her grocery
bag, and this drives her insane.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.890
Literally.

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:48.450
By the time she gets off the train
she is nuts, and then she goes

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:50.830
to the garden and she
sees these plants.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:53.800 position:56%
And so instead of saying isn't
nature beautiful, she says something

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.380
like it was full of rotting brains.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.000
You know, there were all these like
flowers that were just fading away

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.400
on the ground and all this stuff
and in nature was this cool thing.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.390
And she, but, again, just as
happens in normal people's lives,

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.760 position:56%
and it certainly happens in my life,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:17.350
and I'm sure that anyone here knows
this feeling, is you do get back

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.490
to [inaudible] and go
to the dinner party.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.330
You know. You have these
moments and you're just like, oh,

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.880
the world falls apart and it's
just like you're never [inaudible].

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.820
But most people unless you
really go mad, which does happen,

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.620
and it happened to Clarice's
son, which is a very, you know,

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.480
he had that over sensitivity
that she had, but she could go

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.410
and she could come back,
and go, and come back.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.550
And he just went.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:49.290
And she writes not about him but
she does write about the mad.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.920
Most people don't go mad.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.390
Most people get on with it.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.470
Most people figure it out, and
they get up, and they go on.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.170
And I think that, there's
a beauty to that, really,

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:03.520
is that you can step out
of your life for no reason,

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.170
and it can be a myth,
and you come back,

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:11.910
and then you go on
because you have to.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:15.340
&gt;&gt; I think we, I want to open
the questions and comments,

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.850
and we can throw out
questions [inaudible].

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:21.770
Is there a microphone.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.470
&gt;&gt; Or you can just shout.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:25.770
&gt;&gt; I'll protect.

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.070
&gt;&gt; Okay. Good [laughter].

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.170
&gt;&gt; So you just touched a
very interesting subject

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.620
for me, which is madness.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:42.570
And she talks about madness
throughout a lot of stories

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:54.580 position:56%
and a lot of books, so I was like
interested in hearing what you think

00:36:54.580 --> 00:37:03.140
about what her idea of madness was
and if that had any relationship

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:08.480
with what she calls
freedom all the time.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.120
She's also searching for freedom,
debating with her freedom,

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.590
and talks about that all the time.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:17.730
&gt;&gt; Well freedom, you know, is
something she is very skeptical of.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.990
She is not interested in
political freedom particularly,

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.550
and this is why.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:28.540
I mean she writes a lot of this
stuff during the dictatorship

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:34.600
in Brazil, and of course, I mean
she is what we would consider a,

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.890
in this country she would
be a democrat, you know.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:44.140
She is a pretty left-wing
but not communist,

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:48.260
which in that day was a big divide,

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.250
especially anywhere
in Latin America.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.880
She was, you know, what we consider
a pretty normal center-left person,

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.320
so of course she was
against torture,

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.480
she was against dictatorship,
all these things,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.180
but that wasn't the
freedom that interested her.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.070
The freedom that interested her was
a kind of soul freedom and a kind

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.420
of how do you, how do you
create yourself in the sense

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.720
that allows you to
experience freedom.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.020
She would never think that
freedom was a permanent state.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.350
You know, something that you
once, like a city that you get to

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.790
and then you just check into
a hotel and you stay there.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.230
You know, it's something you
can visit, but there's all sorts

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.530
of freedoms just in people's lives.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:15.830
The madness question, I mean
the real book about madness

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:17.130
that I think is interesting
that's in the next series

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.720
that we'll be publishing is "The
Apple in the Dark," Maca no escuro,

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.370
which is an experience of mystic
madness, and it takes place

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.020
as always with her in this very
boring place, which is this farm

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.320
in the interior of [inaudible]
but it's not really named,

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.990
you know, kind of nowhere, Brazil.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:30.060
You know, it's just a farm,
and it's a few people sitting

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.890
on the farm doing things,
and he cleans out the stables

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:35.480
and he milks the cows and
all this kind of stuff,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.300
and he realizes he is insane.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:44.590
And she writes in that
book a lot about how,

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:48.590
how this delusion can
lead to a mystically

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.260
and spiritually productive thing.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:54.520
The man, Martin, as in Martin,
he thinks he has killed his wife.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.470
Now you don't really hear this
until the very end of the book.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:01.860 position:56%
When you think it, you think, wow,
he killed his wife, that's terrible.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.200
It's going to be like Agatha
Christie or something.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.180
But she doesn't, she's not
interested in that at all.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.350
This, this crime, and this is why
it's the apple, like "The Apple

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:17.530
in the Dark," the apple is
knowledge from the tree of Eden.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:23.630
He uses this crime to achieve this
mystical knowledge, but it's not --

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:27.740
it's like she thinks that
madness is a productive state,

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.920
but she also knows
what real madness is.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.660
I mean there are a lot of
writers, like if you think

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:37.560 position:56%
in Brazilian terms, like [inaudible]
or some of these people who think

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.150
of madness as sort of
admirable in some ways.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.730
She does not think
madness is admirable.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.810
I mean this is part of
her being a normal person.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.650
She does not, she knows
what madness is.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.830
Madness is shocking and
horrifying, and it destroys people

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.460
and it destroys everyone
around them.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.610
So it's a more productive
creative artistic madness,

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.830
and that was something
that she channeled a lot,

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.250
but she never entirely ceded to.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:03.980
Although, you know, it's
pretty clear at the end

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.950
of her life she wants to.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.970
She would like to give in.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.270
You know, she dies very young.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.350
She's only 56 when she dies.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:15.330
And you feel, when you read this
last book that she's ready to go.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:18.590
Like you don't think, wow, I
wish she'd live 25 more years,

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:20.540
like she really was done.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.730
And artistically she was
done, and she creates this arc

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:27.010
in her work that is complete.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:32.220
Like Macabea, "The Hour of the
Star," that's her last book,

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.870 position:56%
and that's exactly how it should be.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.930
She says, the last word is yes.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.000
And then she's off stage.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.070
So, I don't know, there's -- yeah?

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:48.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay, maybe you already answered
it, but anyway, one of my questions,

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.360
do you think she was
attached to life

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.450
and how [inaudible] was
related to it or not.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.320
&gt;&gt; I think, well yes,
she was attached to life.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.620
She really did love life.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:02.100
And she's not a dreadful, sad,
black person, you know, like, uh,

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.960
just everything's heavy
and miserable.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.260
She's not that person at all.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.160
She's actually, and the humor
that you see, also not just jokes

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.920
and things like this,
because she's very Jewish.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.570
I mean those jokes are sometimes
like, Groucho Marx sometimes.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:16.800
I mean there's like a
certain voice there.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.150
But she was very funny,
and she was very fun.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.450
People loved her.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:24.870
You know, it's very interesting
to compare it with Susan Sontag,

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:27.940
who everybody was interested
in, but, and people love her,

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.750
but they also hated
her, you know, so it's,

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.210
but everybody loved Clarice.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.360
Nobody, and I've talked to
hundreds of people about her

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.910
in Brazil and all over the world.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.210
People loved her.

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:42.790
I mean sometimes she'd be in a bad
mood or something, but she was,

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:45.210
her attachment to life
was very physical.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.550
It was very sensual too.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.900
It was about water or a book

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:55.500
or it wasn't outside what
her life actually held.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.800
She loved animals.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.100
She loved children.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.080
You know, she was a very normal
person in some ways except

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.390
that she was a great genius.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.810
We were just at Emily
Dickinson's house last week.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.110
And it's sort of similar,

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:11.550
I mean except that Emily Dickinson
never left her room for four years,

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.970 position:56%
but you get a feeling of Emily
Dickinson that you could portray her

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:21.370
as crazy, but in fact what
he wanted to do was write,

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:25.950
and she chose that in a world where
that was a hard choice to make,

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.660
even for a woman like
Emily Dickinson or at least

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.960
from an intellectual family

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.580
and who had enough money
to be able to do it.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:38.950
She loved it, and the writing
is full of that joy, I think.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and she said something
about like, I quote actually

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.400
from your book, "When I
don't write I'm dead."

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.220
&gt;&gt; She always this thing, that
writing is the way for her

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.940
to overcome death, the
meaning of writing, you know,

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.890
so you see that all over
her text and everything.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.290
I think, and now she
mentions in her, you know,

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.890
interview like how she loves,
she doesn't consider herself,

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:05.370
or didn't consider herself a writer
but more like a mother, you know,

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:09.420
things like that, and she really,
you know, all this negativity

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.630
that we see in this tradition, but
she is not, as been pointed out,

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:18.800
she is not that negative in
terms of the dark view of life.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.820
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit about
what the translator [inaudible]

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.600 position:56%
or how you guys work together and --

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.650
&gt;&gt; Well, so as I said,
Katrina, who did this book, was,

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:39.530
I keep getting it wrong, I think
it's seven books, so it's five,

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.080
so she's the sixth in the series
of translators who have done it,

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.350
because we've done it, it's a
project that's pretty interesting.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:49.300 position:56%
I'll just speak about it for one
second, but Portuguese is a language

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.870
like most languages actually.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.040
Unless it's Spanish or French,

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.810
most language are underrepresented
by good translators.

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.610
So this is what you're starting
out with if you think I want

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.320
to translate a great Brazilian.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.440
Well, the problem is there's
not many people to do it.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.700
So I liked, I mean
me and the publisher,

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.400
we decided to take younger people,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.590
who hadn't really had
much experience,

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.500
and give them a classic author
and work with them, you know,

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.560
line by line and page by
page and with the idea

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.280
that we would then create new
people who would then go out

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.330
and translate other stuff and
make it easy for Brazilians to be

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.420
in English because now that English
is so dominant internationally,

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.720
it's very hard -- oh thank you --

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.280
it's very hard, it's very hard
having an international career

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.480
if you're not translating
into English.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.970
It used to be you could
be translated into German.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.270 position:56%
You could be translated into French.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:42.670
You could be translated
into Spanish.

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:47.190
So what we, well I guess
what my role, I mean,

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:51.580 position:56%
and then you can hear a little bit
about what Katrina did specifically,

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.880
but the, every translator just

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.880
like every person has
a very different voice.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.600
So the real challenge for me and
for Katrina, who was the last

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:08.690
of the series, I mean and more will
be coming, but would be not only

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:12.740 position:56%
to make Clarice's voice unified in
English, but also to make it unified

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:17.910
in terms of how the other people
wrote Clarice, which is otherwise

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:21.170
when I translated Clarice,
in another language,

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:25.660
and so there was a real,
it's a challenge in two ways.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:31.420
Not only is Clarice difficult,
but it has to be in the series

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.460
without sacrificing
individual voices,

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.490
and I think Katrina's real talent

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:42.310
for this was not only having this
one voice of [inaudible] and of my,

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:46.220
whatever we invented for her,
but also in a book like this

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.260 position:56%
that has a million voices because
there's all these different stories.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.580
I mean if you're translating
a novel,

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.030
no matter how difficult the novel
is, it's basically you get it,

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.900
you figure out how to do
it, and then you keep going

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.720
and then to the end, you know.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.350
But here it's like five pages

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.850
and then you have a totally
difficult voice, new characters,

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.060
and new social and economic
and political circumstances,

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:11.840
and newer times, and so it's a very
difficult thing, and, you know,

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.140
she just won the [inaudible]
translation prize last week,

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:21.200
or this week, and you
know, so it's a really,

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:26.420
I think that is a recognition of
just how daunting this project is.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.560
It's not easy, to put it mildly.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.430
So, I saw, next door to
you was somebody else.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.230
Yeah?

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:56.590
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:57.890
Well I talk a little
bit about [inaudible].

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:01.560
She lived at 4311 Ridge
Road, if anybody is familiar

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:06.240
with Chevy Chase, which I went
there last time I was in Washington

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.770
about six months ago, and it's
funny because it's the only house,

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.940
you know, this being America
we carry down anything that's

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:18.130 position:56%
over 20 years old, so all the houses
on the street are gone and replaced

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.370
by McMansions, you know, except for
her house, which is still there.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:27.130 position:56%
And I actually wanted to go, maybe
if people want to come we can all go

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:29.130
and it can be a little
trip [laughter].

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:32.630
I wanted to get in the house,
and I schlepped out there.

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:36.130 position:56%
It was like a $70 cab ride, you know
how, I mean, or Uber or whatever,

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:39.500
so we went out there, and
it was really freezing.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.460
It was really cold.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:43.290
This was maybe two years ago.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:44.590
It wasn't last summer.

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:46.600
It was winter, because it was cold.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:53.190
And there was Clarice's living room
and her front door and her window

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.680
and all this stuff that
really felt exciting

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.520
for people who are into her.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.900
Just to think of her on this boring
suburban street writing these

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.000
completely insane books, one after
the next, with her perfect hair

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.880
and going to the Embassy
receptions and then,

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.660
you know, taking care of the kids.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:16.090
You just, it's amazing to see it
if you have that in your head.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:20.200
I'm really hopeful -- Paolo,
her son, wrote me yesterday.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.820 position:56%
He said, oh, you know, go see if the
house on Chevy Chase is still there

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.120
because that's where he was born.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.790
Actually he was born at
George Washington Hospital,

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:31.790
but he grew up there, and he said
for me the word, what was it?

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:35.350
He said homesick always came
for me before [inaudible].

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:40.970
Because he was then, you know,
she separates from her husband

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.990
and returns to Brazil in 1959,

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:47.510
and he was an English-speaking
kid who was from Washington.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:50.270
I mean he went to school
and Chevy Chase,

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:56.060
and suddenly he's brought back
to this world of Brazil at an age

00:48:56.060 --> 00:49:00.180
where he was certainly
old enough to know

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.470 position:56%
that he had left something behind
and he had -- you know, it was hard,

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:05.290
and his parents broke up.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.640
So, you know, Washington is
an important place for him.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.800
Not only is it his birthplace, and
it was an important place for her,

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.160
and the writer's that she had
here were only two really.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.690
Brazilians will always, well
anyone international will come

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.990
through Washington.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.290
I mean it's a big city.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:22.590
It's the capitol.

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.890
People do show up here,
but the only people

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.190
which really lived
here were [inaudible]

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.580
who were her best friends.

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:32.160
And [inaudible] was a very famous
writer from the south of Brazil,

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.640
[inaudible], and he was, he
was the head of something

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.500 position:56%
at the Organization for American
States, like some, one of those jobs

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.130
that people have there [laughter].

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:47.840
And so they came here,
and they drank milkshakes

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.440
and they took pills.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.600
They took like, I can't
remember what it was.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.190
You know those pills that
people took in the 50s

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:58.360
where you would fall asleep in the
middle of the street [laughter].

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.810
She and [inaudible] would do that

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:05.210
and just spend the afternoon
being zoned out in a diner.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.940
That's a great image.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:10.070
I mean if there's any painters
here, I would, you know,

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.640 position:56%
it's like an Edward Hopper painting.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:17.380
Clarice and [inaudible] in a diner,
like slumped over the milkshake.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.450
But, you know, but she, Washington
never shows up in her work.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:24.390
Europe, where she lived for many
years, never shows up in her work.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:25.730
She went all over the place.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.030
The only places she's
really interested

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:29.820
in is Rio and [inaudible].

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.400
She does write about
[inaudible], she does write

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.310
about San Paul [phonetic],
she doesn't, you know,

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:37.440
the place of her childhood
and her early years,

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.810
that's all she writes about.

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:44.750
Yeah? Go ahead.

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:49.700
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, [inaudible]
the biography you wrote,

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:56.600 position:56%
what I was wondering is because I
only [inaudible] how can a foreigner

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.150
read in Portuguese.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:00.990
I mean of course you could
translate it as you said,

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.820 position:56%
you've got to be careful [inaudible]
people have a sense of that.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.950
But when you're reading
in Portuguese, I mean,

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:08.630
I don't know how even
how to say this.

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:12.250
I mean, today, would you compare,
I don't knew Portuguese by then

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:16.930 position:56%
and when you found out about here,
but if you compare the understanding

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:19.730
or the grasp or the
depth, I don't know,

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:23.950
or because for me it was something
almost like an impossible task

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:28.790
to think how can you
actually get it.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:32.110
&gt;&gt; Well, my Portuguese is good.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:35.250
Well that's [inaudible] but,
and it became better, an better,

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.000
and better, and I'd
read her for many years,

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.370
and I guess the real answer,

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:40.800
I mean Portuguese is
something you can learn.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.100
You can learn a language.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:46.630
You go, you get a dictionary,
and you know, you study it.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.760
There are classes, you know,
for these things [laughter],

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.130
but the thing is that
really, I mean it's funny,

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:54.790
with Clarice like you
either understand her

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.250
or you don't understand here.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:57.800
And you can actually
understand a lot

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.350
if you don't know Portuguese
very well, if you understand her.

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:02.720
If you don't understand her,
I can't explain it to you.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.140
And that happens with Brazilians
who just don't understand her.

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.320
They think eh, like I don't
understand why are these people

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.620
obsessed with her.

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.800
And so you can't, but I would
say that as a more general answer

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.300 position:56%
to that everybody, every reader's
experience of a writer is different,

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.190
and whether it's a language, I
mean, you're woman, for example,

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:22.090
you'll read her differently
than I will.

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:24.030
You know, you come from
somewhere different.

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:25.610
You have a different
life experience.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.300
You read different books
when you were a kid.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:34.370
You know, maybe, I don't know,
maybe you're black, or you're gay,

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:36.860 position:56%
or your Mexican, or you're whatever,

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:38.280
you're going to bring
something different to it.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:45.680
So, I don't have any
thinking that what I have dug

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.760
out of her is the final word.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.650
You know, if Clarice [inaudible]
you know, Clarice [inaudible],

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:52.460
this is the title of the
biography [inaudible]

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.620
because that wasn't my idea.

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:59.200
That was somebody else's
idea, but it was because it's,

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.960
there's never a final word on her.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.470
There's a never a period.

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:08.940
So, you know, you take, I'm I miss
a lot of stuff, but with Clarice,

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.830
it's such a rich quality of work

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:13.870
that you're always going
to miss something, so --

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:16.020
&gt;&gt; I have a question for you.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.320
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh?

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.620
&gt;&gt; What you say about
she was full of life,

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:22.600
and I believe "Agua Viva" is one
of the books that does show that.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.020
She is taking the moment.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:29.340
&gt;&gt; Here and now, and she's kind
of full of life in that book.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.610
And then you say about
the "Maca no escuro,"

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:35.160
it's completely [inaudible],
the other side.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:40.180
How do you, how do you feel when
you did "Aqua Viva" for example?

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.030
&gt;&gt; Well that's an interesting
comparison actually because

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:43.530
"Agua Viva" is really tiny.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:47.340
It's like 80 pages long,
and it's written like wow,

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.140
here's this crazy lady writing
[inaudible], woo, woo, you know.

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:55.810 position:56%
And actually it took her years, and
years, and years to write that book.

00:53:55.810 --> 00:54:02.020
It's very, very carefully written,
and if you see the manuscripts,

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:06.460
she goes through I think five
full total rewrites of that book.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.800
"Maca no escuro" was the
other book that she rewrote.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.360
She actually rewrote it 11
times, which is just horrible

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.930
because that's her longest book,
and it's like 500 pages almost.

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:20.600
And you just, I mean,
it's a hard book to read.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.900
It's very intense.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.290
And thinking about writing it
is even worse, and then thinking

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:27.230
about rewriting and then
rewriting and rewriting,

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:31.070
so actually those books are more
similar than they look like,

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:32.790
but this is 20 years later,

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:36.410
and Clarice has this much
more poetic style by then.

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:38.620
She's removed all these
elements of the plot.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:39.920
If you read "Maca no escuro,"

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.540
she never was interested
in the plot anyway.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:46.300
I mean it's like 300 pages of like,
he's like cleaning up the bathroom,

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.600
you know, whatever he's doing.

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.250
I mean nothing really happens.

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:50.600
You know, there's a,
if you remember,

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.390
there's the rain storm
that's coming.

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:56.100
I think it takes like 400 pages
for the rain storm to come.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.250
Like it really just comes, and
they're like no another day

00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:00.780
and no rain, and there's the cloud.

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.920
It's getting a little closer,
and none of that matters to her.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.820
I mean that's not the
point of the book.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.290
The point is what's happening in
the people and in the language.

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:13.390
So Clarice is both very
different, and she's very similar,

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:19.510
and I guess learning about her life
shows you how she constructed these

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:24.320
books that seem very
difficult, so --

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.620
&gt;&gt; I have a couple of questions.

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.920
&gt;&gt; Sure, sure.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.220
Go ahead.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.520
&gt;&gt; It just seems that I
think between audience

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:33.150
that I know would be interested,
and they know, one is animal,

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:36.270
[inaudible] and another is music.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.310
Those are very important things
and have a strong presence

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:42.620
in Clarice's work, could
you elaborate a little.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well in "Agua
Viva," you know,

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.790
she says that what she's
interested in is not the music,

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:50.520
but it's putting her hand on the
record and feeling the vibrations

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:54.870
on the music, which is very
beautiful, and we live in part

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:58.030
of the year in southwestern France,

00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:01.000
which is where the cave
paintings are, and, you know,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.860
the very oldest art in
the whole world is there.

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.160
And I feel like it's so Clarice.

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.400
You know, it's like, it's,
there's nothing really there.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.160
You can kind of see it sketched
out, but you have to fill it in.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.790
You have to imagine this
antiquity of where this comes from.

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:19.820
This layer, under a layer,
under a layer, under a layer.

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.710
And I think Clarice
has liked animals

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:26.070
because she had been often
disappointed by people,

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.880
which is something we've
all been familiar with.

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.180
She not the only one?

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:35.340
And, so she loves animals
because they were physical,

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:39.080
and they were warm, and they
were, and they didn't think.

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.530
I think that's maybe really
an important part of animals.

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:42.830
And music too.

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:44.130
You know, music doesn't have words.

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:47.870
I mean it can have words, but what
makes the music music is the sound,

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:49.170
not the words.

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:55.460
And she, as part of the idea
of getting beyond thought

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:58.890
and getting beyond these kind
of constructions of ourselves.

00:56:58.890 --> 00:57:01.560
That she was just really
not interested,

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.280
and I think she saw through that.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.580
She thought that was a tool.

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.950
You know, just like clothing.

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:07.250
And she was a feminine, you know,

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:09.020
as they say in Brazil,
a feminine columnist.

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:12.390
She wrote about makeup and
hair and clothes for years,

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:14.250
every day in the papers in Rio.

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:18.710
So she knew how women were
supposed to look or men.

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:22.730
She wrote advice about how to use
perfume and how to use mascara,

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:24.590
which is hilarious if you
know anything about her.

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:27.890
I mean she's like the
most radical thinker,

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:31.000
I think probably the most radial
thinker of the 20th century.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.990
Like when you think about,
like the existentialists,

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:37.000
I would maybe accept [inaudible],
but some of these people

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.840
like [inaudible] and oh,
I mean it's so boring

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.700 position:56%
and over thought after you read her.

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:46.280
You know, she's, and that's why
I quote in the very beginning

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:51.400 position:56%
of the biography this whole cabalist
in the 13th century who gets

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.950
in Spain somewhere very
upset with these people.

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:56.680
He's like, ah, you
know, you ought to know.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:01.380
But, you know, we begin,
no where you end, we begin,

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:05.770
speaking to the philosophers.

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:07.830
Mystics are not philosophers.

00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:10.360
They're, they're beyond that.

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:13.810
&gt;&gt; So when --

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:15.110
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, just [inaudible] --

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:16.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:21.400
&gt;&gt; A couple years before she died,
she gave [inaudible] TV interview,

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.580
and you probably saw that.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:26.880
&gt;&gt; I subtitled it.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.140
&gt;&gt; You did?

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:31.860
[laughter] She was
kind of really for me,

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:35.040
she looked really sad, you know.

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:36.340
The last time.

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.290
And then she said, I
don't understand myself.

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:39.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:42.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah. She said that of all
of the books that she wrote,

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.870
I don't understand what they say.

00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:46.570
&gt;&gt; Clarice was very
fakely modest oftentimes.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:48.590
She knew exactly who she was.

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:51.320 position:56%
Just like you think didn't Emily
Dickinson probably know who she was?

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.620
She must have.

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.250
You know, you can't have
that level of thinking.

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:57.770
That video was not a couple
of years before she died,

00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:59.710 position:56%
it was a few months before she died.

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:02.230
She was dying when she
gave that interview,

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:03.530
which was a great interview,

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:07.270
because it was the only time
she ever spoke on television.

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:11.120
And fascinatingly enough,
that interview was something,

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.840 position:56%
she was interviewed by a
journalist, and he actually went mad

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.540
after that interview,
in a certain way.

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.840
I spoke to him.

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.600
He was a little bit crazy at the
end of his life, but all because of

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.260
that interview, and he had
this thing, he said once to me,

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:29.580
he said neither Kafka nor
Rudolf [phonetic] would ever

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.880
be interviewed.

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.800
I had her, and I fucked it up.

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:36.530
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:40.690
&gt;&gt; So he felt the weight of
this historic responsibility,

00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:43.020
and actually his interview,
she shows up.

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.430
She was visiting San Paolo.

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:46.140
She was in the studio
with her friend, Olga,

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:49.010 position:56%
who was one of her companions at the
end of her life and would take her

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:52.980
around and put her in a taxi
and all this, and she walked

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:56.400
into [foreign language], which was
the old sort of PBS or whatever

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.570
of Brazil, and she
walked through the door,

00:59:58.570 --> 01:00:00.650
and she said you can
interview me now.

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:03.270
And she was like the most
famous writer in Brazil,

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:07.140 position:56%
and she had famously never been
interviewed, and she just walked in,

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.620
and she said okay I'm ready.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:12.670
And there was total panic,
and everybody ran to try

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:16.450 position:56%
to get her a studio and get her a
thing and you know and find this guy

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:18.970 position:56%
who was like, I don't know,
smoking a cigarette or eating lunch,

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:24.250
and he said, you know, come on
Clarice, and it's fascinating

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:27.020
that interview is so powerful
because everybody who's seen it,

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:31.650
I just sent it to Holland last
night for a television thing,

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:35.090
and the woman who watched it was
amazed she'd never seen it before,

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:39.620
the power that comes
out of this dying woman,

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:50.440
and that's why I think every
Brazilian has seen that, you know,

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:55.090
because it's so unforgettable.

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:57.660
It's a powerful thing.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:08.800
&gt;&gt; I think we have, we'll take one
more question, and then we'll --

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:17.020
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm a little
under the weather.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:30.320
I wanted to do a little bit more
about the role of religion in her,

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:37.320
you know, in her writing, for
her, and I don't even know how

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.400
to formulate this question, but
it's very curious to me, you know,

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:50.030
about being Jewish and [inaudible]
her books are so autobiographical

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:54.260
for me that you see different
factors and different directions

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.840
that she goes about [inaudible].

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.970
&gt;&gt; Well so Clarice comes
from a rabbinical family.

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:05.050
She comes from -- this is obvious
if you know Jews, and if you know

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:08.730
where Jews come from,
especially in terms of class

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:15.210
and education background, these
things go, as they did in Europe,

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:17.890
they went from generation
to generation,

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:21.090
and the rabbinical families
were the same people.

01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:24.210
And she comes from
those, that background.

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:28.530
And what happens to her at the
very beginning of the book,

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:36.080
I tell the story, the disaster that
happens to her family that happened

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:43.570
to hundreds of thousands of
Jews after the First World War,

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:45.930
even before the Second World
War, which was even worse,

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:50.210
but hundreds of thousands
of people killed.

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:53.130
Her grandfather was murdered.

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:58.020
Her mother was raped and got
syphilis and died in Brazil.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.580
All of their being nice
to God didn't work.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.880
This is the point.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:11.590
All of the 613 commandments and
the, you know, do three dances

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:14.130
around the Magilla
[phonetic], and all this kind

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.430
of stuff, complete failure.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:16.730
Nothing about that.

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:18.190
And these were religious people.

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:23.570
They were forced to see the failure
of this human-centered existence,

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:27.410
or this human-centered idea of God,

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:31.520
which is that God is this
basically benevolent guy,

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.580
who if you do certain things,
like if you clean out the crumbs

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.850
from your pantry in April,
and if you, you know,

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.320
cut the foreskin off
your kid, you know,

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:47.850
then basically God is going piece,
sort of like a touchy parent,

01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:56.450
you know, but it's basically
an idea of God as a human

01:03:56.450 --> 01:04:01.470
that can be pleased or
displeased, and he can get mad.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:04.080
And he'll be happy if
you do this or that,

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.380
so you have to do these
little dances.

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.680
That's a ridiculous thought.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.940
I mean it's a ridiculous thought
even as I'm formulating it now

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.240
because it actually is ridiculous.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.540
It is not the reality
of anybody's life.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.840
And it's not the reality of
physics or astronomy or anything.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.540
And yet, what's so fascinating
about her is the spiritual impulse

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:17.840
as opposed to the religious
impulse is still there,

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.600
and it's 100 percent there, and
it's not just there in a way

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.900
that is some kind of legacy.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.200
If this is my family, used to be
in clothing, so I love a good suit.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.500
You know, it's not like that.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.800
It's something really deep, and
she uses this expression not

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.110
to ridicule religion but to find
some other spiritual values,

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:27.520
and she finds them where the
Jews have always found them,

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.260
which was in language, and that's
I think what you feel of the beauty

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.790
if you read her, especially if
you read her in her own language.

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:32.230
And so, of course it's something
she regretted losing that,

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:33.530
because it's comforting to believe

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:34.830
that if you just do these certain
things and everybody's happy

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.130
and you don't get cancer, but
of course you do get cancer,

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:37.430
and you do die, and you
do suffer horrible things.

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:38.950
Your child can go mad, and your
mother can die, and these things --

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:40.250
so it's a very complicated thing,

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.550
but it actually becomes
more beautiful

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:42.850
because the hocus pocus
gets taken away from it,

01:04:42.850 --> 01:04:44.150
and what you have is this desire
to connect with something divine.

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:45.450
And she does.

01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:46.750
So, on that note --

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Ben
Moser Vivaldo Santos, and --

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:51.000
[ Applause ]

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
-- and Ben will be
signing books outside.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.640
Thank you very much.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.300
&gt;&gt; This has been presentation
of the Library of Congress.
