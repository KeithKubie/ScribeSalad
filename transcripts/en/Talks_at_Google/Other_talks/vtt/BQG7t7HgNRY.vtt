00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.300
&gt;&gt;presenter: Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers,
the author of What's Mine is Yours: The Rise

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.420
of Collaborative Consumption. When I got the
blurb for this book, I was really excited.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:18.100
Then I saw Rachel's TED Talk and I was even
more excited. She was a fantastic speaker

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.039
there and I expect her to be a fantastic speaker
and then I read the book; loved the book.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.759
In fact, I've been, evangelized everybody
on my Facebook page to on my Buzz, on my,

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.100
talking to my friends in person. My friend's
14 year old kid was super glad to hear about

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.970
share.com cause he's now getting full value
for his video games as opposed to half at

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.470
GameStop. So, it, I think you're gonna find
these ideas super interesting, both personally

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.130
and professionally. I think you know about
some of these companies and I think you're

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.170
gonna find some new companies you haven't
heard of that will be useful to you, but I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.350
think the book is more than something that's
interesting both personally and professionally.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.471
It's also a different way of thinking about
the world. It's a way, I said, I think we

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:03.240
can get by, get past some of the kind of roadblocks
that we've got on public discussions. Because,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.180
I mean, think about it. Sharing for fun and
profit; what could be more socialist or more

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:21.040
capitalist? So, it's a chance to transcend
old problems. Please welcome Rachel and Roo.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.430
[applause]

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:35.810
&gt;&gt;Rachel: So. Good morning, or good afternoon,
everyone and thanks for having us today. So,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.600
I'm gonna talk to you about the rise of collaborative
consumption. And Roo and myself have been

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.320
doing interviews for the last couple of weeks
and the most popular question is, "Is this

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.740
a reaction to the recession?" So, today I'd
like to talk to you about why this isn't a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.900
reactionary blip to the recession, but a fundamental
change in the relationship between producers

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.170
and consumers and the beginning of what we
think is a revolution in identity and ownership

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.519
that could become as big as the Industrial
Revolution or even the Information Age. So,

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.130
today we thought our focus would actually
be on technology and how technology enables

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.380
trust between strangers, and how this is reinventing
sectors from retail to banking to food; creating

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.520
massive workspaces of opportunity. So, to
get started, I thought I would start with

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.970
an example you're all very familiar with,
which we call the Godfather of collaborative

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.800
consumption, which is eBay. Now there is a
popular Silicon Valley legend that eBay started

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.130
when Pierre Omidyar wanted to help his girlfriend
sell and collect Pez dispensers. This is,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:58.380
in fact, a myth made up by a PR whiz. The
real story, whoops, it is Murphy's Law today.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.131
The real story is that Pierre actually put
this broken laser pointer up for auction on

00:03:04.131 --> 00:03:10.349
his personal website as an experiment. And
he was even astonished within 24 hours when

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.020
a bid came in for 14 dollars and 83 cents.
So he contacted the winning bidder to make

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.000
sure that he knew it was broken and the guy
wrote back and said, "I'm a collector of broken

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.980
laser pointers." Now, it was in this moment,
that Pierre knew he'd hit on something really

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.360
big for two reasons. One, he realized, that
it was actually a massive opportunity to redistribute

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.129
things that were unwanted or worthless to
one person. And then secondly, that had an

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.510
immediate value to someone else. And what
he also realized was that the Internet had

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.270
created this massive match-making machine,
with the power to match person A's "have's"

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.340
with person C's "wants" with whatever they
may be. So, no longer was the coincidence

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.420
of "wants" a problem. So, in other words,
the Internet had created the efficiency and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.860
access for us to trade peer to peer. But it
also did something critical for eBay, and

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.989
also for collaborative consumption, was that
it created the social lubricant, or trust.

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.570
In other words, we know had the technology
to create trust between strangers. Now, my

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.310
grandma, who the book is dedicated to, is
very fascinated by this subject of collaborative

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.389
consumption and it's funny cause she really
gets the heart of the book; she really gets

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.180
the community aspect. Although, she gets a
little lost when we start talking about real

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.000
time technologies and augmented reality. So
anyway, I was last back in London and she

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.490
asked me to show her the power of this matchmaking.
So I went onto eBay and I said to her, "What

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.310
do you want?" And she said, "I want a pearl,
silver-rimmed picture frame for your wedding

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.800
photo." So, online I went and found one within
two seconds and so the seller was called moocowmeadows.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.479
So she said, "Well, how can I trust someone
called moocowmeadows?" And I said, "Well,

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.870
you just do." And then she said, "What, I'm
gonna pay for it and I can't actually physically

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.720
inspect the item?" And I said, "Yes." And
then she said, "And then we're gonna pay for

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.280
it before it's actually shipped?" And I said,
"Yeah." She said, "Well, how do I trust this

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.400
person?" So then I started to explain to her
well, 98 percent of trades on eBay receive

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.400
a positive rating and the two percent negative
rating, it's relatively minor reasons, like

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.130
the item arrives one week later than expected.
"Ok," she says, "let's order the item." So,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.130
we then got into this conversation about reputation
systems, right? Now, eBay has proven something

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:48.550
incredibly powerful, which is that the trust
we form face-to-face can now be replicated

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:56.259
online through points, feedback, power sellers
and Roo and I noticed that these two principles

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:03.890
that eBay had proven on steroids, trust and
efficiency were enabling us to mimic the exchanges

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:10.910
that used to take place in villages, but in
ways and on a scale that had never been possible

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.820
before. So, in other words, technology was
actually taking us back to really old market

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:24.080
behaviors. So, we're swapping and sharing
and bartering and trading, but they're being

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.840
reinvented into cooler and dynamic forms that
are relevant for the Facebook age. We call

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.070
this groundswell collaborative consumption
and we believe it's a new culture and economy

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:42.750
that reinventing not just what we consume,
but how we consume. So, a few years ago we

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:49.270
started to notice the massive surgance in
car sharing and bike sharing and peer to peer

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.410
rental markets and Etsy labs and food co-ops,
and we started to wonder whether all these

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.020
things were linked and interconnected. And
what we believe is that we are sharing and

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.580
collaborating again in ways actually more
hip than hippie and keeping up with the Jones's

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.319
is being replaced by sharing with the Jones's.
I was reading The New York Times, I like to

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:18.620
go back and look at articles that really influenced
me and there was a great quote where it said,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.260
"Sharing is to the iPod what the 8-track is
to, sorry, sharing is to the iPod, sharing

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.280
is to ownership what the iPod is to the 8-track,
what the solar panel is to the coal mine."

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.750
In other words, sharing is post-modern and
cool and ownership is becoming dull and backwards.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:41.080
Now, when we started writing the book, we
had around 500 examples of collaborative consumption

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.580
and now we actually have over five thousand
from all corners of the world. And as we dug

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.259
deeper, we actually realized that they could
be organized into three clear systems. So

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:59.490
the first is called redistribution markets.
So, to tell you the power of redistribution

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:06.820
markets, about four years ago I bought a bread
making machine. Now, hands up here, it's predominantly

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:13.889
men, but maybe some of you know Nigella Lawson.
Does anyone know? Oh, sweet, yes, Nigella

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:17.860
Bites. So, Nigella often appears on the TV
screen looking like this. It's the middle

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.569
of the night, right? And she feels like making
cakes and there she appears, fully made up

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:27.060
and she becomes somewhat of this domestic
goddess, right? So, at the time, I was doing

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:34.020
a lot of travelling and I happened to be on
a plane where Nigella declared that every

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.469
woman needed a bread making machine to fill
up our homes with these warm and comforting

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:42.959
smells of freshly baked bread. And I thought,
"Wow. This is all I needed to be a domestic

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:47.360
goddess?" So, I bought this bread making machine.
Now, bread making machines are huge. I don't

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.339
know if you've seen them, but they actually
occupy probably half of a New York kitchen.

00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:57.579
And I used this bread making machine just
once, but the weird thing was I actually felt

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:03.899
this strange sense of relief when I finally
got rid of the thing. I had fallen in to the

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:08.440
common consumer trap of buying not what I
needed, but I thought I needed or what I desired

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.639
or what I thought I should be. I was trying
to keep up with the Jones's. Now, this problem

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:21.800
is huge. Consumerism has actually become all-consuming
and I wanna give you a couple of steps to

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.589
support this point. Our houses are stuffed
with ice cream makers, electronic gadgets,

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:33.269
foot spas, chocolate fondue fountains and
my latest spotting, a strawberry slicer. I

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:39.129
mean, was life complete before the strawberry
slicer came along? So, 80% of the stuff we

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:45.319
own, we use less than once a month. Just think
about that. Eighty percent of the stuff you

00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:52.499
own you lose-, use less than once a month.
The second thing is there actually 53 thousand

00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:58.459
personal self-storage units in the United
States alone. That's seven times the amount

00:09:58.459 --> 00:10:02.709
of Starbucks. Now, this is crazy. Like we
don't have enough room in our houses for all

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:07.579
this stuff, so we start renting and paying
for self-storage units? And when you think

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:14.610
about it, waste and storage are two end games
of the same problem; we have too much stuff.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.639
And this is where redistribution markets come
in. You've got examples like Freecycle, where

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:24.980
people give stuff away, you've got examples
like swap.com that Daniel mentioned, or Thread

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:30.460
Up, a kid's clothing exchange, where people
exchanging things for equal value. And then,

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:36.709
of course, you've got reuse market places
where people are actually making money. eBay

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:42.309
actually just estimated that the worth, the
estimated worth of the secondary goods market

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:48.910
is 500 billion dollars. So, it's a huge, whitespace
of opportunity. Redistribution markets also

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:55.230
have massive environmental benefits because
reduce, reuse, recycle, repair, redistribute

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.489
what they are doing is stretching the lifecycle
of a product. In other words, they reduce

00:11:00.489 --> 00:11:08.089
the amount of stuff that end up in landfill.
The second system is what we call collaborative

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:14.300
lifestyles. So, hands up, how many of you
have heard of co-working or social lending

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:22.319
or peer to peer travel? Most of you, right.
Ok. These are all examples of collaborative

00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:26.220
lifestyles because it's not just stuff that
can be shared; its spaces, parking spaces,

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:34.089
gardens, time, skills, assets that are intangible.
And the reason why it's so easy to share this

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:39.429
stuff is because we've wired our world to
share and we can share within our neighborhoods,

00:11:39.429 --> 00:11:45.149
our offices, or our Facebook network. But
to give you two examples of collaborative

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:50.369
lifestyles, I personally really like, the
first is social lending. Now, the easiest

00:11:50.369 --> 00:11:56.529
way to explain social lending is Roo has a
hundred dollars to lend and I want to borrow

00:11:56.529 --> 00:12:01.369
a hundred dollars and it matches us together,
although it doesn't have to be a direct exchange.

00:12:01.369 --> 00:12:06.190
And there's some huge marketplaces emerging
like Zopur in the UK and Lending Club in the

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:15.209
US. Now, social lending increased by 800%
last year. Now, I can't think of a traditional

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:21.920
bank that increased by 800%. Now, Lending
Club did around 11 million dollars worth of

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:28.359
loans last year and their expected to become
ten% the personal loans market. So, if I was

00:12:28.359 --> 00:12:33.350
someone like Bank of America or Commonwealth
Bank, I'd start getting worried about social

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.110
lending, that they were actually gonna start
eating into our margin. But the thing that's

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:46.130
so fascinating about social lending is that
for default rate is really low at 0.64%. Now,

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:52.619
credit cards are around 8% and the traditional
bank is around 5%. Now, in our research, we

00:12:52.619 --> 00:12:59.569
discovered that the reason why it is so low
is that people said, "I trust my peer. I feel

00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:05.369
more accountable to my peer than I do with
any kind of big bank." This is really interesting.

00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:12.629
The second is another example of a collaborative
lifestyle, is called Landshare in the UK.

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:17.299
Now, Landshare, there's similar ones in the
US called Sharing Backyards or sharedearth.com.

00:13:17.299 --> 00:13:24.239
It's like a garden dating agency. So, what
it does is it takes Mr. Jones with some spare

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:29.810
back garden space and Mr. Smith, a would-be
grower, and it matches them and together,

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:37.829
they grow their own food. There's been over
55 thousand matches in the UK so far and it's

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:41.350
one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,
you wonder why it's never been done before.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:47.290
My dad is actually participating in Landshare
and the funny thing is it's actually not about

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.600
the food, right? He has all these kids come
round to his neighborhood and grow tomatoes

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.480
and the first time, in 18 years that he's
lived in Hampshire Garden suburb, he actually

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:03.339
knows his neighbors names. So, I think it's
really interesting that what's happening is

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:09.639
its part of this OTO, offline, online to offline
trend, where people are forming connections

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:18.040
through technology that leads to very powerful
community and human relationships in the real

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.679
world. The last system is what we call product
service systems, ok? So, have any of you been

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:29.790
to London or Washington or Denver or Minneapolis
or Paris, recently, you've seen a lot of people

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:35.749
cycling around on bikes. But they're not on
their own bikes, they're on magic bikes that

00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:40.129
are there when you want them and gone when
you don't. Now, bike sharing is actually the

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:44.911
fastest growing form of transportation in
the world and it's a great example of a product

00:14:44.911 --> 00:14:51.459
service system, whereby you pay the benefit
of a product, what it does for you, without

00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:57.059
needing to own the product outright. Now,
product service systems are absolutely ideal

00:14:57.059 --> 00:15:03.430
when products have, what we call, high idling
capacity. So, high idling capacity refers

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:11.319
to unused or untapped value, of a good. So
a car that sits idle for 23 hours a day, the

00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:15.720
evening dress that you wear once and that
sits in your wardrobe has high idling capacity.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:24.279
Now one of my favorite metaphors for this
is who owns a power drill? Wow. A lot of men,

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:29.579
so around 80% of the room own a power drill.
Actually, half of all households in the US

00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:36.819
own a power drill. Now that power drill will
be used between 12 to 13 minutes in its entire

00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:41.919
lifetime. Now, when you think about it, it's
really crazy. You're laughing, but it is crazy

00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:47.130
because what you need is the hole, not actually
the drill, and that's a great example of the

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:52.139
shift in mindset about a whole generation
of people growing up saying, "Hang on a minute.

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:56.920
I want the benefit of that product and I can
access that through different ways." Peer

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.709
to peer rentals, such as Zilok, is a great
example. Now product service systems have

00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:08.589
actually been around for years. Just think
of libraries or laundress, but we believe

00:16:08.589 --> 00:16:15.660
that we're entering a new era of supercharged
appeal for two reasons. One, we now have the

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:22.680
technology to make sharing frictionless, convenient
and fun. And two, our relationship to satisfy

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:30.879
what we want is far less material than any
previous generation. I don't want CDs. I want

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:35.359
the music it plays. I don't want videos; I
want the movie it carries. I don't want an

00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:42.919
answering machine, I want the message it saves.
In other words, we don't want stuff; we want

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:48.879
the needs or experiences it fulfills. So,
we're entering an era where access is better

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:55.680
than ownership, as Kevin Kelly puts it, or
where usage trumps possession. Now, these

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.939
three systems are fusing together and creating
a dotted line between what's mine, what's

00:17:01.939 --> 00:17:08.669
yours and what's ours. I thought you guys
might actually appreciate that there's someone

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:13.459
in Parsons, it's a magic things starting to
happen around collaborative consumption, where

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:18.199
it's becoming a movement, which was always
our intent. And we get sent all these wonderful

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:23.740
things from all around the world of people
making videos, someone sent me a jewelry collection

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.459
she's made, inspired by the things that we're
saying, which is a little weird, but lovely

00:17:27.459 --> 00:17:33.280
as well. And some students at Parsons had
actually started to use Google Maps to map

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.600
all the examples of collaborative consumption
by the systems in New York City. So, I'll

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.080
send this link to you, but it's pretty cool,
the things that they're starting to do. And

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.649
this student actually wants to open it up
to the rest of the world to create a world

00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:53.380
map of collaborative consumption examples.
So, how big is this thing? Is it a niche,

00:17:53.380 --> 00:18:02.809
or is it a trend or is it really a groundswell
that we talk about? So, we've made this little

00:18:02.809 --> 00:18:52.909
video that's gonna load and work to show you
just how big it really is. And hopefully,

00:18:52.909 --> 00:19:24.679
it will work.

00:19:24.679 --> 00:20:38.809
[electronic music]
[video plays for 2:23 minutes]

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:57.580
So, it's pretty big and it's during its nascent
stages. So, just like to now talk about why

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:04.799
we think its emerging now and I hate this
word, cause its cliché, but it's actually

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:12.360
a perfect storm of four key drivers. Now the
first is two big global contextual facets,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:18.530
pressing on unresolved environmental concerns
and a global recession that has fundamentally

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:24.059
shocked consumer behaviors. Now, I don't like
to talk about it being frugal, because I think

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:30.429
what's actually happening is that we are seeing
a questioning of the health of the consumer

00:21:30.429 --> 00:21:36.570
system in a way that we've never seen before.
I mean, if you look at the number of articles

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.029
coming out around happiness and fulfillment
and satisfaction, this is all connected to

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:46.179
does consumerism make you happy? Thomas Freedman,
who is one of my favorite columnists, wrote

00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:52.571
something which I thought summed up nicely,
he said, "2008 was when we hit a wall when

00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:59.950
Mother Nature and the market both said, 'No
more.'" Now, we know that a system that's

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:05.929
based on selling more and more stuff is an
environmental and economic Ponzi scheme, yet

00:22:05.929 --> 00:22:11.889
it's really difficult for us to figure out
what we individually should do. Now, our hypothesis

00:22:11.889 --> 00:22:17.590
is that as the consumer system got bigger,
it pushed us further and further apart, but

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:23.490
now that it broke, it's actually snapped and
it's pushing us back together. All around

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:29.330
us we're seeing an resurgence around the belief
in community, both in the virtual and the

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.769
real worlds. Volunteering makes it through
the roof, bike sales have never been higher,

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:39.110
cooking and sewing classes are doing a roaring
trade. And as you saw in that video, there's

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:44.879
now one thousand more farmers markets than
there are Wal-Mart's in the United States.

00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:51.879
Now, Facebook recently hit 500 million users
and we actually think that Facebook and farmers

00:22:51.879 --> 00:22:56.759
markets have a lot in common with each other
because all around us, we're seeking to be

00:22:56.759 --> 00:23:03.740
a part of communities of people with shared
interest. We're working to feed our social

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.840
self, the side of us that seeks connection
and belonging. We've gotten really good at

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:15.389
consuming; buying and consuming more. But
we're actually born and bred to share and

00:23:15.389 --> 00:23:20.789
cooperate and we were doing so for thousands
of years, whether we hunted in packs or farmed

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:26.899
in cooperatives. But now sharing is back with
this ubiquitous force that we call the peer

00:23:26.899 --> 00:23:32.269
to peer revolution and we're growing up sharing
files and videos and knowledge and now these

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:38.570
behaviors are extending into other areas of
our lives. And this is driving a massive cultural

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:43.879
shift from Generation Me to Generation We.
Clay Shirky, who I'm sure you're all familiar

00:23:43.879 --> 00:23:49.080
with and should read his book called Cognitive
Surplus. He put it brilliantly when he said,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:54.180
"We're monkeys with Internet access." I think
it's happening so fast because these behaviors

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:59.240
are very innate to us, but now we have the
infrastructure to share and collaborate in

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:06.460
ways that have never been possible before.
So, these four drivers are fusing together

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.919
to create the big shift away from the 20th
century defined by hyper-consumption, towards

00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:17.240
the 21st century; an era of collaborative
consumption. We believe it's a new era of

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:23.279
consumerism defined by access over ownership,
the primacy of experience over more stuff

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:31.840
and trust between strangers. So, just to wrap,
I wanna come back to the cornerstone of this

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:38.120
new culture economy, which is trust or reputation.
Because it doesn't matter if you're sharing

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.509
your car, sharing your back garden or swapping
a good, they all involve different degrees

00:24:42.509 --> 00:24:47.789
of trust. And the way we look at it is that
it actually can be put out on a spectrum.

00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:53.149
So you've got companies emerging that actually
revolve around this centralized trust system,

00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:58.460
so Zipcar is a great example of this. Zipcar
still controls an inventory of cars, so it's

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:05.080
a fairly controlled system of trust. You've
then got a whole breed of marketplaces which

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:12.249
are enabling trust between strangers so, swap.com
is a great example of that where you're trading

00:25:12.249 --> 00:25:17.870
peer-to-peer, but you still feel the presence
of the company. And then you've got really

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.670
open systems of trust where it truly is peer
place and the organization of the company

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.580
completely disappears. So, Couchsurfing is
a great example of that, or Freecycle, or

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:34.730
even Craigslist; that's really Craig Newmark's
intent. And it's so fascinating how this principle

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:42.150
of trust between strangers is changing marketplaces.
Now, how many of you would hitchhike? Zero.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:43.809
Maybe one, maybe.

00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:46.020
&gt;&gt;male member #1: [inaudible].

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:52.419
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Not recently, right. Ok. So, what
about, would you share a ride with someone

00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:59.090
from your old college? Hands up. Yeah. What
about someone from this room, someone you

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.830
work with? Everyone, right? So, the circle
of trust, your relationship to hitchhiking

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:10.899
changed, changes when it becomes ride sharing.
Now, what Zimride does is its integration

00:26:10.899 --> 00:26:17.320
with Facebook means that it can change your
relationship to the person that you're sharing

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.820
a car with. So, it does the usual things by
saying which university you went to or which

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.480
workplace you belong to, but then it actually
gets into personal preferences that enables

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.679
you to figure out who's gonna be in the car.
Do they smoke? Are they a chatterbox? What

00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:36.510
do they listen to on the radio? Do they like
to eat in the car? So, what these systems

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:42.210
are actually doing is helping you get a very
complete picture of not just whether you can

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:47.409
trust this person, but also whether you'd
like to share a ride with them as well. And

00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:52.399
so, what's happening here is it's actually
community plus technology, totally reinventing

00:26:52.399 --> 00:26:58.510
a very old idea of carpooling. The other example
that we love is called Thread Up, I mentioned,

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:04.840
which is the clothing exchange for kids clothing.
By the time a child 18, it's estimated that

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:10.600
we would have spent 20 thousand dollars on
kid's clothes and retired three thousand items.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.749
Now, anyone who has a child knows that they
grow out of them every three months, so the

00:27:13.749 --> 00:27:20.590
clothes are actually pretty new. Now, what
Thread Up realized was that they problem with

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:26.110
most used car-, used car marketplace, used
clothes marketplaces is that Mums and Dads

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:31.710
are very worried about cleanliness and quality.
They will swap stuff if they believe that

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:36.659
stuff is gonna be clean and high quality.
So what they're doing is actually using reputation

00:27:36.659 --> 00:27:41.889
systems, and this may look at you a little
bit like Foursquare and Badges to reinforce

00:27:41.889 --> 00:27:49.120
the behaviors that they're looking for. And
I see things like this as a nice example of

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.759
competitive collaboration, where you actually,
you want to be top of the leader board, so

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:59.179
it motivates the good behaviors. Now, what
happens on Thread Up is if you start to reach

00:27:59.179 --> 00:28:05.419
the most stylish of a superswapper, you can
actually start trading in better currencies.

00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:12.409
And this is a really great example of where
reputation is starting to become a currency.

00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:18.519
We actually believe that reputation could
become more powerful than your credit history.

00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:24.649
And it's only a matter of time before the
reputation trail that we leave across communities,

00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:31.410
both in YouTube and Flickr, and also in examples
that we have shown, will be aggregated to

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:40.899
form a score that would determine your access
to these communities. So, just to wrap, this

00:28:40.899 --> 00:28:45.840
is a nice way of summarizing what we've been
talking about. We believe that if the 20th

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:52.630
century was defined by credit and advertising
and individual ownership and was called hyper-consumption,

00:28:52.630 --> 00:29:01.549
the 21st century will be defined by reputation,
community and shared access and will be called

00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:07.289
collaborative consumption. It's funny, consumerism
seems like an immovable fact of life, but

00:29:07.289 --> 00:29:13.350
it's not. It's actually a very new, modern
construct that was actually just invented

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:19.350
in the last 60 to 70 years, and we actually
believe that we're a turning point and that

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:25.759
we'll see this period as a time where society
started to wake up from this humungous hangover

00:29:25.759 --> 00:29:33.559
of emptiness and waste, and started to reinvent
the meaning of more. And we're so excited

00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:36.889
by collaborative consumption, not just from
a social and an environmental perspective,

00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:42.379
but also from a business perspective because
we now believe that we have the technologies

00:29:42.379 --> 00:29:49.100
to reinvent outdated modes of business, leapfrog
over wasteful forms of consumerism and help

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.620
us lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
Thank you very much.
