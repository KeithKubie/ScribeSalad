a lot of faculty and I was impressed

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850
a lot of faculty and I was impressed
 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.380
a lot of faculty and I was impressed
before I came but these faculties they

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390
before I came but these faculties they
 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.330

have been great conversations and I've
 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.810
have been great conversations and I've
ended the conversations by asking them

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820
ended the conversations by asking them
 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.840
ended the conversations by asking them
to tell me about grand challenges that

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850

that I'd thought about but some ideas
 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.980
that I'd thought about but some ideas
that I hadn't and so that was really

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990
that I hadn't and so that was really
 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.050
that I hadn't and so that was really
exciting so what I'm going to be talking

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060
exciting so what I'm going to be talking
 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.240

but the frontier never ends because we
 

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:09.749
but the frontier never ends because we
make one discovery and then there's

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:38.330
to choose whatever the default option is
 

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.170
to choose whatever the default option is
if the high price option is the default

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:41.180
if the high price option is the default
 

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.110
if the high price option is the default
they'll pick that if the cheaper policy

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120
they'll pick that if the cheaper policy
 

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.350
they'll pick that if the cheaper policy
is the option they all pick that the

point is that the way the choice was

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:49.580
point is that the way the choice was
 

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:55.260

sometimes appear kind of obvious or
 

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.370
sometimes appear kind of obvious or

should we study nonverbal communication

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:15.290
should we study nonverbal communication
 

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:19.090

and as I showed in the three examples

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040
and as I showed in the three examples
 

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.330

different data set and generalizability
 

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:46.600
different data set and generalizability
is the extent to which we can generalize

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:46.610
is the extent to which we can generalize
 

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:51.460
is the extent to which we can generalize
from findings to other populations and

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:51.470
from findings to other populations and
 

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:56.730
from findings to other populations and
groups and at the end of their report

they suggested that we could do research
 

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.010
they suggested that we could do research
in sve on robust and reliable science

replicated and then finally the question
 

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.620
replicated and then finally the question
is to the extent there is a problem what

is to the extent there is a problem what
can we do to fix the problem and so

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:10.570
can we do to fix the problem and so
 

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:13.020
can we do to fix the problem and so

is they're sometimes called and note
that we funded their research after they

00:52:11.099 --> 00:52:11.109
that we funded their research after they
 

00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:14.759
that we funded their research after they
won those prizes not when we knew that

00:52:14.759 --> 00:52:14.769
won those prizes not when we knew that
 

00:52:14.769 --> 00:52:18.690

without thinking about people at the
center of it all as this slide shows so

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:29.830
center of it all as this slide shows so
 

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:36.349
center of it all as this slide shows so
we do think that it really does take

00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359
we do think that it really does take
 

00:53:36.359 --> 00:53:40.349
we do think that it really does take
understanding people to unlock most of

understanding people to unlock most of
 

00:53:40.359 --> 00:53:43.170
understanding people to unlock most of
the societal conundrums that we have and

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:43.180
the societal conundrums that we have and
 

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:46.380
the societal conundrums that we have and
we will continue to do that as long as

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:46.390
we will continue to do that as long as
 

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:49.859
we will continue to do that as long as
we continue to have the great scientist

to comment on the effect of geosciences
 

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:32.100
to comment on the effect of geosciences
on SB they such as tsunami geothermal

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:32.110
on SB they such as tsunami geothermal
 

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:35.310
on SB they such as tsunami geothermal

Nino they all causes changes in the
 

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:41.430
Nino they all causes changes in the
climate change and that can have an

climate change and that can have an
 

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.890
climate change and that can have an
effect on XP do you have any comment on

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:43.900
effect on XP do you have any comment on
 

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:49.440
effect on XP do you have any comment on
that absolutely I agree and we work with

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:49.450
that absolutely I agree and we work with
 

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:54.300
that absolutely I agree and we work with
the geosciences Directorate too it's

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:54.310
the geosciences Directorate too it's
 

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:57.900
the geosciences Directorate too it's
it's really the geosciences director at

00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:57.910
it's really the geosciences director at
 

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.740
it's really the geosciences director at
the engineering Directorate and the SBE

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:01.750
the engineering Directorate and the SBE
 

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:05.990

innovations at the Nexus of food energy
 

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:12.300
innovations at the Nexus of food energy
and water and we're working on risk and

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:12.310
and water and we're working on risk and
 

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:15.350
and water and we're working on risk and
resilience so when I talked about the

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:15.360
resilience so when I talked about the
 

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.210
resilience so when I talked about the
they cross Directorate initiative on

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:18.220
they cross Directorate initiative on
 

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.450
they cross Directorate initiative on
risk and resilience one of the big risk

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:21.460
risk and resilience one of the big risk
 

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.170
risk and resilience one of the big risk
is risk from natural disasters as well

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:25.180
is risk from natural disasters as well
 

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:27.960
is risk from natural disasters as well
as risk from people and the risk from

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:27.970
as risk from people and the risk from
 

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:31.530
as risk from people and the risk from
natural disasters that Gio has asked us

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:31.540
natural disasters that Gio has asked us
 

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.410
natural disasters that Gio has asked us
to work with them on is how do we

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:34.420
to work with them on is how do we
 

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:40.790
to work with them on is how do we
communicate to people that there is

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:40.800
communicate to people that there is
 

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.550
communicate to people that there is
going to be a tornado or a flood or a

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:44.560
going to be a tornado or a flood or a
 

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.460
going to be a tornado or a flood or a
tsunami coming how do we communicate

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:47.470
tsunami coming how do we communicate
 

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.550
tsunami coming how do we communicate
that risk in advance so that people will

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:50.560
that risk in advance so that people will
 

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:56.430
that risk in advance so that people will
listen to it but once the horrible

00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440
listen to it but once the horrible
 

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.940
listen to it but once the horrible
natural disaster has occurred it's how

00:55:59.940 --> 00:55:59.950
natural disaster has occurred it's how
 

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:02.310
natural disaster has occurred it's how
do we make a difference in helping

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:02.320
do we make a difference in helping
 

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.150
do we make a difference in helping
people in that situation because often

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160
people in that situation because often
 

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.210
people in that situation because often
as you well know there is just chaos and

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:09.220
as you well know there is just chaos and
 

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:12.420
as you well know there is just chaos and
so people have to be helped and so

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:12.430
so people have to be helped and so
 

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:14.790
so people have to be helped and so
that's another way that we are working

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:14.800
that's another way that we are working
 

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.820
that's another way that we are working
with the geosciences but we really do

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:17.830
with the geosciences but we really do
 

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:21.300
with the geosciences but we really do
consider ourselves partners in those two

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:21.310
consider ourselves partners in those two
 

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:23.400
consider ourselves partners in those two
in several initiatives but with the

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:23.410
in several initiatives but with the
 

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:27.330
in several initiatives but with the
geosciences especially innovations at

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:27.340
geosciences especially innovations at
 

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.520
geosciences especially innovations at
the Nexus of food energy and water and

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:29.530
the Nexus of food energy and water and
 

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:35.220
the Nexus of food energy and water and
risk and resilience

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:35.230
 

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:41.890
several tens of millions of dollars

00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:41.900
 

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:54.329
right absolutely sorry well recording it

00:56:54.329 --> 00:56:54.339
right absolutely sorry well recording it

right absolutely sorry well recording it
so Faye when you presented the

00:56:57.839 --> 00:56:57.849
so Faye when you presented the
 

00:56:57.849 --> 00:57:00.430
so Faye when you presented the
organization chart on the right side you

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.440
organization chart on the right side you
 

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.069
organization chart on the right side you
had a interdisciplinary social and

00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079
had a interdisciplinary social and
 

00:57:03.079 --> 00:57:06.220
had a interdisciplinary social and
behavioral research you had a separate

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:06.230
behavioral research you had a separate
 

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.170
behavioral research you had a separate
program or is that something you uncover

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:08.180
program or is that something you uncover
 

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.569
program or is that something you uncover
encourage and all your programs we have

00:57:10.569 --> 00:57:10.579
encourage and all your programs we have
 

00:57:10.579 --> 00:57:13.630
encourage and all your programs we have
three divisions and then there is what

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640
three divisions and then there is what
 

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.400
three divisions and then there is what
we call in your right I didn't talk

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:15.410
we call in your right I didn't talk
 

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:19.589
we call in your right I didn't talk
about it SMA the SBE multidisciplinary

00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599
about it SMA the SBE multidisciplinary
 

00:57:19.599 --> 00:57:24.760
about it SMA the SBE multidisciplinary
activities and that is where we have we

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:24.770
activities and that is where we have we
 

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:27.970
activities and that is where we have we
do a lot of interdisciplinary work but

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:27.980
do a lot of interdisciplinary work but
 

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.950
do a lot of interdisciplinary work but
that is where some of that

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960
that is where some of that
 

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.799
that is where some of that
interdisciplinary work is really located

00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:32.809
interdisciplinary work is really located
 

00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:37.390
interdisciplinary work is really located
so for example that's where our science

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400
so for example that's where our science
 

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:43.620
so for example that's where our science
of learning centers began as a cross SBE

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:43.630
of learning centers began as a cross SBE
 

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:46.410
of learning centers began as a cross SBE
activity that's where we have our

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:46.420
activity that's where we have our
 

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:49.210
activity that's where we have our
postdoctoral program that's where we

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:49.220
postdoctoral program that's where we
 

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:52.260
postdoctoral program that's where we
have the science of science innovation

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:52.270
have the science of science innovation
 

00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:55.859
have the science of science innovation
policy program that's where we have our

00:57:55.859 --> 00:57:55.869
policy program that's where we have our
 

00:57:55.869 --> 00:57:59.920
policy program that's where we have our
undergraduate research experiences for

00:57:59.920 --> 00:57:59.930
undergraduate research experiences for
 

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:03.130
undergraduate research experiences for
undergraduates we fund about 750

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:03.140
undergraduates we fund about 750
 

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:07.539
undergraduates we fund about 750
undergraduates so I really should have

00:58:07.539 --> 00:58:07.549
undergraduates so I really should have
 

00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:16.839
undergraduates so I really should have
mentioned that thank you hey thanks

00:58:16.839 --> 00:58:16.849
mentioned that thank you hey thanks
 

00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:19.180
mentioned that thank you hey thanks

day with us really greatly appreciate
 

00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:24.190
day with us really greatly appreciate
that you alluded to this in the course

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.200
that you alluded to this in the course
 

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.870
that you alluded to this in the course
of your presentation and during the day

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880
of your presentation and during the day
 

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:30.099
of your presentation and during the day
as well this idea of where data sciences

00:58:30.099 --> 00:58:30.109
as well this idea of where data sciences
 

00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:34.390
as well this idea of where data sciences
and Social Science intersect and the

00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400
and Social Science intersect and the
 

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.059
and Social Science intersect and the
extent of it you see the need for new

00:58:37.059 --> 00:58:37.069
extent of it you see the need for new
 

00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:39.630
extent of it you see the need for new
studies in social science on account of

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:39.640
studies in social science on account of
 

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.740
studies in social science on account of
the fact that you have all these new

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:41.750
the fact that you have all these new
 

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:45.370
the fact that you have all these new
kinds of data sources being being made

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:45.380
kinds of data sources being being made
 

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.890
kinds of data sources being being made
available do you see that as something

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:47.900
available do you see that as something
 

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:54.160
available do you see that as something
that is part of SD ease sort of focus or

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:54.170
that is part of SD ease sort of focus or
 

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:55.839
that is part of SD ease sort of focus or
is do you see this as part of

00:58:55.839 --> 00:58:55.849
is do you see this as part of
 

00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:57.700
is do you see this as part of
the cross Directorate efforts that your

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:57.710
the cross Directorate efforts that your
 

00:58:57.710 --> 00:59:01.089
the cross Directorate efforts that your
outline because I could see elements of

00:59:01.089 --> 00:59:01.099
outline because I could see elements of
 

00:59:01.099 --> 00:59:03.969
outline because I could see elements of
it in both these both both aspects of

00:59:03.969 --> 00:59:03.979

some ideas about what you think we

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:43.130
some ideas about what you think we
 

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:45.340
some ideas about what you think we
should do this is a time when we really

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:45.350
should do this is a time when we really
 

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:48.220
should do this is a time when we really
are thinking about the challenges for

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:48.230
are thinking about the challenges for
 

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:49.960
are thinking about the challenges for
the future because we have a little time

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:49.970
the future because we have a little time
 

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.150
the future because we have a little time
now because we don't have to develop

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160
now because we don't have to develop
 

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.610
now because we don't have to develop
that fiscal year twenty eighteen budget

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:54.620
that fiscal year twenty eighteen budget
 

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:58.000
that fiscal year twenty eighteen budget
and I have asked every group I've spoken

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:58.010
and I have asked every group I've spoken
 

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.460
and I have asked every group I've spoken
with today what are what are the grand

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:00.470
with today what are what are the grand
 

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:03.550
with today what are what are the grand
challenges in the SPE sciences so if you

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:03.560
challenges in the SPE sciences so if you
 

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.880
challenges in the SPE sciences so if you
wrote up for me a couple of your

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:06.890
wrote up for me a couple of your
 

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:08.500
wrote up for me a couple of your
thoughts about what we should be doing

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:08.510
thoughts about what we should be doing
 

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:12.010
thoughts about what we should be doing
there and what we shouldn't be doing it

01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:12.020
there and what we shouldn't be doing it
 

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:14.050
there and what we shouldn't be doing it
would mean a lot and we take it very

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:14.060
would mean a lot and we take it very
 

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:17.500
would mean a lot and we take it very
seriously hey one last and very quick

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:17.510
seriously hey one last and very quick
 

01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:19.740
seriously hey one last and very quick
lesson

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:19.750
lesson
 

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.210
lesson
so you talked about the two challenges

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:21.220
so you talked about the two challenges
 

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.670
so you talked about the two challenges
and they kind of play off each other a

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680
and they kind of play off each other a
 

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.500
and they kind of play off each other a
little bit and I was wondering if you

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:25.510
little bit and I was wondering if you
 

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:28.920
little bit and I was wondering if you
talked about that so for example the

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:28.930
talked about that so for example the
 

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:32.760
talked about that so for example the
incentives for producing novel insights

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:32.770
incentives for producing novel insights
 

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:36.420
incentives for producing novel insights
new contributions things that state

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:36.430
new contributions things that state
 

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:38.310
new contributions things that state
legislators about to move on or just

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:38.320
legislators about to move on or just
 

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.570
legislators about to move on or just
replicate already and how do you

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:41.580
replicate already and how do you
 

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.300
replicate already and how do you
communicate that value of the

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:45.310
communicate that value of the
 

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:54.090
communicate that value of the
replication well I think we are

01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:54.100
replication well I think we are
 

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.140
replication well I think we are
communicating it by simply having an

01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:58.150
communicating it by simply having an
 

01:05:58.150 --> 01:06:00.870
communicating it by simply having an
interest in robust and reliable science

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880
interest in robust and reliable science
 

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.160
interest in robust and reliable science
this whole theme is so important that

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:05.170
this whole theme is so important that
 

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:08.810
this whole theme is so important that

officers and Marcia McNutt editor of
 

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.300
officers and Marcia McNutt editor of
science came and spoke because Marcia

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:24.310
science came and spoke because Marcia
 

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:27.030

McNutt really cares about data sharing

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:27.040
McNutt really cares about data sharing
 

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.580
McNutt really cares about data sharing
she really cares about robust and

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:29.590
she really cares about robust and
 

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:31.830
she really cares about robust and
reliable science she really said cares

01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:31.840
reliable science she really said cares
 

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.860
reliable science she really said cares
about ethical research and so she spoke

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:34.870
about ethical research and so she spoke
 

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:38.820
about ethical research and so she spoke
and really challenged us across the

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:38.830
and really challenged us across the
 

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:42.570
and really challenged us across the
foundation and so SBE has taken up that

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:42.580
foundation and so SBE has taken up that
 

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.990
foundation and so SBE has taken up that
gauntlet and said it's not an SBE

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000
gauntlet and said it's not an SBE
 

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.030
gauntlet and said it's not an SBE
problem per se but we in SBE can help

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:51.040
problem per se but we in SBE can help
 

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.740
problem per se but we in SBE can help
address the issue and if you look around

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:55.750
address the issue and if you look around
 

01:06:55.750 --> 01:07:00.420
address the issue and if you look around
some of the SBE disciplines some there

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:00.430
some of the SBE disciplines some there

some of the SBE disciplines some there
has become a real renewed interest in

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200
has become a real renewed interest in
 

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.920
has become a real renewed interest in
the importance of replication and the

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:07.930
the importance of replication and the
 

01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:13.580
the importance of replication and the
importance of reproducibility and we are

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:13.590
importance of reproducibility and we are
 

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:18.860
importance of reproducibility and we are
figuring out ways that we can legitimize

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:18.870
figuring out ways that we can legitimize
 

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:24.030
figuring out ways that we can legitimize
the importance of reproducing and

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:24.040
the importance of reproducing and
 

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.970
the importance of reproducing and
