00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.790
This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.520
It's not just a sedan, it's a Subaru.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.810
Everyone thinks they’re a good driver - but
it turns out, morning people might just have

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.830
the upper hand!

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.170
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and like most
of us out there, you probably think you’re

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.240
an excellent driver.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.970
Maybe you’ve bragged about it to your friends
- I know I have.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.690
But what actually makes someone a good driver?

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.910
Well it turns out, things you’d never even
think of, can have a drastic impact on your

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.910
driving ability.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.800
And a new study, published in Accident Analysis
and Prevention, shows that being a morning

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.540
person - actually makes you a better driver.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.730
For this study, a team of researchers analyzed
the circadian, biological rhythms of 29 students

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.430
from the University of Granada, with extremely
defined chronotypes.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.320
A chronotype is basically an internal timer,
that indicates whether someone is a morning

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.980
person or a night person.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.480
Now because the topic of sleep medicine has
become more and more well-researched over

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.230
the past few decades, science has effectively
determined that every person has a specific

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.390
chronotype, built into their DNA.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390
So no matter what your upbringing was, your
chronotype is pretty much unchangeable.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.450
And it all stems from your hypothalamus.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.299
This is the part of your brain that links
your nervous system up with your endocrine

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.500
system, and it basically regulates all of
your necessary bodily functions - hunger,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.080
thirst, body temperature, and sleep.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.650
Contained inside the hypothalamus, is something
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.130
And this particular part, is essentially your
internal clock.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.189
It interacts with your optic nerve, so that
when your eye detects light, that light travels

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.549
down the nerve, stimulating the SCN.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.869
So all of your neural and hormonal activity
is regulated, based on your personal circadian

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:39.869
rhythm.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.970
Now like I said, all of the students in this
study were chosen because they had very defined

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.970
chronotypes.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.470
So to see if that affected their driving abilities,
researchers had them fill out a questionnaire,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.200
and then undergo a simulated driving test
at various times throughout the day.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.840
Turns out, the students who considered themselves
“morning people,” were far better drivers

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.460
at 8am, than night owls.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.790
And you might think that effect would be reversed
in the evening, but it wasn’t.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.189
Even at 8pm, morning people were still just
as alert and aware while driving, as they

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.679
were in the morning.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.290
Interestingly, there do appear to be certain
times of the day, where almost everyone is

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.629
a poor driver, and that includes early afternoon
- around 2-3pm - and early morning, around

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.629
3-5am.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.180
Now the obvious solution here - would be to
just not drive during those times, or at the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.680
very least, try to be especially vigilant
while doing so.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.999
But a lot of professions, like truck drivers
or airline pilots - don’t really have a

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:30.999
choice.

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.379
They have to stay up, no matter how much sleep
they get.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.250
Which as we know, can be extremely deadly.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.980
Studies have shown that driving when you haven’t
slept for 18 hours - is equally as dangerous,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.090
as driving drunk.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.459
So the authors of this study, recommend that
professional drivers try to perform their

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.000
routes according to their personal chronotypes.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.739
As for the rest of us, driving on little to
no sleep - especially if you’re a night

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.919
owl - is something we should all try to avoid.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.829
And while we’re on the topic of driving,
we wanna say a quick thank you to Subaru,

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.510
for making this episode possible.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.689
And especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy
- it goes where other sedans can’t, by offering

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.459
a safer and more dynamic ride than ever before.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.040
In the meantime, let us know in the comments
below whether you’re a morning person, or

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.639
a night owl - and how you think that affects
your ability to drive.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.090
That’s all for me, but as always - thank
you guys for watching!
