00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.440
So in problem 44, once again
we have the exact same setup

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.830
that we had in
problems 42 and 43.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.330
But now they're
asking us the number

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.440
of A in T sub p such
that the determinant of A

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.040
is not divisible by p.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.120
Well, we've already done
some work in problem 43

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.750
in figuring out some
set of the members that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.882
are divisible by p.

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:25.340
So why don't we just figure
out the total number of members

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.840
of T sub p, and then subtract
the total members whose

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.000
determinants are divisible
by p, and then we'll

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.890
get this answer right over here.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:44.050
So what's the total
members in T sub p?

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.880
Well, for a, I have p
possible choices, right?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.590
If I'm picking between-- up to
p minus 1, but I'm including 0,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.200
there's actually p
possible choices.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.362
So I have p possible
choices for a,

00:00:54.362 --> 00:00:56.860
p possible choices for
b by the same logic,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.270
and p possible choices for c.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.790
So I have p to the
third possibilities.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.640
So there are a total of p to
the third members in T sub p.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.790
Now, what did the
last problem tell us?

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.580
This was number 43.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.840
It told us the members-- maybe
I should write it this way.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:26.560
The number of members, numbers
of A's, such that the trace

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.270
of A-- this was
the language I used

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.300
in the last video or the last
problem-- such that the trace

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:41.220
of A not divisible by p,
but the determinant of A is.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.270
And we got the answer
as p minus 1 squared.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.270
Now, if you remember that
problem, and even just

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.500
to do that problem,
when we thought

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.390
about this statement,
such that the trace of A

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.630
is not divisible by
p, we figured out

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.670
that this was exactly equal to
saying that A does not equal 0.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.800
So one way to view the
result of problem 43

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.920
is if you assume that
A is not equal to 0,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480
there are p minus 1 squared
members of T sub p where

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.840
the determinant
is divisible by p.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.570
So we're starting to count some
of the A's whose determinant

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.340
is divisible by p.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.860
But these are the only--
the matrix A's whose

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.900
a entry is not equal to 0.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.530
So if we want to
count all of them,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.380
we have to also count the
ones where a does equal 0,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.630
so where a does equal 0.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.060
So let's think about that case.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.070
We can figure out how
many matrices there

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.710
are where a does equal 0,
and the determinant of A

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.780
is divisible by p.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.790
Add it to that.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.992
Then we have the total
number of A's whose

00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:57.325
determinants are divisible by p.

00:02:57.325 --> 00:02:59.660
And we could subtract
that from the total number

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.430
of possibilities, and hopefully,
we'll get one of the answers

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.157
up here.

00:03:03.157 --> 00:03:04.740
So let's think a
little bit about what

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.450
will the determinant
look like over here?

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.830
So in this situation, the
determinant of our matrix

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.070
will be-- it's a squared.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.180
It's a times a minus b
times c, a squared minus bc.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.840
Now, we're assuming
that a is equal to 0.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.600
If a is equal to 0, it's
equal to negative bc.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.530
And we need to think
about how is this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.615
going to be a
multiple, or how is

00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:33.350
this going to be divisible by p?

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.700
So this has got to be equal
to some multiple of p.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.370
So the first thing, just
think about b's and the c's.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.110
They are both non-negative.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.740
So this value right
here cannot be negative.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.950
So if you put a negative sign
there, it cannot be positive.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.970
So it can't be any
positive multiples of p.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.880
It could be 0.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.190
So we could have negative bc.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.250
We could have negative
bc is equal to 0, which

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.690
is equivalent to saying
that bc is equal to 0.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.450
That's one possibility,
where it equals 0 times p.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.790
That's still a multiple.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.560
Or maybe it could be negative.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.420
Maybe we could have negative bc
is equal to negative 1 times p.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.990
But when you think about
it here, if this was true,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.460
that would mean that bc
is equal to p, so b or c

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.250
would be factors of p.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.120
Now, we know that p
is a prime number.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.182
Its factors are only 1 and p.

00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:36.780
b and c-- I mean, one of
these guys could be 1,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.530
but then the other guy
would have to be p.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.360
They can't be p.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.620
They only get as
high as p minus 1.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.340
This is not an option.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.420
So the only possibility, if a is
equal to 0, for the determinant

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.580
of capital A to still
be divisible by p,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.460
is for bc to be equal to 0.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.010
So let's think about how
many possibilities there

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.976
are over here.

00:04:54.976 --> 00:04:56.850
So let's think about
all of the combinations.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.030
So there's the one situation,
where b and c are equal to 0.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.299
b and c is equal to 0.

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:04.840
Now let's think
about the other ones.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.560
There's one where b is
equal to 0 and c isn't.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.680
bc will still equal
0 in this situation.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.580
So how many
possibilities are there?

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.860
How many possibilities
are there for this?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.190
Well, b is equal to 0.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.420
C over here can be any
value, although we've already

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.630
considered the case
where c is equal to 0.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.190
So it could be any
value so that we

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.050
don't double count, any value
where c does not equal 0.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.405
So it could be 1
through p minus 1.

00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:34.780
Or another way to
think about it,

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.540
there's p minus 1 possibilities.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.400
Now let's think about c
is equal to 0 and b isn't.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.827
Well, exact same logic.

00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:46.535
Once again, we don't
want to double count

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:48.559
that they're both
being equal to 0.

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:49.350
So let me write it.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.920
And c isn't-- well,
we're saying it isn't 0,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.295
so we are actually already
putting that constraint there.

00:05:54.295 --> 00:05:57.960
So it has p minus
1 possibilities.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.200
So how many total
possibilities do we

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.140
have where the
determinant of A is

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.830
equal to 0 and a is equal to 0?

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.060
So we have one here.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.030
We have one possibility here,
then p minus 1 and p minus 1.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.380
So our total possibilities
are p minus 1 plus p minus 1

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:25.670
plus 1, which is 2p minus 2
plus 1, which is 2p minus 1.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.860
2p minus 1 incremental
possibilities

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.970
when a is equal to 0
for the determinant of A

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.760
to be divisible by p.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.550
So that's what we just
got in this video.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.040
In the last video, we had p
minus 1 squared possibility

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.070
when a does not equal 0.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.066
So if we want the total
number of A's, where

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:43.690
the determinant of
A is divisible by 0,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.770
we can add the number that
we got in the last video

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.200
to the number we just got.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.590
So let's do that.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.060
So if I were to
rewrite this over here,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.370
this is equal to p
squared minus 2p plus 1.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.380
And then I want to
add this 2p minus 1

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.560
here, so plus 2p minus 1.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.180
And what do I get?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.780
These cancel out.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.410
These cancel with that.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.220
And these guys cancel out.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:24.940
So there's a total of p
squared possible A's where

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.370
the determinant of
A is divisible by p.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.340
Now, we're very close, but
this isn't what they're asking.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.270
They want the total members
where the determinant of A

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.890
is not divisible by p.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.770
So all we have to do here is
take our total membership,

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.570
which is p to the third,
and subtract from that

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.272
the members whose determinants
are divisible by p.

00:07:50.272 --> 00:07:51.480
And we just figured that out.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.380
We subtract p squared.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:08:03.350
And now we'll get the number
of A's where determinant of A

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.260
not divisible by p.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.440
Now let's see if that's one
of the choices, and it is.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.400
D, p cubed minus p squared.
