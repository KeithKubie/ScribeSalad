00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.440
At this point, we’ve covered a lot of the
basics when it comes to how things move.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.590
But we’ve mostly been focusing on only one
type of motion: translational motion,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.950
which is when something moves through space,
but doesn’t rotate.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.500
But rotational motion is also a thing -- and
an important one.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.960
For example, the spin of a football -- both
the soccer and the non-soccer kind --

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.720
will affect the way it flies through the air.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.660
But the physics of rotational motion isn’t
all that different from the physics of translational motion.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.330
It still involves things like position, velocity,
and acceleration.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.829
And many of the equations you use to describe
rotational motion will look really familiar to you.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.440
But there are some important differences.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.129
Like, instead of positions, there are angles.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.249
And instead of points on a line, you follow
points along an arc.

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:47.589
And, there are times when rotational motion can explain things that sound impossible, but actually are true.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.869
Like when a point on a spinning wheel,
is actually standing still.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:52.620
So, the rules here are the same.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.469
But rotational motion has what you might call
its own “circular logic.”

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:10.080
[Theme Music]

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.480
When it comes to translational motion, we tend to talk about position in terms of x and y.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.540
Where is this object, horizontally?
And where is it vertically?

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.729
Those axes make sense, because we’re usually
tracking the object’s motion along those directions.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.020
But for rotational motion, we really want
to know the object’s angle -- what we call theta.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.579
Say we have a big disk with a dot painted
on it.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.900
If we call the top of the disk our starting point, then when the dot is at the top, its angle would be zero.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.759
And when the dot is at the left, its angle
would be 180 degrees -- half of a full circle.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.520
But! Even though we’ve been measuring angles
using degrees until now, there’s another

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.940
unit that physicists use a lot, and it’ll
be the main one we’ll use in this episode and the next.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.299
That unit is called the radian, and its name
comes from the fact that it’s based on the radius of a circle.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.520
If you think back to basic geometry, you’ll
recall that the circumference of a circle

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.469
is just 2, times pi, times the circle’s
radius, right?

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.700
Radians describe angles by essentially telling you how much of that circumference is covered by a given angle.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.670
So, 360 degrees -- which is a full circle’s
worth of angles -- would be 2 pi radians.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.690
180 degrees -- or half a circle’s worth
of angles -- would be pi radians.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.420
And to convert any number of degrees to radians, you just multiply the degrees times pi and divide by 180.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.440
So now we know how to describe the angle of
something that’s rotating.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.760
But what about the velocity of its rotation?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.480
Well, we’ve already learned that plain old translational, or linear, velocity is a measure of an object’s change in position.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.380
And in the same way, rotational velocity is
a measure of an object’s change in angle.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.700
This is known as its angular velocity, and
is represented by the lowercase Greek letter, Omega.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.700
which I want to point out looks a bit like a W, but itsn't a W.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.220
And, as you might have guessed by now, angular
velocity is the derivative -- or, the rate

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.450
of change -- of angular displacement with
respect to time.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.110
But we can also describe an object’s rotation
in terms of its tangential velocity.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.970
This is the same type of velocity we used
when we talked about the physics of uniform circular motion.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.060
Remember? With the key spinning around on
a string?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.720
And that vomit-causing carnival ride?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.330
In those cases, we described how, when an
object moves along a circular path, its velocity

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.070
is perpendicular to the radius of the circle,
in the direction of the motion.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.760
And, when you think about it, any rigid object
rotating around a fixed axis is basically

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.550
a set of points, all moving along circular
paths.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.530
So, at any given moment, each of those points
will have a tangential velocity that depends

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.870
on the path it moves through -- specifically,
the radius of that path.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.260
In fact, its tangential velocity will be equal
to its angular velocity, times the radius.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.510
It’s easy to see why this makes sense, if
you picture the spokes of a rotating wheel.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.370
All of the points along each spoke have to
have the same angular velocity, because they

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.690
all cover the same angular distance in the
same amount of time.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.570
But to get from, say, the right-hand side
of the circle to the bottom, the points on

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.470
the outside of the wheel will pass through
a much bigger arc -- covering more space,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.360
basically -- than the points on the inside.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.210
So, the farther that a point on the spoke
is from the center of the wheel, the greater

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.340
its tangential velocity has to be.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.750
Like circular motion, rotational motion can
also be periodic -- when the rotation repeats

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.440
after a set amount of time, which is represented by a  capital T, also called The Period.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.320
And the equations that describe periodic motion
are pretty much the same as the ones we used

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.840
for a single point moving along a circular
path:

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.639
So the frequency, or number of rotations that
happen every second, is equal to one, divided by the period.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.230
But frequency and angular velocity are really
just two different ways of describing the

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.090
same thing -- they just use different units.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.440
Frequency is measured in rotations -- or revolutions
-- per second, and angular velocity is measured

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.730
in radians per second.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.960
And one revolution is equal to the circumference
of the circle: 2 pi radians.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.690
So, in order to convert from frequency to
angular velocity, all you need to do is multiply

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.890
the frequency by 2 pi.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.450
Now, there’s a special case when it comes
to the velocity of rotating objects, and that’s

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.360
what’s known as rolling without slipping.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.110
This kind of motion shows up in real life
all the time.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.700
It’s what happens to your car’s tires
when you drive down the street, as long as

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.160
you aren’t skidding -- which, let’s hope
you aren’t.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.260
And it’s what a train’s wheels do as they
move along the track.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.720
But it turns out that the translational velocity
at the bottom of the wheel is /super weird/.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.080
Mainly, because at any given moment, the point at the bottom of the wheel doesn’t have a translational velocity.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.680
In other words, it doesn’t actually move.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.290
To figure out why, let’s experiment with
a bicycle wheel.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.820
If you roll the wheel along the floor for
one full rotation, that means that the entire

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.500
circumference of the wheel will touch the
floor, one point at a time.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.139
And the center of the wheel will move forward
by a distance that’s equal to the circumference

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.120
of the wheel -- aka its radius, times 2 pi.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.530
And the time it took to move that distance
was equal to the period of the motion.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.460
So, the translational velocity of the center
was equal to the radius, times the angular velocity.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.580
Now, what about the top of the wheel?

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.100
It has the same translational velocity as
the center of the wheel, plus the tangential

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.990
velocity that comes from the wheel’s rotation.
Because, at the top of the wheel, the tangential

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.860
velocity is pointing in the direction the
wheel is rolling in.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.680
And in the same way, the bottom of the wheel
has the same translational velocity as the

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.139
center of the wheel, minus the tangential
velocity that comes from the wheel’s rotation.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.240
Because at the bottom of the wheel, the tangential velocity is pointing opposite to the direction the wheel is rolling in.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.480
Here’s the weird part:

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.720
We just saw that the translational velocity of the wheel is equal to the radius, times the angular velocity.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.470
And we know that in general, the magnitude
of tangential velocity is also equal to

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.389
the radius, times the angular velocity.

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.960
So, the top of the wheel will be moving exactly twice as fast as the center of the wheel, relative to the ground.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.660
Because, to get its total velocity, you add
the translational velocity to the tangential velocity.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.230
But the bottom of the wheel won’t be moving
at all … because its total velocity is

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.880
its translational velocity minus the tangential,
since they’re moving in opposite directions.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.669
As a result, the total velocity at the bottom
of the wheel is zero.

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.520
Even though the wheel is clearly moving relative
to the ground.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.419
But if you look at the wheel’s motion at
any given instant, you’ll see that whatever

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.000
point is at the bottom of the wheel can’t
be moving relative to the ground.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.389
If it was moving relative to the ground
… that would be what we call slipping.

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:49.310
Like when a car is skidding on an icy ground:
The wheel isn’t turning, but the bottom

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.440
of the wheel is moving in relation to the
ground, because it’s sliding along on top of it.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.860
But this wheel isn’t slipping -- its bottom has a total velocity of zero, because its velocities cancel out.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.500
OK: I know I just blew your mind, so while
you put your head back together, I want to

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.570
talk about one more basic quality of rotational
motion: angular acceleration.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.090
Based on what you already know about acceleration,
you can already guess that angular acceleration

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.020
is the derivative of angular velocity.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.550
It’s represented by the lowercase Greek
letter alpha, and it describes how an object’s

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.880
angular velocity is changing over time.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.810
And as an object rotates,  each point on it can actually accelerate in two different ways.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.370
Radial acceleration is another term for what we’ve been calling centripetal acceleration up until now.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.130
It’s the acceleration inward of any point
on our rotating object, and it’s equal to

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.889
the angular velocity, squared, times the radius.

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:41.790
But there’s also tangential acceleration,
which describes whether an individual point on a rotating object

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.940
is speeding up or slowing down.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.280
So, like linear velocity, tangential acceleration
depends on the distance between the point

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.630
and the center of the object.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.500
More specifically, it’s equal to the angular
acceleration, times the radius.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.240
So you see, angular position, velocity, and
acceleration relate to each other in much

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.800
the same ways that linear position, velocity,
and acceleration do.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.470
This allows us to talk about rotational motion
with terms and equations that are familiar

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.919
to us, once we’ve gotten the basics of translational
motion under our belts.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.640
Next time, we’ll see how how the logic of rotational motion applies to another idea: momentum!

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.000
For now, you learned about the qualities of
rotational motion, including angular position,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.130
angular velocity, periodic motion, and the
special case of rolling without slipping.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.900
We also talked about angular acceleration,
as well as constant angular acceleration.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.160
