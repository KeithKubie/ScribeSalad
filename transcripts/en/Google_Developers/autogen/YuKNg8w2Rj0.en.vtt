00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.140
 here is a new episode of evidence of 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.820
 tour if nation I am Alberto 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.100
 last time we saw comments 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.350
 pay an application remotely 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.180
 runs on an android device is like 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.310
 see what the listener events are 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.020
 linked to an html element 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.119
 in this episode we will see two instead 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.950
 other panels of chromebook tools that 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.140
 are the network panel respectively 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.120
 in which we can see the requests 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.010
 http that are carried out and the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.710
 timeline panel in which in particular 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.720
 this episode we will see how to analyze the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.070
 declines in the performance of 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.070
 rendering of a web page 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 ok let's see here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.960
 the next request from the boss tells us 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.290
 hi alberto the problem oct not 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.730
 it works what's wrong then 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.920
 bring up the pop up about 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.360
 click on the respective option in the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.280
 menu and this is what it says 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.640
 this is a game in which the anci lady 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.680
 shuriken error for in the number of 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.790
 visits 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.160
 so let's try to understand what that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.530
 cause this error to do this 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.040
 take the magnifying glass here and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.360
 we select about from the menu so it 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 we highlighted in the panel of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.040
 elements and from here we can go to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.080
 see if listener we have the listener 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.610
 for the click action with the mouse and here 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.619
 the respective code is the function that 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.100
 it is executed which is this melted 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.560
 the cup in turn this function which 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 love the to coast to function with these 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.460
 parameters 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.520
 let's quickly see what 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.110
 are and what the parameters do are a 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.440
 data url them post is a call back la 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.840
 function executes a call le jobs a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.060
 this scream with these parameters and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.820
 when it is done it will be called 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.040
 this callback with data and response 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.430
 we will have received you 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.600
 then returning to ceva pop up 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.610
 the callback function that comes 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.000
 performed is this part summer stars 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.239
 menshov earth for example these 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 operations take input data and go 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.500
 to check that the first character is 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.250
 a symbol of minor if it is not 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.850
 launch error otherwise xml e 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.110
 then show a law now we can 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.660
 analyze the data we received 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.410
 incoming in two ways one by issuing a 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.049
 breakpoint here and going to see that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.900
 object type is this an alternative 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.790
 and use the network panel in fact 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.739
 if we go here 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.299
 we see that there is this request that is 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.269
 was done when we clicked 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.069
 on the about option we can 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.379
 see again when i am here 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.049
 here is the request again 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:12.129
 with the network panel here it will be 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.489
 we select we can see that we have 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:19.090
 all information on eders of 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:21.280
 request and response is a preview 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.040
 of the response we received in 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.120
 this case we can see that 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.250
 instead we receive an SM as an answer 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.230
 these data here where it tells us that 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.019
 these pious has been deprecated that 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.239
 we must instead the jason ok maybe 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.969
 we could have known more about it 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.889
 nice but at least we found out what it is 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.500
 the problem 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:48.639
 so let's lose it by luck 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 I had already prepared the function that 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:55.209
 all a jason passes and then we go to 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:01.620
 call this instead of in operation 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.620
 that can also xml lady at the exchange 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:13.620
 we call jazz I like xml we talk 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.620
 back to the page 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.810
 click on the bout button and that's it 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:24.070
 now the number of visits has appeared 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.539
 of this page 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.130
 we can go see the panel 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.770
 network and then we see that we have the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.190
 request we made 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.830
 we can see here it is if there 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.070
 we click we can see the same 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.870
 what for those to ask here and paolo 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.139
 why give an answer with our e 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.139
 jason 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.670
 in the last episode 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.710
 had asked to modify the 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.060
 behaviors of this button and of 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.040
 make sure that when cyclical they go 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.800
 above then they are loaded into the belt 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.120
 little dogs instead of a solo 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.480
 however obviously problems are not finished 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.560
 here we say hello alberto the shurikens 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.760
 they are slow do not kill take them fast 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.980
 ok 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.300
 let's try a little we put 200c together 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:20.960
 at the belt and we launch them 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:26.750
 actually there are some words to say 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.180
 back lenses we can see that 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.850
 chrome is not fast enough to 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.490
 efficiently redesign everyone 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.390
 these elements to try to understand 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.600
 what's the problem 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.280
 we use the fein e screen 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.110
 here we can see all the events that 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.230
 they fall during the execution of the page 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.290
 frame after frame maybe now update the 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.060
 page many colored bars appear 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:54.710
 of different length 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.150
 whose color can be explained here 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.880
 Blue walls are logging events 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.640
 collegiate of writings violet rendering e 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.920
 green paintings also here we have some 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.470
 vertical bars that are 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:12.500
 respectively the don 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:15.500
 contemplates an amendment of them in the 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.700
 our case, however, we are interested in this 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.410
 part here with the suter in then 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.240
 let's add flowers we make 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:28.370
 start a recording and leave them 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.180
 here we can see that the graph is 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.770
 populates with many colored bars 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.430
 we come to the registration and we go to 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.990
 see what it is here we have one 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.720
 horizontal line representing the 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.450
 30 frames per second 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.100
 here we have so many vertical walls that 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.110
 represent law of execution of 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.480
 every single frame those that go 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.850
 over the first 30 second line 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.040
 it means that they are failing and therefore 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.250
 we can't get to 3 from the first to the 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.800
 second but it will certainly be less 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.840
 we can click here to select 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.690
 this area we can make it here 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.319
 below in the diagram drawn where we see 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.610
 there are several purple horizontal lines 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.680
 which are much larger than all the 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.840
 other 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.930
 here we also see the code that comes 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.530
 followed in this case is of type 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:26.099
 calculation of the style we laugh at above 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.080
 this function brings us the function 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:30.560
 anime it being called in 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.550
 continuation through a set time out 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.680
 the operation that is performed that 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.659
 cause the problem is this here where to 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.069
 move on you and then to animate it 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:41.310
 system change it 

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:43.229
 the property letter pro vita css 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.530
 which is very inefficient because it doesn't 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:48.120
 we are exploiting class acceleration 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:51.000
 we can try to solve using 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.560
 instead the css 3 transformer e properties 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.569
 francisco 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.000
 little parenthesis always better 

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:59.639
 use a class there is sexy instead 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.050
 that we're going to type it through games in 

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:04.590
 this case is only a 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.669
 let us therefore take the example 

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.009
 this new code 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:09.870
 we comment on this and this is no longer there 

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:15.210
 need animation because there 

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:19.199
 will think css 3 properties except yes 

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:21.000
 start the page made in the screen 

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:24.090
 timeline bit to gate this fact that 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.060
 no need 200 usual load we do 

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:29.610
 starting a recording and 

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:33.800
 then let's see that they are already a lot 

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.800
 slower and here we can see that 

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:38.339
 all the bars now are always a 

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.860
 a bit long because there is work anyway 

00:08:38.339 --> 00:08:43.649
 to do to draw but they are almost 

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.779
 all except these initials under the 

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:48.450
 30 first second line so so 

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:51.329
 we managed to improve a little 

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:54.870
 rendering performance of ours 

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:56.600
 application thanks for your attention 

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:01.550
 in the next episode we will talk about 

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.550
 we will talk about fine memory problems
