00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.490
As you're becoming a more discerning programmer, at least a more tasteful one,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.890
there's something about this that should still really bother you, in addition to

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.239
the fact that Dave is not getting eaten any more. We've got a big chunk of

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.746
duplicated code here. Well, it's only one line, but it could be a lot more,

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:17.307
depending on what you have to do to actually eat someone. If the victim is not

00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:21.455
named Dave, both the Discerning Bear and the regular bear and the regular

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:25.255
Grizzly Bear do the same thing. We had to cut and paste that code to get that

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:29.568
behavior here. What we'd like is a way to be able to access the original eat

00:00:29.568 --> 00:00:33.990
method of bear from inside the method we're writing to override that method. We

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.190
could change the name here, but that wouldn't solve our problem because then

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.240
inside chase which is defined inside grizzly bear, we would get the wrong

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.338
method. So we can't change the name of this method. It still needs to be called

00:00:43.338 --> 00:00:46.985
eat, but we want a way of accessing the eat method of bear. To do this, we need

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:51.688
a special operator, which is the super operator. What super does is it takes A

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:56.422
class and an object, and it returns a special proxy. This is sort of like an

00:00:56.422 --> 00:01:01.786
object, except it ignores the new definitions provided by class. What this means

00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:06.466
is we can replace the code here with a call to super, passing in discerning bear

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:11.045
and self, and that will mean We're ignoring the overridden eat method. So now

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:14.231
when we get the eat method, we're going to get the eat method from the

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:18.184
GrizzlyBear class, which turns out, is the eat method it inherited from the Bear

00:01:18.184 --> 00:01:22.345
class. And the one requirement is that the object that's passed in must be an

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:23.609
instance of the class.
