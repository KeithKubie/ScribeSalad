00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.269
One of the hardest questions when you think
about the evolution of the human species,

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:12.580
from the standard framework of evolution,
which really is about individual survival,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.529
competing, getting your genes to the next
generation -- one of the hardest questions

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.340
within that framework is why are people so
frequently and routinely good and generous

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.890
and sacrificing, right?

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.300
And you know, most people think that Darwin
had this idea of "survival of the fittest"

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.769
that really it's the most ruthless and bloodthirsty
who really thrive and survive.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:42.440
That is not Darwin's view of human evolution
at all he really felt that sympathy is the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.069
strongest instinct that human's have.

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:49.960
Communities that have the most sympathetic
members will flourish and raise the greatest

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.550
number of offspring.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.930
That notion of Darwin's led to this sense
that out of the vulnerability of our offspring

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.800
emerged, first of all social structures like
cooperative care giving and then also physiological

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.780
systems shaped by evolution to help take care
of the carriers of our genes:our offspring.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.579
We have learned from neuroscience down at
UCLA that if you feel physical pain, a part

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.630
of your brain lights up and if I see you have
that physical pain, the same part of my brain

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.080
lights up.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.320
It's as if we're wired to have the same experience
of other people.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.729
Empathy is this really complicated task.

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.259
It really engages the frontal lobes, these
newer regions of the cortex that are involved

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.530
in more complex symbolic processes like language
and imagining the future.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.579
Because empathy requires that you think: there's
someone else out there who has feelings and

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.770
thoughts that may be different from mine -- that's
a really complicated cognitive achievement.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.880
In my lab, the Berkeley social interaction
lab, we showed images of prototypical suffering

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.630
to our participants.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.020
They trigger massively powerful reactions
of compassion and what we found in the brain

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.120
is that a very old part of the brain called
the periaqueductal gray, which is common to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.820
mammals when they take care of things, lights
up when you feel compassion.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.870
So that tells us, compassion is really old
in the nervous system as Darwin speculated.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.099
My students and I got really interested in
social class.

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.349
What does it do to the human mind?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.370
Our lab and other labs are interested in something
called the vagus nerve.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.780
It's the longest bundle of nerves in the human
nervous system.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.540
In our research compassion, the feeling of
caring for someone in need, activates the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.830
vagus nerve.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.099
Lower class individuals, if we show them images
of suffering, they have a vagus nerve response.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.489
You don't see that in upper class individuals.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.860
It literally is a compassion deficit that's
produced by lots of wealth.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.810
Next set of studies on charity: who gives?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.440
Economic analyses would say if I have a lot
of money, it should be easy to give.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.599
If I have 900 bucks in my bank account, giving
away money -- it really matters, you know,

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.439
it matters what you put in your fridge.

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:20.439
And in spite of that what we find is lower
class individuals give more, and this is replicated

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.860
in studies of philanthropy.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.299
You know one of things this science tells
us is there is enormous strength in these

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:35.200
poorer communities of generosity and empathy
that you know, many people in more privileged

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.189
circumstances miss -- it's strong community.

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:47.049
Yeah, you know 60 percent of what we do is
really about maximizing an individual's personal

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.800
gratification and desire, just the classic
survival of the most competitive -- but 40

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.189
percent of the time, we're really doing things
for other people and we sacrifice and we risk

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.269
exploitation and we still do it.

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.750
And not only that but, it actually becomes
personally fulfilling and inspiring to engage

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.800
in that work, we find these secondary delights
in enacting on behalf of others.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.620
And I think that it really requires that we
redefine human self-interest.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.460
You know, the great ethical traditions have
always been encouraging this and now we're

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.730
seeing the science say, yeah that brain really
cares about other people.
