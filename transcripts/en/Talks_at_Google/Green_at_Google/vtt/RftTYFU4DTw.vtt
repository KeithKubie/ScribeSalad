OTTO SCHARMER: So good
morning, everyone.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.780
I do feel this situation
has happened often

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.620
to me because I am from MIT.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.240
And I don't know how often we
do also these live, global, very

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.330
ambitious things.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.940
And you run into all the
fundamental problems.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.720
And then, oh, what?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.220
Really?

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.920
Is that true?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.230
MIT, and you can't put
these two things together?

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.340
So I have been in that
situation also quite often.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:45.740
So I want to share this
morning a few experiences

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.640
and stories around two guiding
questions that interest me

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.140
most.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.380
One is how to use the power of
technology for good basically.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:07.230
And as we all know, [INAUDIBLE]
and others from the Arab Spring

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.980
revolution, and so on, there
is with many people a sense

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.920
that social media is
good at breaking things.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.650
But is it also good
at making things?

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.480
So that has been called into
question by social change

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.960
activists more recently.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.450
So how to use technology
for good is one question.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.180
And the other one is how to
use the power of mindfulness

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.520
not only for the cultivation
of the individual,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.380
but also for the evolution
and transformation of larger

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.450
systems, of the collective.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.720
So that's really
what's interesting me,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.100
and the intersection
of these two questions.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.600
So I want to also introduce
my colleague and co-creator

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.370
of U.Lab at MIT and the
Presencing Institute Adam

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.600
Yukelson, who on short
notice is in town

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.450
and is able to also join in
for the discussion later today.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.340
So I want to start off
with-- I know no one can

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460
see it, but maybe some remote.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.090
So it's basically--
oh, we have it here.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.280
Wonderful, we have it here.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.460
So it's that kind of situation.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.890
I just find it interesting,
and I'm sure many of you

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.370
have experienced that as well.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.560
You go to other countries,
you go to other systems

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.060
and communities,
this kind of feeling,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.710
a feeling of disruptive
change is true on many levels

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.800
off scale today on
an individual level.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.590
Organizationally,
we face disruption.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.700
Certainly, here in Europe.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.360
I mean, no one needs
to explain that.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.730
But also worldwide
with ecological

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.243
and social and other challenges.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.750
So everyone is talking
about disruption.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.760
That's no longer anything new.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.650
What's the perspective we
take from the mindfulness,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.360
or the term we
use is presencing.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.890
And we mean by
presencing the capacity

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.890
of sensing an actualizing
emerging future possibilities.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.660
So what's the
perspective we take?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.120
The perspective we
take is that each

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.440
of us in each human system
and social system today

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.040
is not only sitting on this
side, the current reality

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.910
side of disruption, but
one part of ourselves

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.060
is also located here
on the other side,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.710
in other words, which is kind
of representing the emerging

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.300
future.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.440
In other words, we
operate on the assumption

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.170
that the future
is already there.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.810
We just need to learn how to
notice it and pay attention

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.310
to it.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.750
Because it's usually
not inside our bubble.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.560
It's not in our main focus.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.340
But it may be a
little left and right.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.840
And that's a little bit
the topic I want to follow.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.730
So the two ideas,
the two guiding ideas

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.090
we use, the first one, I'm
sure you have seen many times.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.959
It's the iceberg model,
systems thinking.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.260
10% is visible.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.540
The other 90% also matters.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.650
And so it's like on the
surface, we have symptoms.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.950
Then there is structures
and systems underneath.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.850
So for example, if we look
at the current situation

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.320
in Europe, you could
say symptoms is Brexit,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.330
a lot of people disenchanted
with the European project you

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.020
could say.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.370
Underneath, structures
and systems, a lot

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.560
of systemic disconnects, right?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.990
If you look at the map,
the vote-- when was it?

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.810
Last week?

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.480
One way of interpreting
that is basically

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.470
representing inequity
in commitment

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.900
to do something about it, right?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.770
So it's kind of the long
term results of the Thatcher

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.380
revolution that are
visible also in the votes.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.240
So many people having the
feeling that the systems--

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.010
the bigger the system, the more
the mistrust and disappointment

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.930
because it's accumulated
in your life experience.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.590
And we see similar patterns
in the rise of the Trump

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.300
phenomenon and the
rise of the right here

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.540
across all countries in
Europe, and similar phenomena

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.230
also in Asia.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.630
But then, what's underneath?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.410
What's driving?

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.940
So there's a number of
systemic disconnects

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.200
that I could-- the disconnect
between, for example,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.160
finite resources and the
infinite growth paradigm.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.140
So that's an obvious
one kind of related

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.950
to the ecological crisis.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.880
But it's also a disconnect
between the real economy

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.430
and the financial economy when
there is something getting out

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.370
of sync.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.920
And there is a disconnect,
also well-known,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.200
between GDP and well-being.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.250
For all developed
countries, more GDP

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.010
does not translate
into more well-being.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.250
So it's no longer a good
measure for economic progress.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.410
If it's not GDP, then what is
it, these kinds of questions.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.570
But if you go a little
deeper underneath,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.970
the next deeper level of
root causes, I believe,

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.260
has to do particular
with root causes that

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.420
originate between our
ears, that originate

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.060
in our qualities of
thought, particularly

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.410
the outdated paradigms
of economic thought

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.470
that we still use and
teach at business schools

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.460
and use to design economic
institutions based

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.890
on which way we operate.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.950
So you can say thinking
creates the world in many ways.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.160
And what we see today, the
enacted economic reality,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.650
is really an embodiment
of yesterday's paradigm

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.380
of economic thought.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.100
So when you look
at the evolution

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.900
of the economic thought and
the evolution of the economy,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.010
you can see a movement
from centralized to free

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.720
market-- laissez-faire
capitalism-- to a more

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.440
social market economy like
20th century OECD countries.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.540
And today, at the beginning
of the 21st century,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.440
we move from this 3.0 economy.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.650
We believe there's a possibility
of the current crisis

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.250
to progress to a 4.0 economy
in which the three sectors--

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.820
business, governments,
and society-- no longer

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.240
or just work against
each other, but begin

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.010
to work with each other
in order to innovate

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.850
at the scale of
the whole system,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.070
addressing some of these
bigger issues like inequity

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.370
or connected to the
ecological crisis.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.480
So that's, you
could say, the basic

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.310
view that we have been taking.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:25.430
In other words, we see the
evolution of the modern economy

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.810
based on distribution of labor
and the evolution of economic

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.570
thought as an embodiment of
human consciousness that moves

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.500
from traditional
awareness-- like loyalty,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.700
fitting in-- to
ego-system awareness,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.100
which is what we still teach
at business schools today,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.870
homo economicus, to
stakeholder awareness,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.120
which is what we use in all
real companies or governmental

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:56.690
institutions today, to what we
believe will be foundation this

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.630
century, which is
ecosystem awareness,

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.910
by which we mean an awareness
that's not only focusing

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.440
on my well-being--
ego-system awareness--

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.950
or the well-being of the
few key stakeholders--

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.490
stakeholder awareness--

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.370
but that's focusing on the
well-being of all partners

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.420
in an ecosystem,
particularly those

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:26.000
that are least connected
and most disadvantaged.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.310
The past 15 years,
I've done many projects

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.870
in sustainability,
education, health, business.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.090
And basically, in
all these situations,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.510
you face the same basic
issue that to make progress,

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:50.570
or the big challenges today,
no one can do it alone, right?

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:55.060
You need to bring together a
diverse group of stakeholders

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.960
that need each other
to make progress.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.220
And then, once you
get that, you need

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.100
to help them to move from
a silo type of viewpoint

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.930
and interaction, or
ego-system awareness,

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.060
to ecosystem awareness, which
is a view that is more embedded

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.440
in the whole system view.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.880
And that's basically
our bread and butter.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.550
I mean, that's what
we have been doing.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:26.660
And so let me quickly--
we developed basically

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:34.390
a method that is taking people
who want to engage on this ego

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.620
to ecosystem process, on a
journey that moves through

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.240
observe, observe, seeing
the system from the edges,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.170
deep reflexion, rapid cycle
prototyping, like design

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:51.970
thinking, but that also
invites people to basically do

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.310
some inner leadership
work, which is basically

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.980
quality of listening.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:01.840
So seeing your system
from different angles

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.700
doesn't help if
you still project

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.750
your old habits of judgment.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.760
So the inner
leadership work that we

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.940
believe is necessary
today is basically

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.530
the development of
three inner instruments

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.280
of knowing that we call open
mind, open heart, open will.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.530
And open mind
really means suspend

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.110
your old habits of thought.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.220
Look with fresh eyes
into a situation.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.650
Open heart really
means look at it.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.870
So develop the capacity
to look at a problem

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.930
not from your angle, but from
the angle of your stakeholders,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.250
from the partners
you're working with.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.970
In all network
leadership challenges,

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.880
that's the number
one capacity that you

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.780
need to be effective in
situations like that.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.700
And the third one, open will,
is basically the capacity

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.300
to let go and let come.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.480
That's the reason why usually
mergers don't work, right?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.420
It's because we hold on to
the old definition of us

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:13.470
versus them, and thereby
block an evolution to a new

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:19.570
we or a new kind of evolution
to connect to the deeper

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.600
sources of knowing.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.660
So that's basically
what we have been doing.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.280
There is a-- but I'm
not going into that

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.760
because as you can
see the pictures,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.190
we have been using that
in a number of projects

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.640
in public sector,
private sector.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.540
The bottom line
is you can do it.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.480
It does work.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.790
It takes a lot of effort.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:59.970
But what are some
of the deeper shifts

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.010
that you can observe there?

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.490
And I think this
is a visible one.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.950
So there's a little
summary slide here.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:12.910
What we notice, if
you take systems

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.390
through a journey-- kind
of where you move basically

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:21.790
from the me to we shift--
where people begin across

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:28.040
organization and sector
boundaries to communicate

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.020
in a more fluid, in
a more direct way,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.230
and therefore kind of develop
a more distributed intelligence

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.840
that allows people to
co-sense kind of what

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.130
the current situation is
like and develop ideas

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.640
and explore them quickly
with experimentation.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.080
The main shift that happens
is not only outcomes

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.895
that you create, for
example, reducing

00:13:52.895 --> 00:13:55.510
mortality and so forth.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.710
But it's a mindset shift
that can be summarized

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.800
with this picture here.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.000
It's a mindset
shift from this way

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.040
of seeing the
system as something

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.280
out there to seeing
the system that way,

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:16.120
which is a way that includes
myself as part of the picture.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.180
So that's really at
the end of the day,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.740
if you have a successful
process, that's

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.520
kind of the fundamental mindset
shift that, if in place,

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.450
allows you to be much
more effective in dealing

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.570
with issues.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.950
And when you have a conflict
situation, a real conflict

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.500
situation, different
interest clashing,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.480
to come up with productive
ways of dealing with that.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.860
And when you move from
this mindset, the realities

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:54.412
out there, to this mindset
as an individual, what

00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:55.120
do you call that?

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.480
What's the word for that?

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.930
What's the English word
that we use for that shift?

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.136
What do we call-- how do
we label the second state?

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:06.035
SPEAKER 1: It's
a transformation.

00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:07.160
OTTO SCHARMER: What's that?

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.230
SPEAKER 1: It's
a transformation.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.396
OTTO SCHARMER: Transformation,
yeah, transformation.

00:15:10.396 --> 00:15:11.650
What other words for that?

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.400
AUDIENCE: Empathy.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.570
OTTO SCHARMER:
Yeah, well, in a way

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.780
you could say it's like seeing
yourself as part of the system.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.550
Often like there is empathy
with others, empathy with self.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.690
Yeah, that's connected to that.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:34.290
I think a lot has to do
with the term mindfulness.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:40.050
And if you look at the field of
leadership, which is my field,

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.520
and you know like
I know everything

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.430
has been said too often by
too many people already.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.820
So what is really new?

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.810
Very little things when you
look at the whole field.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:56.520
But one of the things I
think that truly is new,

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:03.510
let's say the past 10, 15 years,
is the rise of mindfulness

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.240
from being a very marginal
term 10, 15 years ago

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.070
to being very central,
almost mainstream,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.340
in four different areas.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:18.380
It's in our cognition science,
health and well-being,

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.360
education, the whole movement
around social-emotional

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.830
learning, and now
the fourth one,

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:28.680
as you can see in [? Davos ?]
and other places-- leadership.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.630
And why is it more than
maybe a personal interest?

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:39.360
Because this kind of capacity
to seeing reality out

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.100
there toward seeing myself as
part of the problem, of course,

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.820
is a key capacity that in
any kind of change process

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.120
you want to foster.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.400
You want to develop.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.234
So if that happens to a group
moving from here, this mindset,

00:16:55.234 --> 00:16:57.650
which is like a [? deep aid ?]
when you have communication

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.080
in that mindset, and you move
to that style of talking,

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.400
that's dialogue.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.290
Dialogue is not people
talking with each other.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.630
Dialogue is the
capacity of a system

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:15.180
to see itself, to reflect
on your own assumption.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.747
And yay.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:20.740
You did it.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.030
OK, wonderful.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:26.250
So it's not quite synchronized
with what I show here.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.720
But you know, it's
moving in that direction.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:37.760
So making a system see itself
is not only, you could say,

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.090
a key feature of dialogue.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.710
It's also 50% of all
change management

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:49.170
because if I see the system
out there, the problems we face

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.420
is because of all
these idiots around me,

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.500
all the other
departments, and so on.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.370
And it's only if we
shift the way we talk

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.420
and the mindset that's
underneath to a way

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.910
where I am part of
the problem, where

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:08.880
I see how I in my way of framing
as contributing to the problem,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.200
only then when you deal
with multiple stakeholders,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.442
you start to having
useful conversation.

00:18:15.442 --> 00:18:22.390
So in that regard, this
shift, this ego to eco shift,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.990
really has to do a
lot with this capacity

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:33.000
to bend the beam of observation
back on to the observing self,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.960
back on to making a
group not only sense,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.840
but also see itself as
really the essence you could

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.390
say of systems
thinking and systems

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.750
thinking-based change processes.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.650
So when we abstract
now from that and say,

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.180
OK, so that's kind
of where you could

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.775
say a shift in
consciousness is happening--

00:18:57.775 --> 00:18:59.900
so if you don't like
consciousness, take awareness.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.660
If you don't like awareness,
take mindset, or take the way

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.510
we pay attention.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.470
Paying attention is
essential for all leadership

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.450
because energy
follows attention.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.610
So wherever you
pay attention to,

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.130
that's where the
energy-- your own,

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.400
but also the energy of the
people around you-- is moving.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.320
So we know that.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.240
And what is
essentially meditation?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.140
It's about paying attention,
about deepening and honing

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.300
our capacity to focus,
to pay attention

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:45.230
in a way that is not
diluted by distraction

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:51.690
by attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.510
kind of symptoms.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.500
So what does that look like?

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:03.904
So if we look at-- we
still cannot see it, right?

00:20:03.904 --> 00:20:04.820
SPEAKER 1: Yes we can.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.903
OTTO SCHARMER: Oh, we can.

00:20:05.903 --> 00:20:07.890
OK.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:14.290
So basically, we develop
social technologies

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.680
that is accelerating that
shift because usually, if you

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:25.130
go through processes, and making
a complex system sense and see

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:32.160
itself, and thereby
shifting the mindset

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.950
but also the communication
and collaboration in shifting,

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.180
that's a big thing to do.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.400
It usually takes
a lot of effort.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.160
So we developed
social technologies.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.290
And I'll just show
you a few pictures.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.670
This is a multi-stakeholder
group in Indonesia.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:53.450
It's focusing on
one of the biggest

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.160
multi-stakeholder projects
currently existing.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.150
It's Coral Triangle
Initiative, which

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.540
is the second most important
ecosystem after the Amazon

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.220
region on the planet.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.510
And they map all the
different systems.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.790
Now in our case, because we work
with a framework that we say,

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.560
OK, current crisis is ecological
divide, social divide, and also

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.890
a spiritual divide that has to
do with not really connecting

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:28.410
with our own deeper sources
of well-being and creativity.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:32.020
So this guy in his real
life, he is a banker.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.820
But the role he plays
here is Mother Earth.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.040
So we bring the voice of
Mother Earth into this system.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.350
That's the ecological divide.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.490
We bring the voice of
the underprivileged.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:48.090
Those are like the
fishermen, the farmer.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.540
So bring also in.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.630
And we bring the
voice of the emerging

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.490
future with the children.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.430
So usually, you want
to map the system

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.730
in a way that's a little
more comprehensive than just

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.880
the existing stakeholders.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.890
And that brings other voices in.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.580
So mapping means
first comes reality,

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.070
and then morphing into
an emerging future.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.860
So if we can switch one more.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:20.010
So that's using the
same thing, but around

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.810
a different topic--
reinventing ICBC,

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.000
kind of the biggest state-owned
enterprise in China,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.730
around big data.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.400
So what it means for how
they relate to the customers,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.450
to the other
communities, and so on.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:38.360
So you can apply it to any
kind of problem of course.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:43.072
But then, you try to take
a little more extended

00:22:43.072 --> 00:22:43.780
stakeholder view.

00:22:46.325 --> 00:22:47.755
Can I just do it?

00:22:47.755 --> 00:22:48.870
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, you can.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.090
OTTO SCHARMER: All right.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:59.720
So a different technique, which
is 3D modeling, which is you

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.640
model the system with objects.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.209
And then you go around, and you
model first current reality,

00:23:08.209 --> 00:23:09.250
then the emerging future.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:14.950
In this case, it's all the
leaders of the various business

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.710
units with Alibaba
in order to use

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:23.410
it to map the interdependency
in their ecosystem.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.750
So they do that.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.110
And you know, it's 50 people.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.910
It's maybe eight to
nine different tables.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:35.610
And then, they look at the
patterns that emerge from that.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.200
Here, the same technique,
but with 150 people.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.990
So you can easily scale it.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.350
And it just means that you
stay the same group size,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.720
but then you make people
look at each other's results.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.250
So you quickly, even
in a bigger group,

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.910
identify the key themes,
the deeper topics

00:23:55.910 --> 00:24:01.000
that need to be addressed in
the second half of that bigger

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.290
workshop day.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.990
So the last thing, the
main thing actually,

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.930
I want to share
with you is related

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.760
to the question of
technology and how

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.530
to bring these kinds
of processes to scale.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:21.120
So we have developed these
other social technologies

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.710
that allow complex stakeholder
groups to go through this ego

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.760
to eco mindset shift.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.930
We have done it many times.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.013
Other people have done it.

00:24:31.013 --> 00:24:33.850
So we all know it's possible.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.200
But it takes a lot
of effort, right?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.490
So the big question
on the table really

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.610
is how can you
bring that to scale?

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.590
And that's where, of course,
the question of technology

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.120
comes in.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.960
And last year, we
launched an experiment

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.860
where I believe
for the first time

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.270
we're trying to link to things.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:25:00.810
One is MOOCs, so the idea
of massive democratization

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:04.730
in the access to knowledge,
learning, and technology.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.880
On the one hand,
now we know it has

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.821
been a success like
the last five year,

00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:11.070
very interesting developments.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:15.010
But learning stayed flat.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.330
So learning and education
was in bad shape before.

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.590
Now it's worse because everyone
is just looking at the screen.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.560
And how's transformation
supposed to happen that way?

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.540
So in other words,
it's working well.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.552
MOOCs are working
well for the transfer

00:25:30.552 --> 00:25:31.510
of technical knowledge.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.620
It's not working at
all for developing

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.870
these deeper capacities
of innovation leadership.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.940
So our question was can you
link these two things-- the MOOC

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.060
and democratization
on the one hand,

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:51.620
and the activation of the
deep learning innovation cycle

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.360
that I indicated before--
opening the mind, the heart,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.890
the will-- on the other hand?

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:57.935
That was the experiment.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.280
So we started that
early last year.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.070
And I wanted to begin
with a little video clip

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:15.830
that we created for inviting
people into this space

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.530
because we knew the only
way of doing it successfully

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:24.660
is to radically decentralize
the space of learning.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.340
So to move from one place that
you basically set up for others

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.139
to a radical decentralization
where people self organize

00:26:34.139 --> 00:26:35.180
in their own communities.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:35.679
All right.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:45.820
I'm also showing the clip
because it takes into a tour

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.480
into MIT, into the
MIT architecture which

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.130
is a perfect embodiment of the
whole mindset based on which

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.570
not only education
today is organized,

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:02.720
but also all organizations
really, a tent to operate,

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.270
which is a distinction between
abstract knowledge at the top

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.410
and applied knowledge
at the bottom.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.480
So that's kind of
the old paradigm.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.670
And throughout that clip,
we'll share with you

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.070
that the big
disruption that's going

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.770
on in the space of learning
that really kind of

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.970
turns that whole
paradigm upside down.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:30.900
So what this first
clip really did

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.250
is tell the story of
disruption that I believe

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.830
is currently going
on in the field

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.480
of learning and leadership,
which is two transformations.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.530
The first transformation
is shifting the outer place

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:50.600
off learning from the
classroom, listening to folks,

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.790
to the real world,
learning by doing.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.270
And the second
transformation concerns

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.480
shifting the inner
place of learning

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:05.400
from the head to the heart,
and from the heart to the head.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.000
So a more, you
could say, holistic

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.610
that's not only
limited here, but that

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.870
includes the emotional
intelligence,

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.700
the relational capacities
on the one hand,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.440
but also the learning by
doing on the other hand.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.470
And what it really
is organizationally

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.920
is bursting up.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.280
It's opening the old dome.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.360
So the old model of
learning, everyone

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.760
is sitting inside that dome,
not a single window outside,

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.310
and you're captured inside
in these classrooms,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.810
to a more open structure
where people can freely

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.340
move in and out.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.870
And that's kind of what
the second clip is about,

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.610
which is inquiring more
into what really then

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.170
is the new architecture.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:59.280
And so I want to briefly show
that one and then share kind

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.810
of the three main
learnings that we had

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.150
from running this
experiment last year.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:12.510
This clip basically shows a
little bit the deeper evolution

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.630
of learning and action science
space that actually goes back

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:20.740
to the 1940s and Kurt
Lewin, who actually left

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.550
in the '30s Berlin when
the Nazis took power,

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:29.210
went to the east coast, and was
the main source of inspiration

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.510
of founding what today
is called action science,

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:37.230
which is the reason why I left
Germany 20 years ago going

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.570
to the east coast because
I wanted to learn that

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:44.120
methodology which starts with
the sentence that you cannot

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.090
understand a system
unless you change it.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.780
In other words, as
a social scientist,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.150
you have to engage with.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.660
You have to participate
in the change processes.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.690
Otherwise, you're just getting
stuck at the surface data.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:01.050
You want to understand the
deep data that's underneath.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:07.190
And that lineage, that
also includes the limits

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:11.010
to growth study
that in the 1970s

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:14.100
sparked the global
environmental movement.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.040
And that brings us
now all the way here.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.870
And I think the interesting
thing at the end

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.760
is what we see today
is that we see a deeper

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.510
personalization, the deeper
questions of awareness,

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:35.510
of mindfulness, we see as
very present in society today.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.390
So here are the three
things that we learned.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.820
So that was basically
these two clips we put out.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.660
And we said, OK, if you are
interested in self-organizing

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.950
and activating such a deep
learning process for yourself,

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.710
join this experiment.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.240
Create your own hub.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.990
Here are the three
things that we learned.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:01.270
The first one is that we had
quite a significant resonance.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:05.380
So in the first
year, last year, it

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:11.320
was a total of 75,000
registered participants.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.144
It doesn't mean that really
everyone participated

00:31:14.144 --> 00:31:14.810
the whole thing.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:18.550
So the hardcore, of course,
who did the whole seven-week

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.530
and then the seven-week
prototyping after that,

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:22.550
it's a smaller group.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.670
But it is yet, even for
conventional measures,

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:31.590
a very significant group that
engaged in this process which

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.150
took many, many hours in
all these different places

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.610
to self-organize, to
form place-based hubs.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.850
We were inspired by the Obama
campaign actually originally,

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:46.140
which is link technology with
local grassroots mobilization.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.460
We wanted to do the same thing.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.510
Create your own hub in
your own living room.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.160
Invite your friends.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.210
And form a group in your
company or in your living room

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.250
or your community
space that allows

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:02.650
you to go on that journey
together, not just alone.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.650
And so here are a few pictures.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:15.940
China, Chengdu, Mumbai, India,
Sao Paolo, and then Oakland,

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.500
Bay Area.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.010
So it's a lot.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:21.950
Not all of these
groups-- so these

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.520
were some of the larger groups.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.790
But most of them were actually
much smaller, so five,

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:34.030
10, 15, 20, 30 small
groups that came together.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.740
The second thing
that we learned is

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.620
that institutions--
so that's kind

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.360
of the bottom up grassroots.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.980
But what was interesting is
that even in the first year,

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.480
we saw several
institutions using

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.140
U.Lab as a mobilization tool.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:53.630
So in this case, Alibaba used
it for their own capacity

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.090
building, leadership
development.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:04.180
Then Scotland used it-- the
Scottish government used it

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.350
as a way to reinvent
government from the old model

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.880
that we all know, which
is we create resources

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.440
that we give to our agencies
who deliver services

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.390
to beneficiaries.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.220
The beneficiaries
are frustrated.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.100
The front line people
who deliver the services

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.890
suffer burnout.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.870
Now, that's the old model.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.030
What they now try is
a different model,

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.900
what's called
asset-based, which is

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.030
you use the
resources to activate

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:40.780
the community themselves to
identify what they will like

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.950
to do, where the real needs
are, and then to co-generate,

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.330
to co-produce these services.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:52.850
And they use U.Lab, the
seven-week self-organize

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.210
capacity building around
change initiatives

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.560
that they define as a
mechanism to mobilize.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:05.690
So it involved more than
1,000 people last fall.

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:08.980
And this it is an NGO in China.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.130
It's the number
one on reinventing

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.429
education in China
that partnered up

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:15.889
with us a few weeks ago.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:19.670
We had a large meeting to
use that U.Lab approach

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:25.270
to massively bring innovation,
creativity into the education

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.150
system in China by bringing all
the communities, the innovators

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.989
of the education
system, together

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:35.920
and use the MOOC structure
to scale and accelerate

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.350
the replication
of what's working.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.139
Now, the last
thing we learned is

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:52.940
that you could-- which is
maybe the most interesting--

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:58.060
that we could engage the global
community of tens of thousands

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.540
of change makers as a whole.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.800
You see an example here.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.900
So in each, we had
four live sessions.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.540
In each of them, we use
global moments of stillness,

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:14.900
mindfulness practices, in which
the awareness was not only

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:21.420
focusing on your own body,
the field around you,

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.770
the local group you're
connected with, but also

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:30.420
the collective body of change
makers around the world,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.520
across all these hubs that
came together in that moment

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.020
and started to interact
with each other, which

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.520
was a moment of
transformation and inspiration

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.420
for many as we
learned afterwards.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:47.420
So we also engaged
the entire group

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.270
in knowledge creation processes.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.940
So I'm not going
into details here,

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.080
but it's a one-page summary
of what the U process is,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.440
which is the four
levels of systems

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.340
change-- micro, individual,
groups, organization system.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:10.790
And on this axis, we have
four levels of consciousness

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:15.760
moving from downloading old
models to deep listening

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.520
and transforming
organization, transforming

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.830
the way we organize,
transforming

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.500
the way we coordinate,
basically from old style

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:32.260
to our emerging new, and kind
of more horizontal and more

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:36.780
co-creative in how our
coordination, collaboration

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.080
works.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.540
Now, we asked people,
OK, that's the map.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.110
Where are you operating today?

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.380
And this is what they set.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.720
We basically operate on
the first three levels.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.470
And then we asked,
given the challenges

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.000
that you face on all
these different levels,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.100
where do you need to
operate from in order

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:58.630
to respond to these
challenges appropriately?

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.810
And this is what they said--
it's kind of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.710
When we saw that, we
asked them, wait a minute,

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.760
you just said this is
what you need to do,

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.270
this is what you really do.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.070
Why?

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.520
What's holding you back
today on all these levels

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.930
to actually operate from
this more co-creative space

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.600
of connecting with others and
collaborating with others?

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.100
And here is what they said.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:28.660
So we said give us your
response in three words.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.240
And the word cloud that
resulted from that, it basically

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:38.780
can be summed up with greed,
fear, and ignorance, which

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:45.399
also in Buddhism is known are
known as the three poisons.

00:37:45.399 --> 00:37:47.690
So that was at the beginning
of the seven-week journey.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.630
At the end of the
seven-week journey,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.800
we asked them, OK, now
that we have better

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.620
connected with what
you really want

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:58.320
to try to do, with your
life and your work,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.010
what would it take for
you to actually bring that

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.340
into reality?

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.680
And this is kind
of what they said.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.820
What I would take is courage.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:17.370
And then we asked, OK, and
if you're really committed

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.890
to do that, if you
could mobilize that,

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.880
tap into that courage,
what is the help

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.820
you need from others to succeed?

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:31.520
And this is what people said--
love, listening, and trust.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.930
So if you step back
and say, OK, what

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.720
is it that we learned from
our global community of change

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.120
makers is what
they really taught

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:43.680
is this-- that transformation
today happens around--

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.160
or leadership happens around
three transformations, which

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:52.320
is transforming ignorance
to listening and curiosity,

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:59.890
transforming greed to love
our empathy or compassion,

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:04.140
and transforming
fear to courage.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.430
So it's these three
transformations

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.820
that we believe-- or that
little community of change

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.250
mirrored back to
us is really what's

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:17.400
at the heart of the current
leadership challenge

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.070
that we face not only
in small pockets,

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.910
but that we face if we start
to address the bigger system

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.320
issues.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.010
In the exit survey,
we learned that those

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:39.440
that responded, a third of
them said life-changing.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:44.130
So how could that
possibly be true?

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.640
Well, certainly not
by watching videos.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.390
You don't have a
life-changing experience.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:51.390
I mean, you're attached.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.410
But it's not a
life-changing experience.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:57.090
The only way-- I mean,
this is self-reported,

00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:00.040
of course-- but the only
way that makes sense

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.220
is that the main experience
of learning that people had

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.845
was really facilitated at all
the self-organized groups.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.880
And all the
self-organized groups

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.240
that met either in
person-- the coaching

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.440
circles, the place-based
groups that even met in person,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:29.230
or using Google Hangout or other
technologies that made them

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:33.900
connect virtually which we
enabled through a platform.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.470
So I started with
the question-- what

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:43.330
does it take to address
some of these processes

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.680
and challenges of disruption?

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.450
And what I basically said is
what it takes us two things.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:41:00.470
One is a process, which
is-- OK, interesting.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:05.070
So it's a process that
moves through these stages

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.240
of observing, of
connecting to sources

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.150
of knowing, and
prototyping, learning

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:14.200
by doing on the one hand.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.780
And then the other to
make this process work

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.850
is engaged in this
inner leadership

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:24.725
work which has to do with
curiosity, compassion,

00:41:24.725 --> 00:41:28.400
and courage, or open mind,
open heart, open will.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.310
That's basically the
story that I told.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:36.180
And I think that what we,
of course, also all see

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:44.270
is that in reality, often
the opposite is happening.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.629
So this actually, when
you play it on the Mac,

00:41:46.629 --> 00:41:48.420
it's actually looking
the other way around.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.390
But never mind.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:59.800
So it's the cycle of absencing
that I try to communicate here,

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.410
which is not this
process of opening

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:05.850
the mind, the heart, the will.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:09.650
But it's the opposite,
which is what we see today

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:13.270
in larger scale
playing out around us

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.370
in corporate politics,
in larger systems.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.910
In most systems
today, we collectively

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:21.330
create results
that no one wants.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:27.940
And so that has to do with
ignorance, greed, and fear, as

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.560
shared before,
which means that we

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.740
are moving through a cycle
of denial, de-sensing,

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.250
absencing, disconnecting
with our true purpose,

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:41.430
and then kind of into a
process of destruction

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:45.010
as opposed to a
process of co-creation.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:53.400
So that's basically, I believe,
the world we are living in

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:58.140
and that we see on the one
hand all of these processes

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.790
and networks of innovation.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:06.590
On the other hand, we
also see lots of evidence.

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.360
We don't only have to
look to Donald Trump

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.370
to see the evidence.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:17.150
The industry of fear, of
anger, and blaming others,

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:21.070
and of ignorance really
that is giving rise

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:26.900
to a lot of phenomena
that suggests

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.510
that in the current
evolutionary threshold

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.590
we're standing collectively,
we could move backwards very

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.490
easily.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.280
I think that the interesting
moment we all live in

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.040
is that we actually participate,
or we have the possibility

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.910
to participate, in
that process where

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:54.180
the mainstream of our
evolution will either

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:58.350
tap more deeply into
this co-creative space,

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:02.360
or whether we kind of on a
collective level more and more

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.230
are sucked into this other
space which is really

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:12.930
fueled by the economies and
the industry of ignorance,

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:16.590
blaming others, and
anger, and fear.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:21.480
So that's, I believe,
why the use, the heart

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.300
of this challenge has to
do with using technology

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.860
in a new way that is not just
amplifying this stuff here,

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.610
which we see in many all-star
networks going on today,

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:39.710
but that allows us to bring
these types of processes

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:43.120
here that we all know are
possible, and each of us

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.010
has already participated
in on a smaller scale,

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:49.400
to bring them to the
level of scale that's

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.990
really necessary today.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:57.670
That's what we are passionate--
we'll love to partner deeper

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:00.890
with what you guys are
doing here in Berlin,

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:07.560
but also Google in general
in other locations.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.257
And we think that--
my experience

00:45:10.257 --> 00:45:14.420
is-- I mean, my first
Google visit, I remember

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.945
don't do evil or something.

00:45:16.945 --> 00:45:18.320
I don't know
whether that's still

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.670
part of corporate culture.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:23.260
But I think that there's
always at the heart

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.320
of the new technology
companies, there

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.820
is the aspiration making
the world a better place.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.250
Yet, that's not
always what happens.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.970
There's technologies also
used for this stuff here.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:40.490
So what I would love
to learn from you

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.620
is kind of where
you see yourself

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:47.230
and how we can partner
more deeply to really bring

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.260
these types of new
environments to scale.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:55.390
Because what we learn is the
openness of people, 75,000

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:58.260
people, joining up for
the prototype year,

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:03.720
that's a massive
amount of willingness,

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.430
but also our capacity
to self-organize

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:11.140
in completely new ways
and use technology

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:16.790
with more intention to form more
deeper and more dialogue-based

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:17.500
processes.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.530
Anyhow, that's what we
are passionate because we

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:25.820
feel that the
technology-enabling conditions

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.950
that we have formed so
far are very insufficient.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.830
Yet, they worked great.

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:33.240
But they are still
very insufficient.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:37.020
The social media we have
now are mostly downloading,

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.960
kind of broadcasting stuff.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.310
It's not activating these
deeper innovation processes.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:45.137
To do that, we need each other.

00:46:45.137 --> 00:46:46.220
And that's why we're here.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.320
Thank you.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.830
[APPLAUSE]
