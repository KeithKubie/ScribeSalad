we've just started introducing some
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.580
we've just started introducing some
basic game services stats into the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
basic game services stats into the

see an example here we're looking at a
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950
see an example here we're looking at a
couple of sample games that we have

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
couple of sample games that we have
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.410
couple of sample games that we have

players that's a little misleading this

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
players that's a little misleading this
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.050
players that's a little misleading this
isn't people who are playing your game

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
isn't people who are playing your game
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210
isn't people who are playing your game
but players who have signed into game

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
but players who have signed into game
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980
but players who have signed into game
services with your game the actual

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
services with your game the actual
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.330
services with your game the actual
number of people playing your game is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
number of people playing your game is
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.109
number of people playing your game is
probably going to be larger than this

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119
probably going to be larger than this
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.300
probably going to be larger than this
also if you go into your achievement

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
also if you go into your achievement
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.640
also if you go into your achievement
screen within game services you will now

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
screen within game services you will now
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.609
screen within game services you will now
see a percentage complete staff these

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
see a percentage complete staff these
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.410
see a percentage complete staff these
are the number of players who have

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
are the number of players who have
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210
are the number of players who have
signed in who have earned this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
signed in who have earned this
 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.249
signed in who have earned this
achievement so this is a really good way

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
achievement so this is a really good way
 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.390
achievement so this is a really good way
to look and see if there are any

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
to look and see if there are any
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.160
to look and see if there are any
achievements that are too difficult to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
achievements that are too difficult to
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.140
achievements that are too difficult to
get so we're looking at brunos sample

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
get so we're looking at brunos sample
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.410
get so we're looking at brunos sample
game here firewall defense and you can

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
game here firewall defense and you can
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.460
game here firewall defense and you can
see that there are a number of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
see that there are a number of
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380
see that there are a number of
achievements where the percent complete

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
achievements where the percent complete
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.020
achievements where the percent complete
is basically zero and so he's probably

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
is basically zero and so he's probably
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600
is basically zero and so he's probably
made those achievements too hard this is

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
made those achievements too hard this is
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.830
made those achievements too hard this is
a common trap for all your game

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
a common trap for all your game
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660
a common trap for all your game
developers you play your game for weeks

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
developers you play your game for weeks
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.130
developers you play your game for weeks
on end do you understand how it works

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
on end do you understand how it works
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.639
on end do you understand how it works
inside and out and you know achievements

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
inside and out and you know achievements
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.840
inside and out and you know achievements
that seemed really easy for you to get

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
that seemed really easy for you to get
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.190
that seemed really easy for you to get
her very difficult for your average

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
her very difficult for your average
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.830
her very difficult for your average
player so this is a good way to go back

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
player so this is a good way to go back
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840
player so this is a good way to go back
and just kind of sanity check your

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
and just kind of sanity check your
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.160
and just kind of sanity check your
assumptions and see if those

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
assumptions and see if those
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.410
assumptions and see if those
achievements really are as easier is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
achievements really are as easier is
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.999
achievements really are as easier is
this difficult as you thought they were

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
this difficult as you thought they were
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.479
this difficult as you thought they were
in addition you will now be able to see

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
in addition you will now be able to see
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160
in addition you will now be able to see
the number of unique players who have

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170
the number of unique players who have
 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.869
the number of unique players who have
submitted a score to each of your leader

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879
submitted a score to each of your leader
 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.730
submitted a score to each of your leader
boards and this is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
boards and this is
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.710
boards and this is
useful if say you have different

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
useful if say you have different
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.510
useful if say you have different
leaderboards for different levels you

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
leaderboards for different levels you
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.340
leaderboards for different levels you
suddenly have an idea of how many people

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350
suddenly have an idea of how many people
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.690
suddenly have an idea of how many people
have completed each one of your

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700
have completed each one of your
 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.550
have completed each one of your
different levels because obviously you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
different levels because obviously you
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.710
different levels because obviously you
can see the number of score completions

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
can see the number of score completions
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680
can see the number of score completions
for each one of those so I know that by

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
for each one of those so I know that by
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.020
for each one of those so I know that by
the by themselves these stats are you

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
the by themselves these stats are you
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.340
the by themselves these stats are you
know they're interesting but they might

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
know they're interesting but they might
 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.110
know they're interesting but they might
be data that you already have if you're

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
be data that you already have if you're
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.390
be data that you already have if you're
using any kind of third-party analytics

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
using any kind of third-party analytics
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.750
using any kind of third-party analytics
tool already but you know it's I think

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760
tool already but you know it's I think
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.430
tool already but you know it's I think
maybe the interesting point here is that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
maybe the interesting point here is that
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.340
maybe the interesting point here is that
we have all the plumbing now attached so

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350
we have all the plumbing now attached so
 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.650
we have all the plumbing now attached so
that we can get data from the Play game

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
that we can get data from the Play game
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.560
that we can get data from the Play game
services down to the developer console

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570
services down to the developer console
 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.590
services down to the developer console
and up to you the game developer so what

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600
and up to you the game developer so what
 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.570
and up to you the game developer so what
we have here is a pretty nice start and

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580
we have here is a pretty nice start and
 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.860

more importantly we have a nice
foundation for us to start showing you a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700
foundation for us to start showing you a
 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520
foundation for us to start showing you a
lot more interesting statistics

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
lot more interesting statistics
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.880
lot more interesting statistics
regarding game services so you know now

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890
regarding game services so you know now
 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.110
regarding game services so you know now
that now we've got kind of all the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
that now we've got kind of all the
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.640
that now we've got kind of all the
plumbing hooked up we've got a few basic

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650
plumbing hooked up we've got a few basic
 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.230
plumbing hooked up we've got a few basic
things in there expect to see some more

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240
things in there expect to see some more
 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.590
things in there expect to see some more
stats from us in the future and so I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600
stats from us in the future and so I
 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.150
stats from us in the future and so I
don't know I think this is kind of cool

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
don't know I think this is kind of cool
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.150
don't know I think this is kind of cool

just launched game insights on the
 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.050
just launched game insights on the
developer console we call it game

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060
