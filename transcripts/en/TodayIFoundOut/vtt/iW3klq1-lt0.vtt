00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.910
The Strangest Thing Ever Found On the Set
of a TV Show

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.960
In 1977, The Six Million Dollar Man was a
hit TV series starring Lee Majors.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.320
That year, the show was filming an episode,
Carnival of Spies, at Nu-Pike, a museum-park

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.080
in Long Beach, California.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.110
During filming, one of the crew was instructed
to move a mannequin.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.070
The mannequin was painted fluorescent orange;
it was dressed in a cowboy outfit and was

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.449
hanging from a rope.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.160
When the crew member tried to lift it, one
of the mannequin’s arms broke off.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.090
Horrified, the cast and crew soon discovered
that this “mannequin” was actually a human

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.090
body!

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.659
The cowboy dummy was later discovered to be
a man named Elmer McCurdy who lived from 1880-1911.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:44.190
Incredibly, the corpse’s identity was revealed
by two items found in McCurdy’s mouth: a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.460
1924 penny and a ticket to the Museum of Crime
in Los Angeles.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.850
From these two items, the story of the corpse
was reconstructed.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.709
Elmer McCurdy was a small-time criminal who
often bragged that his only arrest was for

00:00:56.709 --> 00:01:00.670
being drunk in Kansas, where he had killed
a man in a drunken brawl.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.619
After a variety of low-level crimes, McCurdy
turned to train robbery.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.219
In 1911, he ambushed a train in Oklahoma.

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.159
He believed the train contained thousands
of dollars, but it turned out to be a passenger

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.159
train…

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.610
McCurdy got away with $46 and two jugs of
whiskey, the latter of which would perhaps

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.229
play a small role in his decision making process
that led to his demise.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.539
As law men moved in on a somewhat drunk McCurdy,
who had taken refuge on a farm after the robbery,

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.450
he vowed that they would not take him alive,
boarding himself up in a hayshed.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.719
McCurdy was right and he was killed in the
subsequent shoot-out.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.119
His body was taken to a funeral parlor in
Oklahoma and no one came forward to claim

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.119
it.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.009
The funeral parlor’s undertaker came up
with an ingenious idea- he embalmed the body

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.159
and charged customers a nickel apiece to see
“the bandit who wouldn’t give up”.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.749
McCurdy’s body on display proved to be a
lucrative racket for the undertaker.

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:55.920
A while later, the undertaker was conned by
a traveling carnival owner, who claimed to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.380
be the brother of McCurdy and wanted the body
so he could give it a respectful burial.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.561
Reluctantly, the undertaker turned the body
over to the man, who immediately put it in

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.399
his traveling show.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.000
Over the years, the body was passed off from
business to business and eventually ended

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.440
up at the Nu-Pike Museum and Park, where it
was stored and forgotten until that fateful

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.250
day in 1977 on the set of The Six Million
Dollar Man.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.640
You might be wondering at this point why McCurdy
had a ticket and a penny in his mouth.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.180
Starting all the way back with McCurdy’s
time at the undertaker’s establishment,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.049
people would place coins in the mouth of McCurdy,
for who knows what reason.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.069
It’s been speculated that this was simply
how they made payment for seeing the body;

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.790
or perhaps people were doing it for similar
reasons as to why we throw coins into fountains;

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.910
or maybe this was a throwback to the Ancient
Greek and Roman practice of putting coins

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.450
in people’s mouths so they could bribe Charon,
or similar such mouth/dead person traditions

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.370
practiced by many other cultures throughout
history.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.959
Whatever the case, this practice appears to
have continued and at some point the last

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.739
to do this placed a penny in his mouth and
they or someone else also placed a ticket

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.599
stub to the museum where they were seeing
the body at the time, the Sonney Amusement’s

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.379
Museum of Crime in L.A.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.640
It was lucky they included the ticket stub,
as this provided the necessary clue needed

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.860
to track down who the man was.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.959
Once the mystery was unraveled, McCurdy’s
body was returned to Oklahoma and buried in

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:16.959
a cemetery.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.579
The state medical examiner ordered two cubic
yards of concrete be poured over Elmer McCurdy’s

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.790
coffin, so his remains would never be bothered
again.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.519
And so, after 66 years, the body of the luckless
man who made far more money dead than he ever

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.269
did alive, was finally put to rest.

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.319
Bonus Fact:
• After McCurdy fired on the officers and

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.700
they subsequently opened fire on the hayshed
McCurdy was in, he ceased to fire back.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.939
Rather than go in and investigate themselves,
and possibly get shot if McCurdy was still

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.560
alive, they initially sent a young boy in
to investigate…

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.099
One can imagine the conversation: “You go…

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.239
No, you go…

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:07.189
Hey, let’s just send in 
that kid.”
