we talked about the idea of slow cooking
 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.570
we talked about the idea of slow cooking
capturing that well-being because it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580
capturing that well-being because it

doesn't blow so much out of food when
you don't put fast heat to something

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050
you don't put fast heat to something

you don't put fast heat to something
just mechanically there's more there

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360
just mechanically there's more there
 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.300

when you're done cooking then if you try

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
when you're done cooking then if you try
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.130
when you're done cooking then if you try
to cook the same thing and five minutes

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140
to cook the same thing and five minutes
 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.500
to cook the same thing and five minutes
versus cooking it in an hour and there's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
versus cooking it in an hour and there's
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.510
versus cooking it in an hour and there's
a lifestyle that goes with that learning

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520
a lifestyle that goes with that learning
 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.330
a lifestyle that goes with that learning
to be conscious well not present that

to be conscious well not present that
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.690
to be conscious well not present that
goes with it and I think that that that

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700
goes with it and I think that that that
 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.170
goes with it and I think that that that
idea then would be it's highly feminine

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
idea then would be it's highly feminine
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.390
idea then would be it's highly feminine
because it's multi-layered and the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400
because it's multi-layered and the

multiphasic individuals on the planet
 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.320
multiphasic individuals on the planet
usually are women that comes to them

then that cooking can become something

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020
then that cooking can become something
 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.500
then that cooking can become something
you can do many many different things at

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510
you can do many many different things at
 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.320
you can do many many different things at
once without tending to any one thing at

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330
once without tending to any one thing at
 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.050
once without tending to any one thing at
any one time and I think that is

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060
any one time and I think that is
 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.060
any one time and I think that is
actually the draw I think people became

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070
actually the draw I think people became
 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.020
actually the draw I think people became
bored with the idea that they were

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
bored with the idea that they were
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.270
bored with the idea that they were
delivered everything and it became they

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
delivered everything and it became they
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.280
delivered everything and it became they
became just that that's the other thing

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290
became just that that's the other thing
 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.080
became just that that's the other thing
that gets me to death we're disconnected

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090
that gets me to death we're disconnected
 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.970
that gets me to death we're disconnected
from our foods well we were disconnected

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980
from our foods well we were disconnected
 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.780
from our foods well we were disconnected
from the process to that the chef's not

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790
from the process to that the chef's not
 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.180
from the process to that the chef's not
doing stock and all that that all came

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190
doing stock and all that that all came
 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.300
doing stock and all that that all came
about with the word instant and I think

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310
about with the word instant and I think
 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.080
about with the word instant and I think
that's pretty

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090
that's pretty
 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.820
that's pretty
pretty much the zeitgeist if it was

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
pretty much the zeitgeist if it was
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.340
pretty much the zeitgeist if it was
instant well you then you say what's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350
