00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:09.797
On January 1, 1863,

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:13.887
Abraham Lincoln legally changed the status
of over 3 million enslaved blacks

00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:17.287
across ten states from slave to free.

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:19.637
His Emancipation Proclamation 
wasn't a law,

00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:21.238
or a presidential decree.

00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:23.157
It was an executive order.

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:26.698
The framers of the American Constitution
made the power of executive order

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:29.028
available to the executive branch.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:31.068
But what exactly is this tool?

00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:32.157
How does it work?

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.008
And what is the extent of its power?

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:41.242
Well, an executive order isn't a law,
but it can carry the weight of one.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.655
Passing laws involves 
a fairly lengthy process.

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:48.529
First, a member of Congress proposes
a piece of legislation

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:50.404
in the form of a bill.

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:52.268
After many committees and revisions,

00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:55.409
if the bill is approved 
by a majority votes in Congress,

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.096
that is both the House and Senate,

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:01.578
the bill is then sent to 
the president for signature.

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:06.389
If the president signs the bill,
it then becomes a law.

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:08.610
An executive order, on the other hand,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.870
is something the president issues
without consultation

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.369
or permission from Congress.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.281
They are, however, enforced like laws,

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:20.437
and are subject to judicial review
by the court system

00:01:20.437 --> 00:01:24.581
to make sure they're within the limits
of the Constitution.

00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:29.430
That means the courts have the power
to invalidate any executive decisions

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.512
that they determine are an overreach of
the president in trying to assert power.

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:36.570
And once the president leaves office,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.542
if his or her successor wants to eliminate
the executive order,

00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:43.211
they can do so.

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:46.731
So when does a president 
use an executive order?

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:51.722
Sometimes a president feels the need to
exert power without working with Congress,

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:55.933
and in times of crisis, quick decisions
can be justified.

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:59.852
But most executive orders are not 
responses to emergencies.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:03.211
They're often directed towards
agencies in the federal government

00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:06.861
in order to expand 
or contract their power.

00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:10.983
Others determine the extent
to which legislation should be enforced.

00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:14.052
And sometimes, a president may use
an executive order

00:02:14.052 --> 00:02:19.902
to clarify and help implement a policy
that needs to be easily defined.

00:02:19.902 --> 00:02:21.863
Some of the most famous executive orders

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:24.713
have changed the course 
of American history.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:29.242
FDR issued an executive order to establish
the Works Progress Administration,

00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:32.889
which helped build thousands of roads,
bridges, and parks

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.942
throughout the country.

00:02:34.942 --> 00:02:37.543
The WPA also employed 
thousands of writers,

00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:38.723
painters,

00:02:38.723 --> 00:02:39.825
sculptors,

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:43.804
and artists to create works of art
in public spaces.

00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:46.833
Additionally, Harry Truman used
an executive order

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:50.884
to desegregate the armed forces in 1948.

00:02:50.884 --> 00:02:54.643
And in 1965, Lyndon Johnson signed
an executive order

00:02:54.643 --> 00:02:58.764
to establish requirements 
for nondiscriminatory practices

00:02:58.764 --> 00:03:01.545
in hiring and employment.

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:05.265
Executive orders have often been used
in positive and inclusive ways,

00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:08.945
but they've also been used 
to exclude and divide.

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:13.705
One of the most notable examples being
FDR's 1942 executive order.

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:17.786
He gave the military authority to target
predominantly Japanese-Americans,

00:03:17.786 --> 00:03:21.256
as well as German-Americans
and Italian-Americans,

00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:23.687
in certain regions across the country.

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:28.725
This executive order also removed any or
all of those people into military zones,

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:32.686
most commonly known as internment camps.

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:35.047
Beginning in the early 1960s,

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:38.868
each president has issued 
roughly 300 executive orders,

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:42.056
but FDR issued over 3,500.

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:43.775
At the other end of the spectrum,

00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:47.166
William Henry Harrison never issued
an executive order,

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:52.356
probably because his presidency only
lasted 31 days.

00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:57.446
The U.S. Constitution is somewhat ambiguous
on the extent of the president's power.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:04:01.536
That's resulted in executive orders
expanding over time.

00:04:01.536 --> 00:04:04.188
For instance, since Lyndon Johnson,

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:08.588
presidents have begun issuing orders
to create faith-based initiatives,

00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:10.537
establish federal agencies,

00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:15.178
and remove barriers 
for scientific research.

00:04:15.178 --> 00:04:18.288
There are checks and balances 
in the U.S. political system.

00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:22.408
Congress can pass laws to counteract
executive orders,

00:04:22.408 --> 00:04:26.021
and judges can halt them by deeming them
unconstitutional.

00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:28.567
But in the time it takes 
for those things to happen,

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.287
an executive order can go into effect

00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:35.689
and possibly change the course of history,
for better or for worse.
