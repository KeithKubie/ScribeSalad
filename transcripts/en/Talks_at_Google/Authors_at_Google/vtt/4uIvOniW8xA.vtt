[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.320
TIM KELLER: Hi, thanks
for having me here.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.320
It's always hard
to convey a book,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.080
especially one as dense
as this one, quickly.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.150
I'll try to think
about half the time

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.210
conveying the book, what the
book's about, and about half

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.360
the time questions and answers.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.170
So the book is about
how belief in God

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.570
or religious faith
or Christian faith

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.910
can make sense to
somebody today.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.220
It's about how it's possible
for that to make sense.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.400
Now, I would like to make
the case right now that

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.270
should be of some interest to
you, no matter who you are.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.360
Chapter one tries
to make that case

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.200
that no matter who you are, you
should at least care about how

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.060
people come to their
faith positions,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.840
how their beliefs come
to make sense to them.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.300
In chapter one, I make the
case that there's actually

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.860
two trends that are marked
in the world with regard

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.610
to religion.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.367
Here's the one.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:10.950
The one is-- and I
know what I'm going

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.033
to say is going to sound
counter-intuitive to you,

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:15.180
but the book explains
it and there's really

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.600
not much doubt about this--
that in general, the world

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.320
is becoming more religious
and will for the next 30

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.720
to 50 years at least.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.110
It's getting more religious.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.340
The reasons for that, which
are laid out there-- everything

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.000
here is brief.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.880
You can always ask more later--
is that both Christianity

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.650
and Islam are both
converting people at a rate

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.570
faster than the
population is growing.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.580
And that's the reason
why they're growing.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.740
Secondly, it's also true
that religious people

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.570
have a lot more children than
secular people and unbelieving

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.070
people.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.490
So you put all
that together, all

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.680
of the demographic
projections are

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.770
that actually the number of
people today in the world

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.650
that say they're secular,
no religious preference,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.410
is close to 17%.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.537
Over the next 35 years,
that's going down to about 12%

00:02:06.537 --> 00:02:08.370
because of these trends
I've just mentioned.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.150
So on the one hand, the
world's becoming religious.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.550
On the other hand,
parts of the world

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.000
are becoming more secular
than they've ever been before.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.960
Parts of the world
are going to be

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.979
marked by more and more
people who say religion

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.020
doesn't make sense to me.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.490
Belief in God doesn't
make sense to me.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.740
Now, what this means is that
there's two kinds of slogans

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.750
that you should never believe.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.500
One is that religion
is going away.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.630
It's just not.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.880
I mean, I do hear it a lot
that religion is dying out.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.050
Younger people are
less religious.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.800
What younger people?

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.580
The people I know.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.400
OK, we have to
look at the world.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.330
And it's not true that
religion is dying out.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.725
And it won't.

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:53.100
So the idea that religion is
going away is just not true.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.560
But the idea that in
some triumphalistic sense

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.020
that religion will
triumph or Christianity

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.520
will triumph in
the world, that's

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.010
not going to happen either.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.562
And since both these
trends are true,

00:03:08.562 --> 00:03:10.770
religion is not going away,
and yet part of the world

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.936
are going to become less
religious than they've ever

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:18.360
been, what that does mean is it
should matter to us how people

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.280
come to their various positions.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.040
Increasing numbers
of people are finding

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.620
that belief in a
universe without God

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.720
makes sense to them.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.580
They believe in a
universe without God.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.788
And that makes sense to them.

00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:33.620
And other people are
finding that belief in God

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.060
and a universe filled with
God makes sense to them.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.460
How do they get to
those positions?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.700
We actually often do not
really talk enough about

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.910
that because people don't want
to say, how do you get there?

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.360
By the way, people who lose
their religious faith usually

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.800
say, I just saw the truth.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.630
And people who get
converted usually

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.740
say, I just saw the light.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.620
But that's not
very illuminating.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.180
Instead, I'm going
to make the case

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.690
that the process by which
we come to our beliefs,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.370
to believe in a
universe without God

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.930
or believe in a
universe with God,

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.970
are actually more
complicated than that.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.630
So in chapter two
what I do-- and I

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.840
want to spend a little
time here with you

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.560
just for a moment
to lay out what

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.329
I do there-- is I tackle
this simplistic idea.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.997
So for example, one of the
things that people say a lot--

00:04:21.997 --> 00:04:23.580
I see it on the
internet all the time,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.800
and I talk to people in New
York all the time who say this.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.560
And that is this.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.670
It's a popular
belief to say belief

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.410
that there is no God is arrived
at mainly through using reason.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.250
So if you come to the
conclusion that there is no God,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.080
that happened through reason.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.640
But if you come to
believe there is a God,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.380
that's a leap of faith.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.340
So belief that there is
no God, through reason.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.980
Belief that there is
a God, through faith.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.130
I'm here to tell you
actually that is wrong.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.640
It's naive.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.450
It's simplistic.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.940
The fact of the
matter is both sides

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.980
use a combination
of reason and faith.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.280
So to press a little
bit, here's a thesis

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.140
I put out in chapter two.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.950
And I'll try to defend it in
about four or five minutes

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.510
here.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.710
And here's the thesis.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.020
The move from religion
to secularism,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.810
the move from religious faith
to a secular belief that there

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.480
is no God or maybe
there is no God--

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.000
so to move from religious
faith to secularism

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.630
is not so much a loss
of faith as a shift

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.190
to a new set of beliefs,
to a new community of faith

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.130
where the lines between
orthodoxy and heresy

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.562
are just drawn in
different places.

00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:43.020
So if you're
religious, you grew up

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.280
in a church, say,
or a synagogue,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.070
and then you move to being
non-religious-- I'm a secular

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.870
person, I actually
don't believe in God--

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.310
that's not so much
a loss of faith

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.960
as actually a
movement from one set

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.418
of beliefs to a
new set of beliefs,

00:05:54.418 --> 00:05:56.890
from one community of faith
to another community of faith,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.100
from one standard of
orthodoxy and heresy

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.960
to another standard of
orthodoxy and heresy.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.340
I know that's kind of
a provocative thesis

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.890
and not most people think that.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.240
Let me show you, I think,
how I can demonstrate that.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.510
Secular people that I know--
I'm not saying all of you--

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.100
if you say, well,
I consider myself

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.690
a person who doesn't
really believe in God,

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.090
so I consider myself
something of a secular

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.430
person-- I'm not saying
this is true of everybody.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.770
I'm saying plenty of people I've
talked to who say I'm secular

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.030
or I'm a non-religious
person actually

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.680
have two sets of beliefs.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.980
And they are beliefs.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.380
What are they?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.390
I will call them
proofism and humanism.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.530
Now, what's proofism?

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.520
It's a coined word.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.140
It's not the most
felicitous phrase.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.090
But I'm trying to get at this.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.830
What many people
will say to me is,

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.526
I'd be happy to believe in God
if you could prove it to me.

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:52.150
I'd be happy to
believe in Christianity

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.440
if you could prove it to me.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.330
But since there
isn't any evidence,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.940
you can't prove it
to me, therefore

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.340
I shouldn't believe it.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.630
Now, that statement is
wrong on a number of levels

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.840
and actually is a
statement of faith.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.800
Well, number one, when you say
you shouldn't believe something

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.300
unless it can be
empirically proven,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.890
the problem is
that that statement

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.230
can't be empirically proven.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.610
For about 100
years, philosophers

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.200
have pointed that out.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.127
To make a claim like
that, to make a claim

00:07:22.127 --> 00:07:24.460
that you shouldn't believe
something unless it's proven,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.400
is itself a statement
that can't be proven.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.510
It's an assertion.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.670
It's not an argument.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.250
It's just a sweeping statement.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.560
And it can't be
its own criteria.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.969
Secondly, when people
say to me, well, I

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:40.510
could be happy to believe in
God if you could prove it to me,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.270
But if you can't prove it to
me, I can't believe in a god.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.540
The problem is that everybody
bases their lives on beliefs

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.370
that they can't prove.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.300
If you believe in human
rights, if you believe

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.890
we ought to take care of the
poor and not trample the poor,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.690
can you prove that?

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.920
Of course you can't.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.857
Actually, everybody bases their
lives on deep convictions.

00:07:59.857 --> 00:08:00.940
They just can't be proven.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.400
So it's quite wrong to say,
for example to Christians,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.820
you've got to
prove your beliefs.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.170
But then I don't have
to prove my beliefs.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.760
The fact is nobody,
frankly, could

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.590
prove the most important beliefs
on which their life is based.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.300
And thirdly-- by the way,
you probably would guess,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.630
actually those of you with
a philosophy background,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.713
is there's not a lot of
agreement on what the word

00:08:22.713 --> 00:08:24.490
proof means.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.650
It is true that I
think most people agree

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.610
it's possible to prove
that substance x boils

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.200
at temperature y at
barometric pressure z.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.270
And therefore, if I
can demonstrate that,

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.309
then we could say
that's been proven.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:42.820
But beyond that, how do you
prove historical claims?

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.040
When is a historical
claim, that something

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.620
happened 300 years ago,
when has that been proven?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.620
Or how do you prove
any moral values?

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.940
Again, how do you prove that
human rights are important

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.400
or that they're there?

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.680
The answer is nobody
actually agrees

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.290
on what proof is, because some
people say, that was proven.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.470
Other people say, well,
how do you define proof?

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.470
So in the end, if you're
a person who says,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.010
because of my rationality,
I cannot believe in God

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.580
or Christianity, what
you're actually doing is

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.976
you're assuming a set of beliefs
about how rationality operates

00:09:15.976 --> 00:09:17.350
that are really
a set of beliefs.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.220
And they're not
self-evident to everybody.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.920
They're contested.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.891
So they're really
a set of beliefs.

00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:24.610
To say I can't believe
in Christianity

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.710
because you haven't proven
it is a set of beliefs.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.020
Then the other
thing besides what

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.840
I call proofism, which is a set
of beliefs about rationality,

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.780
which can't be proven.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.449
Most secular people
I know also are

00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:38.740
what you might call a humanist.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.440
Humanism means they
believe it's important

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.300
that every human
being be treated

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.840
with dignity, that people's
rights not to be trampled upon,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.810
that we not oppress
people, that we

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.760
share our goods and
our power with others

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.650
and not exploit them.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.250
Right?

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.920
When you say most, I mean,
let's put it this way--

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.590
most of the atheists
and most of the secular

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.364
or non-religious people
I know believe that.

00:10:02.364 --> 00:10:03.280
But here's a question.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.390
How do you prove that?

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.230
What is that?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.660
Not only is that
a set of beliefs,

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.820
but frankly, those beliefs
take more faith to believe in.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.570
See, if you're a
Hindu, you believe

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.090
the world is such
that you will get off

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.519
the cycle of reincarnation
if you live a good life.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:26.060
If you don't live a good life,
you keep getting reincarnated.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.560
If you live a good life,
you can be taken off

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.360
the cycle of reincarnation
and go into eternal bliss.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.240
If you believe the bible, so
if you are an Orthodox Jew

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.490
or you're a Christian
believer, you

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.032
believe that God made the world,
a loving God made the world,

00:10:42.032 --> 00:10:43.406
and you should
love your neighbor

00:10:43.406 --> 00:10:45.370
so that you're like God,
and you can know him,

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.540
and you can be saved.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.200
In other words, to live a
good life of humanistic values

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.980
fits in with the Hindu view
of what the universe is like.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.541
And it fits in with
the Christian view

00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:01.540
or the Jewish view of
what the universe is like.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.080
But what is the secular
view of the world?

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.450
It's what's called a
materialist view, which is

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.700
to say there's no supernatural.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.100
There's only natural.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.135
There's no soul.

00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:14.170
There's no heaven.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.210
It's just everything
has a natural cause.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.060
So just to show the
problem with that,

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.740
or I'll just say
the amount of faith

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.160
it takes that humanistic values
with that view of the world,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.780
last year I found this.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.210
This was written in
the "New York Times."

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.880
It was actually a letter.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.010
It says there are
30,000 galaxies

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.755
of over 13 billion years old.

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:37.870
So there's 30,000 galaxies
13 billion years old

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.330
with many trillions of stars
and many, many more trillions

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.300
of inferred planets.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.315
So how significant are you?

00:11:43.315 --> 00:11:45.130
He's talking to
individual people.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.728
How significant are you?

00:11:47.728 --> 00:11:48.907
You are not special.

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:50.740
You're just another
piece of decaying matter

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.810
on the compost
pile of this world.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.020
Nothing of who you are and
what you do in the short time

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.400
you were here will ever matter.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.400
Everything short of that
realization is vanity.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.060
Therefore, or he says
"so," celebrate life.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.680
In every moment,
admire its wonders

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.010
and love people
without reservation.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.300
Now, the word "so," most of
us think the word "so" means

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.720
this logically leads to that.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.150
When you say "so," we
think that somehow what

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.170
comes before the "so"
should lead you to do what

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.691
comes after the "so," right?

00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:29.440
Here's a question.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.960
The first part of
that statement is

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.000
a bracing, wonderfully
honest look

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.460
at what it means to believe
in a materialist universe.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.400
You're not here for any purpose.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.920
No one put you here.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.310
You came up through evolution,
red and tooth and claw.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.200
You know, the strong
eating the weak.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.960
You're only here
because your ancestors

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.150
killed weaker organisms.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.080
And in the end, eventually,
you're going to die.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.686
Then the sun is going to die.

00:13:00.686 --> 00:13:01.810
Then civilization will die.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.420
And in the end, whether
you're a genocidal maniac

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.880
or whether you're an
altruist and philanthropist

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.840
will make no
difference in the end.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.420
There won't be anybody
around to remember anything

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.420
that anyone's ever done.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.290
So in the end, nothing
you do will matter, right?

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.550
Therefore, he says,
love one another.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.760
See, here's the question.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.820
If that's the case of the
nature of the universe,

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.490
why should I love other people?

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.850
If my ancestors got here
by destroying and eating

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.160
the weaker organisms,
why should I now

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.360
suddenly become unselfish?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.750
And the answer is if you want to
believe in humanistic values--

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.960
I'm glad, by the way.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.630
I am really glad.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.820
The more people that believe
in humanistic values,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.490
I think the better
the world will be.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.990
But it doesn't follow from your
view of the universe at all.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.420
It's a huge leap of faith,
unbelievable leap of faith.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.320
It doesn't take huge
faith to go from the Hindu

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.441
view of the universe
to humanistic values,

00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:54.190
or from the Christian
view of the universe

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.660
to humanistic values.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.127
But it does from the
materialistic, the secular view

00:13:58.127 --> 00:13:58.960
to humanistic value.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.680
You can believe them.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.809
But don't tell me that
that's not a leap of faith.

00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:03.100
It's an enormous leap of faith.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.200
And you know who's
going to tell you?

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.670
Nietzsche.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.680
Friedrich Nietzsche
is going to say--

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.180
and this is what he did say,
and he argued incredibly--

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.660
I would say in an incredibly
convincing way-- he would say,

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.520
if you say I'm an
atheist, and then

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.560
you say but we should
not starve the poor

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.440
and we should honor
their equal rights,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.310
he says you're still a
Christian, whether you admit it

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.030
or not.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.840
Because, he says, those
ideas came historically

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.330
into the Western society
when people believed

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
in the Christian understanding
of the universe--

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.913
that you're here for a purpose
and you're made by a loving God

00:14:42.913 --> 00:14:45.850
and you're made the image of
God and all human beings are

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.960
children of God.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.202
He says those values
made sense when

00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:51.160
we believed the Christian
view of the universe.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.330
But we don't believe
that anymore.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.340
And therefore, if you
hold on to those values,

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.590
you're actually being a
Christian, and a very, very

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.306
inconsistent person even
though you won't admit it.

00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:01.930
I don't think you
can answer Nietzsche.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.054
So now here is what we are.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.820
Fundamentally, there are
no irreligious people.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:16.830
At one level, absolutely
everybody has a set of beliefs,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.900
including secular people
and irreligious people,

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.110
have a set of beliefs
about the universe

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.250
that A, you can't
prove empirically, B,

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.710
are not self-evident to most
of the rest of the world.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.390
See, even if you
can't prove something,

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.389
sometimes you can say,
but everybody knows that.

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:34.730
Well, you can't say that
about any particular set

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.530
of beliefs about the universe.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.655
So in other words,
you can't prove it.

00:15:38.655 --> 00:15:41.030
If you're a secular person,
your beliefs you can't prove.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.119
B, your beliefs are not
self-evident to most people

00:15:44.119 --> 00:15:44.660
in the world.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.360
And C, as I'm going to
show you here in a second,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.030
is your beliefs have as many
contradictions and problems

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:54.620
that attend to them as
any religious faith does.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.440
So what does that mean?

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.840
Does that mean, oh, there
is no way to know the truth?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.250
No, no, no, no.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.799
See, I'm trying to
say everybody gets

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:05.840
their position-- religious
people and irreligious

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.570
people-- get to their beliefs--
because in the end, what

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:14.420
you hold is a belief-- by
a combination of reason

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.910
and intuition.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.810
So for example, how do you use a
reason to come to a conclusion?

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.980
One is you look at the logical
consistency of your beliefs.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.320
That's using reason.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.310
Another thing you
ask-- do the things

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.740
I believe fit in with what's
out there in the world?

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.710
Does it fit in with what I
see happening in the world?

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.330
That's using reason.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.390
But then there's also
a part, frankly--

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.420
everybody to some
degree or other

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.610
also uses their
emotions when it comes

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.050
to believing what they believe.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.600
And they also look socially.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.960
They say, I see other people
who have these beliefs.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.090
And how is that
affecting their life?

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.840
So basically, the way any
particular set of beliefs

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.380
comes to make sense to
you is for emotional,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.693
cultural, and rational reasons.

00:17:03.693 --> 00:17:05.359
It has to make sense
to you emotionally.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.579
It has to make sense to
you socially, culturally.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.911
You see how the
belief fleshes out

00:17:09.911 --> 00:17:11.119
in the lives of other people.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:14.319
And then thirdly, it does have
to be logically consistent.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.560
And there doesn't need to
be rational reasons too.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.970
And so everybody uses
those three things

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.170
to get to their beliefs.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.724
Now, what I do in the
rest of this book--

00:17:24.724 --> 00:17:26.599
and the other book's
already been mentioned--

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:31.400
The Reason for God-- is I
lay out mainly in this book

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.190
the emotional and
cultural reasons why

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.190
Christianity tends to make
sense to a lot of people.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.900
And then at the
very end, I start

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.540
going into the rational reasons,
the more traditional kind

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.470
of arguments for God
and Christianity.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.510
But I start it-- but on the
other hand, I finish it,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.380
you might say, in
The Reason for God."

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.970
So somebody asked me, what's
the relationship of Making

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.220
Sense of God to Reason for God?

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.150
They say, is Making Sense of
God a sequel to Reason for God?

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.350
I said, no, it's a prequel.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.640
Because basically, the
way we get there is we

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.260
use our emotions.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.520
We use our relationships.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.800
And we use our
reason to decide what

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.140
we think about the universe.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.160
Now, what I'm going
to do in only six,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.970
seven minutes, I guess, is
I'm going to actually tell you

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:26.360
what I say in these other books
as the emotional and social and

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.640
rational reasons why
Christianity does come to make

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.710
sense to a lot of people.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.540
But I'm actually going to do
it as a series of assertions.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.720
So this can be infuriating
to many people.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.200
So I'm really hoping that here
at Google, we're all civilized,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.810
that you don't rush the
podium snarling at me.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.110
Because I'm not going to
make the case for any one

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.530
of these assertions.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.530
I'm going to say people who
find Christianity making

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.530
sense come to believe this.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.220
And in the books, I actually
lay out all kinds of reasons

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:55.740
for why.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.400
So there's nothing I'm about to
tell you is really groundless.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.740
In the end, if you read the
books, you might disagree.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.890
But what I'm saying is not
arbitrary or groundless, OK?

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.240
They were all kind of
worked out in the books.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:19.180
But if I was going to make a
case in five minutes, which

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:24.214
I am, for why Christianity can
make sense for a lot of people

00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.880
and how it makes sense
for other people,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.220
I would say Christianity comes
to make sense for us when we

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.590
see three things-- when we see
the faith that takes to doubt

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.670
it, that is Christianity, the
faith it takes to doubt it,

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.560
the problems we have
without it, and the beauty

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.605
we see within it.

00:19:43.605 --> 00:19:44.730
Now what do I mean by that?

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:50.040
First of all, fast here, the
faith it takes to doubt it.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.010
One of the ways in which people
who are doubting Christianity

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.830
come to embrace it
is when they realize

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.650
that all their doubts,
every one of their doubts,

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.820
is always based on
a leap of faith,

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.690
which is harder to justify
than the thing you're doubting.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.122
Follow that?

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:07.830
Wasn't that easy?

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.060
No.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.140
In other words, every time
you say, I doubt Christianity,

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.160
your doubt is based on actually
an assumption of faith which

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.410
itself needs to be justified,
and very often can't be.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:19.826
So let me give you
three examples.

00:20:19.826 --> 00:20:21.612
Number one, one
of the objections

00:20:21.612 --> 00:20:23.070
I hear to Christianity
all the time

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:27.901
is there can't just be
one true way to believe.

00:20:27.901 --> 00:20:29.150
There can't be one true faith.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.530
There can be one
true way to God.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.650
There just can't be one
true way to believe.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.840
And here's the
problem with that.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.450
How do you know that?

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.400
I mean, that's an
assertion, not an argument.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.740
How do you know that
there's not one true way?

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.220
The only way to know that there
is not one sure way to God

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.500
would be actually if you
have the ultimate perspective

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.770
on truth that you just said
nobody is allowed to have.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.270
And actually, what that
means is that your doubt

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.630
is based on an assessment
of your perspective, which

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.730
actually is a major
leap of faith,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.050
and I think is hard to justify.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.130
Here's the second one.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.796
People say, I can't
believe in a God who

00:21:08.796 --> 00:21:12.260
allows such evil and suffering.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.750
And by the way, I'm a pastor.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.280
I'm not a scholar.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.740
I'm not an academic.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.970
I'm not a person who
mainly does thinking.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.610
I'm a pastor, so I've
walked with plenty of people

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.280
through horrible suffering.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.826
So what I'm saying here I do
not mean to be so cursory.

00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:33.200
I told you this is the problem
with what I'm about to do.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.520
But here's the point.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.000
When someone says I can't
believe in God because he

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.360
allows such evil and suffering,
what you actually are saying

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.580
is this.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.410
Because I can't think
of any good reason

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.280
why God would allow
evil and suffering,

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.970
therefore, there can't
be any good reason.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.920
Because I can't think
of it, he can't possibly

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.870
have one that I can't think of.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.910
See, the only way to
walk away from God

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.660
is to assume there
can't be a good reason.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.870
And why can't there
be a good reason?

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:00.830
Because you can't think of it.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.496
But why in the world,
if there is a God,

00:22:02.496 --> 00:22:04.310
couldn't he might
maybe-- maybe he's

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.622
got an idea that you don't have.

00:22:06.622 --> 00:22:08.330
And you see, ancient
people, philosophers

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.530
will point out the
ancient people,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.446
though they struggled
with evil and suffering,

00:22:11.446 --> 00:22:13.354
never thought evil and
suffering was a reason

00:22:13.354 --> 00:22:14.270
not to believe in God.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.930
You know why?

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.350
Because they were humbler
about the human reason.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.180
We are not so humble.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.920
We have an assumption
that we have

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.504
the powers of
exhaustive surveillance,

00:22:23.504 --> 00:22:25.461
that we should be able
to look at the universe.

00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:27.440
And if we can't think
of anything, I mean,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.557
our ancestors would never
have been this arrogant.

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.640
Because we can't think of
any good reason for evil

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.473
and suffering, therefore
there can't be any.

00:22:33.473 --> 00:22:36.620
So you see, you're actually
assuming something.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.780
You have a doubt, but it's
based on a faith in yourself,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.100
which how justifiable is it?

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.970
Here I'll give you one more.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:51.440
There are lots and lots
and lots of objections

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.990
to various parts of the bible.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:59.480
And you need to realize that
virtually all the objections

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.270
you might have to
things the bible teaches

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.780
are based on high
faith in your culture

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.090
and the superiority
of your culture.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.900
So for example, years
ago, not too long ago,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.830
I once talked about Christianity
to a Chinese graduate student--

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.390
brilliant young man.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.540
I was in Britain when
I was at the time.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.290
And you know what?

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.790
He had no problem with the
idea that God would send people

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.280
to hell, no problem at all.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.260
Because, he says,
I'm not a Westerner.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.340
And so the idea that God
might have the authority

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.048
to send people to hell
doesn't bother me.

00:23:32.048 --> 00:23:34.310
I have no problem with
that exercise of authority.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:36.680
But he says, what I
can't accept is this--

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.350
the individualistic nature
of Christian salvation

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.030
means that if I believe
in Jesus Christ,

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.772
I would not be
with my ancestors.

00:23:42.772 --> 00:23:45.230
And I don't want to believe
anything that would separate me

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.550
from my ancestors.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.730
And my guess is the average
Manhattan young professional,

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.830
that's not the main problem
they have with the bible. c

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.920
OK, I talked to a Middle
Eastern intellectual over there.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.204
And what she believed,
interestingly enough,

00:24:00.204 --> 00:24:02.120
what she says, I have
no problem with the idea

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.010
that God would send people
to hell, no problem at all.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.620
If there is a God, why
couldn't he do that?

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.390
He created us.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.730
Doesn't he own us?

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.850
But then, she said, but she
cannot accept what the bible

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.084
says about forgiveness, this
idea that we are obligated

00:24:17.084 --> 00:24:19.250
to forgive no matter what
the other person has done,

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.040
that we have to forgive.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.649
And even though most
young Manhattanites

00:24:25.649 --> 00:24:28.190
don't think about the difficulty
of that, generally speaking,

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.530
that's another reason
why it's probably

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.140
not the average New Yorker's
problem with the bible

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.731
that it talks about
forgiveness too much.

00:24:35.731 --> 00:24:37.730
However, the average New
Yorker is going to say,

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.063
I just can't accept a God who
would send people to hell.

00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:40.610
You know why?

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.580
Because at that moment,
what you're saying

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.850
is my cultural location
is superior to theirs.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.729
My culture is absolutely right.

00:24:49.729 --> 00:24:51.020
And it's never going to change.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.490
For all you know,
100 years from now,

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.948
your great-grandchildren
will think

00:24:53.948 --> 00:24:55.670
that your approach
to things is stupid.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.030
In fact, inevitably
they will, by the way.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:04.310
If the record of your political
views is somehow preserved,

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.810
your great-grandchildren
will think you are horrible.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.210
And yet on the basis of your
cultural location, which you're

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.415
kind of absolutizing on the
basis of your historical moment

00:25:14.415 --> 00:25:16.040
which your kind of
absolutizing, you're

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.030
going to throw the
whole bible over.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.020
See, every doubt of the bible
is based on incredible faith

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.340
in something else which is
really hard to justify--

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.770
the faith it takes to doubt it.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.630
Do you see that?

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.280
Virtually always,
Christianity starts

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.150
to make sense when you begin
to see what incredible faith it

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.350
takes to doubt it.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.610
Secondly, the problems
you have without it.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.330
Now, I'm really
going to be fast.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.900
But here's the point.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.710
There are emotional, cultural,
and rational problems

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.100
with not believing in God.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.350
Now here, I'm kind of
going at secularism.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.809
And of course, you
do have to weigh

00:25:52.809 --> 00:25:54.766
Christianity and other
religions to secularism.

00:25:54.766 --> 00:25:56.570
But I don't have time
for that unless you

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.990
want to ask me about it.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.344
But here's the problems.

00:25:59.344 --> 00:26:01.010
Number one, if you
don't believe in God,

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.675
there is a problem with meaning.

00:26:03.675 --> 00:26:05.300
Because the meaning
that you create for

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.860
yourself will be too thin
for you to handle suffering.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.420
The secular culture,
unlike religious cultures,

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.950
make you find your
meaning and life

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.860
in something here, which means
suffering can take it away.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.960
And every other
culture, whether it's

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.652
Hindu or Islam or Christian,
every other kind of religion

00:26:24.652 --> 00:26:27.110
helps you locate your meaning
and life outside of this life

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.720
so that suffering can
actually help you accomplish

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.840
your meaning in life.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.548
But if you're a secular
person, suffering

00:26:32.548 --> 00:26:34.680
will destroy your
meaning in life.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.250
And secular culture
gives its members

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.110
less resources to
deal with suffering

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.230
than any culture in the
history of the world.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.630
And we are much more
traumatized by it.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.780
Number two, just these.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.180
Secularism, the idea
there is no God,

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.750
gives you a view of identity
which is incredibly fragile.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.172
Every other religion
says you find

00:26:55.172 --> 00:26:57.380
who you are by connecting
to something more important

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.810
than you.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.840
The secular culture says
you find your identity

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.360
by looking inside
and doing whatever

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.910
you think you want to do most.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.160
And you assert it over and
against everybody else.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.630
And lots and lots
of studies have

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.660
shown that kind of identity,
which is really unique-- it's

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.330
not the way it works in the rest
of the world or in history--

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.880
makes you incredibly fragile
because you desperately

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.125
need a kind of recognition that
it actually can enslave you.

00:27:22.125 --> 00:27:24.000
Thirdly, it's not just
the problem of meaning

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.150
and a problem of identity, it's
also the problem of freedom.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:34.536
Modern culture defines freedom
as the absence of restrictions.

00:27:34.536 --> 00:27:36.410
Isaiah Berlin, the
philosopher Isaiah Berlin,

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:37.610
said there's two
kinds of freedom.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.901
There is negative freedom
and there's positive freedom.

00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:42.440
Negative freedom
is freedom from.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.650
Positive freedom is freedom for.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.360
Negative freedom
simply says, I'm

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.040
only free if I have
no restrictions.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.860
And I hope you all
know if that's really

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.550
what freedom is, then that
is antithetical to love.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:02.270
Because the more committed
your love relationship is,

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.890
the less free you are.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.170
And yet, by the
way, the more you

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.990
are in a wonderful
committed love relationship,

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.150
generally the happier you are.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:16.010
The fact is we've got a culture
and a belief set that doesn't

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.340
support positive freedom.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.030
It only supports
negative freedom.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.890
As a result, freedom
actually tends

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.110
to eat up love relationships.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.440
It's one of the reasons why we
have fewer and fewer lifetime

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.860
committed love relationships
because the view of freedom

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.440
that comes from highly
individualistic view that

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.890
goes along with the secular
view undermines that.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.375
There's a whole lot
of emotional problems.

00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:41.000
But then there's the
rational problems.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.830
And I'll just
simply mention them.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:48.110
There's the problem, by the
way, of existence itself.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.610
There are really
good arguments that

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.840
say it's difficult to understand
if there is no God why there's

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.690
something rather than nothing.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.830
If you want ask me about
that, we can go into it.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.080
But it's one of the
problems you have

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.364
if you don't believe in God.

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:03.530
Another problem you have
if you don't believe in God

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.110
is the problem of
moral obligation.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:10.580
If you don't believe
in God, no trouble

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.830
accounting for moral feelings.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.150
You have moral feelings, right?

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.185
Everybody in this room
has some things you feel.

00:29:16.185 --> 00:29:17.060
I feel this is right.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.934
I feel this is wrong.

00:29:18.934 --> 00:29:21.350
And if you don't believe in
God, no problem explaining it.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.090
It could be evolution.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.930
That's why we have
those feelings.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.320
Or it could be your culture
has taught you those things.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.236
Or it could be an
existential choice of yours.

00:29:29.236 --> 00:29:30.410
Whatever.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:32.690
But if there is no God,
it's hard to see how there

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.081
could be moral obligation.

00:29:35.081 --> 00:29:37.430
See, a moral feeling says,
I feel this is wrong.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.920
A moral obligation is to say
you must stop doing that,

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.750
whether you feel
it's wrong or not.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.990
See?

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.160
How can you say to another
person even though you

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.200
feel it's OK, it's wrong.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.590
And you ought to--
obligation-- stop doing it.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:59.270
See, why should your feeling
trump that person's feeling?

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:03.737
Well, the only way to say that
is to say there's a higher law.

00:30:03.737 --> 00:30:04.820
There's something outside.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.520
There's a moral source
outside of both of us.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.530
We all have to honor that.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.200
But what can that be
if there is no God?

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.616
You know, Martin
Luther King, Jr.,

00:30:10.616 --> 00:30:13.310
in his famous letter
at Birmingham jail,

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.690
put it like this.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.660
He said, if there is
no higher divine law,

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.834
if there is no God,
no higher divine law,

00:30:19.834 --> 00:30:22.250
there will be no way to tell
if a particular human law was

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.310
unjust or not
because it would just

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.640
be my feelings
versus your feelings.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.920
Big problem.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.860
Lastly, the beauty.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.470
The beauty that
we find within it.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.750
Christianity has a beauty to it.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:44.650
I mean, first of all,
there's the idea--

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.340
the Christian idea of God is
that God is not an individual.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.330
But God is a trinity
of three persons

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.480
who have known and loved
each other from all eternity.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.640
And you all know, if you're
into a real love relationship,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.340
that's when you're
really the happiest.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.230
So if you have Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.799
according to Christian
teaching having perfect love

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:09.340
relationships for
all eternity, we're

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.100
utterly happy-- totally
happy, you might say.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.220
Why would you create
a world filled

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.960
with other personal beings if
you're already perfectly happy?

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.210
And the answer is to share
your happiness with them.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.040
There's no other good reason.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.590
You already have everything.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.950
So the Christian idea
is that God actually

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.550
created us to share
his happiness and love.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.920
Then secondly, the
Christian story

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.470
is that we turned away from him.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.452
And that's the reason
why things fall apart.

00:31:40.452 --> 00:31:41.410
The center cannot hold.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.810
Mere anarchy is
loosed upon the world.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.950
Christianity has a
story of what happened

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:50.050
to the universe that
explains both the ruin

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.550
and the glory of the human race.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.170
Any story that just looks
at human beings as trash

00:31:56.170 --> 00:32:00.790
or any story that looks at
human beings as basically good

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.079
and does not recognize the
good and the evil in them

00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:05.620
doesn't really
account for how things

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.203
are, doesn't lead
you to expect what's

00:32:07.203 --> 00:32:09.220
going to happen tomorrow.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.260
And so Christianity,
the beauty of the story

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:16.696
is, God, who wants to share his
love and unhappiness with us,

00:32:16.696 --> 00:32:21.910
an account of what's wrong with
us, then thirdly, a love story.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.210
He comes into the
world as Jesus Christ.

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.780
Dorothy Sayers-- one
of the first women who

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.270
ever went to Oxford, and
she wrote detective novels.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.820
And one of her detectives
was Lord Peter Wimsey,

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.750
and she wrote a series of
stories and novels about him.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.220
He solves mysteries.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:44.620
And halfway through the
stories, suddenly a woman

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.970
shows up to him, Harriet Vane.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:53.290
She's one of the very first
women who went to Oxford,

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.950
and she also wrote
mystery stories.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.420
So Harriet Vane character shows
up in the Peter Wimsey stories.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.910
She's one of the first
women graduates of Oxford.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:05.260
She writes mystery stories.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.890
And she's not
particularly good-looking.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:09.490
Wait a minute.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.380
Who is this?

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.940
Dorothy Sayers,
many people believe,

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.000
looked at this character
that she had created,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.790
saw how lonely he
was, and wrote herself

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.040
into the story out of love.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.010
And Harriet Vane saves him.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.510
And of course, the
Christian story--

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.250
you might say, oh, that's sweet.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:31.449
What a sweet idea.

00:33:31.449 --> 00:33:33.490
The Christian story, that's
exactly what God did.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.140
He looks into the
world he created.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.920
He sees us harming each
other, ruining each other.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.480
And he writes
himself in the story.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.790
And in Jesus Christ,
he goes to the cross

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:46.840
and dies to pay for our
sins so that God can forgive

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.130
us and still be a just God.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.380
If you're a judge, you
can't just forgive people.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.264
You know, the law
needs to be paid.

00:33:55.264 --> 00:33:56.680
You can't just
say, oh, it doesn't

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.660
matter what you've done.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.160
Go off.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.360
Well then, justice falls apart.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.870
But how could God be
both just and forgive us?

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.250
And the answer was Jesus Christ.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:09.699
God, in a sense, writes
himself into the story

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:14.317
because he loves us and
does all that for us.

00:34:14.317 --> 00:34:16.400
And that's the reason why,
in the end, by the way,

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.679
if you read the gospels, one
of the main reasons that people

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:25.420
come to believe in Jesus Christ
is they read the gospels,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.500
and they see Jesus.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.489
They see his claims.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:28.630
They see his humility.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.520
They see his grace.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.127
They see his courage.

00:34:32.127 --> 00:34:34.460
And you read through the
gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:34.719
and John.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:35.802
And you're amazed at this.

00:34:35.802 --> 00:34:40.120
And some years ago,
there was a pastor

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.500
I knew who was confronted
by a non-believer who said,

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.440
I would believe in
God if you can give me

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.600
a watertight argument.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:57.850
And the minister said,
read the New Testament.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.430
And he said, you mean, there's
a watertight argument there?

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:01.770
He says, well, not exactly.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.324
There's Jesus Christ.

00:35:04.324 --> 00:35:05.740
And he says, you
know, what if God

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.198
didn't give us a watertight
argument to lead us to himself?

00:35:08.198 --> 00:35:10.922
What if he gave us
a watertight person

00:35:10.922 --> 00:35:12.880
against whom, in the end,
there is no argument?

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.910
Read him, and you'll see
there's almost no way to account

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:19.640
for the beauty of this
person unless maybe he

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.220
is who he said he is.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.790
OK, slightly longer
than I wanted

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:28.960
to go and also slightly
faster than I wanted to go.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.520
So I'm just an unhappy guy.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.490
So let's see what we can do.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:36.240
So those are some
ways why we need

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:40.000
to worry about and be
concerned about how people come

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.310
to their beliefs, and how
it's possible for Christians

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.940
to make sense even today.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.910
Questions?

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:50.080
The best way to do it
would be to go to your mic

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.420
because otherwise, you will not
be picked up for the recording.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.794
Yes, go ahead.

00:35:56.794 --> 00:35:59.566
AUDIENCE: Well, first of all,
thank you so much for coming.

00:35:59.566 --> 00:36:03.980
This has been really interesting
and a great opportunity.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.170
And I wanted to ask.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.925
I know you talked a lot about
the arguments for religion

00:36:07.925 --> 00:36:10.656
and the arguments
against secularism,

00:36:10.656 --> 00:36:12.986
but I wanted to ask
you about spirituality,

00:36:12.986 --> 00:36:17.710
in that I and some of my
peers very much do believe

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.560
that there is a higher power.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.060
And we don't believe
in secularism.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.230
There is something
that connects us all

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.390
that created us on this Earth.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:30.030
But that doesn't necessarily
translate into religion.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.256
And there's a lot of the dogma.

00:36:32.256 --> 00:36:34.626
And Christianity
and other religions

00:36:34.626 --> 00:36:36.050
don't necessarily appeal.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.070
They make us uncomfortable,
especially the way

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.420
it can be used sometimes
for hate today.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.410
TIM KELLER: Yes.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.414
AUDIENCE: And also, necessarily
kind of figuring out

00:36:45.414 --> 00:36:46.634
the differences between them.

00:36:46.634 --> 00:36:50.000
Why would one choose
Christianity over Judaism,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.860
over Hinduism,
when they all have

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.590
these different beautiful ways
of bringing people together?

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:55.710
TIM KELLER: They do.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.334
AUDIENCE: But you're
obviously a pastor

00:36:57.334 --> 00:36:59.000
and of the Christian faith.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.230
So you made a choice.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:01.570
TIM KELLER: Well, yeah.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.800
AUDIENCE: So if you have
any thoughts on that.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.920
TIM KELLER: You only
have-- generally speaking,

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.030
it's hard to have
more than one career.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.970
It's hard to be both
Muslim and a Buddhist

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.400
and a Christian cleric,
five years of each.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.129
It doesn't work.

00:37:18.129 --> 00:37:18.920
I'll tell you what.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.210
I would suggest two things.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:21.540
I'm going to read you
something out of the book,

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:21.950
believe it or not.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:22.790
Thank you, actually.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.390
You asked a question
that gets me to the book.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.095
Oh, were you finished
with the question?

00:37:26.095 --> 00:37:26.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.720
TIM KELLER: OK, I would
suggest on the multiple faiths,

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:36.110
there is a book by John
Dixon-- he's Australian--

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:40.940
who wrote a book called The
Spectator's Guide to World

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.520
Religions.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.220
Now, like me, he's a
Christian minister.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.020
But I read the book recently.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:54.110
And he said, I'm trying to
create five small vignettes.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:58.310
He did Islam, Hinduism,
Buddhism, Christianity,

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:59.540
and Judaism.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.380
And he lays it out very, very as
objectively as he possibly can.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.600
He does everything
he possibly can.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.990
He says, I'm sure
critics will say

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:12.260
it's obvious to see even
the way you handle Buddhism

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.640
that you're a Christian.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.080
But he said, I tried real hard.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.413
Besides that, everybody who
would write a book like that

00:38:17.413 --> 00:38:19.640
would have to come from
some position generally.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.100
And it's a really,
really helpful book.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.100
Because what it does is it
just lays out the differences

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:29.690
and tries very hard to say,
now, you make the decision

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.580
rather than him doing it.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.750
That's one side.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.810
Here's the other side though.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.240
The last part of this
book is actually the story

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.140
of a guy named Langdon Gilkey.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.290
Langdon Gilkey was
a young man who

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.260
graduated from Harvard
with a philosophy degree

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.410
with honors in the
1930s and went to China

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.320
to teach at a university there.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.950
And when the Japanese
overran that part of China,

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.990
he was put into
a detention camp.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.740
It was a really, really,
really difficult place.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.800
2,000 people in less
than a city block.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:14.120
Everybody had something
like-- there was

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.404
20 toilets for 2,000 people.

00:39:17.404 --> 00:39:19.070
It was a very, very
difficult situation.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.350
And when he went
there, growing up,

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:22.665
he had lost his church faith.

00:39:22.665 --> 00:39:25.040
He had actually believed in
the goodness of human beings,

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.770
and rationality is the way
to overcome our problems,

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:31.190
and that religion actually
wouldn't help much.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:34.520
When he was there,
he basically came

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.070
to see that there is
absolutely no way.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.960
Human beings are
basically selfish.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.550
He actually says at one point--
I marked this in case somebody

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.080
asked this question.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:52.370
He says he came to believe
what the bible said about sin.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:53.960
He said self-interest
seemed almost

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.770
omnipotent next to the weak
claims of logic and fair play.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.330
As the months went
by, he constantly

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.210
faced intractable
self-centeredness.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.490
And he actually said, he
says, the fundamental bent

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.770
of the whole human
self in all of us

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.450
was inward toward
our own welfare.

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.330
And we're so immersed in
it that we hardly are ever

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.520
able to see this in ourselves,
much less extricate ourselves

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.680
from our dilemma.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.410
He says everybody he saw
who were really being cruel,

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:22.070
they always gave rational
and moral reasons

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.830
for what they were
already determined to do.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:29.660
He says even the most moral
and religious people--

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.850
because there were a lot
of priests and missionaries

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:35.930
there who had been working
in China who were thrown

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.110
in with everybody else-- he says
the most religious people found

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.360
it incredibly difficult,
not to say impossible,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.270
to will the good
and to be objective

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:45.872
and to be generous and fair.

00:40:45.872 --> 00:40:47.330
And what they
actually did, though,

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.130
was they always gave
religious reasons

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:51.240
for what they were doing.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.730
So he got incredibly
disillusioned.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.272
Because here was
the secular people.

00:40:55.272 --> 00:40:56.730
They were being
incredibly selfish.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.020
And here were the
religious people.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.728
And they were being
every bit as selfish.

00:40:59.728 --> 00:41:01.830
The secular people were
using rational reasons

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.912
for why they were
being selfish and cruel

00:41:04.912 --> 00:41:05.870
to the other neighbors.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.160
They were just
trying to survive.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.535
And he says, the
religious people

00:41:08.535 --> 00:41:10.480
were using religious reasons.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.800
So he started being pushed
back toward belief in sin.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.190
But then, there's one guy--
now the guy in the book,

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.350
the guy's name is Eric Ridley.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.530
But it's actually Eric
Liddell that you might

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.260
know was in "Chariots Of Fire."

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:30.750
He was a Presbyterian Scottish
guy who wouldn't run on Sunday,

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.240
but then did win
the 400-meter gold

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.310
medal in the 1921 Olympics.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:39.720
He went to China
as a missionary.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.850
And he was put in the camp.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:45.720
And he died of a brain tumor
in there at the age of 43.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.830
But he had an amazing impact.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.496
And this is actually,
believe it or not,

00:41:49.496 --> 00:41:50.620
is answering your question.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.000
He had an amazing
impact on Gilkey.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.930
Gilkey said, it's
rare indeed when

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.140
a person has the good
fortune to meet a saint.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:05.540
But he came as close as
anyone I had ever known.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.290
Eric Liddell was
concerned to minister

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.520
to the teenagers of the camp.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.311
He cooked for them.

00:42:09.311 --> 00:42:11.280
He supervised
recreation for them.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.110
He poured himself out for them.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.360
He was about the only
person that Gilkey

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.450
saw in the whole camp who was
always overflowing with humor,

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:20.660
love of life, sacrificial
kindness for others,

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.480
and inward peace.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.790
And when he died of a
brain tumor suddenly,

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:25.800
the entire camp was stunned.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.082
So he was trying to say,
what made this guy different?

00:42:28.082 --> 00:42:29.790
I mean, there were a
lot of missionaries.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:30.480
There were a lot of religions.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.800
What made him different?

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.570
And this is what he said.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.230
Liddell-- this is
what Gilkey says--

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.660
was a committed Presbyterian
missionary who believed

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.720
in Christ, but that his
salvation was accomplished

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.100
by God's sheer and free grace.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.660
He did not believe-- and this
is a Christian teaching--

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.932
you do not believe
that that God loves you

00:42:50.932 --> 00:42:52.890
because you are living
a good life, because you

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.830
are surrendering your
will, because you're

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:56.640
charitable to people.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.110
Believes it's
totally sheer grace

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.270
because of what Jesus did.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:03.030
And Gilkey then points
out that religion all by

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:06.150
itself does not necessarily
produce the changed heart

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.060
capable of moral selflessness.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.830
Often, religion can just make
our self-centeredness worse,

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.370
especially if it
leads us to pride

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.640
in our moral accomplishments.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.690
So he came to see
religious people were

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.150
kind of self-centered
in their religiosity

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.580
because they thought,
my religiosity makes

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.300
me a good person.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.729
That's why God loves me.

00:43:25.729 --> 00:43:28.020
And he says, it actually
didn't make them less selfish.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.180
It made them part of
the problem, people

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.811
just scrambling and trampling
other people so they

00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:33.310
can survive.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.430
Gilkey says, in Liddell,
we have a picture

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.684
of what a human being could be
if he was both humbled and yet

00:43:41.684 --> 00:43:44.100
profoundly affirmed and filled
with the knowledge of God's

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.800
unconditional love
through undeserved grace.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.450
And this is the last
thing Gilkey says.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.908
He's quoting Reinhold
Niebuhr here.

00:43:49.908 --> 00:43:52.200
He says, religion
is not the place

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.940
where the problem
of man's egotism

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.930
is automatically solved.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.950
Rather, it is there
that the ultimate battle

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:02.970
between human pride and
God's grace takes place.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:07.050
If human pride wins the
battle-- that is to say,

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:08.700
if you adopt a
religion that makes

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.620
you more proud of your
goodness-- he says,

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.320
if human pride wins the
battle, religion can and does

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.600
become one of the
instruments of human sin.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.910
And this is what
you're talking about.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:26.700
But if there is a self that
does meet God and surrenders

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.490
to something beyond its own
self-interest, the grace

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:32.970
of God, religion may
provide the one possibility

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.850
for a much needed
and very rare release

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.640
from our common self-concern.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.290
So I would say check out
all the different religions.

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:44.070
But the genius of Christianity,
even though many people

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.600
who are professing
Christians don't see it,

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.620
is that religion by
itself actually makes

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.222
you as bad as everybody else.

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.930
In fact, it can make
you worse because it

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:55.120
makes you a Pharisee.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.030
But the doctrine
of the grace of God

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.140
that you're saved by sheer grace
humbles you, and yet affirms

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.230
you at the same time.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:04.140
You're so bad Jesus
had to die for you.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.950
But you're so loved that Jesus
was willing to die for you.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.670
And so Gilkey saw, here's
a guy who actually got it.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.120
And he was different.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.659
So that would be my answer.

00:45:14.659 --> 00:45:16.200
The reason it was
long was because it

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.420
was a great question,
my answer, and also

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.300
because I wanted to say it.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.950
Anyway, yes, sir.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.480
Thank you.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.850
AUDIENCE: Hey, thank
you for speaking.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.830
It seemed to me like
a lot of your argument

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:32.520
against secularism or humanism
was predicated on this idea

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.280
that human evolution
and evolution in general

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.280
is sort of Hobbesian
and ruthless.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.560
And I'm wondering
how you would respond

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.140
to an alternative
hypothesis, which

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.910
is that humans, like
some other species,

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:48.660
actually evolved having a lot
of benefit of social cooperation

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.980
and in group goal-setting.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:56.150
And nested within that, there's
actually a huge benefit for us

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.250
to tell stories and
have beliefs in order

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.620
to get us to work
together as a group.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.560
And if that's plausible,
why it wouldn't actually

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.100
make more sense for us to
by some democratic process

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.370
come up with a new form of
philosophy, rules, governance,

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:13.280
social norms that
lead us to collaborate

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.530
and have a lot of
the humanist ideals

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.860
that I think many religious
people and many secular people

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.810
would find advantageous
to us as a species.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.020
TIM KELLER: Right.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.480
Three things by which
I will defend myself.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.300
That's a great idea.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.330
Great thoughts there.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:36.495
Number one, I would say
that wouldn't be most of it.

00:46:36.495 --> 00:46:38.120
Yes, you're right in
saying that's part

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.320
of my argument
against secularism.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.710
But it's not the whole thing.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.530
So number one.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:43.410
That's a minor one.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.800
Number two, as you
know, not everybody

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:52.970
believes that groups
survive because they

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:57.390
learned to be altruistic and
to take care of each other.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:59.500
There is a huge amount
of debate about that.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.290
You say, if it could be shown,
well, it hasn't been yet.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.580
It might be.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.040
But even there, by the
way, you do know, do you

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:12.690
not, you might be
able to make the case,

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:17.390
for example, that people
in your clan or tribe

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:21.770
survive because they were
unselfish with each other.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.620
It is hard to know how
we came to the place

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.690
where, through
evolution, we actually

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:32.600
believe that it is good to
take care of anybody at all.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:39.325
In other words, my feeling
that it would be not only

00:47:39.325 --> 00:47:40.700
good to take care
of my own kind,

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.030
but to be kind to somebody
who's not my own kind, how could

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:47.990
that have ever allowed somebody
to survive in the past?

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:51.110
That's part of the debate that
white people are saying maybe

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:53.060
what you're saying
isn't provable.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.350
But here's the third thing.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.410
Even if it was true, even
if it comes to be proven,

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:02.030
all that proves is that it's
selfish to be unselfish.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:04.940
All that proves is not that
it's wrong to be unselfish,

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.520
but that it benefits
you to be unselfish.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.997
So in the end, it's a
selfish, pragmatic argument

00:48:10.997 --> 00:48:13.580
that doesn't say that it's wrong
to be unselfish, just that it

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.770
would be in your benefit.

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.860
See, I think most
of us believe not

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:23.420
that killing an innocent
person is practical.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.730
It's impractical.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.190
In other words, the best
that you could argue for

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:32.854
is that killing somebody else
or being unkind is impractical.

00:48:32.854 --> 00:48:33.770
We don't believe that.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:37.160
We believe it's wrong whether
it's practical or not.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.540
So in other words, evolution
can never give you an ought.

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.350
It can only give you
a what would work.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:45.080
In the end, it can only
support pragmatism,

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.020
and not the moral intuitions
that all the religions have,

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:51.272
that something's wrong whether
it's impractical or not.

00:48:51.272 --> 00:48:52.730
All you could do
is to say it would

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.597
be impractical to be unselfish.

00:48:54.597 --> 00:48:56.180
But in the end,
weirdly enough, you're

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:59.060
appealing to selfishness,
selfish motives,

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.620
to be unselfish.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.460
And this, by the way, Nietzsche
also took that idea apart.

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.860
He takes apart the
idea that you can

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.450
appeal to someone's
self-interest

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.280
to make them unselfish.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.090
You can appeal to their
desire to survive to teach

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:15.482
them to care for other people.

00:49:15.482 --> 00:49:16.940
In the end, it
doesn't really work.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.160
So I've got three objections.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:24.200
And yet, I want people
to have humanistic values

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.900
for any reason at all, frankly,
because it does make the world

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.590
a better place.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:32.845
So in the end, would religious
people like this approach?

00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:33.620
Yeah, I would.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.090
But I just try to show
you where I thought

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:36.460
there's still some holes in it.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.770
AUDIENCE: Well, we can
agree on that last part.

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:38.270
Thank you.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:39.080
TIM KELLER: OK.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.176
Yeah?

00:49:40.176 --> 00:49:42.050
AUDIENCE: So again,
thank you for being here.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.591
In addition to
filling out this room,

00:49:43.591 --> 00:49:45.305
we actually have
crowds in California

00:49:45.305 --> 00:49:48.287
and a number of our other global
offices that are tuning in.

00:49:48.287 --> 00:49:49.870
And so I just wanted
to take a minute.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:51.650
There's actually
several questions

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:52.940
that came in in [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:53.450
TIM KELLER: Good.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:55.158
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
write one that came

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:57.080
from Ambrose in California.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.270
And he asks about
technology and faith,

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.630
which I believe your church
has a initiative going on

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.764
in this area.

00:50:02.764 --> 00:50:04.430
He said, technology
has an immense power

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.770
to improve people's lives and
make a positive difference

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:10.334
in the world, which is why
many of us are here at Google.

00:50:10.334 --> 00:50:11.750
Does the Christian
world view have

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:14.930
an opinion about how
technology should be used?

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:19.010
Are there categories or problems
that technology can't solve,

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:22.040
or at least improve?

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.080
TIM KELLER: Well, I
think Langdon Gilkey--

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.610
I'd say Langdon
Gilkey would say--

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:29.030
that the basic selfishness
of the human heart, which

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.990
most of us don't see.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.530
It hides.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:34.830
He says, when you get into
a place like the Shantung

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:37.130
Compund-- when he
was in that compound,

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:43.560
and everybody was in close, he
says when it's about survival,

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:48.740
he says, very, very few
people are kind and open.

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:53.840
And he says, human beings
are so selfish and so out

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.320
for themselves, they
hide it from themselves

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.240
till push comes to shove.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.280
I don't know how this
technology changes that.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.170
In fact, what Gilkey actually
says-- what he actually says

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:11.900
is if you love yourself, if your
highest good is your own self,

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.400
then it's going to
make you selfish.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.500
If your highest
good is your people,

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.610
it'll make you a racist.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:18.109
If your highest
good is your family,

00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:21.350
it'll create patriarchy
and paternalism.

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:25.547
He says really the only way
that you can make decisions

00:51:25.547 --> 00:51:27.630
about right or wrong is
what is your highest good?

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:29.362
And if your highest
good isn't God,

00:51:29.362 --> 00:51:31.070
it's got to be one of
these other things.

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:33.028
And you're going to turn
that into an absolute.

00:51:33.028 --> 00:51:35.280
And that's going to
actually be another vehicle

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.540
for self-interest.

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:40.200
But not only belief in
God, but an experience

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.480
of the grace of God
can actually change

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:48.280
that inner self-absorption,
self-centered,

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:54.830
which is the reason for all
of the problems in the world.

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:56.610
And my friend,
just a minute ago,

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.400
I was trying to make the cases
that if the best thing you can

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:04.140
do is sort of harness it by
appealing to selfishness,

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.870
then you're really still
not going after the root.

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:09.270
What you're doing is
you're trimming it.

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.670
In fact, that's what
we do with our kids.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.340
Generally out of
selfishness, we teach

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:17.550
them to be unselfish
because frankly, it'll

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.532
get them where they want to go.

00:52:19.532 --> 00:52:21.240
I mean, I'm afraid a
lot of that happens.

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.670
To really get at the
root, according I

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:25.440
think as a Christian
minister, you're

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.330
going to need spiritual reasons.

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:31.680
Spiritual resources,
not just technology.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.870
Technology,
ultimately, is a tool.

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:34.830
But it's an instrument.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:35.790
It's a means.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.310
But it's not an end.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:39.570
You're going have to
decide what your end is.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:41.160
Yes, sir?

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.630
Were you going to
do some others?

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.100
Or was that?

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:44.850
OK, go ahead.

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:46.356
AUDIENCE: We have two minutes.

00:52:46.356 --> 00:52:46.980
TIM KELLER: OK.

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.282
AUDIENCE: OK, I'll be fast.

00:52:48.282 --> 00:52:49.740
Dr. Keller, I like
the way that you

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.380
talked about those who are
religious and those who

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.462
are secular and the
things that are actually

00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:56.670
very similar between them,
even though they might not

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:57.370
recognize it.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:59.070
TIM KELLER: Oh yeah.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.440
AUDIENCE: One of the things
that the tech community

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.900
in particular and the
broader community in general

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.860
has been focused on is gender
equality and gender balance.

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:10.270
And it's been a big struggle
in the tech community.

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.940
And I don't have a
perspective on this

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:15.000
from the Christian perspective.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.670
From an outside
point of view, a text

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:20.700
that talks about God
the father and Jesus

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:26.790
the son and the twelve apostles
has a very male perspective

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:27.360
on it.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.943
And I was kind of
curious if you could

00:53:28.943 --> 00:53:31.230
talk about how you see
the Christian community

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:34.290
and your fellowship struggling
with some of these things that

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:39.810
are interesting both to seculars
and people who are religious.

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.520
TIM KELLER: Did
you hear the lady?

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.487
Two minutes.

00:53:42.487 --> 00:53:44.070
AUDIENCE: In the
remaining 60 seconds.

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.361
TIM KELLER: You're not helping.

00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:46.290
[LAUGHING]

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:46.790
Gee.

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:52.830
Look, at the very
beginning of the bible,

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:59.400
it says God made humanity
in his own image.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.430
And then it says, male and
female, he created them.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:05.332
And there is
indications not only

00:54:05.332 --> 00:54:07.290
that obviously male and
female are both equally

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:08.850
made in the image of God.

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:13.780
But there's even maybe a hint--
though this is debatable--

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:17.040
there's even a hint that
male and female together

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.560
reflect all the
glories of God better

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.590
than either male or female.

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:25.230
What that would argue
for-- and this is basically

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:28.710
what I think
Christianity-- not all,

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:30.490
I mean, there's
great differences.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:32.190
I'm making this a
short answer so I

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.510
can take one more question.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:38.010
But basically, I think the
Christian approach would

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.920
be to say male and female
are equal, and not absolutely

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.750
interchangeable.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.000
In fact, a lot of feminism
would say, no, they're not.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.700
There is a female way to lead
that is going to be different.

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:50.400
That they are equal, but
they're not interchangeable.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.650
And yet, at the same
time, frankly, they

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:55.950
should be, they're
irreplaceable for each other.

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:59.400
In other words, each one
brings certain of God's glories

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.550
and strengths into a
process, into an event,

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.100
into a community the
other one can't bring.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.590
And because of that, we
desperately need each other.

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:09.930
So they're equal,
not interchangeable,

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:11.730
but equally important.

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.944
And actually, we're
interdependent.

00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:15.610
We really can't live
without each other.

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:17.276
And that's whether
we're married or not.

00:55:17.276 --> 00:55:23.700
We need to be into
communities where

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.620
both male and female
are using their gifts

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.210
and their abilities.

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:27.932
That's about it.

00:55:27.932 --> 00:55:29.640
Do you want to do that
one more question?

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.750
Or Barbara, do we
feel like we don't?

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:36.050
Yeah, do we have one more
from outside of the-- yeah,

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:37.010
and that'll be it.

00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:43.390
AUDIENCE: This is also
coming from Mountain View.

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:45.854
It says, I'm a twentysomething
Christian and an American.

00:55:45.854 --> 00:55:48.020
I'm often told by older
Christian friends and family

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.810
that America is becoming
increasingly secular.

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:52.940
Christian morality
is disappearing.

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:54.650
Society is degradating.

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:56.610
And we're at a perilous
point in history.

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:58.250
Do you think that's
a valid assessment?

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:00.500
Or should Christians
be concerned?

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.000
How do you think
Christians should

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.104
respond to cultural
shifts toward secularism?

00:56:04.104 --> 00:56:06.770
TIM KELLER: Well, we're in luck,
because that's an easy question

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.440
to answer, believe it or not.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.260
The point is that it's
both good and bad news.

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:15.920
The answer is I don't like
the full decline narrative.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.790
If God is in charge, and America
is getting more secular, then

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:22.770
God's got some good
purpose for that, OK?

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:26.240
And one of which I think
is to humble Christians

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.880
and say to some degree,
when we were more in power,

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.440
we didn't use our
power very well.

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.860
So it's time to really
rethink who we are

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.530
and what it means to
relate in the world.

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:39.210
So it's just not all bad news.

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:41.980
But on the other hand, it is
getting more secular, yes.

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:46.490
And the future will be, I
think, difficult for Christians

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:48.542
to adjust-- American
Christians--

00:56:48.542 --> 00:56:50.750
I'm so glad he said, I'm an
American and a Christian.

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:53.910
Because frankly, there's almost
nowhere else in the world

00:56:53.910 --> 00:57:00.380
where Christians
have this memory

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.567
of a sort of past influence.

00:57:03.567 --> 00:57:05.900
Because most everywhere else,
Christians are a minority.

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.180
And they learn how
to be good neighbors

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:12.189
and still to lift up what they
believe and still serve others.

00:57:12.189 --> 00:57:13.730
American Christians
are going to have

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.550
to humble themselves
and become, frankly,

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:18.980
better neighbors than they
have been in the past.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.420
And that's not bad news.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.670
But there will be some
sad things happen too.

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:25.560
There will be some things
lost in our culture too.

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.550
OK.

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:28.650
BARBARA: All right,
thank you, Dr. Keller.

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:29.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.750
Thank you all.

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:32.250
Awesome.

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:35.000
[APPLAUSE]
