00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:09.567
- Hi. My name's Jenny Martin

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:11.195
and I'm the Director of Cybersecurity

00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:13.633
Investigations at Symantec.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.211
Today cybercrime causes huge problems

00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:17.381
for society.

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:19.804
Personally, financially, and even

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:22.178
in matters of national security.

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:23.857
Just in the last few years,

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.754
hundreds of millions
of credit card numbers

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:27.031
have been stolen.

00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.213
Tens of millions of
social security numbers

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:31.881
and health care records were compromised.

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.769
Even nuclear centrifuges have been hacked

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.920
and unmanned aerial
drones have been hijacked.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.646
This is all done by
exploiting vulnerabilities

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:42.588
in hardware and software.

00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:44.422
Or more often by taking advantage of

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:46.565
unintentional decisions made by the people

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:48.649
using the software.

00:00:51.764 --> 00:00:53.766
The people committing these cybercrimes

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.542
don't fit a single profile or motivation.

00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:59.236
It could be anyone from an
international terrorist,

00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:02.254
to a teenager competing
for bragging rights.

00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:04.495
Today, the largest countries not only

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:06.469
have a regular army, but also have

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.918
a well-armed cyber army.

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:10.676
In fact, the next world war may not

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:12.248
be fought with traditional weapons

00:01:12.248 --> 00:01:14.096
but with computers, used to shut down

00:01:14.096 --> 00:01:17.141
national water supplies, energy grids,

00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:20.011
and transportation systems.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.100
- Hi. My name is Parisa

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.684
and I'm Google's Security Princess.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:27.247
I've worked on a lot of
different Google products

00:01:27.247 --> 00:01:31.044
in a lot of different ways
to try and make our software

00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:33.427
as secure as possible.

00:01:33.758 --> 00:01:35.406
Now let's take a look at how cybercrime

00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:37.055
works under the hood.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.121
We'll learn about software viruses,

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.790
denial-of-service attacks,
and phishing scams.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.328
In biology in life, a virus is an organism

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:47.374
that is spread by coughing, sneezing,

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:49.076
or physical contact.

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:51.298
Viruses work by infecting cells,

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:53.192
injecting their genetic material

00:01:53.192 --> 00:01:55.142
and using those cells to replicate.

00:01:55.142 --> 00:01:56.725
They can make people really sick

00:01:56.725 --> 00:01:59.038
and then spread to other people.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.085
A computer virus works a bit similarly.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:03.966
A virus is an executable program

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:07.064
that gets installed,
usually unintentionally,

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:09.678
and harms a user and their computer.

00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:12.050
It's also possible for
a virus to spread itself

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.177
to other computers.

00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:16.527
Now how does a virus get on your computer

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:17.970
in the first place?

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.197
There are couple ways an attacker

00:02:19.197 --> 00:02:21.221
can infect someone's computer.

00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:23.559
They might lure a victim
into installing a program

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.256
with deception about
the program's purpose.

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:28.725
So for example, a lot
of viruses are disguised

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:30.894
as security updates.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.269
It's also possible that the
software on your computer

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.588
has a vulnerability.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.542
So an attacker can install itself

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:39.509
without even needing explicit permission.

00:02:39.623 --> 00:02:41.604
Once a virus in on your computer

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:44.227
it can steal or delete any of your files,

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:46.961
control other programs,
or even allow someone else

00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:50.305
to remotely control your computer.

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.424
Using computer viruses,
hackers can take over

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.557
millions of computers worldwide.

00:02:56.557 --> 00:02:58.368
And then use them as a digital army,

00:02:58.368 --> 00:03:00.033
otherwise known as a botnet,

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:03.028
to attack and take down websites.

00:03:03.028 --> 00:03:04.428
This kind of attack is called

00:03:04.428 --> 00:03:07.140
a distributed denial-of-service.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.962
A denial-of-service is when hackers

00:03:08.962 --> 00:03:11.668
overwhelm a website
with too many requests.

00:03:11.668 --> 00:03:13.665
We call it a distributed denial-of-service

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:15.509
when the attack comes from many computers

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.343
all at once.

00:03:18.308 --> 00:03:19.875
Most websites are ready to respond

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.582
to millions of requests a day,

00:03:21.582 --> 00:03:23.716
but if you hit them with
billions or trillions

00:03:23.716 --> 00:03:26.067
of requests coming from different places,

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:29.379
the computers are overloaded
and stop responding.

00:03:30.472 --> 00:03:32.346
- Another trick used by cybercriminals

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:34.724
is to send large amounts of spam email

00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:36.419
in an attempt to trick people

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.624
into sharing sensitive
personal information.

00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:42.526
This is called a phishing scam.

00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:44.029
A phishing scam is when you get

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.380
what seems like a trustworthy email

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.633
asking you to login to your account,

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:51.966
but clicking the email
takes you to a fake website.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.328
If you login anyway, you've been tricked

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:56.772
into giving your password away.

00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:58.826
Hackers can then use
your login credentials

00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:00.614
to access your real accounts

00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:02.764
to steal information, or maybe even

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.799
to steal your money.

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.534
Fortunately there are many companies,

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:09.158
laws, and government organizations

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:11.341
working to make the internet safer.

00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:14.214
But these efforts are not enough.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.285
You may think when a
computer system gets hacked,

00:04:17.285 --> 00:04:19.212
the problem was the security design,

00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:20.930
or the software.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.368
90% of the time a system
gets hacked however,

00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:25.103
it's not because of a security bug,

00:04:25.103 --> 00:04:29.144
but because of a simple
mistake made by a human.

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.197
- It turns out there are
steps we can all take

00:04:33.197 --> 00:04:34.629
to protect ourselves.

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.508
Often, your actions not only impact

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:38.819
the security of your
own data and computer,

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.465
but the security of everyone

00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:43.406
at your school, workplace, and home.

00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:46.435
With billions or trillions
of dollars at stake,

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:48.468
cybercriminals get smarter each year,

00:04:48.468 --> 00:04:51.198
and we all need to keep up.
