00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.280
Scientists at New York University have discovered
a new pathway for stimulating nerve-insulating

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.650
myelin - which is damaged by Multiple Sclerosis
- that will hopefully lead to restoring and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.639
protecting nerve function.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.450
And VAMP is a solar-powered hypersonic entry
vehicle designed to collect data in the Earth-like

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.700
mid-cloud environment of Venus.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.880
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow! 100

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.690
Researchers in Sweden have created a cyborg
plant. A liquid solution that included a polymer

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.070
was sent through the xylem of the plant - forming
a solid wire that conducts electricity while

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.940
still allowing the plant to transport life-sustaining
water and nutrients. The xylem wires enable

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.710
organic electrochemical transistors to convert
chemical signals to electronic output, meaning

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.720
future uses could include storage systems
that convert sugar produced from photosynthesis

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.899
into electricity, all happening inside plants.
This video shows how they can change the color

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.390
of a leaf by manipulating the conductive material
inside.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.850
The Haptoclone lets you touch holograms. Telehaptics
allows users to send a holographic image that

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.500
another person can actually feel and interact
with. The box uses ultrasonic radiation pressure

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.080
to create the feeling of the holographic image,
but the produced force is generally weak.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.810
If it were strong enough to feel like a solid
object, the ultrasound would damage your nerves.&nbsp;

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.200
But the system allows you to virtually touch
fingers with someone in real time.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.070
A computer learning algorithm can detect liars.
Researchers at the University of Michigan

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.009
in Ann Arbor fed the algorithm 121 trial videos
that included speakers’ expressions and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.780
gestures, along with whether they were convicted
of perjury. It correctly identified the truth-tellers

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.729
75% of the time, with humans managing just
59.5%, and the very best interrogators reaching

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:58.770
65%.&nbsp;

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.829
Meanwhile, scientists in Bristol have developed
urine-powered microbial fuel cell socks. Based

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.170
on the circulatory system of fish, it doesn’t
require a powered pump like previous attempts

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.170
- all it needs is pee. They say it could serve
a ‘proof of life’ function for military

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.890
or outdoor gear because it’s capable of
transmitting a message wirelessly and only

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.069
functions if the person is alive and peeing.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.050
LaserPipe is a snake-arm robot that uses high-powered
lasers to weld stuff. So yeah.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.391
Finexus is a project that uses magnets on
fingertips to explore virtual worlds. The

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:39.900
fingernail-sized electromagnets are tracked
by magnetic sensors, and unlike amera-based

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.120
tracking systems it doesn't require a clear
view of your hands - and it’s much more

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.890
immersive way to perform VR input than a plastic
controller. Researchers from the University

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.900
of Washington are now focused on adding more
sensors and miniaturizing the system - possibly

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.300
by creating a glove filled with electromagnets
and a wristband to house the sensors.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.770
Plant Lamps provide light sources for people
living in the rainforest without using gasoline

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.280
or oil. They utilize the free electrons generated
from the oxidation process of plant-produced

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.430
nutrients in contact with microorganisms in
soil - to power the LED lamps. Which is awesome.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.170
Over the past five years Mind Blow has uncovered
several innovations that have gone on to experience

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.500
huge success, like Nest, a smart thermometer
featured in Mind Blow #51. Two years later

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.000
it was bought by Google for $3.2 billion dollars.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.519
We’ve also witnessed the very beginning
of ideas that were later implemented on a

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.620
massive scale. Mind Blow #39, uploaded in
April 2012, showcased the pizza button - a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.269
bluetooth fridge magnet from Red Tomato Pizza
that automatically ordered a VIP customer’s

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.280
favorite pizza. In 2015, Domino’s announced
emoji ordering - just Tweet them a pizza emoji

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.260
and your order is on the way.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.870
Various Augmented Reality systems have been
featured throughout the years, like Invoked

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.269
Computing which could turn household objects
input devices, GravitySpace, which tracked

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.500
users with a pressure-sensing floor, and KinEtre,
which animated everything. Well, Amazon was

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.579
just recently awarded patents for an augmented
reality system that projects images in a room

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.879
that users can interact with using gesture
controls.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.889
A concept for a smart highway highlighted
in Mind Blow #53 featured glow in the dark

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.090
lines that would absorb light and emit a glow
for 8-10 hours. After a trial in early 2014,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.169
changes were made due to rain affecting the
glowing lines and a new moisture-resistant

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.270
paint was used. The new smart highway finally
went public with glow in the dark lane markers

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.330
and a glowing bicycle path. There are now
plans to launch glowing lanes in Japan and

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.340
China.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.360
If you’ve watched all one hundred episodes
of Mind Blow, you’ve spent around seven

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.419
hours learning about stories which in just
one video range from New Blue Butt Monkey

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.710
and Acoustic Levitation to GPS Shoes and Tallest
Mohawk. If you’ve thought Mind Blow was

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.729
called Mind Blown this entire time…that
could be an example parapraxis - a slip that

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.979
occurs when the brain is trying to come up
with a word or name and simply selects what

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.749
it deems to be the best match.

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.540
But regardless of how you remember the name,
you’ve all come together to view Mind Blow

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:23.149
over 228 million times. So here’s to the
future of cutting edge science, here’s to

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:34.369
the next one hundred episodes - and as always
- thanks for watching.

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:41.050
Meat-flavored water? Pea butter. New toilet
that can flush golf balls? The N64 upside

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.279
down looks like a koala's face. A robot designed
to scratch your itch? An octopus chair? A

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:57.729
plasma ball watch? Edible spray paint? A beehive
for your apartment? A 27 pound lobster. A

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:04.149
dress boat? A one thousand dollar ice pop.
And this robotic bear pillow is designed to

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:09.350
tickle your face to prevent you from snoring.
And it produces contractions in the lower

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.010
intestines that relieve chronic constipation.
Hey kid, want a lollipop thermometer? And

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:23.300
a hummingbird feeder for your face. And guitar
pee. And a giant brain phone booth. And say

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.569
hello to the newly discovered blue butt monkey.
And a snake cake. And a one million dollar

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:40.379
gold vacuum with a rap song. A kid in New
Zealand recently found a chunk of whale poop

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:46.809
worth $65,000. Like the internet, anternet.
Here's the most detailed picture ever taken

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:52.639
of Uranus. Half bear half dog and extinct
for nine million years it's BearDog. Who's

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.240
hungry for a solid chocolate baby head? Newly
discovered loris? Check. Brand new species?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.459
Check. Extremely cute? Check. Venomous teeth?
Check. This is a hummingbird hawk moth. Bones

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:09.169
of a new dinosaur were found in Utah and they
kinda look like a cow and a triceratops had

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:15.120
a baby. Tweet Pee lets parents know when their
baby has peed. This robot tells you if you

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.830
have bad breath. I"m a moth and here I am.
I'm a moth and now I'm a tree. On land or

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:30.679
on sea. Amphibious RV. Sorry. It's a Mind
Blow. Wait, what's a Mind Blow? Ah, I've been

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:37.689
waiting for you, Vsauce. Vsauce, I've come
to protect Kevin from the T-1000. Uhh, Terminator?

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:43.490
I was just finishing Mind Blow. Come with
me if you want to live. I'm gonna leave you

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.460
with a biped robot that corrects its balance
if you push it. I'm gonna leave you with a

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.400
robotic ape transitioning from a quadrupedal
to a bipedal posture. I'm gonna leave you

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.129
with a thousand robot swarm that self-assembles
into shapes. I'm gonna leave you with a humanoid

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:02.889
robot autonomously playing the metallophone.
I'm gonna leave you with a gymnastic robot

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:08.639
landing a quadruple backflip off a bar. I'm
gonna leave you with a superhydrophobic knife

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:15.279
cutting a water droplet in half. And as always.
And as always. And as always - thanks for

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:20.749
watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for
watching. We'll see ya there. Come on! And

00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:33.719
what? Oh. Well. As always - thanks for watching.
