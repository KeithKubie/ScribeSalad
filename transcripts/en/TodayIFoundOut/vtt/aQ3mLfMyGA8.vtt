00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.369
Canadians boast longer lives, safer communities,
free nationalized healthcare, a cleaner environment,

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.259
the most gold medals in Olympic hockey, and,
of course, poutine.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.640
But, contrary to popular belief, one thing
they don’t do any different than their friends

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.940
to the south is make stronger beer.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.070
When you’re dealing with mainstream beers,
those with the highest alcohol are generally

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.899
stouts, porters and pale ales, with alcohol
by volume (ABV) contents typically ranging

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.969
between 4% and 10%, though most mainstream
beers tend to stay in the range of 4%-6%,

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.850
such as Canada’s popular Labatt (5% ABV),
which edges out the United States’ “favorite”

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.250
brew, Bud Light (4.2% ABV).

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.380
For a few more comparisons using ABV, we have
the U.S.’s Busch (4.6%), Coors Original

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.689
(5%), Old Milwaukee (5%), Bud Ice (5.5%),
Keystone (4.4%), Keystone Ice (5.9%), and

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.149
Budweiser (5%).

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.930
On the Canadian side, we have Carling Black
Label (4.7%), Grizzly Canadian Lager (5.4%),

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.170
Moosehead (5%), Labatt Ice (5.6%), O’Keefe
Canadian (4.9%), and Molson Canadian (5%).

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.570
However, some Americans prefer their beer
with a little extra kick, and United States

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.940
brewers have delivered.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.290
For instance, the kind people at Dogfish Head
make the 120 Minute IPA with an ABV of 20%,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.580
while the evil geniuses at Sam Adams have
created Utopias, a brew that boasts a whopping

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.200
27% ABV.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.490
Of course, Canadian brewers are no slouches
and their breweries have produced some hefty

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.750
quaffs, too, including Trafalgar’s Critical
Mass Double/Imperial IPA with its 17% ABV,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.700
and the aptly named but apparently discontinued
Korruptor (ABV 16%).

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.480
As you can see from this, both nations boast
brewers that make beers with a variety of

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.790
alcohol levels, but there really is very little
difference between the nations’ respective

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.040
brewers when you average them all out.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.140
This, perhaps, should not come as a surprise
as most would like to be able to drink several

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.840
beers while socializing or watching sporting
events, rather than become completely hammered

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.270
off just one or two beers.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.100
As a result, the sweet spot for this type
of recreational drinking tends to be in that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.860
4%-6% ABV range favored by brewers the world
over.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.850
At this point, you might be wondering where
the myth that Canadian beers contained significantly

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.849
more alcohol than beers made in the United
States came from.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.459
And, indeed, the U.S. also has the reputation
among other nations of having weak beers,

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.450
not just in comparison to Canada, despite
the alcohol levels in reality being pretty

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.500
similar on the whole to every other beer drinking
nation in the world.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.500
So what gives?

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.700
It is generally thought that this comes from
the fact that Canada (and most everywhere

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.349
else) lists the alcohol levels in their beers
by the aforementioned alcohol by volume (ABV).

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.560
As with many metrics, the United States initially
bucked the trend and went with alcohol by

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.440
weight (ABW)- the weight of the alcohol in
a drink divided by the total weight.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.660
The key thing to note here is that alcohol
is lighter than water (about 0.79 g/cc at

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.180
standard pressure and temperature vs. 1.0
g/cc of water).

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.730
The result is that the ABW in beers is going
to be equal to roughly 4/5 of the ABV.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.430
To illustrate, if you have a typical 12 ounce
bottle of beer that is listed at a 5% ABV,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.540
5% of that 12 ounces in the bottle is going
to be alcohol.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.489
On the other hand, take that same bottle,
but now list it by ABW and because alcohol

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.900
weighs about 4/5 of water, by weight, it’s
then only going to be about 4% of the total

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.550
weight of the beer in the bottle.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.519
It’s the same amount of alcohol in the bottle,
but if you don’t pay attention to whether

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.560
it’s ABV or ABW, one looks like less than
the other.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.290
With most beers in the United States classically
listing their beer by ABW, instead of ABV,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.819
this ultimately led to people thinking beer
from the United States had about 20% less

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.750
alcohol on average than their international
counterparts.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.190
Today, of course, most brewers in the United
States go with alcohol by volume, but the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:05:35.339
undeserved reputation for weaker beers has
endured nonetheless.
