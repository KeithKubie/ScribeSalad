so much of science culture to me seems

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770
so much of science culture to me seems
 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.670
so much of science culture to me seems
like a holdover from the last century

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680
like a holdover from the last century
 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.140

there is still this formalism that's

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
there is still this formalism that's
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.490
there is still this formalism that's
involved and and to some degree

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
involved and and to some degree
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.769

scientific formalism is really needed

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:15.779
scientific formalism is really needed
 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:16.880
scientific formalism is really needed
because the whole point of being a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890
because the whole point of being a
 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.800
because the whole point of being a
scientist is if you write a scientific

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
scientist is if you write a scientific
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.900
scientist is if you write a scientific
paper another scientist should be able

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
paper another scientist should be able
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.400
paper another scientist should be able
to read your paper and set up their

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
to read your paper and set up their
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.960
to read your paper and set up their
instrument just like yours and do

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
instrument just like yours and do
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880
instrument just like yours and do
exactly the same experiment and if

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
exactly the same experiment and if
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.109
exactly the same experiment and if
everything goes right they would get the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
everything goes right they would get the
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.669
everything goes right they would get the
same result you know point your

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679
same result you know point your
 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:29.870

telescope at this part of the sky

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

observe for this long and you're gonna

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
observe for this long and you're gonna
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500
observe for this long and you're gonna
see the same thing that I did at least

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
see the same thing that I did at least
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.980

you hope so and this formalism now is

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990
you hope so and this formalism now is
 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.660
you hope so and this formalism now is
something that we constantly stumble

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
something that we constantly stumble
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.760
something that we constantly stumble
over because I think scientists have

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
over because I think scientists have
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100
over because I think scientists have
made the mistake that the formalism is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
made the mistake that the formalism is
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.180
made the mistake that the formalism is
science

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
science
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.330
science
it is a tool it is a part of science and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
it is a tool it is a part of science and
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.030
it is a tool it is a part of science and
it's a useful tool but science itself is

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040
it's a useful tool but science itself is
 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.970
it's a useful tool but science itself is
an inquiry in its curiosity it is not a

scientific method people go about being
 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.050
scientific method people go about being
a scientist in many different ways with

a scientist in many different ways with
 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.110

connected to your work of being able to
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.149
connected to your work of being able to
convey that to an audience and I think

celebrated and yet as scientists we

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
celebrated and yet as scientists we

where we're blowing our own horn it's
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.249
where we're blowing our own horn it's
very unseemly to do this and I often run

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
very unseemly to do this and I often run
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.989
very unseemly to do this and I often run
into scientists that really resist

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999
into scientists that really resist
 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:56.389

science communicators like me trying to
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.849
science communicators like me trying to
help them visualize their science you

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859
help them visualize their science you
 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.919
help them visualize their science you
know I think about exoplanets planets

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929
know I think about exoplanets planets
 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.440
know I think about exoplanets planets
around other stars at this moment in

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
around other stars at this moment in
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.779
around other stars at this moment in
time we know of about 4000 planets going

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789
time we know of about 4000 planets going
 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.399
time we know of about 4000 planets going
around other stars in the sky

around other stars in the sky
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.249
around other stars in the sky
and we have some data on them the data

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
and we have some data on them the data
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380
and we have some data on them the data
is usually just what the mass of the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
is usually just what the mass of the
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.479
is usually just what the mass of the
planet is how big the planet is whether

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489
planet is how big the planet is whether
 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.100
planet is how big the planet is whether
the planet is solid or gaseous

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
the planet is solid or gaseous
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.310
the planet is solid or gaseous
but so often I run across scientists I

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320
but so often I run across scientists I
 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.230
but so often I run across scientists I
just want to present the graphs of their

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240
just want to present the graphs of their
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.360
just want to present the graphs of their
data and they get very upset when we

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
data and they get very upset when we
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.310
data and they get very upset when we
bring in artists very well-informed

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320
bring in artists very well-informed
 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.990
bring in artists very well-informed
artists by the way they work with the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
artists by the way they work with the
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.450
artists by the way they work with the
scientists and say well you know with

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460
scientists and say well you know with
 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.250
scientists and say well you know with
that size of a planet and that distance

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260
that size of a planet and that distance
 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.840
that size of a planet and that distance
from the star maybe you'd have an

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850
from the star maybe you'd have an
 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.210
from the star maybe you'd have an
atmosphere maybe would have clouds maybe

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220
atmosphere maybe would have clouds maybe
 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.190
atmosphere maybe would have clouds maybe
it even has water on the surface and we

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
it even has water on the surface and we
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.510
it even has water on the surface and we
always say we don't know these things

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
always say we don't know these things
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.930
always say we don't know these things
but this is based on scientific fact you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940
but this is based on scientific fact you
 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.000
but this is based on scientific fact you
know a lot of scientists really really

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
know a lot of scientists really really
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.460
know a lot of scientists really really
rebel when you try to actually make it

something visual and something emotional

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840
something visual and something emotional
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.890
something visual and something emotional
it doesn't seem to really be science if

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
it doesn't seem to really be science if
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.330
it doesn't seem to really be science if
you let that happen to me science is

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
you let that happen to me science is
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.580
you let that happen to me science is
going to die unless science becomes

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
going to die unless science becomes
