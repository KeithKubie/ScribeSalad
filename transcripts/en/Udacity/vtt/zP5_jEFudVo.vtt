00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
So let's see if we understand the types of partners and suppliers that are available

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.810
and remember, none of these come with a memo that says

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.670
they look exactly like these.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.720
Some of these might actually blur the lines,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.080
but let's take a look and see if we can understand

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.080
who would fit under strategic alliances, joint ventures,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.020
traffic partners, coopetition, joint business development, and suppliers.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.250
Match the type of relationship with each of these partnership examples.
