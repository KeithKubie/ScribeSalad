00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.520
The superhero genre has taken over the film
industry in recent years, thanks in no small

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.990
part to the spectacular action sequences at
the core of the movies.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.360
The impending release of Batman v Superman:
Dawn of Justice looks to continue that trend,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.270
as it features what might be the most anticipated
superhero brawl of all time.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.420
With the release of Captain America: Civil
War also in our very near future, we decided

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.480
to collect our favorite jaw dropping brawls
from the cinematic worlds of Marvel, DC, and

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.550
everything in between.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.810
In no particular order, here are Screen Rant’s
10 Mind Blowing Fights in Superhero Movies.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.810
SPIDERMAN VS.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.309
GREEN GOBLIN
The web crawler’s big screen debut launched

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.409
the superhero genre to new heights when it
became the first film in history to cross

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:56.570
the $100 million threshold in its opening
weekend at the box office.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.329
Featuring a star making performance from Tobey
Maguire — as well as a wonderfully hammy

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.370
villainous turn by Willem Dafoe — this breakout
hit crescendo in gritty fashion with a third

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.590
act showdown between the two arch nemeses.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.920
After managing to subdue the crazed Norman
Osborn, a badly injured Spiderman dodges an

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.060
underhanded glider attack at the last second,
and the Goblin pays the ultimate price for

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.610
his treachery.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.660
BIG DADDY VS.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.410
WAREHOUSE THUGS
Kick Ass had no shortage of insane fight sequences,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.810
and the ones featuring Chloe Moretz’s Hit
Girl were as fun and inventive as killing

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.390
sprees get, but it was Big Daddy’s warehouse
sequence that truly sent a chill down our

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.390
spine.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.420
Nicholas Cage’s performance as a murderous
masked vigilante was as over the top as you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.480
might expect, and his showdown with mobster
Frank D’Amico’s men was a particularly

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.910
violent visual treat.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.880
Set to the tune of John Murphy’s epic instrumental
track “In the House — In a Heartbeat,”

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.200
Big Daddy runs through the thugs with the
sort of brutal efficiency that would make

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.100
Batman himself proud.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.060
Except for the killing part.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.060
THE PUNISHER VS.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.310
THE RUSSIAN
The second of three attempts to bring the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.700
fan favorite antihero to life on the big screen
did not fare well, critically or financially.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.470
Despite an admirable effort from star Thomas
Jane, the film simply didn’t connect with

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.590
audiences.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.600
One of the lone bright spots of this grim
affair was this 4+ minute long brawl between

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.120
Frank Castle and The Russian, a mob enforcer
played by Kevin Nash.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.420
The 6’9 former professional wrestler brings
a true sense of physicality to the scene,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.120
and even though the fight has its silly moments,
it’s still one of Marvel’s most memorable

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.190
showdowns.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:44.480
Keep an eye out for an even more badass Punisher
in season 2 of Daredevil.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480
QUICKSILVER VS.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.170
PENTAGON SECURITY TEAM
Comic book fans were up in arms when the design

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.069
of Evan Peters’ Quicksilver was initially
unveiled on the cover of Empire Magazine.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.770
Despite bearing little resemblance to his
comic book counterpart, the speedster ended

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.810
up stealing the show with this innovative
slow-mo sequence.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.780
Folk legend Jim Croce’s “Time in a Bottle”
echoes in the background as “Peter” Maximoff

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.099
cleverly maneuvers the room at supersonic
speeds, dispatching of the security guards

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.240
and preventing his fellow mutants from being
riddled with bullets.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.880
Fingers crossed X-Men: Apocalypse features
more highlight reel Quicksilver scenes like

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.840
this one.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840
OZYMANDIAS VS.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.070
NITE OWL II AND RORSCHACH
Despite any criticisms cinephiles may level

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.600
at Batman v Superman director Zack Snyder,
it’s an indisputable fact that the man can

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.599
helm an action sequence like few others in
the industry.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.790
Fans got a taste of what they can expect out
from his Dark Knight’s fighting style in

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.150
this underrated 2009 adaptation of Watchmen.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.870
The film features a few solid brawls, but
the final showdown between Nite Owl II, Rorschach,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.900
and the mass murdering Ozymandias is particularly
stellar.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.102
The latter’s gradual reveal of his plot
to kill millions during the fight is a bit

00:03:51.102 --> 00:03:55.010
of an eye roller, until he mentions the fact
that the deed is already done and there truly

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.240
is no stopping him.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240
CAPTAIN AMERICA VS.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.020
THE WINTER SOLDIER
Easily one of the best films to come out of

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.200
the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far, Steve
Rogers’ second solo outing was a thrill

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.700
ride from start to finish.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.820
It’s almost unfair to single out one solitary
moment from the movie, but in our eyes, the

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.629
highway fight scene between the Captain and
his former best friend turned assassin takes

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:21.629
the cake.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.349
This expertly choreographed super soldier
melee is capped off by the film’s big reveal

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:33.520
— that Bucky Barnes is still very much alive
— one that adds an extra dimension to the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.520
proceedings.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.340
These two look to be fighting on the same
side again in Civil War, but we wouldn’t

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.200
be opposed to another physical altercation
or two.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200
BATMAN VS.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.139
BANE
Having appeared in more live action films

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.140
than any other modern superhero, you’d think
we’d have gotten a proper fight sequence

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.660
featuring the Caped Crusader before 2012.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.040
Widely hyped as the first time we’d see
the Batman taking on a worthy physical foe

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.560
on the big screen, his first battle against
Bane was a shocker for non comic fans who

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.490
never thought they’d see the Dark Knight
get manhandled like this.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.300
Fans of the 1993 Knight fall storyline probably
saw the back break coming a mile away, though.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.560
Batman of course manages to heal himself and
overcome his foe in the end, though not before

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.940
he was betrayed in epic fashion by the shadows
he once believed to be his and his alone.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.840
IRON MAN VS.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.350
THE HULK
The sequel to one of the most successful movies

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.190
of all time, Age of Ultron had an absurd standard
to live up to.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.900
And while it may not have improved on its
predecessor in any meaningful way, Whedon’s

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.780
Avengers follow up was still a smash hit with
critics and audiences alike, thanks in no

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.070
small part to this spectacular brawl.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.720
Fans had hoped to see Iron Man break out the
Hulk buster armor for years, and its live

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.880
action debut did not disappoint.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.910
Tony Stark’s upgraded suit eventually stops
the rampaging behemoth, but not before the

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.750
two tear apart a Wakandan city.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.240
Black Panther’s probably not going to be
too thrilled about that when he makes his

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.479
debut in Civil War.

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:02.479
SUPERMAN VS.

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.979
GENERAL ZOD
Zack Snyder’s second scene on this list

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.470
is also quite possibly the most controversial.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.980
While few would argue against the sheer visual
spectacle of watching two Kryptonians beat

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.720
the hell out of each other, the fact that
Metropolis was all but leveled in the process

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.660
bothered a lot of comic book fans.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.090
And even more were upset over Superman’s
decision to kill Zod in order to save the

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.520
lives of innocent bystanders.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.350
Both the battle and its murderous conclusionary
act will have MAJOR consequences in Batman

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.360
v Superman, of course.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.260
In fact, they could just be leading directly
into the most epic superhero battle of all

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.380
— though the jury’s still out on that
one.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.380
WOLVERINE VS.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.400
YAKUZA
Hugh Jackman’s unforgettable take on the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.820
hyper popular Marvel hero has lasted over
15 years now, and the creative well doesn’t

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.030
appear to be drying up anytime soon.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.979
The Wolverine was a substantial improvement
on Logan’s first solo outing, drawing on

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.590
the character’s comic book roots to serve
up a fresh take on the face of the X-Men franchise.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.930
This fight sequence aboard a high speed train
against a few insanely determined Yakuza was

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.810
eye openingly innovative, and deserved far
more praise than it received.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.460
That being said, the scene is not quite our
favorite locomotive based Marvel brawl…

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.960
What did you think of our list?

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.160
Will the Batman/Superman brawl have earned
its way on here when all is said and done,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.430
or will it be outshined by the Civil War showdown
between Captain America and Iron Man?
