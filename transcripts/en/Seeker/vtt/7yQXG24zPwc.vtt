00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.290
recently this happened capture confront
SpaceX launched its crew dragon marking

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.340
the first time that a commercially built
crew capsule launched from American soil

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.230
this is exciting all on its own but this
upcoming Soyuz launch could also mark

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.340
the end of an era and what could be the
last time Americans are sent to space in

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.900
a country other than their own
expedition 5960 is expected to launch on

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.130
march 14th from the balcony or
cosmodrome in kazakhstan ferrying the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.809
new crew to the ISS including astronauts
from October's failed abort mission the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.620
two astronauts in one cosmonaut will be
joining the crew already aboard the ISS

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.629
working on roughly 250 experiments to
further our understanding of the human

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.460
body test new technology and even try to
further wrap our brains around what time

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.949
means in space this latest mission will
be on a Soyuz ms 12 spacecraft carrying

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.960
a three-person crew alexey ovchinin of
the russian space agency Roscosmos NASA

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.250
astronauts Christina hammock coke and
Nick Hague 4ov Keenan and Hague this is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.049
their second attempt to make it to the
ISS on October 11th 2018 the pair were

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.830
headed for a routine trip to the space
station on a Soyuz rocket but two

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.189
minutes after liftoff a problem occurred
during the separation of one of the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.360
Rockets strap-on boosters forcing them
to perform an emergency landing via

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.490
ballistic re-entry which sounds scary
and is scary but it's actually the only

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.180
way astronauts used to re-enter at the
beginnings of human space travel

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.810
since then ovchinin and Hague have been
retrained and are prepared for

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.400
expedition 59 60 we got in touch with
Hague currently stationed in Star City

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.619
Russia
and spoke to him about his feelings of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.869
heading back after only a few months
well you know if you asked me a year ago

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.829
if I'd be in this position I could have
never imagined it so it's a little bit

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.950
surreal being able to have another
opportunity this quickly but I feel very

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.630
fortunate for the opportunity to be able
to get up there and you know finally get

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.810
to doing the mission that I've been
training for at NASA for the last five

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.079
years
expedition 5960 will be making history

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.770
as they will be on board when the first
Commercial Crew vehicles are scheduled

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.910
to arrive at the ISS having launched
from Cape Canaveral in Florida do you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.020
hasn't launched astronauts into space
from its own soil since 2011

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.160
since then astronauts have been ferried
to and from Earth via Russian Soyuz

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.900
rockets but this agreement is due to run
out by the end of 2019 now there's a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.080
chance that they may have the
opportunity to buy more seats but the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.280
overall goal is to get back to launching
from the US so why did the u.s. stop

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.790
ferrying its astronauts to space
officially named the space

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.600
transportation system NASA's Space
Shuttle program had its first flight on

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.190
April 12th 1981 the space shuttle
program was the world's first reusable

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.840
rocket shuttling astronauts repairing
satellites and even helping to build the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.750
ISS during its reign the program had
five space shuttles that flew a total of

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.550
135 missions but by 2011 one estimate
put the average cost per trip to roughly

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.490
1.5 billion dollars so after 30 years of
service NASA decided to retire the

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.480
program since then the US has been
entirely dependent on Russia as the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.250
Soyuz is the only spacecraft available
to transport crews to the ISS and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.959
they're pretty reliable the Soyuz is the
longest operational manned spacecraft in

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.690
history although it's expensive the u.s.
currently pays 81 million dollars per

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.060
seat for its astronauts two hits arrive
which is why in 2014 NASA decided to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.110
spend its coin in the private sector
awarding both SpaceX and Boeing with

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.459
contracts to build spacecraft that could
shuttle astronauts in the long term this

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.020
also means that NASA has more resources
available to tackle challenges like deep

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.010
space exploration and getting to Mars to
be ready for the task

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.590
SpaceX built its crew Dragon spacecraft
that sits atop a falcon 9 its first test

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.300
flight dubbed demonstration 1 launched
on March 2nd from Kennedy Space Center

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.190
making history as the first commercially
made American spacecraft and rocket to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.480
launch from the US after a day in
Earth's orbit the capsule successfully

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.620
docked into the ISS delivering its
spacesuit sensor wearing test device

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.670
named Ripley and roughly 180 kilograms
of supplies

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.630
it remained docked for roughly five days
before making its descent back to earth

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.520
splashing down into the Atlantic Ocean
the other contract was awarded to Boeing

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.000
who cst-100
our liner capsule is scheduled for its

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.100
uncrewed test launch in April 2019 star
liner is designed to be reused at least

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.170
ten times within the span of six months
SpaceX and Boeing are continuing tests

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.400
but both have committed to manned space
missions for later this year nASA has

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.970
already assigned the crew that will be
heading up on these historic flights and

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.960
although crew dragon and star liner are
built to carry seven passengers for

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.680
these first operational missions they'll
carry only four crew members along with

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.120
roughly 100 kilograms of cargo by having
different launch capabilities it

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.530
provides more launch options when
needing to replan an aborted launch like

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.340
what happened to option and and Hague
back in October this is going to make

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.510
the the program much more robust by
having multiple means to launch from

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.530
whether it's the US whether it's Boeing
or whether it's space X or or whether

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.670
it's on a Soyuz we've got all these ways
to deliver crews so that if we do have a

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.960
problem we're more resilient and we
don't have to bring down the size of the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.170
crew of the station and put a you know a
damper on the the research and we can

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.620
continue to move forward at the pace
that we want to because at the end of

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.090
the day it's also about the really cool
science happening on board the ISS right

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.010
now there are roughly 250 scientific
experiments stationed aboard send up on

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.390
previous missions from different space
agency partners looking to study various

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.500
aspects of life in space these
experiments include how to grow food and

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.940
microgravity or monitoring lightning
from space that happens every second or

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.620
how astronauts experience bone density
loss during expeditions before heading

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.920
up the astronauts get training so
they're able to handle the experiments

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.430
and they can even volunteer for them
like the airway monitoring program sent

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.270
up by European Space Agency to help
study astronauts loan function on the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.920
ISS the study looks at the nitric oxide
the astronauts breathe out which helps

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.880
in understanding the conditions of our
lungs in space monitoring nitric oxide

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.510
levels helps to detect inflammatory
diseases in the lungs like asthma

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.260
previous crews of astronauts have
volunteered for the experiment like

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.630
German ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst and
we also found that spaceflight triggers

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.340
a little bit the reaction of the lungs
that are very close to what people have

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.230
when they have asthma so we can still
breathe freely in space

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.000
it's not really stopping us from working
and living there but we can still use

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.260
that little change to measure that right
and we can understand it better because

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.470
we are in a much more controlled
environment than it's possible down here

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.730
on earth for expedition 59 60
Nick Hague volunteered to be the human

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.590
test subject for the experiment so the
benefit is when we get to the surface of

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.730
the Moon and there's dust and we know we
had problems with lunar dust back in the

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.240
Apollo program we're going to be able to
monitor the health of the astronauts

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.930
even better while they're working up
there and and diagnose problems and

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.620
protect us while we're exploring the
moon space is not easy it's a it's a

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.490
risky business it's always going to be a
risky business but why do we do it

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.660
we've been up there for two decades on
the space station in this amazing

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.310
international collaboration performing
science collecting data so the

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.270
scientists on the ground can learn more
about our planet

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.550
they can learn more about humans in our
bodies and and how they behave they can

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.150
learn more about the universe that
surrounds us and and all of that is

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.640
advancing humanity and so we accept
those risks so that we can continue to

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.040
move forward and continue to expand the
boundaries of what we know that's it's a

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.880
vital mission and we're doing it every
day and I want people to when they see a

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.660
launch like that I want them to connect
that launch with the importance of the

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:08.120
mission and that's just it there are so
many launches happening every year so

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.170
many historic moments that aren't to be
missed which is why we're committed to

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.830
bringing you more launch coverage than
ever before that means we'll be there to

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.980
talk about the next crew Dragon launch
Boeing Starliner

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.460
and the latest International moon
missions if there's anything you'd like

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.330
us to cover on future missions let us
know down in the comments and as always

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.550
thanks for watching seeker and I'll see
you next time
