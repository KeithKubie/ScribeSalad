something because you just don't want to
 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.860
something because you just don't want to
use the app anymore and then you know

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870
use the app anymore and then you know
 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.509

seconds later the actual next screen
 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.930
seconds later the actual next screen
just shows up randomly because the the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940
just shows up randomly because the the
 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.640
just shows up randomly because the the
splash screen hasn't recognized that

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650
splash screen hasn't recognized that
 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.110
splash screen hasn't recognized that
you've backed out of it so it's just

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120
you've backed out of it so it's just
 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.449
you've backed out of it so it's just
that there are so many things that can

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459
that there are so many things that can
 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.890
that there are so many things that can
go wrong with splash screens and there's

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
go wrong with splash screens and there's
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.020
go wrong with splash screens and there's
a very poor user experience just don't

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030
a very poor user experience just don't
 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.810
a very poor user experience just don't
use them at all all right I think we

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820
use them at all all right I think we
 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.970
use them at all all right I think we
covered

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980
covered
 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.490

we've beaten that dead horse or whatever

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500
we've beaten that dead horse or whatever
 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.550
we've beaten that dead horse or whatever
I'm really better all right anyway let's

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560
I'm really better all right anyway let's
 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.650
I'm really better all right anyway let's
move on so the next thing is we wanted

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660
move on so the next thing is we wanted
 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.420
move on so the next thing is we wanted
to cover is tutorials so we're gonna

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430
to cover is tutorials so we're gonna
 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.950
to cover is tutorials so we're gonna
spend some time talking about a couple

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960
spend some time talking about a couple
 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.230
spend some time talking about a couple
of main sections of onboarding I mean

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240
of main sections of onboarding I mean
 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.880
of main sections of onboarding I mean
parts to onboarding the first will be

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890
parts to onboarding the first will be
 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.890
parts to onboarding the first will be
tutorials and we'll talk about login

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900
tutorials and we'll talk about login
 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.720
tutorials and we'll talk about login
flow and then finally I think we'll talk

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730
flow and then finally I think we'll talk
 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.570
flow and then finally I think we'll talk
about on-screen overlays so for

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580
about on-screen overlays so for
 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.030
about on-screen overlays so for
tutorials one thing before we jump into

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040
tutorials one thing before we jump into
 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.500
tutorials one thing before we jump into
all the details we do want to mention

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510
all the details we do want to mention
 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.380
all the details we do want to mention
that there is a pretty good coverage of

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390
that there is a pretty good coverage of
 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.720
that there is a pretty good coverage of
a lot of these things in the Android

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730
a lot of these things in the Android
 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.880
a lot of these things in the Android
design guide so if you visit this link

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890
design guide so if you visit this link
 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.010
design guide so if you visit this link
here you'll you'll see kind of these

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020
here you'll you'll see kind of these
 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.560
here you'll you'll see kind of these
specifics on on when and when not to

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570
specifics on on when and when not to
 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.790
specifics on on when and when not to
show unsolicited help

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800
show unsolicited help
 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.530
show unsolicited help
so tutorials are one of those examples

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540
so tutorials are one of those examples
 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.080
so tutorials are one of those examples
of unsolicited help basically help that

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090
of unsolicited help basically help that
 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.250
of unsolicited help basically help that
you're kind of pushing to the user

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260
you're kind of pushing to the user
 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.250
you're kind of pushing to the user
without them actively requesting for

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260
without them actively requesting for
 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.200
without them actively requesting for
requesting it rather so we very clearly

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210
requesting it rather so we very clearly
 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.150
requesting it rather so we very clearly
kind of advise against it you know

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160
kind of advise against it you know
 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.590
kind of advise against it you know
they're interruptions they're usually

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600
they're interruptions they're usually
 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.050
they're interruptions they're usually
not necessary and so on and so generally

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060
not necessary and so on and so generally
 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.920
not necessary and so on and so generally
you know this is something that's

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930
you know this is something that's
 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.560
you know this is something that's
covered in our guidelines but you know

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570
covered in our guidelines but you know
 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.000
covered in our guidelines but you know
besides I wanted to kind of add

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010
besides I wanted to kind of add
 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.910
besides I wanted to kind of add
additional color I guess to to some of

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920
additional color I guess to to some of
 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.050
additional color I guess to to some of
these guidelines and kind of explain

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060
these guidelines and kind of explain
 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.960
these guidelines and kind of explain
some of them and the reasoning for them

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970
some of them and the reasoning for them
 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.450
some of them and the reasoning for them
so one of the first things that you

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460
so one of the first things that you
 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.670
so one of the first things that you
should you know think about is you know

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680
should you know think about is you know
 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.170
should you know think about is you know
there's a comfort there's a couple of

there's a comfort there's a couple of
 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.510
there's a comfort there's a couple of

need to kind of go through before you
 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.510
need to kind of go through before you
get into the app and we'll talk about

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520
get into the app and we'll talk about
 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.040

thing that you shouldn't do and the
 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.060
thing that you shouldn't do and the
reason that you shouldn't do them is

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070
reason that you shouldn't do them is
 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.970
reason that you shouldn't do them is
generally that you know it's it's a sign

generally that you know it's it's a sign
 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.400
generally that you know it's it's a sign
that you actually may need to simplify

that you actually may need to simplify
 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.780
that you actually may need to simplify
your app maybe there's too much going on

maybe your app is just not simple enough
 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.890
maybe your app is just not simple enough
and so certainly that it's it's

start caring about this at this point we
 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.170
start caring about this at this point we
actually show this card or this this uh

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180
actually show this card or this this uh

this is how I would probably use the app

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560
this is how I would probably use the app
 

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.329
this is how I would probably use the app
and then obviously screenshots you know

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:30.339
and then obviously screenshots you know
 

00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:31.530
and then obviously screenshots you know
screenshots are a really good way to

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:31.540

especially if you're doesn't

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:35.270
especially if you're doesn't
 

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.450
especially if you're doesn't
your UI design is very good and very

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:37.460
your UI design is very good and very
 

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.580
your UI design is very good and very
clear it can emit you can immediately

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:39.590
clear it can emit you can immediately
 

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.260
clear it can emit you can immediately
kind of understand what the app does and

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:41.270
kind of understand what the app does and
 

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.370
kind of understand what the app does and
how it works just by looking at the

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:42.380
how it works just by looking at the
 

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.020
how it works just by looking at the
screenshot one thing I would say on the

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.030
screenshot one thing I would say on the
 

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.230
screenshot one thing I would say on the
screenshots as well is be careful the

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240
screenshots as well is be careful the
 

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.700
screenshots as well is be careful the
order you put them in quite often I'll

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:48.710
order you put them in quite often I'll
 

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.560
order you put them in quite often I'll
see screenshots uploaded for an

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:50.570
see screenshots uploaded for an
 

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.150
see screenshots uploaded for an
application and it seems like they're in

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160
application and it seems like they're in
 

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.740
application and it seems like they're in
the order in which you might go through

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:53.750
the order in which you might go through
 

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.650
the order in which you might go through
the application so in some apps I've

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:56.660
the application so in some apps I've
 

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.630
the application so in some apps I've
even seen you know a splash screen like

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640
even seen you know a splash screen like
 

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.100
even seen you know a splash screen like
that motor this is the first screenshot

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.110
that motor this is the first screenshot
 

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.110
that motor this is the first screenshot
and then the login screen and then maybe

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120
and then the login screen and then maybe
 

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.940
and then the login screen and then maybe
further down the line perhaps you know

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:03.950
further down the line perhaps you know
 

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.770
further down the line perhaps you know
once you have into the actual content

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:05.780
once you have into the actual content
 

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.270
once you have into the actual content
within the application and that's a real

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:07.280
within the application and that's a real
 

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.070
within the application and that's a real
shame because well as you can see here

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:09.080
shame because well as you can see here
 

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.690
shame because well as you can see here
and I screenshot from the year from the

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:10.700
and I screenshot from the year from the
 

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.880
and I screenshot from the year from the

this is even more exaggerated when

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:14.870
this is even more exaggerated when
 

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.420
this is even more exaggerated when
you're on a device so you'll probably

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:16.430
you're on a device so you'll probably
 

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.860
you're on a device so you'll probably
see the video maybe one screenshot

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:17.870
see the video maybe one screenshot
 

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.540
see the video maybe one screenshot
perhaps half with the second one coming

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:19.550
perhaps half with the second one coming
 

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.460
perhaps half with the second one coming

empty state they wanted to be
populated right so one of the ways in

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760
populated right so one of the ways in
 

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.650
populated right so one of the ways in
which you could do that is you could

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660
which you could do that is you could
 

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.810
which you could do that is you could
just simply use that empty state for in

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820
just simply use that empty state for in
 

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.610
just simply use that empty state for in
all sorts of things in this example this

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620
all sorts of things in this example this

seeing the full populated list so that

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:03.840
seeing the full populated list so that
 

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.940
seeing the full populated list so that
and it's very easy to do from a

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:04.950
and it's very easy to do from a
 

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.110
and it's very easy to do from a
development standpoint you basically

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120
development standpoint you basically
 

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.180
development standpoint you basically
just provide an empty view for the list

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:08.190
just provide an empty view for the list
 

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.830
just provide an empty view for the list
yeah quite commonly you might imagine

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:09.840
yeah quite commonly you might imagine
 

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.990
yeah quite commonly you might imagine
well quite often I see screens which

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000
well quite often I see screens which
 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.490
well quite often I see screens which
might be like this on the left but it's

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500
might be like this on the left but it's
 

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.050
might be like this on the left but it's
just empty screen with maybe a small

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060
just empty screen with maybe a small
 

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.460
just empty screen with maybe a small

plus in the action bar and as such a
 

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.620
plus in the action bar and as such a
missed opportunity yeah one thing I will

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:18.630
missed opportunity yeah one thing I will
 

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.450
missed opportunity yeah one thing I will
say here is that there's just a bit too

kind of didn't do that anyway so let's

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:31.830
kind of didn't do that anyway so let's
 

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.370

to login all together and that's offered

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:48.750
to login all together and that's offered
 

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.450
to login all together and that's offered
quite quite neatly I think by and the

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460
quite quite neatly I think by and the
 

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.220
quite quite neatly I think by and the
Google+ sign-in so if you choose to go

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:52.230
Google+ sign-in so if you choose to go
 

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.440
Google+ sign-in so if you choose to go
down that route and you only have a

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:54.450
down that route and you only have a
 

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.230
down that route and you only have a
popular web property if you the user

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240
popular web property if you the user
 

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.760
popular web property if you the user
signs in on the web properties in the

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:58.770
signs in on the web properties in the
 

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.680
signs in on the web properties in the
same Google+ account it'll actually pop

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:00.690
same Google+ account it'll actually pop
 

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.150

is you know how do we it's always about
 

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.320
is you know how do we it's always about
the funnel right how do we maximize the

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:24.330
the funnel right how do we maximize the
 

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.880
the funnel right how do we maximize the
fun how do we you know minimize the

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:25.890
fun how do we you know minimize the
 

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.590
fun how do we you know minimize the
roadblocks and the funnel this is one of

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600
roadblocks and the funnel this is one of
 

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.500
roadblocks and the funnel this is one of
the best ways to do that cool so that's

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:30.510
the best ways to do that cool so that's
 

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.680

view or something like that which might
 

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.120
view or something like that which might
have you know worse kind of data entry

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.130
have you know worse kind of data entry
 

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.100
have you know worse kind of data entry
and form filling kind of capabilities so

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:52.110
and form filling kind of capabilities so
 

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.960
and form filling kind of capabilities so
I definitely urge you to kind of include

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:53.970
I definitely urge you to kind of include
 

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.640

a pick from the list if you want then do
 

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.470
a pick from the list if you want then do
suggest one thing to be wary of I've

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480
suggest one thing to be wary of I've
 

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.880
suggest one thing to be wary of I've
seen some implementations of this where

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:12.890
seen some implementations of this where
 

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.520
seen some implementations of this where
they just you know see if there's

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:15.530
they just you know see if there's
 

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.659
they just you know see if there's
already an email address on the device

00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:16.669
already an email address on the device
 

00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:18.280
already an email address on the device
and then you're just pre-fill it but

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:18.290
and then you're just pre-fill it but
 

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.840
and then you're just pre-fill it but
they don't let you pick so we kind of

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:19.850
they don't let you pick so we kind of
 

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.880
they don't let you pick so we kind of
like isn't great for users if you have

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:21.890
like isn't great for users if you have
 

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.350
like isn't great for users if you have
more than one account on the device so

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360
more than one account on the device so
 

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.820
more than one account on the device so
definitely let them switch between

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:24.830
definitely let them switch between
 

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.830
definitely let them switch between
multiple accounts if they have that but

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840
multiple accounts if they have that but
 

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.270
multiple accounts if they have that but
yeah already this has got so much easier

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:28.280
yeah already this has got so much easier
 

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.430
yeah already this has got so much easier
just with a couple of key taps I can

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440
just with a couple of key taps I can
 

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.260
just with a couple of key taps I can
just pick from this list here and one of

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:32.270
just pick from this list here and one of
 

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.310
just pick from this list here and one of
the things that one of the questions

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320
the things that one of the questions
 

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.510
the things that one of the questions
that they're actually we discussed

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520
that they're actually we discussed
 

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.490
that they're actually we discussed
earlier was how do you actually show

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:36.500
earlier was how do you actually show
 

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.409
earlier was how do you actually show
this list right you know do you show an

00:21:38.409 --> 00:21:38.419
this list right you know do you show an
 

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:40.120
this list right you know do you show an
additional affordance to pick and

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.130
additional affordance to pick and
 

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.520
additional affordance to pick and
certainly if you use the Google Play

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:42.530
certainly if you use the Google Play
 

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.860
certainly if you use the Google Play
services SDK there's actually something

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:44.870
services SDK there's actually something
 

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.169
services SDK there's actually something
called account picker that's a dialog

00:21:47.169 --> 00:21:47.179
called account picker that's a dialog
 

00:21:47.179 --> 00:21:48.549
called account picker that's a dialog
that pops up and that actually doesn't

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559
that pops up and that actually doesn't
 

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.950
that pops up and that actually doesn't
require any permissions and so if you

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960
require any permissions and so if you
 

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.450
require any permissions and so if you
want to show like the account picker

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.460
want to show like the account picker
 

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.190
want to show like the account picker
dialog you could have a good additional

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200
dialog you could have a good additional
 

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.810
dialog you could have a good additional
button next to this field rather than a

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:55.820
button next to this field rather than a
 

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.430
button next to this field rather than a
drop-down but if you do this has to go

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440
drop-down but if you do this has to go
 

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.730
drop-down but if you do this has to go
for a drop-down which is also very nice

00:21:59.730 --> 00:21:59.740
for a drop-down which is also very nice
 

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.810
for a drop-down which is also very nice
the way I'd probably do this is you know

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:01.820
the way I'd probably do this is you know
 

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.669
the way I'd probably do this is you know
as soon as the text field is focused

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679
as soon as the text field is focused
 

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:06.190
as soon as the text field is focused
drop down the list and then you know as

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200
drop down the list and then you know as
 

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.289
drop down the list and then you know as
it loses focus you know collapse that

00:22:08.289 --> 00:22:08.299
it loses focus you know collapse that
 

00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:10.690
it loses focus you know collapse that
list as an alternative you could have

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:10.700
list as an alternative you could have
 

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.909
list as an alternative you could have
like an additional kind of spinner type

00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919
like an additional kind of spinner type
 

00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:14.740
like an additional kind of spinner type
affordance on the side that pops up the

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:14.750
affordance on the side that pops up the
 

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.600
affordance on the side that pops up the
list but generally you know it's

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:16.610
list but generally you know it's
 

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.039
list but generally you know it's
probably best to just show the list

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:18.049
probably best to just show the list
 

00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:19.600
probably best to just show the list
immediately and I think that's that may

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:19.610
immediately and I think that's that may
 

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.460
immediately and I think that's that may
be how the autocomplete stuff works by

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:21.470
be how the autocomplete stuff works by
 

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.460
be how the autocomplete stuff works by
default but not not quite sure

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:24.470
default but not not quite sure
 

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.040

great cool another sign oh we've hit it

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.050
great cool another sign oh we've hit it
 

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.530
great cool another sign oh we've hit it
we've added here is to prefer email to

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:29.540
we've added here is to prefer email to
 

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.510
we've added here is to prefer email to
usernames I don't know about you but I

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520
usernames I don't know about you but I
 

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.610
usernames I don't know about you but I
just find when I'm forced to pick like a

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:33.620
just find when I'm forced to pick like a
 

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.990
just find when I'm forced to pick like a
username rather than just using my email

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.000
username rather than just using my email
 

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.370
username rather than just using my email
address it's just another thing I'm not

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:36.380
address it's just another thing I'm not
 

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.890
address it's just another thing I'm not
going to remember whereas you know it

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:38.900
going to remember whereas you know it
 

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.480
going to remember whereas you know it
all comes back to email at the end of

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:40.490
all comes back to email at the end of
 

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.950
all comes back to email at the end of
the day anyway so you can reset it and

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:41.960
the day anyway so you can reset it and
 

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.440
the day anyway so you can reset it and
so forth so the worst is when there is a

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:44.450
so forth so the worst is when there is a
 

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.330
so forth so the worst is when there is a
service where the username is your email

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:46.340
service where the username is your email
 

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.340
service where the username is your email
and it says username like just say email

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:48.350
and it says username like just say email
 

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.660
and it says username like just say email
like just ask for the person's email

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:49.670
like just ask for the person's email
 

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.270
like just ask for the person's email
absolutely and yeah and it works really

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:52.280
absolutely and yeah and it works really
 

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.770
absolutely and yeah and it works really
really well on Android because you be

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:53.780
really well on Android because you be
 

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.570
really well on Android because you be
able to query their device for no ones

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:55.580
able to query their device for no ones
 

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:00.420
able to query their device for no ones
as well okay so next up with passwords

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:00.430
as well okay so next up with passwords
 

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.040
as well okay so next up with passwords
so we've said here like make it optional

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.050
so we've said here like make it optional
 

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.220
so we've said here like make it optional
so you can either you know just not

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:06.230
so you can either you know just not
 

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.710
so you can either you know just not
require users to enter a password you

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720
require users to enter a password you
 

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.020
require users to enter a password you
could do something like auto-generating

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.030
could do something like auto-generating
 

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.430
could do something like auto-generating
one like pre fill it in and let them

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440
one like pre fill it in and let them
 

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.290
one like pre fill it in and let them
slide code or something like that you

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:14.300
slide code or something like that you
 

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.670
slide code or something like that you
could just say it's optional some users

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:15.680
could just say it's optional some users
 

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.380
could just say it's optional some users
will want to set it some users might not

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:17.390
will want to set it some users might not
 

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.540
will want to set it some users might not
but my preferred option would be just to

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:19.550
but my preferred option would be just to
 

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.370
but my preferred option would be just to
probably admit it all together I mean

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:21.380
probably admit it all together I mean

I'm probably going to enter something

I'm probably going to enter something
very weak or very quick in anyway I'd

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:24.890
very weak or very quick in anyway I'd
 

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.680
very weak or very quick in anyway I'd
rather just you know it's in the

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:29.900
secure or something like that and then I
 

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.090

can always just hit there you know

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:31.100
can always just hit there you know
 

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.160
can always just hit there you know
forgot password or reset button should I

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.170
forgot password or reset button should I
 

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.590
forgot password or reset button should I
really you know want to get access to

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600
really you know want to get access to
 

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.000
really you know want to get access to
that password or you know getting any

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.010
that password or you know getting any

that password or you know getting any
I've forgotten that somehow same and

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:38.570
I've forgotten that somehow same and
 

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:39.760
I've forgotten that somehow same and
maybe later when you're on your desktop

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:39.770
maybe later when you're on your desktop
 

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.560
maybe later when you're on your desktop
when you have a real keyboard you can

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:41.570
when you have a real keyboard you can
 

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.120
when you have a real keyboard you can
get that email and actually fill out a

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:43.130
get that email and actually fill out a
 

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.530
get that email and actually fill out a
real password or something like that

real password or something like that
 

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.270
real password or something like that
yeah get the email I click here to

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:46.280
yeah get the email I click here to
 

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.550
yeah get the email I click here to
actually set a password so thinking back

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:48.560
actually set a password so thinking back
 

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.320
actually set a password so thinking back
through that kind of funnel an allergy

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:50.330
through that kind of funnel an allergy
 

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.460
through that kind of funnel an allergy
like how many people are gonna get

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:51.470
like how many people are gonna get
 

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.630
like how many people are gonna get

anyway by suggesting something in a bunt

00:23:59.440 --> 00:23:59.450
anyway by suggesting something in a bunt
 

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.510
anyway by suggesting something in a bunt
hit sign up you've got to imagine that

the funnel isn't a lot better for this

the funnel isn't a lot better for this
one thing I wanted to add is I guess

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360
one thing I wanted to add is I guess
 

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.810
one thing I wanted to add is I guess
with passwords one of the one of my

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:07.820
with passwords one of the one of my
 

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.850
with passwords one of the one of my
biggest pet peeves is when there's like

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:09.860
biggest pet peeves is when there's like
 

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.800
biggest pet peeves is when there's like
passwords that require symbols and

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:11.810
passwords that require symbols and
 

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.080
passwords that require symbols and
capital letters and and all this stuff

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.090
capital letters and and all this stuff
 

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.150
capital letters and and all this stuff
and generally you know people it's a bad

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:16.160
and generally you know people it's a bad
 

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.560
and generally you know people it's a bad
practice but a lot of people use the

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:17.570
practice but a lot of people use the
 

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.750
practice but a lot of people use the
same type of password or the same you

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760
same type of password or the same you
 

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.460
same type of password or the same you
know is it you know I might even be a

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:21.470
know is it you know I might even be a
 

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.710
know is it you know I might even be a
strong password might be very long but

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720
strong password might be very long but
 

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.290
strong password might be very long but
you know people like to use similar

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:26.300
you know people like to use similar
 

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.720
you know people like to use similar
passwords and when you

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:27.730
passwords and when you
 

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.070
passwords and when you
ask them to start introducing like

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080
ask them to start introducing like
 

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.600
ask them to start introducing like
cymbals and and you know all these

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:30.610
cymbals and and you know all these
 

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.600
cymbals and and you know all these
arbitrary constraints it actually makes

if you got on a phone type device so

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:45.650
if you got on a phone type device so
 

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:46.870
if you got on a phone type device so
each of these will cost you a permission

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880
each of these will cost you a permission
 

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.640
each of these will cost you a permission
but it depends if they you know it's

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:48.650
but it depends if they you know it's
 

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.460
but it depends if they you know it's
critical to your signup orders then you

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:51.470
critical to your signup orders then you
 

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.900
critical to your signup orders then you
know that might ease it and you know

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:52.910
know that might ease it and you know
 

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.960
know that might ease it and you know
increase signups all right shall we move

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:55.970
increase signups all right shall we move
 

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.870
increase signups all right shall we move
on to on-screen overlays yeah sure let's

00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880
on to on-screen overlays yeah sure let's
 

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.860
on to on-screen overlays yeah sure let's
do it

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:01.870
 
 

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.540
 
so this is pretty quick but uh on-screen

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:04.550
so this is pretty quick but uh on-screen
 

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.210
so this is pretty quick but uh on-screen
overlays so the general rule of thumb

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:07.220
overlays so the general rule of thumb
 

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:12.250
overlays so the general rule of thumb
here is avoid them in a it's kinda like

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:12.260
here is avoid them in a it's kinda like
 

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.560
here is avoid them in a it's kinda like
hand-drawn style arrows coming out yeah

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:14.570
hand-drawn style arrows coming out yeah
 

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:15.790
hand-drawn style arrows coming out yeah
yeah exactly

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:15.800
yeah exactly
 

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.590
yeah exactly
in particular you know you should avoid

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600
in particular you know you should avoid
 

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.140
in particular you know you should avoid
them for common UI patterns so you know

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:20.150
them for common UI patterns so you know
 

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.540
them for common UI patterns so you know
we're talking action bar you really

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:22.550
we're talking action bar you really
 

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.370
we're talking action bar you really
don't need to tell the user how to use

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:24.380
don't need to tell the user how to use
 

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.790
don't need to tell the user how to use
these things again you know the other

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:27.800
these things again you know the other
 

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.930
these things again you know the other
thing we've been yeah the other thing we

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:28.940
thing we've been yeah the other thing we
 

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.310
thing we've been yeah the other thing we
mentioned here was the the navigation

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320
mentioned here was the the navigation
 

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.900
mentioned here was the the navigation
drawer and and I think we mentioned this

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:31.910
drawer and and I think we mentioned this
 

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.550
drawer and and I think we mentioned this
yet but there's actually a recommended

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:33.560
yet but there's actually a recommended
 

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.080
yet but there's actually a recommended
pattern for the navigation drawer that

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.090
pattern for the navigation drawer that
 

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.180
pattern for the navigation drawer that

into a bit more detail on how help

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:38.150
into a bit more detail on how help
 

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.160
into a bit more detail on how help
should be structured within your

application
 

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.110
application
yeah it's basically like the difference

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120
yeah it's basically like the difference
 

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.149
yeah it's basically like the difference
between unsolicited help and solicited

00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159
between unsolicited help and solicited
 

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:45.159
between unsolicited help and solicited
help it's kind of like put users like

00:28:45.159 --> 00:28:45.169
help it's kind of like put users like
 

00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:46.870
help it's kind of like put users like
crying out for help they're gonna go to

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880
crying out for help they're gonna go to
 

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.250
crying out for help they're gonna go to
the overflow and find what they need

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:48.260
the overflow and find what they need
 

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.710
the overflow and find what they need
there now there is there's there is

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720
there now there is there's there is
 

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.510
there now there is there's there is
sometimes where it's appropriate to have

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520
sometimes where it's appropriate to have
 

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.240
sometimes where it's appropriate to have
on-screen overlays though so custom

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:58.250
on-screen overlays though so custom
 

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.460
on-screen overlays though so custom
gestures like sort of very specific

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:00.470
gestures like sort of very specific
 

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.080
gestures like sort of very specific
gestures to your application that are

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:02.090
gestures to your application that are
 

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.519
gestures to your application that are
just very custom and interesting and

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:03.529
just very custom and interesting and
 

00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:05.740
just very custom and interesting and
different to other applications it can

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:05.750
different to other applications it can
 

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.539
different to other applications it can
be appropriate and a really good example

00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:07.549
be appropriate and a really good example
 

00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:09.640
be appropriate and a really good example
of that here that we have in the

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:09.650
of that here that we have in the
 

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.130
of that here that we have in the
screenshot is the YouTube application

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:11.140
screenshot is the YouTube application
 

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.210
screenshot is the YouTube application
and so the one of the more recent

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:13.220
and so the one of the more recent
 

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.130
and so the one of the more recent
updates the YouTube application actually

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:15.140
updates the YouTube application actually
 

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.830
updates the YouTube application actually
allowed you allows you to basically

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840
allowed you allows you to basically
 

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.630
allowed you allows you to basically
continue to browse YouTube while

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640
continue to browse YouTube while
 

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.159
continue to browse YouTube while
minimizing the current video that's

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:21.169
minimizing the current video that's
 

00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:23.289
minimizing the current video that's
playing and so in the bottom right there

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:23.299
playing and so in the bottom right there
 

00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:24.580
playing and so in the bottom right there
that video would be playing right now

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:24.590
that video would be playing right now
 

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.010
that video would be playing right now
and the first time that you see this in

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:27.020
and the first time that you see this in
 

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.110
and the first time that you see this in
the new YouTube application it gives you

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120
the new YouTube application it gives you
 

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.820
the new YouTube application it gives you
this little overlay so that you can sort

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:30.830
this little overlay so that you can sort
 

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.529
this little overlay so that you can sort
of understand the gestures that you can

00:29:32.529 --> 00:29:32.539
of understand the gestures that you can
 

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:35.380
of understand the gestures that you can
apply to that particular video so

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:35.390
apply to that particular video so
 

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.549
apply to that particular video so
swiping there to the left

00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559
swiping there to the left
 

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:38.980
swiping there to the left
dismisses the video and swiping up

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:38.990
dismisses the video and swiping up
 

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.990
dismisses the video and swiping up
actually maximizes a video back into

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000
actually maximizes a video back into
 

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.630
actually maximizes a video back into
sort of the fullscreen view so I think

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640
sort of the fullscreen view so I think
 

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.510
sort of the fullscreen view so I think
this is a really good use of an overlay

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520
this is a really good use of an overlay
 

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.620
this is a really good use of an overlay
yeah okay so I think that's all we have

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:50.630
yeah okay so I think that's all we have
 

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.409
yeah okay so I think that's all we have
