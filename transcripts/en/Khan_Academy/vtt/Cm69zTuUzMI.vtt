00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.140
- [Instructor] We've spent
a lot of time already

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.850
thinking about markets
for the goods and services

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.270
that firms produce.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.960
Now we're gonna talk about
the markets or the factors

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.930
of production often known
as the factor markets.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.231
What are those factors of production?

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:18.950
Well we've talked about
'em multiple times,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.030
things like land, labor,
capital, and in particular,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.920
we're going to focus
in this video on labor.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.330
So what we have here is some
axis where the vertical axis

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.540
is labeled the wage rate, you
could do that as the price

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.830
of labor, it'd be per unit time,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.350
and on the horizontal axis
in both of these cases,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.950
we have the quantity of labor
which would be the number

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.250
of workers in that unit of time.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.310
And what we're gonna do on
the right hand side right here

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.950
is think about it form the
point of view of a firm,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.410
and then on the left hand side,
we're gonna think about it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.680
from the point of view
of the market as a whole,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.200
and to understand it first
on the firm's point of view,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.030
we can think about the demand from a firm.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.580
How much benefit is a firm getting

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.100
when it hires that incremental worker?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.210
And to do that, we're
gonna think about something

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.533
called marginal revenue product.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.602
Now marginal revenue
product sounds very fancy,

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:20.850
but I'm gonna set up a little table here

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.353
so that we can understand
in reasonable terms.

00:01:23.353 --> 00:01:26.510
So let's say that this is our labor again,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.960
so I'm gonna set up several columns here.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.636
This is how much product
the firm can produce

00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:35.970
based on the number of labor units.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.080
Then you have the
marginal product of labor

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.240
which is for each
incremental unit of labor,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.090
how much more are you able to produce?

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.200
So let me make some columns here,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.660
and I'm going to add more
columns in a little bit.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.550
So let's say we could
have zero units of labor,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.747
one unit of labor, two units of labor.

00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:55.330
When you have zero units, you're
definitely going to produce

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.530
zero units in that time period.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.560
Let's say when you have one unit of labor,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.350
one worker in the time period,
you're able to produce two.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.840
When you have that second
labor, or that second worker,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.580
you're now able to produce
six, and so we can think

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.472
about the marginal product of labor.

00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:16.427
That first worker is able to
produce an incremental two,

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.660
we went from zero to two,
but that second worker,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.970
by adding them, now you're able to produce

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.550
an incremental three units, and so here,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.180
this might be due to
specialization, things like that,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.240
but over time you might have diminishing

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.118
marginal products of labor,

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:34.332
but then if you want to think about

00:02:34.332 --> 00:02:35.700
well what's the real benefit to the firm,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.420
it's not just what is being produced

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.710
but how much the firm can get for that.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.210
So we can think about
the marginal revenue,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.080
and so let's just say that
that is, I don't know,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.260
four dollars, and it's just
a constant four dollars,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.129
and then we can think about
the marginal revenue product

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.765
which is just going to be
the marginal product of labor

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:58.265
times the amount of dollars
or incremental amount

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:00.650
of dollars per unit so it's just gonna be

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.700
two times four here which is
just going to be eight dollars.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.500
So one way to think about
it, when the firm goes

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.337
from zero labors, or zero
workers, to one worker,

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:12.770
you're going to have an
incremental eight dollars

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.707
of revenue based on what
that worker can produce,

00:03:15.707 --> 00:03:17.920
and then when you add another worker,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.430
you get three times four,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.190
you get an incremental
12 dollars of revenue.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.103
And so we can graph this, and as I said,

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:28.980
sometimes you might say
initially you could get

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.893
some benefits of specialization,

00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:33.470
but then over time you
get diminishing returns,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.460
so it might look something like this.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.100
Typically, in an econ class,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.380
you'll just see a downward
sloping line for simplicity,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.280
but the firm's marginal revenue product,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.920
you can view it as that individual
firm's demand for labor.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.560
At those first few units of labor,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.580
it has a very high
marginal revenue product,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.550
but over time you have diminishing returns

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.565
from adding more and more
people onto the staff.

00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:04.410
Now how would this look at the market?

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.240
Well what you could do is you could add up

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.190
all the marginal revenue products

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.370
from all the firms in the market,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.170
and if you add them
up, you're going to get

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.220
a market labor demand curve.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.130
And let me do this in a
slight different color.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.910
If you add all of these up,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.840
you are going to get something like this.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.730
Let me write that out.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.730
That is the market market
labor demand demand curve.

00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:35.500
Now what is going to be the
reasonable level of labor

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.183
quantity both in the market
and how much would be rational

00:04:38.183 --> 00:04:40.282
for this firm to hire?

00:04:40.282 --> 00:04:41.650
Well to think about that,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.270
we think about the market
labor supply curve,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.130
and I'm gonna focus on the market first,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.930
and just like the market for most things,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.700
the higher the wage,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.590
you're going to have more folks

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.310
willing to participate
in that labor market.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.950
So at a low wage, not a lot of people

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.270
are going to want to
work in this industry,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.120
but as wages get higher and higher,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.880
well then more and more
people are going to be up

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.588
for participating in this labor market,

00:05:06.588 --> 00:05:11.588
and so this right over
here is the market labor

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.120
supply curve supply curve,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.997
and so what would be the
equilibrium price of labor

00:05:19.997 --> 00:05:22.470
which was really just the wage rate,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.890
well it's where your supply
and demand curves intersect

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.060
and we've seen this
multiple times already.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.850
So this is I'll just call
that wage star like that,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.120
and then the equilibrium
quantity of labor,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.191
we can just call that
Q star right over here.

00:05:38.191 --> 00:05:41.262
Now how would that impact
what's going on in the firm?

00:05:41.262 --> 00:05:44.500
Well if we assume that this
is a perfectly competitive

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.990
labor market, we'll assume that this firm

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.090
can't set the wage, it's just
going to have to pay people

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.105
whatever the equilibrium wage actually is,

00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:57.565
and so this right over here
is going to be the firm's

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:00.782
what's known as marginal factor cost,

00:06:00.782 --> 00:06:04.031
the cost per incremental unit of labor,

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.930
that's just the wage it's
going to have to pay.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.530
It can get as much of that
labor as we need, we assume,

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.840
'cause we're talking about
a perfectly competitive

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.420
labor market in this industry,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.260
I'm just trying to draw a straighter line.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.260
So this right over here is
our marginal factor cost,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.950
and so you can imagine what
is the rational quantity

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.455
for this firm to hire?

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:32.690
It would keep hiring all the way until

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.024
the incremental revenue
per unit of labor it gets

00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:42.024
is no longer higher than the
incremental cost of that labor,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.690
and that would happen right over here.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.580
So this would tell us the
rational quantity of labor,

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.550
I'll call that quantity for,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.160
I'll call it Q star for
the firm right over there.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.770
I'll leave you there now.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.760
The important thing to realize,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.550
this seems similar to what
we've seen before when we talked

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.927
about things like marginal
revenue and marginal cost

00:07:02.927 --> 00:07:06.330
for a firm's good, but
here we're talking about

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.624
a firm's inputs and so instead
of it being the marginal

00:07:10.624 --> 00:07:13.422
revenue in the price in a
perfectly competitive firm

00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:16.460
that is defined by the equilibrium price,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.350
here it is the firm's cost that is defined

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.913
by the equilibrium wage in the market.
