[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:05.510
- I came to Schlesinger
first for my junior paper,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.760
and the junior paper I
wrote was about the history

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.660
of rape trauma research in
the 1970s through the 1990s.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.840
And so I came Schlesinger,
and that's where I started.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.590
And I ended up loving the
materials I found here

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.800
and loving that research so much
that I'm now writing my thesis

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.045
on that subject matter.

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:25.400
- So first of all, I
think Schlesinger Library

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.220
is a fantastic place
to do research.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.970
The collections are
really well organized.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.890
A lot of it is digitized.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.530
The whole staff here
is incredibly helpful.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.199
- So finding the
sort of hidden things

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.740
that you wouldn't
be able to get just

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.950
by scrolling through an
online database, for example,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.720
was something really
exciting for me

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.750
about the physical
research process.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.650
- I think by coming
here physically

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.110
you get the opportunity to
find other archives that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.360
are somewhat maybe tangentially
related or directly

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.060
related to the person or
topic you're dealing with.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.560
-The original paper-- and
you can smell and feel

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.330
how old it is.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.575
Someone held this in 1912
when it was first printed.

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:06.560
- You can see really on scale.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.500
How small is it?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.220
How big is it?

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.803
What does their
handwriting look like?

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.650
You can see the
condition of the paper.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.760
Was this letter
folded and refolded,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.910
or was it just kept really flat?

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.384
Did someone treasure
it in a way,

00:01:17.384 --> 00:01:18.800
or was it something
that was used?

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.200
- You can read a lot
of secondary sources

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.090
and hear about the history of
what was happening at the time.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.430
But it's another thing listening
to the voices of the people who

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.440
were on the ground and seeing
what they were going through

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.070
at the time.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.330
-I wanted students to encounter
this initially, to just make

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.240
sense of what's
there, to sit with it,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.450
to reflect, to not have any
expectations set on what they

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.510
would discover-- and allow
them to have time to do that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.270
and then figure out, through
that first encounter, what

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.590
they wanted to come back to.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.750
-The research done
here at Schlesinger

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.460
completely changed
exactly what I want

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.710
to do with history of science.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.251
So I do plan to go to graduate
school for history of science.

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:04.070
Schlesinger helped me I
guess find the specifics

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.100
that I was excited about,
that made me want to do that.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.220
-I'm in social work
school now, and I still

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.680
have a huge passion
for archival research

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.799
that totally started here.

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.090
So I think actually one of
the biggest takeaways for me

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.300
from the Schlesinger is
an understanding of how

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.690
to do archival research,
how to know what to ask for,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.580
how to know how to find things--
all of the really basic skills

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.540
that I felt like I was
able to gain, develop,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.180
ask a lot of questions
about, thanks to the support

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.380
from librarians here.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.440
- I think a lot of
times in college, people

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.890
talk about papers like it's
just kind of a glorified book

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.389
report.

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.660
I would sum up about
10 ideas that I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.310
read in various journals.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.900
And I'd try to put
my own spin on it,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.720
but it wasn't like I was
doing my own data collection.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.570
I wasn't reading actual
archives or looking at pictures

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.100
and making my own thoughts.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.890
So doing my own research,
connecting the dots by myself,

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.930
was something that I
haven't done before.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.890
And it was just really
interesting to be

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.530
able to do that on
my own and to feel

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.500
like I produced my own work with
the things that are available

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.000
here.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.980
- If we tried to have a
conversation about what

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.830
happened yesterday, many
of us would not agree.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.425
So the mistake that students
often bring to the classroom

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:18.320
is they flatten out the
complexity of the past.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.520
They miss the texture.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.200
They miss the contestation.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.970
And therefore they
miss the ability

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.276
to interpret multiple phenomena.

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:30.410
- Students in history
classes have a reflex

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.900
where they describe
what has happened

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.160
in the past in a sort of
impersonal third person.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.720
"It says what
happened in 1968." "It

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.870
says that there was violence
at the Democratic convention."

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.675
Well, who says?

00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:43.550
And how do they know?

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.160
What do we know, and
how do we know it?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.510
These are crucial questions
in any range of disciplines,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.460
and we have the
materials to support

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.120
students' original answers
to those questions.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.410
- What I've learned
has completely

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.720
changed my approach to the way
I do a project or I do an essay.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.702
I always first look
for some facts,

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:07.160
and then I always
want to make sure

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.030
that I understand how people
were feeling at this time

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.350
period.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.660
You learn a lot from
different secondary sources.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.370
You hear a lot from
different historians.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.024
They all have
differing opinions.

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.690
But in order to have
a closer connection

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.860
to these characters
in history, it's best

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.020
to see history through their
eyes-- and these images,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.780
diaries, correspondences
helped me do that.
