00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880
I think actually is gpus more powerful
 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.420
I think actually is gpus more powerful
potentially the cpu and so i think we're

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430
potentially the cpu and so i think we're
 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.620
potentially the cpu and so i think we're
going to see some really really cool

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630
going to see some really really cool
 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.630
going to see some really really cool
stuff about it so I'm excited it's using

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640
stuff about it so I'm excited it's using
 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.280
stuff about it so I'm excited it's using
the Exynos 5 and it's a very low

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290
the Exynos 5 and it's a very low
 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.170
the Exynos 5 and it's a very low
resolution device for that excellence 5

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180
resolution device for that excellence 5
 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.690
resolution device for that excellence 5
so you know it's going to be a really

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700
so you know it's going to be a really
 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.580
so you know it's going to be a really
really nice game machine x las five

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590
really nice game machine x las five
 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.170
really nice game machine x las five
that's an exciting chip it is an

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180
that's an exciting chip it is an
 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.360
that's an exciting chip it is an
exciting ship yeah it is actually so the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370
exciting ship yeah it is actually so the
 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.650
exciting ship yeah it is actually so the
chrome the Chromebook actually earned

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660
chrome the Chromebook actually earned
 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.320
chrome the Chromebook actually earned
the distinction of being the first

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330
the distinction of being the first
 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.380
the distinction of being the first
device to ship with an arm a 15 so

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390
device to ship with an arm a 15 so
 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.490
device to ship with an arm a 15 so
that's some good stuff that's an outer

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500
that's some good stuff that's an outer
 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.620
that's some good stuff that's an outer
border part isn't it it is it is it's

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630
border part isn't it it is it is it's
 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.300
border part isn't it it is it is it's
got its got a really long pipeline so

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310
got its got a really long pipeline so
 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.440
got its got a really long pipeline so
you do have to be a little more careful

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450
you do have to be a little more careful
 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.030
you do have to be a little more careful
i think in terms of you install the pipe

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040
i think in terms of you install the pipe
 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.920
i think in terms of you install the pipe

unified China model and so now we're
 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.300
unified China model and so now we're
seeing things where before a lot of

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310
seeing things where before a lot of
 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.610
seeing things where before a lot of
times they would sort of fudge in vertex

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620
times they would sort of fudge in vertex
 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.399
times they would sort of fudge in vertex

in terms of medium in terms of you know
 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.669
in terms of medium in terms of you know
whether you have medium precision or low

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:24.679
whether you have medium precision or low
 

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:26.409
whether you have medium precision or low
precision it might not actually have a

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419
precision it might not actually have a
 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:27.759

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:27.769
tribute your precision but now that
 

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:29.079
tribute your precision but now that
we're actually having these that are

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:29.089
we're actually having these that are
 

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:30.339
we're actually having these that are
designed to deal with compute nina

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:30.349
designed to deal with compute nina
 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:31.929
designed to deal with compute nina
precision may actually be something so

00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:31.939
precision may actually be something so
 

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:33.820
precision may actually be something so
all of a sudden well put Bertha promise

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:33.830
all of a sudden well put Bertha promise
 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.929
all of a sudden well put Bertha promise
it for a long time and in a lot of parts

00:07:36.929 --> 00:07:36.939
it for a long time and in a lot of parts
 

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:39.609
it for a long time and in a lot of parts
so you know the problem is these these

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:39.619
so you know the problem is these these
 

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:43.329
so you know the problem is these these
things are defined as no lo is less than

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:43.339
things are defined as no lo is less than
 

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:44.949
things are defined as no lo is less than

to high i mean theoretically you're

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:46.939
to high i mean theoretically you're
 

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:48.729
to high i mean theoretically you're
guaranteed 16 bands of media is the

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:48.739
guaranteed 16 bands of media is the
 

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:50.559
guaranteed 16 bands of media is the
problem but it could be would be more

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:50.569
problem but it could be would be more
 

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.989
problem but it could be would be more
definite well it usually is actually

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:52.999
definite well it usually is actually
 

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:56.799
definite well it usually is actually
because because um so so the what we're

00:07:56.799 --> 00:07:56.809
because because um so so the what we're
 

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:58.209
because because um so so the what we're
seeing is there are some parts and i

00:07:58.209 --> 00:07:58.219
seeing is there are some parts and i
 

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:59.739
seeing is there are some parts and i
believe the excess five is one of them

00:07:59.739 --> 00:07:59.749
believe the excess five is one of them
 

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:03.459
believe the excess five is one of them
that I the uses 16 bits for medium p and

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:03.469
that I the uses 16 bits for medium p and
 

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:06.629
that I the uses 16 bits for medium p and
so if you were using medium p and

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639
so if you were using medium p and
 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:10.929
so if you were using medium p and
getting by with 24 bits of precision now

00:08:10.929 --> 00:08:10.939
getting by with 24 bits of precision now
 

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:12.729
getting by with 24 bits of precision now
you get squashed down to 16 we're seeing

00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:12.739
you get squashed down to 16 we're seeing
 

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:14.559
you get squashed down to 16 we're seeing
these like bizarre Z fighting issues

00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:14.569
these like bizarre Z fighting issues
 

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:17.589
these like bizarre Z fighting issues
yeah yeah and again it's just it's just

00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599
yeah yeah and again it's just it's just
 

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:19.769
yeah yeah and again it's just it's just
we're talking about vertex shader

00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:19.779
we're talking about vertex shader
 

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:21.939
we're talking about vertex shader
precision most the time pixel shader

00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:21.949
precision most the time pixel shader
 

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:24.879
precision most the time pixel shader
precision actually is is unchanged they

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:24.889
precision actually is is unchanged they
 

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:27.549
precision actually is is unchanged they
were already crazily optimizing pixel

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:27.559
were already crazily optimizing pixel
 

00:08:27.559 --> 00:08:29.949
were already crazily optimizing pixel
shaders it to a lot of these devices so

00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:29.959
shaders it to a lot of these devices so
 

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:32.439
shaders it to a lot of these devices so
well you know the artifacts you're gonna

00:08:32.439 --> 00:08:32.449
well you know the artifacts you're gonna
 

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:35.110
well you know the artifacts you're gonna
get or not nearly then you get banding

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120
get or not nearly then you get banding
 

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.769
get or not nearly then you get banding
mm-hmm and in case you were well it just

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:38.779
mm-hmm and in case you were well it just
 

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:40.569
mm-hmm and in case you were well it just
yeah it's like you know geometry that

00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:40.579
yeah it's like you know geometry that
 

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:43.149
yeah it's like you know geometry that
suddenly is fighting with other geometry

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159
suddenly is fighting with other geometry
 

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.189
suddenly is fighting with other geometry
and if you draw it in one order on this

00:08:45.189 --> 00:08:45.199
and if you draw it in one order on this
 

00:08:45.199 --> 00:08:46.749
and if you draw it in one order on this
on these devices it's just going to

00:08:46.749 --> 00:08:46.759
on these devices it's just going to
 

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:49.600
on these devices it's just going to
overlap and and so it's kind of

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:49.610
overlap and and so it's kind of
 

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.040
overlap and and so it's kind of
terrifying so yeah so one thing to note

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.050
terrifying so yeah so one thing to note
 

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.540
terrifying so yeah so one thing to note
is gives it up when you're actually

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:52.550
is gives it up when you're actually
 

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.850
is gives it up when you're actually
using a vertex shader using media

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:54.860
using a vertex shader using media
 

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.620
using a vertex shader using media
precision you really only guaranteed 16

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:56.630
precision you really only guaranteed 16
 

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.170
precision you really only guaranteed 16
bits and unfortunately it's not easy to

00:08:59.170 --> 00:08:59.180
bits and unfortunately it's not easy to
 

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.740
bits and unfortunately it's not easy to
necessarily test that in terms of having

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:02.750
necessarily test that in terms of having
 

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.620
necessarily test that in terms of having
a GPU that's a reference design but it

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:05.630
a GPU that's a reference design but it
 

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.670
a GPU that's a reference design but it
is something you shouldn't you should

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680
is something you shouldn't you should
 

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.290
is something you shouldn't you should
consider and you should actually put

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:08.300
consider and you should actually put
 

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.940
consider and you should actually put
some it's actually worthwhile to

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:11.950
some it's actually worthwhile to
 

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.080
some it's actually worthwhile to
exceptional code and actually try to

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.090
exceptional code and actually try to
 

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.400
exceptional code and actually try to
check those in from kind of too low

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.410
check those in from kind of too low
 

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.410
check those in from kind of too low
because you can actually test for those

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:17.420
because you can actually test for those
 

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.240
because you can actually test for those
it's just it's just that you may not

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.250
it's just it's just that you may not
 

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.940
it's just it's just that you may not
have a GP sample that yeah so it's an

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:21.950
have a GP sample that yeah so it's an
 

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.500
have a GP sample that yeah so it's an
interesting device but again all the new

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:23.510
interesting device but again all the new
 

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.240
interesting device but again all the new
devices are not necessarily going to

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.250
devices are not necessarily going to
 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.620
devices are not necessarily going to
have that issue but they are going to

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:26.630
have that issue but they are going to
 

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.420
have that issue but they are going to
definitely have issues because we're

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:28.430
definitely have issues because we're
 

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.240
definitely have issues because we're
moving towards unified models here in

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:31.250
moving towards unified models here in
 

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.890
moving towards unified models here in
Mobile which is exciting actually I

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:32.900
Mobile which is exciting actually I
 

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.380
Mobile which is exciting actually I
think it is it is really cool yeah I

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:35.390
think it is it is really cool yeah I
 

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.420
think it is it is really cool yeah I
mean I don't know if I'd characterize it

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:37.430
mean I don't know if I'd characterize it
 

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.890
mean I don't know if I'd characterize it
as being because of unified shaders I

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:41.900
as being because of unified shaders I
 

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.870
as being because of unified shaders I
think it just happened to come along

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880
think it just happened to come along
 

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.110
think it just happened to come along
with that but yeah cold in here okay

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120
with that but yeah cold in here okay
 

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.220
with that but yeah cold in here okay
actually I just want to cover up my

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:48.230
actually I just want to cover up my
 

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.500
actually I just want to cover up my
boobs and I'm Teddy Teddy get that onto

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:50.510
boobs and I'm Teddy Teddy get that onto
 

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.430
boobs and I'm Teddy Teddy get that onto
I'm going back oh so let's talk about a

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440
I'm going back oh so let's talk about a
 

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.170
I'm going back oh so let's talk about a
little a little bit about the game

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.180
little a little bit about the game
 

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.550
little a little bit about the game
behind us because because it is here

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560
behind us because because it is here
 

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.710
behind us because because it is here
yeah absolutely so this is greedy

00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720
yeah absolutely so this is greedy
 

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.750
yeah absolutely so this is greedy
spiders to ever agree spiders didn't

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760
spiders to ever agree spiders didn't
 

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.910
spiders to ever agree spiders didn't
play that it was like a sort of a puzzle

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920
play that it was like a sort of a puzzle
 

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.650
play that it was like a sort of a puzzle
game right I did a puzzle game and it

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:05.660
game right I did a puzzle game and it
 

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.990
game right I did a puzzle game and it
said they're like move your flies or yes

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000
said they're like move your flies or yes
 

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.060
said they're like move your flies or yes
I goal the goal with this one is to is

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.070
I goal the goal with this one is to is
 

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.180
I goal the goal with this one is to is
all this is Q is to free your flies from

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:13.190
all this is Q is to free your flies from
 

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.580
all this is Q is to free your flies from
you know the spiders and and it's

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:15.590
you know the spiders and and it's
 

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.920
you know the spiders and and it's
actually it's actually fairly tricky to

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:17.930
actually it's actually fairly tricky to
 

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.290
actually it's actually fairly tricky to
to do that there are these you know the

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:20.300
to do that there are these you know the
 

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.120
to do that there are these you know the
goal is really to to make that spider

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.130
goal is really to to make that spider
 

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.610
goal is really to to make that spider

nearest book in terms in terms of the
number of segments so you can use that

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:28.850
number of segments so you can use that
 

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.860
number of segments so you can use that
against him so as you see here we really

actually have the goal is now to isolate

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.090
actually have the goal is now to isolate
 

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.860
actually have the goal is now to isolate

00:13:56.889 --> 00:13:56.899
yeah it is oh that's one thing by the
 

00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:00.309
yeah it is oh that's one thing by the
way I've noticed on a couple of games

00:14:00.309 --> 00:14:00.319
way I've noticed on a couple of games
 

00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:02.050
way I've noticed on a couple of games
they'll implement a swipe but they won't

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.060
they'll implement a swipe but they won't
 

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.360
they'll implement a swipe but they won't
implement it with physics and as you get

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.370
implement it with physics and as you get
 

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.639
implement it with physics and as you get
on to bigger devices it's really

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:06.649
on to bigger devices it's really
 

00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:07.750
on to bigger devices it's really
annoying because you have to drag your

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760
annoying because you have to drag your
 

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.699
annoying because you have to drag your
it cold finger all the way across the

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:09.709
it cold finger all the way across the
 

00:14:09.709 --> 00:14:11.350
it cold finger all the way across the
device he's particularly nice if you can

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360
device he's particularly nice if you can
 

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.500
device he's particularly nice if you can
use physics is built

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:13.510
use physics is built
 

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.600
use physics is built
in terms of gesture gesture detector

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:15.610
in terms of gesture gesture detector
 

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.020
in terms of gesture gesture detector
it's just it makes the game feel like an

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.030
it's just it makes the game feel like an
 

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.940
it's just it makes the game feel like an
android game and it makes me feel a

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:20.950
android game and it makes me feel a
 

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.710
android game and it makes me feel a
little bit customized event horizon well

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720
little bit customized event horizon well
 

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.390
little bit customized event horizon well
yeah it could because exactly because

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:24.400
yeah it could because exactly because
 

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.550
yeah it could because exactly because
the gesture detector and the flywheel

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560
the gesture detector and the flywheel
 

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.060
the gesture detector and the flywheel
physics will um will in general do the

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:30.070
physics will um will in general do the
 

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:36.060
physics will um will in general do the
right thing as far as the the momentum

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.070
right thing as far as the the momentum
 

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.150
right thing as far as the the momentum
of your swipe and people are going to be

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160
of your swipe and people are going to be
 

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.890
of your swipe and people are going to be
used to that yeah you know because all

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:40.900
used to that yeah you know because all
 

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.470
used to that yeah you know because all
these other apps use it so and no matter

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480
these other apps use it so and no matter
 

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.270
these other apps use it so and no matter
it like if you tune it so that you

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.280
it like if you tune it so that you
 

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.280
it like if you tune it so that you
really really like it and it's different

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:47.290
really really like it and it's different
 

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.830
really really like it and it's different
from the system default yeah um you

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:49.840
from the system default yeah um you
 

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.190
from the system default yeah um you
might want to just you know ask yourself

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.200
might want to just you know ask yourself
 

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.480
might want to just you know ask yourself
what why you do it is really telling me

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:54.490
what why you do it is really telling me
 

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.380
what why you do it is really telling me
there's a lot of games that actually

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:55.390
there's a lot of games that actually
 

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.630
there's a lot of games that actually
have tried to tame this and you really

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:57.640
have tried to tame this and you really
 

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.490
have tried to tame this and you really
notice it I mean it's very it's a

00:14:59.490 --> 00:14:59.500
notice it I mean it's very it's a
 

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.100
notice it I mean it's very it's a
visceral quality the game feels thick or

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:02.110
visceral quality the game feels thick or
 

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.560
visceral quality the game feels thick or
sticky right we find as it is it you

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:04.570
sticky right we find as it is it you
 

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.270
sticky right we find as it is it you
know our our physics are a little looser

code there is a fudge factor that we

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240
code there is a fudge factor that we
 

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.240
code there is a fudge factor that we
apply to our own physics like a factor

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:36.250
apply to our own physics like a factor
 

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.490
apply to our own physics like a factor
of four it's true because we suck but

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500
of four it's true because we suck but
 

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.260

you know whatever if if there's a fudge

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:43.270
you know whatever if if there's a fudge
 

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.000

it's a constant factor yeah

00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699
it's a constant factor yeah
 

00:15:47.699 --> 00:15:50.639
it's a constant factor yeah
alright so let's let's buddy items I

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:50.649
alright so let's let's buddy items I
 

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.349
alright so let's let's buddy items I
really love this game honestly it's an

00:15:52.349 --> 00:15:52.359
really love this game honestly it's an
 

00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:53.909
really love this game honestly it's an
incredibly well designed game it's

00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:53.919
incredibly well designed game it's
 

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:55.439
incredibly well designed game it's
really really fun the craft really well

really really fun the craft really well
 

00:15:55.449 --> 00:15:58.799
really really fun the craft really well
done it's very cute and it definitely is

00:15:58.799 --> 00:15:58.809
done it's very cute and it definitely is
 

00:15:58.809 --> 00:16:02.249
done it's very cute and it definitely is
a game we're looking at all seasons yeah

00:16:02.249 --> 00:16:02.259
a game we're looking at all seasons yeah
 

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:03.689
a game we're looking at all seasons yeah
that has legs people are come on play

00:16:03.689 --> 00:16:03.699
that has legs people are come on play
 

00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:05.729
that has legs people are come on play
with uneven little details like I like

00:16:05.729 --> 00:16:05.739
with uneven little details like I like
 

00:16:05.739 --> 00:16:10.469
with uneven little details like I like
see what you did there yeah legs nice so

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:10.479
see what you did there yeah legs nice so

eyes even moved here on the gun on the
 

00:16:14.439 --> 00:16:16.529
eyes even moved here on the gun on the
title screen it's very very cute you

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:16.539
title screen it's very very cute you
 

00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:18.119
title screen it's very very cute you
have the little you know you have to

00:16:18.119 --> 00:16:18.129
have the little you know you have to
 

00:16:18.129 --> 00:16:20.129
have the little you know you have to
give the little obvious option for music

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:20.139
give the little obvious option for music
 

00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:22.019

know nations you can change the

00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:25.389
know nations you can change the
 

00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:29.939

difficulty on it from easy too hard you

00:16:29.939 --> 00:16:29.949
difficulty on it from easy too hard you
 

00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:32.249
difficulty on it from easy too hard you
know whatever can't do that actually

00:16:32.249 --> 00:16:32.259
know whatever can't do that actually
 

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:36.599
know whatever can't do that actually
yeah i mean you can't actually determine

00:16:36.599 --> 00:16:36.609
yeah i mean you can't actually determine
 

00:16:36.609 --> 00:16:37.919
yeah i mean you can't actually determine
whether or not they've raided you on

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:37.929
whether or not they've raided you on
 

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:40.979
whether or not they've raided you on
google play so kind of yeah

00:16:40.979 --> 00:16:40.989
google play so kind of yeah
 

00:16:40.989 --> 00:16:43.710
google play so kind of yeah
actually the truth is i hope these

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720
actually the truth is i hope these
 

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.199
actually the truth is i hope these
developers hear this from us because

00:16:46.199 --> 00:16:46.209
developers hear this from us because
 

00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:48.089
developers hear this from us because
they will eventually hear from the play

00:16:48.089 --> 00:16:48.099
they will eventually hear from the play
 

00:16:48.099 --> 00:16:50.879
they will eventually hear from the play

a bad review if this is this is one of
 

00:17:00.429 --> 00:17:02.099
a bad review if this is this is one of

long as you know so it's it's one of the
 

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:06.090
long as you know so it's it's one of the
things and it's a goofball because you

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:06.100
things and it's a goofball because you
 

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.139
things and it's a goofball because you
can't actually tell whether they

00:17:07.139 --> 00:17:07.149
can't actually tell whether they
 

00:17:07.149 --> 00:17:08.819
can't actually tell whether they
reviewed it so it's sort of like you

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:08.829
reviewed it so it's sort of like you
 

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.470
reviewed it so it's sort of like you
know so it usually happens is sure I'll

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480
know so it usually happens is sure I'll
 

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.999
know so it usually happens is sure I'll
rate you on google play and I go to

physics puzzler and it just doesn't

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559
physics puzzler and it just doesn't
 

00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.019

quite live up to their the goal is to

00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:24.029
quite live up to their the goal is to
 

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:28.240
quite live up to their the goal is to
actually you need to clear away the

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:28.250
actually you need to clear away the
 

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.190
actually you need to clear away the
boards so that the banana will make it

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200
boards so that the banana will make it
 

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.440

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:33.450
to the monkey this is the laziest monkey
 

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.529
to the monkey this is the laziest monkey
on earth and it's just you know if

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539
on earth and it's just you know if
 

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:38.180
on earth and it's just you know if
there's so much that I can say in terms

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.190
there's so much that I can say in terms
 

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.560
there's so much that I can say in terms
of polish in terms of

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:39.570
of polish in terms of
 

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.390
of polish in terms of
anything from the font the graphic style

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400
anything from the font the graphic style
 

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.830
anything from the font the graphic style
is actually relatively consistent but

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840
is actually relatively consistent but
 

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.300
is actually relatively consistent but
you even see like the bat like there is

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:44.310
you even see like the bat like there is
 

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.270
you even see like the bat like there is
some yeah yeah I mean like the Stars

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280
some yeah yeah I mean like the Stars
 

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.730
some yeah yeah I mean like the Stars
have have a little bit of a bevel to

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740
have have a little bit of a bevel to
 

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.820
have have a little bit of a bevel to
them that yeah I was saying yeah

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:51.830
them that yeah I was saying yeah
 

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.930
them that yeah I was saying yeah
emphasis I would actually like to see

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940
emphasis I would actually like to see
 

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.310
emphasis I would actually like to see
everything take the style of the

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320
everything take the style of the
 

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.810
everything take the style of the
background I think it's yeah I love it

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:56.820
background I think it's yeah I love it
 

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.490
background I think it's yeah I love it
you're right background that's kind of

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500
you're right background that's kind of
 

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.020
you're right background that's kind of
cool I love that style I think it also

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.030
cool I love that style I think it also
 

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.910
cool I love that style I think it also
scales really really well like what's

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:01.920
scales really really well like what's
 

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.860
scales really really well like what's
great about not having lines and not

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:03.870
great about not having lines and not
 

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.480
great about not having lines and not
having distinct outlines is if they

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:05.490
having distinct outlines is if they
 

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.740
having distinct outlines is if they
actually scale and look great on every

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:06.750
actually scale and look great on every
 

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.480
actually scale and look great on every
display that's a good point because if

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:08.490
display that's a good point because if
 

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.890
display that's a good point because if
you've got a like a black line around

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900
you've got a like a black line around
 

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.990
you've got a like a black line around
your you know that that's going to scale

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000
your you know that that's going to scale
 

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.030
your you know that that's going to scale
differently and it's gonna going to end

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.040
differently and it's gonna going to end
 

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.620
differently and it's gonna going to end
up actually being invisible on some

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:15.630
up actually being invisible on some
 

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.570
up actually being invisible on some
devices and too thick on others exactly

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580
devices and too thick on others exactly
 

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.560
devices and too thick on others exactly
and you end up with these a listing

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:18.570
and you end up with these a listing
 

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.210
and you end up with these a listing
aliasing artifacts like you can see here

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220
aliasing artifacts like you can see here
 

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.890
aliasing artifacts like you can see here
on the board on the very very left you

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900
on the board on the very very left you
 

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.180
on the board on the very very left you
can see that you can you can't really

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:23.190
can see that you can you can't really
 

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.620
can see that you can you can't really
make out the outline because of the

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:24.630
make out the outline because of the
 

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.060
make out the outline because of the
angle the board is sitting at the

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:26.070
angle the board is sitting at the
 

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.530
angle the board is sitting at the
outline wasn't there at all and we

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:27.540
outline wasn't there at all and we
 

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.820
outline wasn't there at all and we
actually chose an art style that was

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:28.830
actually chose an art style that was
 

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.500
actually chose an art style that was
more consistent with a nice gradient

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:30.510
more consistent with a nice gradient
 

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.540
more consistent with a nice gradient
fills of the background I think I think

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:32.550
fills of the background I think I think
 

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.370
fills of the background I think I think
it would look a little bit better don't

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380
it would look a little bit better don't
 

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.250
it would look a little bit better don't
want to say a lot about this game it's

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260
want to say a lot about this game it's
 

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.600
want to say a lot about this game it's
just there's a lot of polish that can be

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:38.610
just there's a lot of polish that can be
 

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.130
just there's a lot of polish that can be
done here I think we did look at it a

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140
done here I think we did look at it a
 

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.800
done here I think we did look at it a
long time ago but you know my memories

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:42.810
long time ago but you know my memories
 

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.960

remotes where your phone is the

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:31.890
remotes where your phone is the
 

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.430
remotes where your phone is the
accelerometer yeah that would be kind of

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440
accelerometer yeah that would be kind of
 

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.490
accelerometer yeah that would be kind of
kicked but if only there was a way to

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500
kicked but if only there was a way to
 

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.080
kicked but if only there was a way to
actually use my other phone is a real

hid device and there was some sort of
 

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.650
hid device and there was some sort of
remote framework for dealing with

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:42.660
remote framework for dealing with
 

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.090

um but this is top-down an isometric
 

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.460
um but this is top-down an isometric
well I guess I guess that's sort of it's

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:48.470
well I guess I guess that's sort of it's
 

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.659

really exposed to the yeah this
 

00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:51.430
really exposed to the yeah this
isometric side well no just like it

need is not even a faint shadows even a
 

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.100
need is not even a faint shadows even a
little shadow underneath a little dead

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.110
little shadow underneath a little dead
 

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.260
little shadow underneath a little dead
little marker it scored sort of odd and

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:05.270
little marker it scored sort of odd and
 

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.299

the graphics are really blurry um you
know I would love to see them be a

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:08.450
know I would love to see them be a
 

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.570
know I would love to see them be a
little higher res and they are oh that's

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:10.580
little higher res and they are oh that's
 

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.820
little higher res and they are oh that's
true you know there's I didn't notice

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:12.830
true you know there's I didn't notice
 

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.620
true you know there's I didn't notice
because so here's a question to our

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:14.630
because so here's a question to our
 

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.740
because so here's a question to our
audience we were we were just talking

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:17.750
audience we were we were just talking
 

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.320
audience we were we were just talking
about this the other day is how if

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:20.330
about this the other day is how if
 

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.760
about this the other day is how if
you're going to run an automated program

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:21.770
you're going to run an automated program
 

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.280
you're going to run an automated program
to detect issues like this so what we're

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:24.290
to detect issues like this so what we're
 

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.810
to detect issues like this so what we're
talking about is over on the right side

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:25.820
talking about is over on the right side
 

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.570
talking about is over on the right side
of the screen so we've got these things

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:28.580
of the screen so we've got these things
 

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.600
of the screen so we've got these things
that are almost behind Dan's head now ok

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:31.610
that are almost behind Dan's head now ok
 

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.200
that are almost behind Dan's head now ok
so these are crisp whereas all of this

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.210
so these are crisp whereas all of this
 

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.180
so these are crisp whereas all of this
it's it's a little hard to tell because

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:37.190
it's it's a little hard to tell because
 

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.400
it's it's a little hard to tell because
it's a textured but it is not crisp and

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:39.410
it's a textured but it is not crisp and
 

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.620
it's a textured but it is not crisp and
it's about yeah I'd say the densities

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:41.630
it's about yeah I'd say the densities
 

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.120
it's about yeah I'd say the densities
about it she's kind of nice it creates

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.130
about it she's kind of nice it creates
 

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.590
about it she's kind of nice it creates
depth of field for us and our in our

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600
depth of field for us and our in our
 

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.460
depth of field for us and our in our
Sean here there yeah yeah yeah good boy

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:47.470
Sean here there yeah yeah yeah good boy
 

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.960
Sean here there yeah yeah yeah good boy
exactly look yeah except he may look

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:49.970
exactly look yeah except he may look
 

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.750
exactly look yeah except he may look
like we're sort of positioned in a weird

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760
like we're sort of positioned in a weird
 

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.750
like we're sort of positioned in a weird
nether space over an isometric field

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760
nether space over an isometric field
 

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.760
nether space over an isometric field
yeah well you know I think I think

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:57.770
yeah well you know I think I think
 

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.620
yeah well you know I think I think
that's okay anyway the point is what

00:29:59.620 --> 00:29:59.630
that's okay anyway the point is what
 

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.539
that's okay anyway the point is what
would you do to detect this and it

00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:01.549
would you do to detect this and it
 

00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:03.669
would you do to detect this and it
because i think you know to put it in

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679
because i think you know to put it in
 

00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:05.590
because i think you know to put it in
layman's terms i think we're trying to

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600
layman's terms i think we're trying to
 

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.169
layman's terms i think we're trying to
detect you know places where there's a

00:30:08.169 --> 00:30:08.179
detect you know places where there's a
 

00:30:08.179 --> 00:30:11.110
detect you know places where there's a
lot there's crisp but then most of its

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120
lot there's crisp but then most of its
 

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.850
lot there's crisp but then most of its
blurry mm-hmm but the problem is you

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:12.860
blurry mm-hmm but the problem is you
 

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.710
blurry mm-hmm but the problem is you
know some things you know if you're just

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720
know some things you know if you're just
 

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.659
know some things you know if you're just
measuring frequency or whatever some

00:30:16.659 --> 00:30:16.669
measuring frequency or whatever some
 

00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:18.400
measuring frequency or whatever some
things are going to be a low frequency

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:18.410
things are going to be a low frequency
 

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.919
things are going to be a low frequency

00:30:20.929 --> 00:30:24.270
signal and especially things like this
game play it's the only places that you

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:24.280
game play it's the only places that you
 

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.470
game play it's the only places that you
notice it the only place where it has to

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480
notice it the only place where it has to
 

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.470

be Chris are the

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480
be Chris are the
 

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.510
be Chris are the
you would expect it to be crisp and

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520
you would expect it to be crisp and
 

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.010
you would expect it to be crisp and
maybe that's it I mean maybe what we

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020
maybe that's it I mean maybe what we
 

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.810
maybe that's it I mean maybe what we
need to do is shrink it down find the

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:32.820
need to do is shrink it down find the
 

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.030
need to do is shrink it down find the
silhouette edges and then see how many

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.040
silhouette edges and then see how many
 

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.040
silhouette edges and then see how many
of the psyllid edges are actually blurry

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:37.050
of the psyllid edges are actually blurry
 

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.290
of the psyllid edges are actually blurry
at higher yeah exactly it would also be

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:39.300
at higher yeah exactly it would also be
 

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.670
at higher yeah exactly it would also be
interesting example you just don t

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:40.680
interesting example you just don t
 

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.020
interesting example you just don t
actually change the size of the display

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.030
actually change the size of the display
 

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.300
actually change the size of the display
look at look at this game at different

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:44.310
look at look at this game at different
 

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.090
look at look at this game at different
display sizes and compare and compare

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100
display sizes and compare and compare
 

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.500

how blur to get it get and then we could

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:48.510
how blur to get it get and then we could
 

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.390
how blur to get it get and then we could
actually see kind of where the optimal

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:50.400
actually see kind of where the optimal
 

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.160
actually see kind of where the optimal
where it had the highest amount of

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.170
where it had the highest amount of
 

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.110
where it had the highest amount of
information where we saw be you know are

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120
information where we saw be you know are
 

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.580
information where we saw be you know are
you starting at that that might yeah

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:55.590
you starting at that that might yeah
 

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.990
you starting at that that might yeah
that's true we just characterize it

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000
that's true we just characterize it
 

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.060
that's true we just characterize it
information theoretically if we if the

00:30:59.060 --> 00:30:59.070
information theoretically if we if the
 

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.880
information theoretically if we if the
information doesn't go up when the

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:01.890
information doesn't go up when the
 

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.380
information doesn't go up when the
screen size does then that's a problem

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:03.390
screen size does then that's a problem
 

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.570
screen size does then that's a problem
right exactly we can do that we can even

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580
right exactly we can do that we can even
 

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.160
right exactly we can do that we can even
take each image apply a scale factor

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:07.170
take each image apply a scale factor
 

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.720
take each image apply a scale factor
scale no you're right you're absolutely

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:08.730
scale no you're right you're absolutely
 

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.370
scale no you're right you're absolutely
right because that's that's the true

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380
right because that's that's the true
 

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.410
right because that's that's the true
that you know it doesn't have anything

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:12.420
that you know it doesn't have anything
 

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.670
that you know it doesn't have anything
to do with frequency it has to do with

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:13.680
to do with frequency it has to do with
 

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.440
to do with frequency it has to do with
information that has to do with whether

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.450
information that has to do with whether
 

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:18.640
information that has to do with whether
the because if you're if you're making a

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:18.650
the because if you're if you're making a
 

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.440
the because if you're if you're making a
bilinear prediction at each pixel mm-hmm

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:21.450
bilinear prediction at each pixel mm-hmm
 

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.630
bilinear prediction at each pixel mm-hmm
and the prediction is always right then

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640
and the prediction is always right then
 

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.030
and the prediction is always right then
there's no information beyond what the

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.040
there's no information beyond what the
 

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.040
there's no information beyond what the
you know quarter the size would have

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.050
you know quarter the size would have
 

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.010
you know quarter the size would have

are there are no questions all right are
there any game genres that you think are

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200
there any game genres that you think are
 

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.290

this seems like it would make sense on a

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:04.110
this seems like it would make sense on a
 

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.260

touchscreen totally i'll i wanna i want

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:06.270
touchscreen totally i'll i wanna i want
 

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.520
touchscreen totally i'll i wanna i want
to see some well you know i think i

to see some well you know i think i
 

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.470
to see some well you know i think i
think in general i want to see games

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480
think in general i want to see games

that take advantage of the connectivity

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:10.950
that take advantage of the connectivity

that take advantage of the connectivity
I mean you know most these these most of

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:12.690
I mean you know most these these most of
 

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.400
I mean you know most these these most of
these are like one hundred percent

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:13.410
these are like one hundred percent
 

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.410
these are like one hundred percent
connected devices and I'd love to see

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:15.420
connected devices and I'd love to see
 

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.640
connected devices and I'd love to see
RTS games and I don't need to play

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:16.650
RTS games and I don't need to play
 

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.040
RTS games and I don't need to play
against the against the computer but

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.050
against the against the computer but
 

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.030
against the against the computer but
actually allow you to play against other

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:20.040
actually allow you to play against other
 

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.220
actually allow you to play against other
players like I think that there's

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:22.230
players like I think that there's
 

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.990
players like I think that there's
there's really an opportunity first st i

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000
there's really an opportunity first st i
 

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.070
there's really an opportunity first st i
don't feel that way because i hate other

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080
don't feel that way because i hate other
 

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.890
don't feel that way because i hate other
people but yeah not grain yet how that's

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:27.900
people but yeah not grain yet how that's
 

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.650
people but yeah not grain yet how that's
something i yeah i mean i think you know

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:30.660
something i yeah i mean i think you know
 

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.090
something i yeah i mean i think you know
i would love to see me starcraft you

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100
i would love to see me starcraft you
 

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.260
i would love to see me starcraft you
know was a great single player

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:33.270
know was a great single player
 

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.840
know was a great single player
experience but you know it it as a as a

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:35.850
experience but you know it it as a as a
 

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.210
experience but you know it it as a as a
multiplayer yeah that's yeah no question

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220
multiplayer yeah that's yeah no question
 

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.409
multiplayer yeah that's yeah no question
well i think that's like

00:32:40.409 --> 00:32:40.419
well i think that's like
 

00:32:40.419 --> 00:32:42.840
well i think that's like
that doesn't feel like it's the you know

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:42.850
that doesn't feel like it's the you know
 

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.789
that doesn't feel like it's the you know
core to the phone right or are you just

enough multiplayer experiences even
 

00:32:48.249 --> 00:32:49.889
enough multiplayer experiences even
though these things are yeah even though

really cool well yeah I mean part of the
 

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:55.440
really cool well yeah I mean part of the
problem is I feel like you know

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:55.450
problem is I feel like you know
 

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:56.519
problem is I feel like you know
starcraft would have been a completely

00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:56.529
starcraft would have been a completely
 

00:32:56.529 --> 00:32:58.950
starcraft would have been a completely

yeah I just got this high score and you

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:01.780
yeah I just got this high score and you
 

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.540
yeah I just got this high score and you
know etc so right because II because

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:03.550
know etc so right because II because
 

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.859
know etc so right because II because
that's because that's really what I'm

00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:04.869
that's because that's really what I'm
 

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.599
that's because that's really what I'm
gaming on my phone is because I've got a

00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:06.609
gaming on my phone is because I've got a
 

00:40:06.609 --> 00:40:08.910
gaming on my phone is because I've got a
little bit of time to grab and I need

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920
little bit of time to grab and I need
 

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.859
little bit of time to grab and I need
the experience that is going to reward

00:40:10.859 --> 00:40:10.869
the experience that is going to reward
 

00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:13.260
the experience that is going to reward
that as opposed to having to like you

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:13.270
that as opposed to having to like you
 

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.240
that as opposed to having to like you
know call my friend and of course you

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:15.250
know call my friend and of course you
 

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.099
know call my friend and of course you
know it'll say my friend is online but

00:40:17.099 --> 00:40:17.109
know it'll say my friend is online but
 

00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:18.960
know it'll say my friend is online but
that of course he's online because he's

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:18.970
that of course he's online because he's
 

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:20.370
that of course he's online because he's
got his phone in his pocket everybody

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:20.380
got his phone in his pocket everybody
 

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.160

challenges that we didn't face when we

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:26.230
challenges that we didn't face when we
 

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:29.010
challenges that we didn't face when we
were doing the you know desktop stuff

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:29.020
were doing the you know desktop stuff
 

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.870
were doing the you know desktop stuff
yeah we're on the Xbox you're on the

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880
yeah we're on the Xbox you're on the
 

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.730
yeah we're on the Xbox you're on the
Xbox you most likely you're either

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:32.740

you're playing games in which case well
actually don't try to message me most

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:41.290
actually don't try to message me most
 

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.710
actually don't try to message me most
the time either oh yeah yeah that's me

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720
the time either oh yeah yeah that's me
 

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.070
the time either oh yeah yeah that's me
on yeah like can't you see that so on

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:47.080
on yeah like can't you see that so on
 

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.800
on yeah like can't you see that so on
but at least at least you're actually at

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:49.810
but at least at least you're actually at
 

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.420
but at least at least you're actually at
a console where you usually have a fast

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:51.430
a console where you usually have a fast
 

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.640
a console where you usually have a fast
internet connection and you're and

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:53.650
internet connection and you're and
 

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.170
internet connection and you're and
you're in the mood to you know

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:55.180
you're in the mood to you know
 

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.730
you're in the mood to you know
potentially interact with humans

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:56.740
potentially interact with humans
 

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.710
potentially interact with humans
although you know not always make sure

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720
although you know not always make sure
 

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.530
although you know not always make sure
turns about multiplayer bandwidth of

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:01.540
turns about multiplayer bandwidth of
 

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.770
turns about multiplayer bandwidth of
course although I would say that the the

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:04.780
course although I would say that the the
 

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.810
course although I would say that the the
bandwidth issue is much less of a

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:06.820
bandwidth issue is much less of a
 

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.960
bandwidth issue is much less of a
concern than latency you can always fix

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:09.970
concern than latency you can always fix
 

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.640
concern than latency you can always fix
bandwidth it's very difficult to fix

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:11.650
bandwidth it's very difficult to fix
 

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.099
bandwidth it's very difficult to fix
latency yeah most I mean I think we're

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:14.109
latency yeah most I mean I think we're
 

00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:15.450
latency yeah most I mean I think we're
finally getting this in network

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:15.460
finally getting this in network
 

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.490
finally getting this in network
like LT has some actually great latency

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:17.500
like LT has some actually great latency
 

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.670
like LT has some actually great latency
numbers on a non congested network and

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680
numbers on a non congested network and
 

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.930
numbers on a non congested network and
so we're probably getting to the point

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:21.940
so we're probably getting to the point
 

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.310
so we're probably getting to the point
where some of the things that were at

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:23.320

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.660
where some of the things that were at
one point limited to either land

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:24.670
one point limited to either land
 

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.450
one point limited to either land

back to my friends who were serious

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:30.430
back to my friends who were serious
 

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.090
back to my friends who were serious
about about gaming would be like all

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:33.100
about about gaming would be like all
 

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.190
about about gaming would be like all
right I can't have a cable modem because

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200
right I can't have a cable modem because
 

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.690
right I can't have a cable modem because
there's too much latency I can't be on

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:36.700
there's too much latency I can't be on
 

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.340
there's too much latency I can't be on
Wi-Fi because it adds too much latency

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:38.350
Wi-Fi because it adds too much latency
 

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.590
Wi-Fi because it adds too much latency

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:42.370
is the only thing it provides a loan of
 

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.010
is the only thing it provides a loan of
latency so that I have a chance of not

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:44.020
latency so that I have a chance of not
 

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.880

getting fragged okay and we're not

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:46.890
getting fragged okay and we're not
 

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.070

anywhere near that in terms of moval yet

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:50.080
anywhere near that in terms of moval yet
 

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.200
anywhere near that in terms of moval yet
you know but there are certain kinds of

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:52.210
you know but there are certain kinds of
 

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.330
you know but there are certain kinds of
twitch experiences that are starting to

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:54.340
twitch experiences that are starting to
 

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.500
twitch experiences that are starting to
work on on an actual you know cellular

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:58.510
work on on an actual you know cellular
 

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.690
work on on an actual you know cellular
network and I think that's exciting LTE

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:00.700
network and I think that's exciting LTE
 

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.190
network and I think that's exciting LTE
is really enabling all that so I think

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200
is really enabling all that so I think
 

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.410
is really enabling all that so I think
we'll see more and more but it still is

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:04.420
we'll see more and more but it still is
 

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.670
we'll see more and more but it still is
tricky and one of things is when you're

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680
tricky and one of things is when you're
 

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.170
tricky and one of things is when you're
doing matchmaking you want to find out

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:07.180
doing matchmaking you want to find out
 

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.910
doing matchmaking you want to find out
how good are my things can I get a

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:08.920
how good are my things can I get a
 

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.770
how good are my things can I get a
quality of service if the quality of

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:10.780
quality of service if the quality of
 

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.480
quality of service if the quality of
service below falls below a certain

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:12.490
service below falls below a certain
 

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:13.800
service below falls below a certain
threshold what does that mean in terms

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:13.810
threshold what does that mean in terms
 

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.540
threshold what does that mean in terms
of game it does I mean that's just

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:15.550
of game it does I mean that's just
 

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.150
of game it does I mean that's just
really I think the biggest problem is

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160
really I think the biggest problem is
 

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.660
really I think the biggest problem is
that your thing time is extremely

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:20.670
that your thing time is extremely
 

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.960
that your thing time is extremely
unpredictable when you're on mobile even

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:23.970
unpredictable when you're on mobile even
 

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.670
unpredictable when you're on mobile even
even if you're stationary yeah it can be

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680
even if you're stationary yeah it can be
 

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.500
even if you're stationary yeah it can be
very unpredictable because so

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:28.510
very unpredictable because so
 

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.420
very unpredictable because so
susceptible to interference even our

has grounded something works on our

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:34.600
has grounded something works on our
 

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.450
has grounded something works on our
Wi-Fi here it probably will work on a

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:36.460
Wi-Fi here it probably will work on a
 

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.240
Wi-Fi here it probably will work on a
mobile network so that might actually be

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:39.250
mobile network so that might actually be
 

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.700
mobile network so that might actually be
true yeah um but you know i mean if

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:41.710
true yeah um but you know i mean if
 

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.190
true yeah um but you know i mean if
you've got a femtocell or a or a Wi-Fi

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200
you've got a femtocell or a or a Wi-Fi
 

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.200
you've got a femtocell or a or a Wi-Fi

of things you can do the nice thing is

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:48.940
of things you can do the nice thing is
 

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.540
of things you can do the nice thing is
that the same games that lend themselves

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:51.550
that the same games that lend themselves
 

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:55.740

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:07.170

sure there are people who really

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:07.180
sure there are people who really
 

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:11.850

let's say tower defense or

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:26.140
let's say tower defense or

I like I said RTS nice thing about those

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:28.990
I like I said RTS nice thing about those
 

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.829
I like I said RTS nice thing about those
games is that while they're not fully

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839
games is that while they're not fully
 

00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:35.519
games is that while they're not fully
deterministic it's really really easy to

00:43:35.519 --> 00:43:35.529
deterministic it's really really easy to
 

00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:37.170
deterministic it's really really easy to
do latency hiding in those situations

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:37.180
do latency hiding in those situations
 

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.210
do latency hiding in those situations
now one of my favorite multiplayer games

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:39.220
now one of my favorite multiplayer games
 

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.970

as you all know is the big win series by
 

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.519
as you all know is the big win series by
hothead and they hide latency

00:43:46.519 --> 00:43:46.529
hothead and they hide latency
 

00:43:46.529 --> 00:43:49.019
hothead and they hide latency
beautifully just by pre computing

00:43:49.019 --> 00:43:49.029
beautifully just by pre computing
 

00:43:49.029 --> 00:43:51.839
beautifully just by pre computing
everything yes exactly this but here's a

00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:51.849
everything yes exactly this but here's a
 

00:43:51.849 --> 00:43:53.640
everything yes exactly this but here's a
dirty little secret oh yeah you're like

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:53.650
dirty little secret oh yeah you're like
 

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:54.900
dirty little secret oh yeah you're like
oh well yeah of course they just pretty

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:54.910
oh well yeah of course they just pretty
 

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.549
oh well yeah of course they just pretty
me it's all predetermined but the truth

00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559
me it's all predetermined but the truth
 

00:43:56.559 --> 00:44:00.839
me it's all predetermined but the truth
is that most sports games can do very

00:44:00.839 --> 00:44:00.849
is that most sports games can do very
 

00:44:00.849 --> 00:44:02.490
is that most sports games can do very
similar things so like for instance when

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:02.500
similar things so like for instance when
 

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.900
similar things so like for instance when
we did yeah when we NFL fever and NHL

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:06.910
we did yeah when we NFL fever and NHL
 

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:11.549
we did yeah when we NFL fever and NHL
rivals for Microsoft sports we we would

00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559
rivals for Microsoft sports we we would
 

00:44:11.559 --> 00:44:14.789

basically start an animation sooner on

00:44:14.789 --> 00:44:14.799
basically start an animation sooner on
 

00:44:14.799 --> 00:44:19.259
basically start an animation sooner on
the client on the originating client and

00:44:19.259 --> 00:44:19.269
the client on the originating client and
 

00:44:19.269 --> 00:44:21.509
the client on the originating client and
hold it out for more frames and this is

00:44:21.509 --> 00:44:21.519
hold it out for more frames and this is
 

00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:23.130
hold it out for more frames and this is
the same thing that like you know the

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:23.140
the same thing that like you know the
 

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.019
the same thing that like you know the
old Warcraft and Starcraft like the you

00:44:28.019 --> 00:44:28.029
old Warcraft and Starcraft like the you
 

00:44:28.029 --> 00:44:30.120
old Warcraft and Starcraft like the you
know if you click on a peon mm-hmm and

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:30.130
know if you click on a peon mm-hmm and
 

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.680
know if you click on a peon mm-hmm and
he says okay I'm going to do my thing

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:31.690
he says okay I'm going to do my thing
 

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.470
he says okay I'm going to do my thing
yeah any you know and he like is acting

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480
yeah any you know and he like is acting
 

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.539
yeah any you know and he like is acting
lazy well that's not laziness on your

00:44:36.539 --> 00:44:36.549
lazy well that's not laziness on your
 

00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:38.400
lazy well that's not laziness on your
peon sprite that's latency compensation

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:38.410
peon sprite that's latency compensation
 

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.410
peon sprite that's latency compensation
because if you can hold off on actually

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:40.420
because if you can hold off on actually
 

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.079
because if you can hold off on actually
doing the thing for five or ten frames

00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:43.089
doing the thing for five or ten frames
 

00:44:43.089 --> 00:44:45.779
doing the thing for five or ten frames
which isn't very long yeah then you can

00:44:45.779 --> 00:44:45.789
which isn't very long yeah then you can
 

00:44:45.789 --> 00:44:49.680
which isn't very long yeah then you can
completely get rid of pink time problems

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:49.690
completely get rid of pink time problems
 

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:52.200
completely get rid of pink time problems
yeah that's why an eye out it I have

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:52.210
yeah that's why an eye out it I have
 

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.569
yeah that's why an eye out it I have
played a lot of FPS games a lot now on

00:44:54.569 --> 00:44:54.579
played a lot of FPS games a lot now on

ground up over and over yeah I made it

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:14.740
ground up over and over yeah I made it
 

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.499
ground up over and over yeah I made it
through I actually beat that level twice

00:45:16.499 --> 00:45:16.509
through I actually beat that level twice
 

00:45:16.509 --> 00:45:19.499
through I actually beat that level twice
but that's right you had to beat that

00:45:19.499 --> 00:45:19.509
but that's right you had to beat that
 

00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:20.910
but that's right you had to beat that
level because we had to get past it to

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.920
level because we had to get past it to
 

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.819
level because we had to get past it to
show it over ilona right-hand bend over

00:45:23.819 --> 00:45:23.829
show it over ilona right-hand bend over
 

00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:26.220
show it over ilona right-hand bend over
Congress it I was like this cool air is

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:26.230
Congress it I was like this cool air is
 

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.480
Congress it I was like this cool air is
um but but yeah the shadow I play Chad I

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:30.490
um but but yeah the shadow I play Chad I
 

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:31.980
um but but yeah the shadow I play Chad I
got a plate that trigger I played sir

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:31.990
got a plate that trigger I played sir
 

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.200
got a plate that trigger I played sir
actually play through batman the dark

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:33.210
actually play through batman the dark
 

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.960
actually play through batman the dark
night I play you know i played through a

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:35.970
night I play you know i played through a
 

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:37.550
night I play you know i played through a
lot of spider-man i played through a

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560
lot of spider-man i played through a
 

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.330
lot of spider-man i played through a
bunch of i play too i love Mass Effect

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:41.340
bunch of i play too i love Mass Effect
 

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.790
bunch of i play too i love Mass Effect
infiltrator I said already I want you to

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800
infiltrator I said already I want you to
 

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.260
infiltrator I said already I want you to
play through a lot of that dead trigger

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:45.270
play through a lot of that dead trigger
 

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.120
play through a lot of that dead trigger
I did a lot of there there's been a lot

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:47.130
I did a lot of there there's been a lot
 

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.260
I did a lot of there there's been a lot
of really really great experiences there

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:50.270
of really really great experiences there
 

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:53.270
of really really great experiences there
but and it's interesting because there's

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280
but and it's interesting because there's
 

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.770
but and it's interesting because there's
two different models there's ones like

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780
two different models there's ones like
 

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.570
two different models there's ones like
mass effect which really tries to use

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:56.580
mass effect which really tries to use
 

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.460
mass effect which really tries to use
swiping and to create a totally

00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:58.470
swiping and to create a totally
 

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:03.200
swiping and to create a totally
different interface and sometimes it

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:03.210
different interface and sometimes it
 

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.480
different interface and sometimes it
just drives me crazy and then there are

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:05.490
just drives me crazy and then there are
 

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.710
just drives me crazy and then there are
the things like shadowgun which are

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720
the things like shadowgun which are
 

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.240
the things like shadowgun which are
which are you know which are you know

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:08.250
which are you know which are you know
 

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:09.890
which are you know which are you know
basically you know doing joystick

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900
basically you know doing joystick
 

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.750
basically you know doing joystick
simulations and it was funny because I

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760
simulations and it was funny because I
 

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.310
simulations and it was funny because I
actually don't know what I like more

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:13.320
actually don't know what I like more
 

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.200
actually don't know what I like more
because there I totally appreciate the

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:15.210
because there I totally appreciate the
 

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.910
because there I totally appreciate the
crazy stuff Mass Effect infiltrator does

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920
crazy stuff Mass Effect infiltrator does
 

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.800
crazy stuff Mass Effect infiltrator does
but the problem is is when you're

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:18.810
but the problem is is when you're
 

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:20.510
but the problem is is when you're
actually playing on a tablet you were

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:20.520
actually playing on a tablet you were
 

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.920
actually playing on a tablet you were
just reaching all over the place you

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:21.930
just reaching all over the place you
 

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:23.210
just reaching all over the place you
like putting going up for the corner and

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220
like putting going up for the corner and
 

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.130
like putting going up for the corner and
dragging stuff and doing gestures here

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140
dragging stuff and doing gestures here
 

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.830
dragging stuff and doing gestures here
and there and and it does it does get to

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:27.840
and there and and it does it does get to
 

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.900
and there and and it does it does get to
be a little bit crazier like I feel like

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:29.910
be a little bit crazier like I feel like
 

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.670
be a little bit crazier like I feel like
that's a common problem right is it

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680
that's a common problem right is it
 

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.650
that's a common problem right is it
people will design a great touch

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.660
people will design a great touch
 

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.420
people will design a great touch
interface but they'll design it around a

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:35.430
interface but they'll design it around a
 

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:39.170
interface but they'll design it around a
particular form factor and and that's

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180
particular form factor and and that's
 

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.520
particular form factor and and that's
just that's not the world we live in

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:40.530
just that's not the world we live in
 

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.830
just that's not the world we live in
anymore I mean it's not just about I

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:42.840
anymore I mean it's not just about I
 

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.270
anymore I mean it's not just about I
mean Android has lots of form factors

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280
mean Android has lots of form factors
 

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.610
mean Android has lots of form factors
yeah everybody has at least two well my

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:46.620
yeah everybody has at least two well my
 

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.010
yeah everybody has at least two well my
favorite is nova 3 so nova 3 actually

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020
favorite is nova 3 so nova 3 actually
 

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.450
favorite is nova 3 so nova 3 actually
allows you has a mode you can actually

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460
allows you has a mode you can actually
 

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.340
allows you has a mode you can actually
go and drag the different controls

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:52.350
go and drag the different controls
 

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.790

guidelines is that you can actually use
 

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:40.390
guidelines is that you can actually use
it as a test plan so that actually says

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400
it as a test plan so that actually says
 

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.069

here are the things that we're trying to

00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079
here are the things that we're trying to
 

00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:43.900
here are the things that we're trying to
test for and then it actually says and

there's like you know yes occasionally
 

00:51:39.849 --> 00:51:42.579
there's like you know yes occasionally
occasionally we'll see a game that has

00:51:42.579 --> 00:51:42.589
occasionally we'll see a game that has
 

00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:45.849

that's a really good sign that we should
 

00:51:52.489 --> 00:51:54.819
that's a really good sign that we should
feature this game as soon as they fix or

00:51:54.819 --> 00:51:54.829
feature this game as soon as they fix or
 

00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:58.120

because if people come in and they don't
 

00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:27.420
because if people come in and they don't
know the retro thing they don't

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:27.430

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.829
understand then they're going to see
this and there you think oh I guess

00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839
this and there you think oh I guess
 

00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:33.300
this and there you think oh I guess
android games are all like full of

00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:33.310

android games are all like full of
gigantic pixels yeah and you know I mean

00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.280
gigantic pixels yeah and you know I mean
 

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.400
gigantic pixels yeah and you know I mean
maybe maybe that was a reasonable fear

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:38.410
maybe maybe that was a reasonable fear
 

00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.440
maybe maybe that was a reasonable fear
maybe it wasn't but I put in a retro

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:40.450
maybe it wasn't but I put in a retro
 

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:41.700
maybe it wasn't but I put in a retro
category it really helps and this is a

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:41.710
category it really helps and this is a
 

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:42.780
category it really helps and this is a
live look I think I think what's

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:42.790
live look I think I think what's
 

00:59:42.790 --> 00:59:43.920
live look I think I think what's
exciting is that we're actually starting

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:43.930
exciting is that we're actually starting
 

00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:45.450
exciting is that we're actually starting
to improve the merchandise and get more

00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:45.460
to improve the merchandise and get more
 

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.770
to improve the merchandise and get more
stuff in there and I think ultimately

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:46.780
stuff in there and I think ultimately
 

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.809
stuff in there and I think ultimately
you know what's even more exciting is

00:59:48.809 --> 00:59:48.819
you know what's even more exciting is
 

00:59:48.819 --> 00:59:51.660
you know what's even more exciting is
you know what it's very possible the
