00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:09.966
&gt;&gt;Dana: My name's Dana and I'm nine.

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:14.896
And my favorite thing of technology
is my dad's iPhone 'cause it has lots

00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:16.516
of games on it.

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:20.836
When I first got my computer,
I was very, very excited.

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:22.466
When I was seven.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:27.216
And I love the internet,
so I kept on going on it.

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.806
&gt;&gt;I love this picture.

00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:33.336
&gt;&gt;Allison: Dana's a
very special girl.

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:37.506
She comes from Kazakhstan.

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:42.336
Both she and her sister, we adopted.

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:49.586
&gt;&gt;Dana: My dad giving
me my first toy.

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:58.976
And then my dad signing
the contract [singing].

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:01.636
&gt;&gt;Allison: She is a child of song
and from the moment she wakes up,

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:04.816
to the moment she goes to
sleep, if she's not talking,

00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:06.346
she's humming, she's singing.

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:08.456
&gt;&gt;Dana: [singing] For
our health, our homes,

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:11.456
our families, for the precious gift--

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:14.436
&gt;&gt;Allison: Her father and her mother
have something to do with technology,

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:18.106
and so she's always
had the stuff around.

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:20.876
But it's always been around
as if it's been furniture.

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:24.426
It's not, you know,
this special thing.

00:01:25.706 --> 00:01:29.366
She's using technology
as a digital native,

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:32.596
as immersed because it's there.

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:34.676
&gt;&gt;Dana: This is the pet of the month.

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:35.536
It's called Doogal.

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:37.676
&gt;&gt;Dana: You can just buy them.

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:44.136
It has a special tag and you can
log its code onto the website,

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.516
and then you'll see your animal.

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:47.336
You can name it.

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:51.176
&gt;&gt;Personally, I have twenty one.

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:53.456
You have to feed it, you
have to take care of it,

00:01:53.456 --> 00:01:56.516
you have to go playwith it every
single day, or else it will die.

00:01:56.726 --> 00:01:58.756
And that takes about an hour.

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:03.446
About to change sites 'cause
also like to go on PBS Kids Co.

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.606
&gt;&gt;Allison: She happens to adore PBS.

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:10.816
&gt;&gt;Dana: You can make your player
here, just by doing anything

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:15.796
that you want really, and
then I can change their shirts

00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:16.846
and their hair [inaudible].

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:22.486
&gt;&gt;Allison: But she's a kid that
just happens to go to the places

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:26.576
that are suitable for her,
and we have conversations

00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:28.116
about what's appropriate
and what's not.

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:30.896
&gt;&gt;Dana: So I'm supposed to hump
and try to get all these candies,

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:35.686
and when I fill up, I go
busing through the house.

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:38.826
Oh, and red light means I have
to be careful, 'cause mom's going

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:41.066
to come soon, so I have to get down.

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:43.376
So I'm pushing my luck here.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:46.236
Look out, mom's coming.

00:02:46.476 --> 00:02:52.026
&gt;&gt;Ben: We have a general
guideline, which is, be responsible

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:53.586
and do stuff that's appropriate.

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:56.376
And if you find yourself on a
place that's not appropriate,

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.376
just shut it down.

00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:00.856
If you're kind of interested,
but you're not sure, come ask us

00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:03.976
and we'll come talk to you and
you'll never get in trouble.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:12.546
&gt;&gt;All: [playing bells]

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:17.196
&gt;&gt;Allison: The children that
are digital natives today are

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:21.216
still children.

00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:23.756
They are children who love stories.

00:03:23.756 --> 00:03:26.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Mine looks like a clown.

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:28.456
&gt;&gt;Allison: They are children
who wanna be respected.

00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.676
&gt;&gt;Here's kind of his little
forehead, and that's his little hat.

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:31.976
&gt;&gt;Allison: They are children
that wanna love learning.

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:33.316
&gt;&gt;Female: But I do know that.

00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:37.646
I'm talking about like
the double digit.

00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:38.876
&gt;&gt;Allison: They don't
just wanna search.

00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:43.736
They wanna use what they've searched
for and do something with it.

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:45.756
They wanna be creative.

00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:49.466
They are probably more
digitally native

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:51.676
at home than they are in school.

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:54.746
They should be allowed
to pursue their passions.

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:57.136
&gt;&gt;Dana: Remember that?

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:58.196
&gt;&gt;Jari: I do.

00:03:58.416 --> 00:03:59.216
&gt;&gt;That's probably here.

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.616
&gt;&gt;In the winter, when
you were a little older?

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.566
&gt;&gt;Jari: Having Dana show me where
she has a personal website and go

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:08.396
through her photos, it's
an extension of self.

00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:12.146
And we have to be able to figure
out how to let technology have

00:04:12.176 --> 00:04:15.536
that ability for kids to
individualize who they are and bring

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:16.766
who they are to the school.

00:04:16.816 --> 00:04:20.866
&gt;&gt;Allison: And so what number
sentence helped you with that?

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:21.356
&gt;&gt;Dana: Thirteen.

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:24.196
&gt;&gt;Jari: For Dana, 'cause she has
some interesting learning challenges,

00:04:24.646 --> 00:04:28.356
it provides an easy access for
her to be able to get information

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:31.436
down in writing, or to
organize her thinking visually,

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:33.976
and that really helps
and supports her.

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:36.886
&gt;&gt;What do you think
about this keyboard?

00:04:36.886 --> 00:04:38.996
Can you type an actual
sentence on there-- ?

00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:39.806
&gt;&gt;Dana: It's way too small.

00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:42.246
&gt;&gt;What do you think
would be ideal for you?

00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:43.536
&gt;&gt;Dana: Slide it out.

00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:44.486
&gt;&gt;Slide it out?

00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:46.746
All right, try this one.

00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:49.336
&gt;&gt;Allison: What happens at Kids
Team, two afternoons a week

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:53.206
and two weeks during the
summer is that we help

00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:55.466
to make new technologies
better for kids.

00:04:55.876 --> 00:04:59.496
&gt;&gt;We work with mostly is the
National Park Service a lot.

00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:03.676
ome of their games on their
website are sorta cheesy,

00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:08.126
so we are the people who
like fix it up and stuff.

00:05:08.126 --> 00:05:10.676
&gt;&gt;Mona: The kids are
our design partners.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:14.026
They absolutely have as many
good ideas as the big people do.

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:16.586
The children are experts
in being children,

00:05:16.896 --> 00:05:20.796
and even though we were all children
once, we weren't children in 2009.

00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:25.256
Sometimes we'll take a look at an
existing technology, for instance,

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:29.456
People in Need, which is a website
that supports people in need

00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:31.856
in Haiti, and is looking to try

00:05:31.856 --> 00:05:34.706
and support more interaction
between children.

00:05:34.776 --> 00:05:37.016
&gt;&gt;Dana: And so you can click
on one of these families.

00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:38.756
It says, "Learn more.

00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:40.056
Help this family."

00:05:40.056 --> 00:05:45.446
And so it tells you a
little bit about it.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.446
&gt;&gt;Allison: Actually, the
favorite technique of all

00:05:50.446 --> 00:05:53.546
of our children is what the
kids call bags of stuff,

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:56.206
but the adults call
low tech prototyping.

00:05:57.686 --> 00:06:00.986
And what we do is, we
take bags of art supplies

00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:03.916
and we start to build things.

00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:06.596
&gt;&gt;Woman: Now what do we
need the microphone for?

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:08.746
&gt;&gt;You can also do like a video chat.

00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:13.636
&gt;&gt;Dana: Sometimes people
ask, "Help me do this,"

00:06:13.636 --> 00:06:15.936
or sometimes it will just be a

00:06:15.936 --> 00:06:20.496
"Choose whatever you
wanna do sort of thing."

00:06:20.496 --> 00:06:23.206
I guess you just use the computer
all the time in your brain.

00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:27.936
And then we all come together
and we explain what we did.

00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:31.206
&gt;&gt;So I thought you should be
able to send stuff to the people.

00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:34.146
&gt;&gt;So it was streamlining
the video taking process.

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:37.856
We also talked about making
it easy to add pictures too.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:40.896
&gt;&gt;You can just put the
camera on your computer

00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:42.836
and then you can do the video.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.576
&gt;&gt;Good work, all right [applause].

00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:51.976
&gt;&gt;Dana: [singing] For our
health, our homes, our families,

00:06:51.976 --> 00:06:54.856
for the precious gift of sight.

00:06:56.056 --> 00:06:59.236
&gt;&gt;Lisa: So the way I want you
to use this video at home,

00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:02.246
after you've practiced with me.

00:07:02.246 --> 00:07:07.066
&gt;&gt;Lisa: Video work and the
internet are the next big wave

00:07:07.066 --> 00:07:10.076
of how we're trying to reach
out to teens and youth,

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:12.886
to pull them into the
Jewish music scene,

00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:17.366
either by teaching via the internet,
conferencing via the internet,

00:07:17.406 --> 00:07:21.826
connecting in so many different
ways through videos and music.

00:07:21.826 --> 00:07:24.976
So that's how she got sucked into it.

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:32.296
&gt;&gt;Dana: [singing] Generations of
community, united hearts and souls

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:43.736
and they all shall dream dream,
and you shall see visions.

00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:47.906
And our hopes will rise to the sky.

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:56.726
&gt;&gt;Lisa: Excellent, awesome.

00:07:57.046 --> 00:08:00.356
&gt;&gt;Allison: We have to understand
that literacy is just not about text,

00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:03.596
and it's even not just
about what's visual.

00:08:03.826 --> 00:08:08.556
It's about the combination of the
visual, the oral, the interactivity

00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:12.086
and being able to support
children in all different ways.

00:08:12.576 --> 00:08:15.626
The technology is a way to do it,

00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:19.586
so you don't need the
gifted teacher all the time.

00:08:19.746 --> 00:08:23.806
You can get a kid with passion at
home doing the things, and then going

00:08:23.806 --> 00:08:27.356
into school and saying,
"Look, look what I've done."

00:08:31.876 --> 00:08:33.786
