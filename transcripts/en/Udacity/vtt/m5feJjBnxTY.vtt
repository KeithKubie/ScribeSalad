00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.040
In this video we will create
a notebook table view controller

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.460
that displays all existing notebooks.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.060
Sorted by name and
creation date in a table view.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.990
First, let's create a new subclass
of CoreDataTableViewController.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.420
Now, we need to implement a single
method, cellForRowAtIndexPath.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.190
In this method, we need to find
out what notebook we need,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.220
create a cell and display the
information of the notebook in the cell.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.010
Only the first part seems new.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.580
How can we figure out which is the
correct notebook from the index path?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.060
And as fetch results is your friend
here, it has a method called object for

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.270
index path.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.860
The rest of the code is per usual.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.648
Let's implement it.

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:52.440
Now, it might be a good idea for
you to pause the video and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.840
try writing this code on your own.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
Feel free to press the pause button,
I'm not going anywhere.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.040
Now, let's create
an NSFetchedResultsController in

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.800
view did load.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.040
We will need three things here.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.210
An initialized stack,
a fetched request and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.240
finally, the NSFetchedResultsController.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.260
Let's implement this.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.779
Lastly, let's make sure we edit
this class to our storyboard.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.210
Okay, great.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.990
Now, finish implementing the code for

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.110
the NSFetchedResultsController
in view that load.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.650
And at the class to the storyboard and
then take it for a spin.
