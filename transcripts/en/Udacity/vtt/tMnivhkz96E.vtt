There are a few small bits of code to be added. To the spotlight itself, you

00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:06.478
need to add that the light casts the shadow. The solidGround object was not

00:00:06.478 --> 00:00:10.594
receiving any shadows, so you need to set this parameter to true. You don't

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:14.240
need to have the ground cast a shadow since it's below everything else.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.970
Finally, the renderer itself must have shadows enabled, which is added to the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.310
list of renderer initialization settings.
