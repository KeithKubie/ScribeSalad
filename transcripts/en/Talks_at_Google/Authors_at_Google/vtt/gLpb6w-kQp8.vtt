00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.900
JOANNA SCHAFFHAUSEN: Hi.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.650
And thank you so much for
coming today and taking time out

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.310
of your very busy schedules
to listen to me yammer

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.710
on about my book.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.780
It's called "The
Vanishing Season,"

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.300
and it just came out last week.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.890
And it had an unusual path
to publication in that it won

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.030
the Mystery Writers
of America/St.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.810
Martin's Minotaur Debut
Crime Novel Award,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.730
which is an annual contest that
is held in conjunction with St.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.380
Martin's-- my publisher--

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.940
and the Mystery
Writers of America.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.010
So it's open to anybody who
has an unpublished manuscript.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.380
So if you have an
unpublished manuscript lying

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.690
around that has
to do with crime,

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.640
you can shine it
up and send it in.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.750
The new deadline is
mid-January of 2018.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.800
And they usually get
about 400 submissions.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.230
And the Mystery
Writers of America

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.690
have some judges who comb
through those manuscripts

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.780
and narrow it down to a handful
of finalists, which are then

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.200
sent on to the editors at St.
Martin's, who pick the winner.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.440
And occasionally,
there's no winner.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.170
But my year, I won,
which I was very

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.430
surprised and
delighted to find out,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.730
which is how my book came to be.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.369
So that was March 2016 when
they said, yes, we like it.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.160
We will publish it.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.950
And it just came out now,
about 22 months later.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.440
So it's a long journey
from the decision

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.990
to publish to the actual
presentation of the book.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.990
But it's been exciting and fun.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.010
I recommend it.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.590
You know.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.850
And so the book is about--

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.160
one of the reasons I thought
that it might not win

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.340
is most of the winners have
been traditional mysteries

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.350
or historical mysteries that
don't feature a lot of grit

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.730
or, well, body parts, as
my mother calls my novel

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.400
The Body Parts Novel.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.080
So I was very
surprised when they

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.840
picked me and my body parts--

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.340
delighted but surprised.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.970
And it's about a
serial killer who's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.350
active in a small town in
Woodbury, Massachusetts.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.820
It's fictional.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.330
And living in this town is
my heroine, Ellery Hathaway,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.320
who has personal knowledge
of a serial killer,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.050
because she was kidnapped
off the streets of Chicago

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.560
as a 14-year-old-- the eve of
her 14th birthday, actually.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.290
She was alone, outside
on the streets at night,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.840
because her mother
was in the hospital

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.850
with her brother who
was dying of cancer.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.690
And the father had
run off years ago.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.990
So Ellery was vulnerable.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.580
And when the sedan pulled
over-- it's a hot July night

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.200
in Chicago, oppressive heat--

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.230
she thought, well, if
I help him, maybe he'll

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.530
give me $1 for a soda
and I can cool off.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.140
But instead, he
got out of the car,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.950
and her life changed forever.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.010
She would have been
victim number 17

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.900
of Francis Coben, who's an
infamous Ted-Bundy-type serial

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.190
killer who had abducted
and killed 16 girls before.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.290
And he kept the hands
and ditched the rest.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.760
And so Ellery was
imprisoned by him

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.960
and would have been killed too
if not for a very green FBI

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.910
agent who was low
man on the totem

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.530
pole in the investigation.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.650
But he played a hunch and
serendipitously rescued her

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.350
from the closet.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.990
And that was 14 years
before the book opens.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.690
And now she's
living in anonymity.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.780
She's changed her name.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.450
She's trying to put all
the past behind her.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.700
But every year
around her birthday,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.400
somebody goes missing
from this small town.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.840
And they all seem to have--

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.120
well, most of them seem to
have reasons to be missing.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.570
So nobody is very surprised.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.010
And they aren't looking for
them too hard in most cases,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.490
and they don't see a pattern.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.880
But Ellery gets a creepy clown
birthday card in the mail

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.514
after each disappearance that
says "Happy Birthday, Ellery."

00:04:14.514 --> 00:04:16.680
And she doesn't really talk
about her birthday much,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.649
so this is a signal
to her that somebody

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:24.370
knows who she is for real and
the person may be dangerous.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.460
But she can't get
anybody to believe her

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.830
that these disappearances
are connected.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.730
And to explain the whole
story risks outing her past

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.720
and again being forced to deal
with this ugly serial killer

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.650
who had hurt her when
she was a teenager.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.547
So this year the vanishing
season is coming around again,

00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:45.630
and somebody is going to
go missing unless she can

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.796
figure out a way to stop it.

00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:49.470
So she calls up the one guy
she knows who will believe her,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.170
and that's Reed Markham, the
FBI agent who rescued her

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.720
when she was 14.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.769
And Reed's life skyrocketed
after his rescue of Ellery.

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:02.310
He wrote a bestselling
book about it,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.230
he got promoted, he
became a hotshot profiler.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.130
It was great.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.990
He met his wife
this way where she

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.420
was starstruck a little by
the whole serial killer-- you

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.930
catch serial killers,
that's really cool.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.120
And so the best time
of his life, basically,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.375
is the worst time of Ellery's.

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.500
And that's why they're
interesting to put together,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.360
is they had their
identities forged

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.180
by this initial terrible
case, and they've both

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.670
been living with it in
different ways ever since.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.160
So for Reed, it's been a boon--

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.140
gave him fame and fortune.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.650
And for Ellery, it has
been awful, obviously.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.450
And so forcing them
back together again

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.280
causes them to
confront those roles

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.400
where, for Reed, if
Ellery's life isn't

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.020
awesome-- he's
always told himself

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.610
he's the big hero of her story.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.670
He rescued her, she's
the one that lived--

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.450
if her life isn't so awesome,
then maybe he's not the hero

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.690
he told himself he was.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.350
And for Ellery, she's
always told herself

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.420
she's going to be
the victim forever.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.900
She's forever tied to this
very famous serial killer.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.304
And so now she has a chance
to see who she might be apart

00:06:16.304 --> 00:06:16.970
from that story.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.580
So that's the main
thrust of the book.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.270
And one of the
questions I get asked

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.310
a lot is where did it come from.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.910
And the genesis of the
story was about 20 years ago

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.450
I was reading one of the
stories about Ted Bundy.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.770
And there are a lot of them.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.620
There's a new Ted
Bundy story every year,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.340
basically-- a movie, a TV
movie, a book, something.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.700
This story, it's 40 years old,
but it keeps getting retold,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.190
and so Ted Bundy lives on.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.020
And for the people who were
caught up in his story,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.410
this can be difficult to
have to keep reliving it

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.750
when the public won't
let it die, basically.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.570
And so he has living
victims, one of whom

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.590
is a woman named Carol DaRonch.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.700
Carol was 18 and shopping
at a Utah shopping mall

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.970
when Ted Bundy, pretending
to be a police officer,

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.472
told her that her car
had been broken into

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.680
and she needed to come with
him to the police station

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.911
and make a report.

00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:24.410
And so she got into
the car with him

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.910
and was immediately
struck that this

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.280
doesn't look like a cop's car.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.190
And then he drove her not
towards the police station

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.980
but away from it.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.620
And so she freaked
out and demanded

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.330
to be let out of the
car, at which point

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.400
Bundy realized
that the jig was up

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.500
and he had to
subdue her somehow.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.480
So he pulled over to
the side of the road,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.630
and he tried to snap
his handcuffs on her.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:48.080
But in the struggle, he got
both the cuffs on one wrist,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.870
and so she was able to escape.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.080
And she became the beginning
of Ted Bundy's end,

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.370
because people knew that he was
out there, this guy named Ted,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.810
and there were
the missing girls,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.540
and they were
probably connected.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.610
But they didn't know
what he looked like,

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.720
all these sort of things.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.220
And she was able
to say, here's what

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.500
he looked like, here's
the car he was driving.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.650
And the cops were able to start
putting the pieces together.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.410
So Carol today-- so, more than
40 years after this incident--

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.940
still gets 10 to 15 messages
per day about Ted Bundy.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.040
People write her saying,
oh, he kidnapped me, too.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.710
Or they say, tell me what Ted's
really like, what was it like?

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.299
They want her story.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:39.230
A couple of years ago, some guy
decided to say he was her son

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.530
and he has this
connection to Ted Bundy.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.070
She doesn't have a son.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.420
So she was forced to either
let this lie perpetuate

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.520
or to come forward and
say, I don't have a son.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.540
He's lying.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.640
So Bundy's been
dead for decades.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.050
He was electrocuted
in Florida in 1989.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.170
But for Carol, he's
there every day.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.590
Her life now became
about Ted Bundy.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.860
And the public won't
let him go for her.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.550
She has no choice.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.980
Another person caught up
in the Ted Bundy story

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.140
would be the Reed
Markham type character.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.560
And this was Bob Keppel,
who was brand new.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.680
He had been on the job
as a homicide detective

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.100
one week when he got
handed the Ted Bundy case.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.730
And this completely changed the
trajectory of Keppel's career.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.980
He ended up specializing
in serial murder.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.820
He hunted Bundy for years
until they caught him.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.980
When Bundy was finally
apprehended for good--

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.980
because he escaped twice--

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.050
he was finally apprehended
for good in Florida.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.680
Keppel traveled there and
interviewed him multiple times

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.530
and was able to get Bundy
to confess to more murders

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.470
that they didn't know
he'd even committed.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.500
Eventually, Keppel went on to
specialize in serial murder

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.790
and try to help classify them
to see if we could figure out

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.422
how to get serial
killers, learn more about

00:10:02.422 --> 00:10:04.130
how they think, where
did they come from.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.670
So he participated in
some scientific research.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:11.310
He ended up lecturing,
teaching about serial killers.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.780
It also took over his life,
in a more positive way,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.410
in that he was the
expert in serial murder.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.720
But again, it was
serendipity, right?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.429
He's just a guy working
for the Seattle Police

00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:25.970
when all of a sudden this call
comes in about a missing girl.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.030
And now he's been handed one
of the most infamous cases

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.360
in all of history.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.080
So I was less struck when I
read this book about Ted Bundy

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.820
himself-- he's
very interesting--

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.120
but all of these side
people, the people who

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.930
were approached by Bundy
and didn't go with him.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:49.880
So I know somebody who was
living in the sorority house

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.580
that he attacked in Florida.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.950
He broke in and just
basically went from room

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.190
to room beating women, these
young women, with a log.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.100
And he killed some of them
and gravely injured others.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.580
There was one who was
going to be a dancer,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.120
and the head injury
caused her life

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.930
to be rewritten because she
had balance issues after that.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.040
And so she lived, but her
life was never the same.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.600
And the woman I know lived there
but wasn't home that night.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.200
She was out.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.660
So it's the sliding
doors, parallel lives--

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.310
what if she had been there.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.050
She wasn't.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.540
But still, it's something
she thinks about frequently.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.430
When you have a brush with
an infamous case like this,

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.680
it changes you.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.630
And so the book is
about serial murder.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.220
And there's a mystery,
and who did it,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.261
and all that other stuff.

00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:44.120
But it's also about what
it's like to live attached

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.190
to this infamous crime.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.060
How many people are familiar
with "Mindhunter," very popular

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.830
Netflix series right now?

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.220
I see one.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.780
So "Mindhunter" is
based on the work

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.550
of two other people who
hunted serial killers, Ressler

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.260
and Douglas.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.360
And they went around
and interviewed them.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.980
They had this idea--

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.530
serial killers have
been with us forever,

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.940
but nobody really studied them.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.460
And they said, well, we're going
to study them and interview

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:17.960
them.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.890
And see if we can classify
them and figure out

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.770
where they come from and
help people catch them.

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.840
So this is all about
their interviews.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.100
They have people playing
creepy serial killers,

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.030
and they show the interviews
and how the work came to be,

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.830
and whether people
supported it at first,

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.850
and how it gained momentum.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.470
What's interesting about it now
is if you go to the FBI site,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:45.630
the FBI is basically like, yeah,
none of that really panned out.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.290
We tried, but it turns
out serial killers

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.730
are very hard to catch.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.490
And they're hard to catch
for a lot of reasons.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.040
But one of the things
is all their hard work

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.810
at trying to figure
out, OK, what can we

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.920
say about serial killers.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.620
And they could find some
tendencies like, OK, they

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.620
tend to be bed-wetters
into later adolescence--

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.130
so bed-wetting is a problem
even when they're 10, or 12,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.660
or something like that.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.530
OK.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.690
Well, if you suspect
you have a serial killer

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.480
in your neighborhood and
you're a police officer,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.990
you can't really go
round up the bed-wetters.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.190
So the cops are looking
at these profiles going,

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.240
they don't help us.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.220
OK, so he had mommy issues.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.220
How do we go round up the
people who had mommy issues

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.570
or whatever?

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.010
This is not helpful.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.680
And then also some
of it just turns out

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.750
not to be helpful even as
a classification system.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.170
So one of the big things
they tried early on

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.630
was you could be an
organized killer who

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:50.880
would be kind of like Bundy,
who planned his victims.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.830
And he had this
very big ruse where

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.185
he would dress up as an
injured person with a cast on.

00:13:57.185 --> 00:13:58.560
And he'd say, oh,
come with me, I

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.436
need you to help me
carry my books to my car.

00:14:00.436 --> 00:14:02.643
And the young women would
go with him, at which point

00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:04.500
he would leap upon
them and subdue them.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.110
Or he would pretend to be a
cop or something like that.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.520
And he had a plan
with how he was

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.040
going to be with the
victim, and kill her,

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.060
and where he was
going to leave her.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.600
And then disorganized
killers, who would be like,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.970
ooh, I'm just walking along
when I am overcome with the urge

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.470
to kill.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.110
And I break in and
I just kill people.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.030
But Bundy did that,
too, at the end.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.450
So is he organized
or disorganized?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.120
And it turns out organized
killers have elements

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.610
that are disorganized,
and disorganized killers

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.650
have elements of organization.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.980
So this category
helped not at all.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.790
But there are other things
that are kind of interesting,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.700
things that appear about
serial killers in movies

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.530
and television.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.540
So for example, you see
things like, oh, they always

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.520
take trophies with them.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.360
That's a big thing.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.360
And it turns out about half--

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.110
half take some sort of trophy,
like some piece of the victim's

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.000
jewelry or a driver's
license, so they

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.450
can relive it afterward.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.480
But only about half.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.700
Another one-- they
found serial killers

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.430
are more likely to have
served in the military.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.461
So if 1% of the
population has served

00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:15.210
in the military around
now, serial killers

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.010
it's one in three.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:21.750
So probably they're attracted to
the dominance, and the weapons,

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.590
and that sort of thing.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:27.540
But again, the vast majority
of people in the military

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.620
are not serial killers.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.530
So even if you suspect
you have a serial killer,

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.239
it's not like you can go round
up everybody in the military

00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:35.280
and say, are you the one?

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.330
And then, let's see,
other things that

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.800
are true about serial killers--

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.500
that they kill
strangers and that's

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.300
why they're hard to catch.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.930
And it turns out about a third
of their victims are strangers.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.030
It turns out the most
common relationship

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:58.140
between a serial killer
and his victim is business.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.940
So watch out when
you're doing business.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.550
Now, prostitution accounts
for a good chunk of that.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.110
That's classified as business.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.210
But also, you go down
to your Kinko's to make

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.080
some mimeographs or whatever
and the serial killer

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.189
happens to be working
behind the counter.

00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:14.730
So you get those
kind of things, too,

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.650
where there's this
casual connection.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.269
You would still
mostly be classified

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:20.310
as strangers-- you don't
really know each other--

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.160
but you have met before.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.680
So that's another thing
that is interesting

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.870
about serial killers.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.660
Another one that
pops up sometimes

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.600
is are the victims all women.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.120
On TV, they're
almost always women.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.570
And it turns out in real life
they're mostly women, too.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.920
It's about 80%.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.010
And again, part of that
is the prostitution.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.160
Because if you're a serial
killer, and you're lazy,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.922
and you want a
victim, it's very easy

00:16:48.922 --> 00:16:50.880
to get a prostitute to
get in the car with you.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.470
You don't have to go hunt her.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.024
Open the door and she'll get in.

00:16:54.024 --> 00:16:55.440
And then you are
expected to drive

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.856
her off somewhere
secluded, so she

00:16:56.856 --> 00:16:58.810
doesn't freak out immediately.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.520
So unfortunately, people
who are in the sex trade

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.740
are still vulnerable
to this kind of thing.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.150
You can call them up and have
one delivered to your home.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.210
So that's a chunk of
where that comes from.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:17.190
So it's about 80% of
the victims are women.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.040
And another one that I
find interesting-- there's

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.650
this idea that, oh, they're
already in the system

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.290
somewhere.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.510
If we just look for people
who are out there committing

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:31.270
violent crimes, we can
find the serial killer.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.610
And it turns out, no,
that about 80% of them

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:40.290
have some kind of record by
the time they are arrested

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.500
for murder, but it's
usually nonviolent stuff

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.169
like peeping or simple theft.

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:51.210
It's not really that
they're out there committing

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.110
these violent crimes,
and they have a record.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.330
So it turns out they're actually
very, very hard to catch.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.380
I got some feedback on my
book actually about Reed,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.390
and his ability to
profile, and everything.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.930
And somebody would be like,
he's not very good at his job.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.690
He gets stuff wrong in the book.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:15.240
And, well, profiling is
not a science, per se.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.930
It's not like it has the
guaranteed outcome that they're

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.350
like, OK, and he's going
to be wearing a red sweater

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.400
and driving a blue minivan.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.530
They can't get it down that far.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.620
And indeed, the cops often
get frustrated because what

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.570
the profilers will come
forward with are stuff

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.926
like, well, he's
really angry at women.

00:18:36.926 --> 00:18:38.550
And the cops are
like, yeah, we kind of

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.860
gathered that from the
way he's killing them.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.265
What else you got?

00:18:42.265 --> 00:18:42.765
Nothing?

00:18:42.765 --> 00:18:46.380
Oh, the bed-wetter thing, OK.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.185
So there is this
tension between the FBI

00:18:48.185 --> 00:18:50.310
that wants to do this
research into serial killers,

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.700
and the local police, who really
just want help catching them

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.020
when they think they have one.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.510
But this is another
problem, is how

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.340
do you know when you have one.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.440
Because it'd be nice if they
were always very consistent

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.580
and they left the signed
notes like the Zodiac--

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.260
ooh, it's me.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.940
Or they always used
a pair of red nylons

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.620
to strangle their victim,
something obvious that says,

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.170
OK, yeah, these are all related.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.820
But sometimes
they're opportunists,

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.890
and they will change
murder weapons.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.480
And so one might
be a strangulation

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.880
and then another
will be a shooting.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.500
So they can be very
hard to detect.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.208
But what's interesting
now is some people

00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.820
are beginning to
experiment with big data.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.090
And it's hard right now because
the way law enforcement works,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.460
they're all segregated.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.210
So you can be a serial
killer in one town,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.326
and go across the street
and be a serial killer

00:19:38.326 --> 00:19:40.200
in another town, and
the two towns don't even

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.740
know that they have related
victims because they're not

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.422
sharing data.

00:19:44.422 --> 00:19:46.380
So there are some people
who are making efforts

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.610
to try and get the police
departments to share more data

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.070
so you can pick
out serial killers.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.760
And that's looking like it
might be an interesting way.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.980
Some people are saying
that this will work,

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.150
but it hasn't been
rigorously tested yet.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.000
But at least we
are probably moving

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.910
in the right direction to
being able to spot these guys.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.210
And again, it is mostly guys.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.890
You can get female
serial killers.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.550
They tend to murder
serial husbands,

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.570
like black widows-- like, I'll
marry a guy and then off him

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.560
for money, and then I'll marry
another one, off him for money.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.750
And if you move around, this
can be very hard to catch.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.830
And this is the thing--

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.385
how do they finally
catch serial killers?

00:20:31.385 --> 00:20:32.760
Well, it turns
out their families

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.810
turn them in, their friends,
the people who know them,

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.250
who can say, oh, yeah,
he was a bed-wetter.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.940
Yeah.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.970
Or in Bundy's case,
his fiancee was like,

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:50.940
he has plaster of
Paris in the bathroom

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.580
and some handcuffs in the car.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.504
That looks suspicious to me.

00:20:56.504 --> 00:20:57.920
She had to turn
him in three times

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.130
before they took her seriously,
because nobody thought they

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.050
were looking for a law student.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.300
They thought they were looking
for some sort of savage

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.690
on the street who was foaming
at the mouth or something.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:09.736
So it took a while.

00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:11.360
Even though lots of
people were turning

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.390
Ted in, Ted Bundy, like, ooh,
this guy does drive a VW Bug

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.125
and his name is
Ted, the cops just

00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:17.750
didn't believe it
could possibly be him

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.510
until his girlfriend
actually turned him

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.360
in when he moved to
Utah and more women

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.040
started disappearing there.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.040
And she's like, OK,
so Ted moved to Utah,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.700
and now you have
missing women there.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.230
You really might want
to check into that.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:35.030
But what's interesting
about Liz, his fiancee--

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.360
she didn't break up with him.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.280
It's a head-scratcher for me.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.210
So she kept turning
him in to the cops

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.730
like, I think he could
be a serial killer.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.870
I think he might be
the guy, and then I'm

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.670
also still going to marry him.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.370
And indeed, one woman did
marry him on death row

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.990
when he'd been
convicted of all of it

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.580
and actually bore his child.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:02.650
So out there is
a woman who would

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.690
be a little younger than me
who has Ted Bundy for a father.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.300
And her mother is somebody who
had sex with Ted Bundy when

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.940
he was on death row.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.100
So that's your
parentage, good luck.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.340
Are there any questions about
publishing, about the book,

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.080
about serial murder?

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.630
AUDIENCE: I found the addressing
of the emotional scars

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.100
in the book interesting.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.180
It really does feel like that
is a major part of the book,

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.034
as you said, rather
than just the killer

00:22:36.034 --> 00:22:37.200
and the hunt for the killer.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.220
It's hard to make such a thing
come across as believable

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:51.150
unless you have examples of
people with emotional scars

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:51.650
to go on.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.150
I guess to some
extent we all do.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.540
Did you use any particular
examples from the real world

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:02.900
to base Ellery's
behavior and baggage on?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.840
JOANNA SCHAFFHAUSEN: So
I have the Bundy case

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.220
as one of the imprints.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:13.160
But actually I was assaulted
by a neighbor when I was five

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.540
repeatedly, by a neighbor
who told me he would kill me

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.970
if I ever told my family.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:25.170
And so I said nothing
for several years.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:30.290
He eventually went to jail
for unrelated charges.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:34.970
But I've always wondered
what parts of my personality

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.770
are as a result
of that experience

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.350
and what would have
been me anyway.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.692
There's no control Joanna
that we can run alongside me

00:23:42.692 --> 00:23:44.900
to be able to say, OK, that's
how you would have been

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.579
if this had never happened.

00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:49.370
So it's something that's
interesting to me.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.080
I started checking
out books on rape

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.970
from the library when
I was eight to try

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.261
to understand this whole thing.

00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:55.800
So I've done a ton of reading.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.370
And I've done writing about it.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.070
And what happens when I write
about it is women come out

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.360
of the woodwork and say, yeah,
here's what happened to me.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.430
And so I've been
collecting these stories

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.270
over the years of
different women.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:14.960
And so Ellery is kind of an
amalgamation of all of us.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.450
Her story is very dramatic
because it's famous

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.460
and you can't get away from it.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.530
Most of us live in
relative anonymity.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.250
So that part is very
unusual for Ellery.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.870
But what's common is
the shame, the wondering

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.890
did I do something to
cause this, the feeling

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.440
that if somebody knows what
happened to you that it's

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.140
going to change how they
look at you, how they feel,

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.590
how they act to you.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.750
We've seen this with the
#MeToo movement, right?

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.220
So a lot of women
have some story.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.620
And most of us are carrying
it around in secret.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:57.650
And just the secrecy part of
it can be a lingering pain.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.970
And so, yeah, Ellery is a
mixture of all of these tales.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.024
Yes, another question?

00:25:04.024 --> 00:25:06.690
AUDIENCE: What did you find most
surprising about the publishing

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.190
process?

00:25:09.181 --> 00:25:10.680
JOANNA SCHAFFHAUSEN:
Most surprising

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.690
about the publishing process.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.770
Well, I'm really heartened
that the book is doing well.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.280
To me, that's the
biggest surprise.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.590
I wrote-- it was a nice little
mystery, and I liked it,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:27.650
but it sold out on
Amazon in six days.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.150
And so people are coming forward
going, I really liked this.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.316
And I'm like, oh, thank you.

00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:33.720
I'm just surprised every time.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.250
In terms of the mechanics, I
would say how long it takes.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:42.250
I knew that intellectually,
but it was 22 months.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.680
And as I like to
say, I could have

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.390
birthed two actual children
in that time frame,

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.830
or one elephant, or a book.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:56.850
And it turns out that there's
a lot of different pieces

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.490
that go into it.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.220
My publisher publishes
110 mysteries a year.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.250
So you have your slot about this
is when the editor can focus

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.200
on your book, this is
when the copy editor can

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.530
focus on your book,
this is when the cover

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.930
artists can focus on your book.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.720
And it's a complicated
dance, and you

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.760
have to meet your steps.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.460
Or the whole process--
you can miss your opening,

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.310
and then your book
is delayed even more.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:29.490
So that has been, I would
say, the most surprising part.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.800
The thing that surprises
other people is I

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.790
don't have anything
to do with the cover.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.220
The publisher picks both the
title and the cover for books.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.110
And authors, depending
on their stature,

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.390
get more or less input.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.720
And so this title
actually is mine,

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.490
and the publisher agreed to it.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.770
The cover, I was
not even consulted.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.829
They're just like, here it is.

00:26:51.829 --> 00:26:54.120
And I provided some feedback,
and they made some tweaks

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.620
on that.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.640
And I'm very happy with
the way it turned out.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.090
But I know sometimes
authors are very unhappy.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.750
Lisa Gardner was
telling me this week

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.110
that they'd tweaked
her cover so many times

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:11.910
that it ended up the
woman had six fingers.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.420
So she's looking at the cover,
she's like, it looks odd to me.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.590
It published this way.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.970
She's like, it looks odd to me.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.280
And her husband, she says,
he's more visual than I am,

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.030
and he came along.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.950
He's like, that's because
she has six fingers.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.370
Oh, yeah.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.250
And then even if you
are Lisa Gardner, who

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.030
has published
zillions of "New York

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.650
Times" bestselling books, still
the publisher will come to you

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.196
and say, can you give
the heroine brown eyes?

00:27:41.196 --> 00:27:42.570
Or not brown eyes
but green eyes,

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.280
because we have
green-eyed art that we

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.496
want to use on the cover?

00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:47.120
And so brown eyes
aren't going to work.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.390
So can you go back and
change her heritage

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:53.340
so that she has green eyes?

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.900
And Lisa is like,
all right, I'll

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.690
just go tweak her heritage so
she has green eyes in the book.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.620
So the way the different
pieces come together

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.360
and where the
author can push back

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.070
and where the author
can't continues

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.290
to be a bit of a
surprise for me.

00:28:11.675 --> 00:28:13.050
AUDIENCE: Just
quickly, thank you

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:17.070
for that explanation of why
so many books' cover pictures

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.840
don't match the story inside.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.127
I never understood.

00:28:20.127 --> 00:28:21.210
JOANNA SCHAFFHAUSEN: Yeah.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.452
Well, it turns out
authors actually usually

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:26.910
are not very good at figuring
out what to put on the cover.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.960
Because they imagine that
it's going to be a scene,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.490
like you act out a
scene from the book.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.070
And when it doesn't look
like that, they're like,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.840
but this doesn't
look like my book.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.030
And it turns out that the most
important thing the book can do

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.910
is signal its genre,
like what it is.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.110
So is it literary fiction?

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.100
Is it a scary mystery?

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.440
Is it a cozy mystery
like "Murder, She Wrote"

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.190
where there's a dead body
but nobody really cares?

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.820
That kind of thing.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.570
Because if you get it wrong,
the readers are angry.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.960
I've seen reviews where there's
something on the cover that's

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.290
super creepy, and then
the book isn't scary

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.810
and the readers are mad.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.470
They're like, I
really was prepared

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.840
to be terrified by this
book, and it wasn't even

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.220
mildly thrilling.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:20.070
Or, this book looks
sci-fi to me and it isn't.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.990
And honestly, even when
you get in the genre,

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.820
you can still have problems.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:30.580
So one of my readers apparently
thinks she looks pregnant.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.400
And so she read the book
expecting the pregnancy

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.650
to show up, and it never did.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:36.700
And she was mad.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.320
She's like, two stars
off, the cover is a lie.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.600
So you can't win.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.720
But really, more than acting
out a particular scene

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.430
or having the
character look exactly

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.650
like they're
described in the book,

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.969
you want it to signal what
it is so that readers--

00:29:54.969 --> 00:29:56.760
you don't want somebody
looking for a pizza

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.910
to get a cheeseburger.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.490
AUDIENCE: What can you tell
us about your future work?

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.448
JOANNA SCHAFFHAUSEN: Oh,
what a great question.

00:30:04.448 --> 00:30:05.430
So I'm very fortunate.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.770
St. Martin's has kindly
picked up the next two

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.810
books in the series.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:15.890
So "No Mercy" is slated
to come out January 2019.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.180
And then there is
another one after that.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.150
And it's Reed and Ellery
again and the basset

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:21.930
hound Speed Bump.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:25.530
Everybody likes the basset
hound, so he's back, too.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.420
And they solve more crimes.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.860
The second book, Ellery is
sentenced to group therapy

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.830
with ordinary crime victims.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.620
One of them is a survivor--
his wife was killed

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.690
in a drunk driving accident.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:44.220
Another one had his buddy die
in a convenience store robbery.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.890
So none of them is famous
like Ellery, none of them

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.260
has, you know, crime
in big, bold letters.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.140
And Ellery, she's been living
with it all these years.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.500
So she's not too keen on getting
in touch with her feelings.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.450
So instead, some of
these crimes are unsolved

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.060
for her fellow survivors.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.120
So she starts trying to
solve all their lives

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.640
rather than doing what
she's supposed to.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.870
And then the third one,
Reed, actually, his mother

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.030
was murdered when
he was an infant.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:14.940
She was found stabbed to
death just a short way

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.900
away from his crib.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.420
And he was adopted.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.240
And he gets a hot new
lead after 40 years.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.550
And Reed and Ellery go to Vegas
to solve his mother's murder.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.139
AUDIENCE: What would you say is
the surprising part of writing

00:31:28.139 --> 00:31:29.930
a book maybe compared
to other stuff you've

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.370
written in the past?

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.370
JOANNA SCHAFFHAUSEN: Sure,
yeah, surprising part

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.380
of writing a book.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.970
Well, I have to
have some surprise.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:42.110
I discovered very
early on that if I

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.140
outline, too much of
a detailed outline,

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.850
I won't write the book.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.787
Because it's all like,
well, the hard part

00:31:48.787 --> 00:31:50.870
is figuring out the exact
phrasing and everything.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.720
And if the story is all there,
I'm like, well, that's it.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.940
I don't need to do that work.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.710
I'll just leave it in my head.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.390
So I have a rough outline.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:03.004
And then things happen
where I'm writing along

00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:04.670
and a character I
didn't think was going

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:06.080
to do something does something.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.640
All of a sudden it's
happening, and I was like, oh,

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.850
that's very interesting.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.150
I didn't know you had
that secret motive.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.340
Or this thing in
your past that's

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.560
suddenly coming out to light.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.500
Ian [? McKellen ?] said
he wrote like 13 books

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.584
before he realized his
hero was Polish, you know,

00:32:21.584 --> 00:32:23.150
like that was his ancestry.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.270
He's like, oh, of course,
you're Polish, I didn't know.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.490
So that's the fun part
is the discovery, where

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.140
you're writing along and you
learn about your character.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.650
So that's, I think, the
surprising part and the fun

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:34.910
part.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:35.750
Thank you.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:39.100
[APPLAUSE]
