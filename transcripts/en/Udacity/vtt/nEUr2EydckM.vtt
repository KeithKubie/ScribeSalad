00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.050
Now you have everything you need to
navigate around in your Git timeline.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.939
And if you're making frequent commits,
your code is safe.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.460
You can revert back in time.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.030
You can branch out into new features.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.620
And you can merge your content.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.340
Remember to push your code on GitHub and

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.690
keep a nice consistent stream
of commits on your profile.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.260
There's still a ton of
Git knowledge out there.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.420
So if you want more practice,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.650
we have a full in-depth Git
course you can find on Udacity.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.470
Now it's time to code with confidence
with your newfound Git knowledge.
