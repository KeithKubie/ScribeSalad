00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.400
know we looked at it wasn't buttery
smooth and you guys really wanted to be

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410
smooth and you guys really wanted to be
 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.920
smooth and you guys really wanted to be
really super smooth and so we I think we

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
really super smooth and so we I think we
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.300
really super smooth and so we I think we
ended up recommending that you draw it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310
ended up recommending that you draw it
 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.490
ended up recommending that you draw it
on its own hardware yeah no definitely I

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500
on its own hardware yeah no definitely I
 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.930
on its own hardware yeah no definitely I
mean that was this screen right here

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940
mean that was this screen right here
 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.580
mean that was this screen right here
this many by category screen it's kind

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590
this many by category screen it's kind
 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.810
this many by category screen it's kind
of that one thing that we want to get

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820
of that one thing that we want to get
 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.000
of that one thing that we want to get
right we wanted to make sure that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010
right we wanted to make sure that
 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.039
right we wanted to make sure that
interactive in your finances was kind of

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049
interactive in your finances was kind of
 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.050
interactive in your finances was kind of
this very immersive experience and that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
this very immersive experience and that
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.810
this very immersive experience and that
buttery smooth you know rotation of the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820
buttery smooth you know rotation of the
 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.509
buttery smooth you know rotation of the
screen clicking on that are tapping on

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519
screen clicking on that are tapping on
 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.789
screen clicking on that are tapping on
the slices even slowing down to kind of

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799
the slices even slowing down to kind of
 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.890
the slices even slowing down to kind of
you know move between the slices we

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900
you know move between the slices we
 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.680
you know move between the slices we
wanted to get that 100% right and that

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690
wanted to get that 100% right and that
 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.820
wanted to get that 100% right and that
was just something that we poured a lot

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830
was just something that we poured a lot
 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.310
was just something that we poured a lot
of effort a lot of time into it really

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320
of effort a lot of time into it really
 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.960
of effort a lot of time into it really
gives that that feeling that this is an

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970
gives that that feeling that this is an
 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.210
gives that that feeling that this is an
app that it feels solid right you know

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
app that it feels solid right you know
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.620
app that it feels solid right you know
it's like there's no jank enos there's

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630
it's like there's no jank enos there's
 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.210
it's like there's no jank enos there's
no oh I can see what they tried to do

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220
no oh I can see what they tried to do
 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.100
no oh I can see what they tried to do
there it just kind of works exactly if

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110
there it just kind of works exactly if
 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.650
there it just kind of works exactly if
you'd hope it does you can see one one

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660
you'd hope it does you can see one one
 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.060
you'd hope it does you can see one one
thing that may not come out in the video

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070
thing that may not come out in the video
 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.000
thing that may not come out in the video
but write something that really

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010
but write something that really
 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.280
but write something that really
impressed us and really made it run

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290
impressed us and really made it run
 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.979
impressed us and really made it run
slower is that there's just a really

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989
slower is that there's just a really
 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.289
slower is that there's just a really
light gradient all the way around here

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299
light gradient all the way around here
 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.780
light gradient all the way around here
and you know we talk a lot about

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790
and you know we talk a lot about
 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.920
and you know we talk a lot about
gradients I think you because there are

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930
gradients I think you because there are
 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.349
gradients I think you because there are
some design guides belonging to our

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359
some design guides belonging to our
 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.080
some design guides belonging to our
competitors that emphasize gradients in

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090
competitors that emphasize gradients in
 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.690
competitors that emphasize gradients in
a way that we find

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700
a way that we find
 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.020
a way that we find
lesk androidy but this is a great use of

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030
lesk androidy but this is a great use of
 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.030
lesk androidy but this is a great use of
gradients it's a wonderful it's you

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040
gradients it's a wonderful it's you
 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.950
gradients it's a wonderful it's you
wouldn't even know it's there if it

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960
wouldn't even know it's there if it
 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.930
wouldn't even know it's there if it
wasn't pointed out to you but it makes

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940
wasn't pointed out to you but it makes
 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.940
wasn't pointed out to you but it makes
the whole thing feel a little deeper a

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950
the whole thing feel a little deeper a
 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.370
the whole thing feel a little deeper a
little more life life and of course it

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380
little more life life and of course it
 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.770
little more life life and of course it
it slowed down rendering because the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780
it slowed down rendering because the
 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.240
it slowed down rendering because the
gradients at that time we're done in and

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250
gradients at that time we're done in and
 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.940
gradients at that time we're done in and
software but once you rendered that all

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950
software but once you rendered that all
 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.390
software but once you rendered that all
out onto one layer then you can rotate

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400
out onto one layer then you can rotate
 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.070
out onto one layer then you can rotate
the layer without actually having to

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080
the layer without actually having to
 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.200
the layer without actually having to
redraw all the gradients every time yeah

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210
redraw all the gradients every time yeah
 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.940
redraw all the gradients every time yeah
I mean you know our designers are very

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950
I mean you know our designers are very
 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.820
I mean you know our designers are very
thankful that you notice the gradient

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830
thankful that you notice the gradient
 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.140
thankful that you notice the gradient
I'm thankful of it I mean again I was

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
I'm thankful of it I mean again I was
 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.430
I'm thankful of it I mean again I was
just one of those things that you know

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440
just one of those things that you know
 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.860
just one of those things that you know
in addition to the interaction piece and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870
in addition to the interaction piece and
 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.730
in addition to the interaction piece and
getting that right

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740
getting that right
 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.590
getting that right
you know the visual aspect the colors

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600
you know the visual aspect the colors
 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.140
you know the visual aspect the colors
the gradients and even kind of the blend

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150
the gradients and even kind of the blend
 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.090
the gradients and even kind of the blend
of the colors you know we spent a lot of

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100
of the colors you know we spent a lot of
 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.010
of the colors you know we spent a lot of
time on that and we're very very proud

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020
time on that and we're very very proud
 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.540
time on that and we're very very proud
of it it's one of those big challenges I

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550
of it it's one of those big challenges I
 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.370
of it it's one of those big challenges I
mean it seems funny like it's it's such

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380
mean it seems funny like it's it's such
 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.770
mean it seems funny like it's it's such
a deceptively simple screen that we're

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780
a deceptively simple screen that we're
 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.510
a deceptively simple screen that we're
looking at here it's a simple pie

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
looking at here it's a simple pie
 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.510
looking at here it's a simple pie
well donut chart you know with a simple

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520
well donut chart you know with a simple
 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.830
well donut chart you know with a simple
sort of explanation of what each thing

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840
sort of explanation of what each thing
 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.450
sort of explanation of what each thing
represents but it's all those little

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460
represents but it's all those little
 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.670
represents but it's all those little
things like I've I think anyone who's

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680
things like I've I think anyone who's
 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.290
things like I've I think anyone who's
done any kind of engineering for any

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300
done any kind of engineering for any
 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.610
done any kind of engineering for any
amount of time has built charting

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620
amount of time has built charting
 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.470
amount of time has built charting
controls from scratch cuz it's like

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480
controls from scratch cuz it's like
 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.270
controls from scratch cuz it's like
databases it's a requirement of every

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280
databases it's a requirement of every
 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.830
databases it's a requirement of every
job you ever do to start from the

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840
job you ever do to start from the
 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.050
job you ever do to start from the
beginning and even simple things like

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060
beginning and even simple things like
 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.550
beginning and even simple things like
choosing what colors you're going to

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560
choosing what colors you're going to
 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.020
choosing what colors you're going to
have because you don't necessarily know

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030
have because you don't necessarily know
 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.370
have because you don't necessarily know
how many categories you're gonna have so

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380
how many categories you're gonna have so
 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.130
how many categories you're gonna have so
it's a pseudo-random color generator but

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140
it's a pseudo-random color generator but
 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.660
it's a pseudo-random color generator but
you need to make sure that each one is

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670
you need to make sure that each one is
 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.100
you need to make sure that each one is
noticeable and that they look well

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110
noticeable and that they look well
 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.600
noticeable and that they look well
together and you know I think that

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610
together and you know I think that
 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.100
together and you know I think that
attention to detail really works well it

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110
attention to detail really works well it
 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.600
attention to detail really works well it
ain't even making it a doughnut instead

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610
ain't even making it a doughnut instead
 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.790
ain't even making it a doughnut instead
of a pie I think and I don't know if

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800
of a pie I think and I don't know if
 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.050
of a pie I think and I don't know if
this is what you had in mind but it

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060
this is what you had in mind but it
 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.380
this is what you had in mind but it
feels like that gives me a clue that I'm

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390
feels like that gives me a clue that I'm
 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.180
feels like that gives me a clue that I'm
gonna interact with it instead of just

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190
gonna interact with it instead of just
 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.830
gonna interact with it instead of just
looking at it yeah well it looks like

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840
looking at it yeah well it looks like
 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.340
looking at it yeah well it looks like
one of those spinning wheels yeah that's

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350
one of those spinning wheels yeah that's
 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.290
one of those spinning wheels yeah that's
that's the one thing you know when I did

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300
that's the one thing you know when I did
 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.570
that's the one thing you know when I did
my version I had to add in with you know

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580
 
 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.640
 
spending money on faster yeah great very

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650
spending money on faster yeah great very
 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.940
spending money on faster yeah great very
cool all right so I guess the two

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950
cool all right so I guess the two
 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.610
cool all right so I guess the two
questions I had so the first one is so

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620
questions I had so the first one is so
 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.879
questions I had so the first one is so
you already had

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889
you already had
 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.129
you already had
a phone app and a website before you had

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139
a phone app and a website before you had
 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.230
a phone app and a website before you had
the tablet out what would you say is

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240
the tablet out what would you say is
 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.730
the tablet out what would you say is
sort of the the biggest change that

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740
sort of the the biggest change that
 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.800
sort of the the biggest change that
you've made in order to make something

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810
you've made in order to make something
 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.179
you've made in order to make something
which was really a great tablet

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:33.189
which was really a great tablet
 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:34.950
which was really a great tablet
experience as opposed to the to the

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960
experience as opposed to the to the
 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.769
experience as opposed to the to the
phone version and and sort of you know

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:37.779
phone version and and sort of you know
 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:39.269
phone version and and sort of you know
more than that what was the result so

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:39.279
more than that what was the result so
 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:41.790
more than that what was the result so
you know what did you do and how has

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800
you know what did you do and how has
 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.290
you know what did you do and how has
that affected your install Raider your

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300
that affected your install Raider your
 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.149
that affected your install Raider your
engagement or any of those sorts of

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:45.159
engagement or any of those sorts of
 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.439
engagement or any of those sorts of
things right so you know when we first

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449
things right so you know when we first
 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:47.879
things right so you know when we first
developed the tablet app as you said we

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889
developed the tablet app as you said we
 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.920
developed the tablet app as you said we
had a phone app already and you know we

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930
had a phone app already and you know we
 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.589
had a phone app already and you know we
weren't 100% sure kind of where folks

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599
weren't 100% sure kind of where folks
 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:53.879
weren't 100% sure kind of where folks
would fall in terms of how they would

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889
would fall in terms of how they would
 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.709
would fall in terms of how they would
use both apps so we said let's release a

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719
use both apps so we said let's release a
 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:57.540
use both apps so we said let's release a
basic version of the tablet app and then

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550
basic version of the tablet app and then
 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.740
basic version of the tablet app and then
let's kind of get some data and let's

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750
let's kind of get some data and let's
 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.420
let's kind of get some data and let's
iterate against that and so one of the

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430
iterate against that and so one of the
 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.589
iterate against that and so one of the
things that we started to find with a

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599
things that we started to find with a
 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.089
things that we started to find with a
tablet app is that people are actually

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099
tablet app is that people are actually
 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:05.790
tablet app is that people are actually
spending more time on the tablet app

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800
spending more time on the tablet app
 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.080
spending more time on the tablet app
basically they're sitting there they're

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090
basically they're sitting there they're
 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.269
basically they're sitting there they're
looking back in their finances and

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:09.279
looking back in their finances and
 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.159
looking back in their finances and
they're also looking forward into their

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:11.169
they're also looking forward into their
 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.439
they're also looking forward into their
finances they said the analysis exactly

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:13.449
finances they said the analysis exactly
 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.570
finances they said the analysis exactly
whereas on the phone it's kind of like

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580
whereas on the phone it's kind of like
 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.700
whereas on the phone it's kind of like
this decision maker you know like you

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710
this decision maker you know like you
 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.079
this decision maker you know like you
might be at the store and you might

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:19.089
might be at the store and you might
 

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:21.019
might be at the store and you might
decide should I really buy this TV

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:21.029
decide should I really buy this TV
 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:23.820
decide should I really buy this TV
saying you figure out yes I can choosing

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830
saying you figure out yes I can choosing
 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.439
saying you figure out yes I can choosing
my consumer electronics budget for this

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:25.449
my consumer electronics budget for this
 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.839
my consumer electronics budget for this
right exactly and then so we started to

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:27.849
right exactly and then so we started to
 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:29.790
right exactly and then so we started to
move down that route of empowering the

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800
move down that route of empowering the
 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.010
move down that route of empowering the
user on the tablet to do things like you

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020
user on the tablet to do things like you
 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.929
user on the tablet to do things like you
know editing budgets and doing split

00:07:33.929 --> 00:07:33.939
know editing budgets and doing split
 

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:35.909
know editing budgets and doing split
transactions and just being able to do

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919
transactions and just being able to do
 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.149
transactions and just being able to do
more in terms of really kind of setting

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:39.159
more in terms of really kind of setting
 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:41.159
more in terms of really kind of setting
their their financial foundation and you

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169
their their financial foundation and you
 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.450
their their financial foundation and you
know looking back at their data and

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:42.460
know looking back at their data and
 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.860
know looking back at their data and
making sure it's kind of jiving with

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:43.870
making sure it's kind of jiving with
 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.290
making sure it's kind of jiving with
what they think so you know our analogy

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.300
what they think so you know our analogy
 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.350
what they think so you know our analogy
is our phone app is basically a snacking

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360
is our phone app is basically a snacking
 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.969
is our phone app is basically a snacking
app like throughout the day your pop and

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:50.979
app like throughout the day your pop and
 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:52.889
app like throughout the day your pop and
peanuts you're you know eating you know

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:52.899
peanuts you're you know eating you know
 

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:55.980
peanuts you're you know eating you know
candy bars and whatnot and then with the

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:55.990
candy bars and whatnot and then with the
 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.809
candy bars and whatnot and then with the
tablet app it's basically like a full

00:07:57.809 --> 00:07:57.819
tablet app it's basically like a full
 

00:07:57.819 --> 00:07:59.279
tablet app it's basically like a full
meal you sit down and you'll kind of

00:07:59.279 --> 00:07:59.289
meal you sit down and you'll kind of
 

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:01.649
meal you sit down and you'll kind of
digest the overview and then you'll you

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:01.659
digest the overview and then you'll you
 

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:03.240
digest the overview and then you'll you
know go deeper into budgets and you

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.250
know go deeper into budgets and you
 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.589
know go deeper into budgets and you
start editing your budgets and things of

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599
start editing your budgets and things of
 

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:06.119
start editing your budgets and things of
that sort I like that that's a nice

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:06.129
that sort I like that that's a nice
 

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:08.189
that sort I like that that's a nice
analogy so um if I understand that

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:08.199
analogy so um if I understand that
 

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.480
analogy so um if I understand that
correctly so you actually are you

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:09.490
correctly so you actually are you
 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.459
correctly so you actually are you
actually putting your spending into the

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:11.469
actually putting your spending into the
 

00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:12.869
actually putting your spending into the
app as you're spending it so if you're

00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879
app as you're spending it so if you're
 

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.129
app as you're spending it so if you're
out at the shops you're actually putting

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:14.139
out at the shops you're actually putting
 

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:17.129
out at the shops you're actually putting
that's that budgetary information in by

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:17.139
that's that budgetary information in by
 

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:19.439
that's that budgetary information in by
the phone app yeah so basically on your

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:19.449
the phone app yeah so basically on your
 

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:20.820
the phone app yeah so basically on your
tablet app you can go and set your

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:20.830
tablet app you can go and set your
 

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.320
tablet app you can go and set your
budgets you can edit your budgets and

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:22.330
budgets you can edit your budgets and
 

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.999
budgets you can edit your budgets and
then when you have your phone app you

00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:24.009
then when you have your phone app you
 

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:25.290
then when you have your phone app you
know that very same budget that you've

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:25.300
know that very same budget that you've
 

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.969
know that very same budget that you've
said you can clearly see how much money

00:08:26.969 --> 00:08:26.979
said you can clearly see how much money
 

00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:28.769
said you can clearly see how much money
you've got left to this particular month

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:28.779
you've got left to this particular month
 

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:30.480
you've got left to this particular month
and then you can dive deeper into the

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:30.490
and then you can dive deeper into the
 

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.309
and then you can dive deeper into the
various you know subcategories and

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:32.319
various you know subcategories and
 

00:08:32.319 --> 00:08:33.149
various you know subcategories and
whatnot and

00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159
whatnot and
 

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.589
whatnot and
you know conversely when you're on your

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599
you know conversely when you're on your
 

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:36.689
you know conversely when you're on your
phone you can enter transactions on the

00:08:36.689 --> 00:08:36.699
phone you can enter transactions on the
 

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:38.369
phone you can enter transactions on the
go and on the fly and then when you get

00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:38.379
go and on the fly and then when you get
 

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:39.869
go and on the fly and then when you get
home you know you can see them show up

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:39.879
home you know you can see them show up
 

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:41.249
home you know you can see them show up
on your tablets and linking it all in

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:41.259
on your tablets and linking it all in
 

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:43.139
on your tablets and linking it all in
and do a little bit more if you wanted

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:43.149
and do a little bit more if you wanted
 

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:44.970
and do a little bit more if you wanted
to so you can find out what punishment

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:44.980
to so you can find out what punishment
 

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.650
to so you can find out what punishment
you've done to your budgets yeah on your

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:46.660
you've done to your budgets yeah on your
 

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.030
you've done to your budgets yeah on your
phone when you get back on yeah that's

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.040
phone when you get back on yeah that's
 

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.569
phone when you get back on yeah that's
nice so so does that mean that the the

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:51.579
nice so so does that mean that the the
 

00:08:51.579 --> 00:08:53.910
nice so so does that mean that the the
tablet app is that something that's sort

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920
tablet app is that something that's sort
 

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.710
tablet app is that something that's sort
of a feature for feature equivalent of

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720
of a feature for feature equivalent of
 

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.179
of a feature for feature equivalent of
what you can do on the website you do

00:08:57.179 --> 00:08:57.189
what you can do on the website you do
 

00:08:57.189 --> 00:08:59.040
what you can do on the website you do
sort of see that in the future is sort

00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.050
sort of see that in the future is sort
 

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.540
sort of see that in the future is sort
of becoming more and more the way that

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:00.550
of becoming more and more the way that
 

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.429
of becoming more and more the way that
maybe people are going to be using the

00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:02.439
maybe people are going to be using the
 

00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:04.499
maybe people are going to be using the
app definitely I mean you know you kind

00:09:04.499 --> 00:09:04.509
app definitely I mean you know you kind
 

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:05.819
app definitely I mean you know you kind
of hit the nail on the head in terms of

00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:05.829
of hit the nail on the head in terms of
 

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:07.319
of hit the nail on the head in terms of
you know we've got a website we've got a

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:07.329
you know we've got a website we've got a
 

00:09:07.329 --> 00:09:09.360
you know we've got a website we've got a
tablet we've got a phone you know where

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:09.370
tablet we've got a phone you know where
 

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.889
tablet we've got a phone you know where
the tablets sit in between and it's

00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:10.899
the tablets sit in between and it's
 

00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:12.689
the tablets sit in between and it's
looking more and more like you know it

00:09:12.689 --> 00:09:12.699
looking more and more like you know it
 

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:14.519
looking more and more like you know it
may kind of replace the web it may kind

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:14.529
may kind of replace the web it may kind
 

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:16.199
may kind of replace the web it may kind
of you know we'll bring some of those

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:16.209
of you know we'll bring some of those
 

00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:18.420
of you know we'll bring some of those
more web like features to the tablet and

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:18.430
more web like features to the tablet and
 

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.009
more web like features to the tablet and
then we'll keep the phone to be very

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:20.019
then we'll keep the phone to be very
 

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:22.590
then we'll keep the phone to be very
simple very decision oriented or kind of

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600
simple very decision oriented or kind of
 

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.300
simple very decision oriented or kind of
enter information oriented and then on

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:24.310
enter information oriented and then on
 

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.889
enter information oriented and then on
the tablet you can do your analysis I

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:25.899
the tablet you can do your analysis I
 

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.179
the tablet you can do your analysis I
mean that's I think something which we

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:27.189
mean that's I think something which we
 

00:09:27.189 --> 00:09:28.860
mean that's I think something which we
go on about quite a bit which is the

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:28.870
go on about quite a bit which is the
 

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.869
go on about quite a bit which is the
idea that on a on a phone you really

00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:30.879
idea that on a on a phone you really
 

00:09:30.879 --> 00:09:32.759
idea that on a on a phone you really
want to have almost a single action so

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:32.769
want to have almost a single action so
 

00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:35.249
want to have almost a single action so
you open it up and there's sort of one

00:09:35.249 --> 00:09:35.259
you open it up and there's sort of one
 

00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:36.780
you open it up and there's sort of one
or two steps to do whatever it is you

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:36.790
or two steps to do whatever it is you
 

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.129
or two steps to do whatever it is you
want to do check to see whether I can

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:38.139
want to do check to see whether I can
 

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:39.960
want to do check to see whether I can
buy this thing or you know basically

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:39.970
buy this thing or you know basically
 

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.460
buy this thing or you know basically
enter the information that I have bought

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:41.470
enter the information that I have bought
 

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.499
enter the information that I have bought
this thing right whereas on the tablet

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:43.509
this thing right whereas on the tablet
 

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:45.569
this thing right whereas on the tablet
you are expecting people to sit down and

00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:45.579
you are expecting people to sit down and
 

00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:47.189
you are expecting people to sit down and
spend a bit more time so you can have a

00:09:47.189 --> 00:09:47.199
spend a bit more time so you can have a
 

00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:48.660
spend a bit more time so you can have a
little bit more of a complex workflow

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:48.670
little bit more of a complex workflow
 

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.179
little bit more of a complex workflow
and have more complex actions yeah and

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:51.189
and have more complex actions yeah and
 

00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:52.559
and have more complex actions yeah and
our day that tells us exactly that I

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:52.569
our day that tells us exactly that I
 

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:54.059
our day that tells us exactly that I
mean you know to the point about

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:54.069
mean you know to the point about
 

00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:56.009

app you know we see most people hopping

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120
app you know we see most people hopping
 

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.850
app you know we see most people hopping
on into the app at about 8:00 you know

00:09:59.850 --> 00:09:59.860
on into the app at about 8:00 you know
 

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.829
on into the app at about 8:00 you know
after 8:00 p.m. and that's what our

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839
after 8:00 p.m. and that's what our
 

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:03.720
after 8:00 p.m. and that's what our
usage spikes between 8:00 and 10:00 so

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:03.730
usage spikes between 8:00 and 10:00 so
 

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.280
usage spikes between 8:00 and 10:00 so

that's cool and so did you see then

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:16.269
that's cool and so did you see then
 

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:17.910
that's cool and so did you see then
obviously we've got a lot of analytics

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920
obviously we've got a lot of analytics
 

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.110
obviously we've got a lot of analytics
which is again something which we tell

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120
which is again something which we tell
 

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.790
which is again something which we tell
people that they need to do you know you

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800
people that they need to do you know you
 

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.530
people that they need to do you know you
need to understand what impact the

experience to tablet that you're in huge

00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:30.009
experience to tablet that you're in huge
 

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:31.710
experience to tablet that you're in huge
was increasing yeah definitely I mean

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.720
was increasing yeah definitely I mean
 

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.519
was increasing yeah definitely I mean
we've seen you know

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:33.529
we've seen you know
 

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:35.650
we've seen you know
a fair amount of usage in terms of just

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:35.660
a fair amount of usage in terms of just
 

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.810
a fair amount of usage in terms of just
you know installs in the app and then

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:37.820
you know installs in the app and then
 

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.420
you know installs in the app and then
just in terms of you know overall time

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:40.430
just in terms of you know overall time
 

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.250
just in terms of you know overall time
spent in the app you know I believe the

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:42.260
spent in the app you know I believe the
 

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.710
spent in the app you know I believe the
number was in the magnitude of 25

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720
number was in the magnitude of 25
 

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.440
number was in the magnitude of 25
percent more time on the app you know

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:47.450
percent more time on the app you know
 

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.870
percent more time on the app you know
versus on the phone so you know again

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880
versus on the phone so you know again
 

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.220
versus on the phone so you know again
big big thing for us

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:51.230
big big thing for us
 

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.870
big big thing for us
you know to know that and to kind of

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880
you know to know that and to kind of
 

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.030
you know to know that and to kind of
make that decision and go down that path

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040
make that decision and go down that path
 

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.730
make that decision and go down that path
very cool that sounds like it sounds

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:57.740
very cool that sounds like it sounds
 

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.710
very cool that sounds like it sounds
like a lot of thought and if it has gone

00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720
like a lot of thought and if it has gone
 

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.329
like a lot of thought and if it has gone
into every aspect of this which is

into every aspect of this which is
 

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:02.800
into every aspect of this which is
really great to see and you can see that

really great to see and you can see that
 

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.199
really great to see and you can see that
from that the polished effect yeah the

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:05.209
from that the polished effect yeah the

because we had mint I think was one of

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:09.410
because we had mint I think was one of
 

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.660
because we had mint I think was one of
the nominees for one of our our clinics

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:10.670
the nominees for one of our our clinics
 

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.250
the nominees for one of our our clinics
a while back but we didn't spend much

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:12.260
a while back but we didn't spend much
 

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.750
a while back but we didn't spend much
time on it because a it was already

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760
time on it because a it was already
 

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.550
time on it because a it was already
great and B we didn't have a demo

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560
great and B we didn't have a demo
 

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.389
great and B we didn't have a demo
account right but you know one thing I

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399
account right but you know one thing I
 

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:20.740
account right but you know one thing I
want to highlight for people watching is

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:20.750
want to highlight for people watching is
 

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.590
want to highlight for people watching is
that this is an app that looks very much

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600
that this is an app that looks very much
 

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.139
that this is an app that looks very much
like I mean it doesn't it doesn't look a

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:26.149
like I mean it doesn't it doesn't look a
 

00:11:26.149 --> 00:11:27.910
like I mean it doesn't it doesn't look a
lot like holo it's got more gradients

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920
lot like holo it's got more gradients
 

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.320
lot like holo it's got more gradients
than we would usually expect to see

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:29.330
than we would usually expect to see
 

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.449
than we would usually expect to see
things like these reflections but it

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:31.459
things like these reflections but it
 

00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:33.160
things like these reflections but it
really works oh yeah you know and I

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.170
really works oh yeah you know and I
 

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.329
really works oh yeah you know and I
think that's something which we spend a

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:34.339
think that's something which we spend a
 

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:35.470
think that's something which we spend a
lot of time telling people like

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480
lot of time telling people like
 

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.790
lot of time telling people like
sometimes you can watch our show and

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800
sometimes you can watch our show and
 

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.500
sometimes you can watch our show and
think we're basically saying make every

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:38.510
think we're basically saying make every
 

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.530
think we're basically saying make every
app look like it should be a native app

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:41.540
app look like it should be a native app
 

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.880
app look like it should be a native app
like you know that is shipped with the

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:42.890
like you know that is shipped with the
 

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.000
like you know that is shipped with the
phone right make everything flat exactly

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.010
phone right make everything flat exactly
 

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.760
phone right make everything flat exactly
flat what and yeah thing to be fair

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:48.770
flat what and yeah thing to be fair
 

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:54.010
flat what and yeah thing to be fair
Roman Nurik does say that but this is a

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.020
Roman Nurik does say that but this is a
 

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.569
Roman Nurik does say that but this is a
really good example of going the whole

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:55.579
really good example of going the whole
 

00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:57.400
really good example of going the whole
way so it's like it doesn't have to be

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.410
way so it's like it doesn't have to be
 

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.170
way so it's like it doesn't have to be
that this still looks consistent with

00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.180
that this still looks consistent with
 

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.639
that this still looks consistent with
Android it looks like it belongs on this

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:00.649
Android it looks like it belongs on this
 

00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:02.800
Android it looks like it belongs on this
device but it does look different to

their desks but probably on their couch
 

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.730
their desks but probably on their couch
or in bed or something like that we

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:21.740
or in bed or something like that we
 

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.170
or in bed or something like that we
definitely knew that people wanted to

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:23.180
definitely knew that people wanted to
 

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.170
definitely knew that people wanted to
get a bigger and better view of their

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.180
get a bigger and better view of their
 

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.600
get a bigger and better view of their
island for anyone who hasn't played the

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:28.610
island for anyone who hasn't played the
 

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.300
island for anyone who hasn't played the
game you you have your own island that

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:31.310
game you you have your own island that
 

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.000
game you you have your own island that
you decorate and by habitats in and then

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.010
you decorate and by habitats in and then
 

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.670
you decorate and by habitats in and then
you hatch and raise different monsters

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680
you hatch and raise different monsters
 

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.610
you hatch and raise different monsters
and then crossbreed them but but we

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:39.620
and then crossbreed them but but we
 

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.900
and then crossbreed them but but we
wanted to make sure that people got as

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:40.910
wanted to make sure that people got as
 

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.240
wanted to make sure that people got as
big and as clear view of the island as

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:43.250
big and as clear view of the island as
 

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.370
big and as clear view of the island as
possible so we took advantage of the

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:45.380
possible so we took advantage of the
 

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.340
possible so we took advantage of the
full side of the size of the screen and

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:48.350
full side of the size of the screen and
 

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.829
full side of the size of the screen and
we made sure that we had high resolution

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839
we made sure that we had high resolution
 

00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:54.280
we made sure that we had high resolution
assets for for all of the buildings all

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:54.290
assets for for all of the buildings all
 

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.290
assets for for all of the buildings all
of the monsters everything that people

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:56.300
of the monsters everything that people
 

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.490
of the monsters everything that people
would be seeing yes that's looks

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:57.500
would be seeing yes that's looks
 

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.230
would be seeing yes that's looks
fantastic I think it's the first thing

00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240
fantastic I think it's the first thing
 

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.030
fantastic I think it's the first thing
that I noticed like you've got the full

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040
that I noticed like you've got the full
 

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.069
that I noticed like you've got the full
screen experience with the sort of the

00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079
screen experience with the sort of the
 

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:05.290
screen experience with the sort of the
chrome the game chrome is big enough

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:05.300
chrome the game chrome is big enough
 

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.940
chrome the game chrome is big enough
without being too big so it doesn't look

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:06.950
without being too big so it doesn't look
 

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.350
without being too big so it doesn't look
like it's been stretched but it's all

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360
like it's been stretched but it's all
 

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.180
like it's been stretched but it's all
big enough to touch and the assets just

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:10.190
big enough to touch and the assets just
 

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:10.870
big enough to touch and the assets just
look gorgeous

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880
look gorgeous
 

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.970
look gorgeous
really gross yeah you guys have come

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:12.980
really gross yeah you guys have come
 

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.190
really gross yeah you guys have come
such a long way since I remember when we

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:15.200
such a long way since I remember when we
 

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.220
such a long way since I remember when we
first got in touch you guys were working

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:18.230
first got in touch you guys were working
 

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.319
first got in touch you guys were working
on was it tap resort or the is a little

00:16:23.319 --> 00:16:23.329
on was it tap resort or the is a little
 

00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:25.420
on was it tap resort or the is a little
island game yes yeah that would have

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:25.430
island game yes yeah that would have
 

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.730
island game yes yeah that would have
been tempers or yeah and and that was

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:27.740
been tempers or yeah and and that was
 

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.530
been tempers or yeah and and that was
the first thing that we noticed was you

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:29.540
the first thing that we noticed was you
 

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.930
the first thing that we noticed was you
know the the assets didn't didn't scale

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:31.940
know the the assets didn't didn't scale
 

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.970
know the the assets didn't didn't scale
very well and there's you know a lot of

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:33.980
very well and there's you know a lot of
 

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.160
very well and there's you know a lot of
things that come over from phone and I

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.170
things that come over from phone and I
 

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.569
things that come over from phone and I
remember we sat down and talked to you

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:37.579
remember we sat down and talked to you
 

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:40.569
remember we sat down and talked to you
about you know the different you know

00:16:40.569 --> 00:16:40.579
about you know the different you know
 

00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:42.910
about you know the different you know
form factors in Android and took a while

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920
form factors in Android and took a while
 

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.460
form factors in Android and took a while
but it seems like I you guys really took

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.470
but it seems like I you guys really took
 

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.540
but it seems like I you guys really took
that to heart I mean didn't you go back

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:46.550
that to heart I mean didn't you go back
 

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.060
that to heart I mean didn't you go back
and basically you wrote a cross-platform

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.070
and basically you wrote a cross-platform
 

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.720
and basically you wrote a cross-platform
engine which works really well we're

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:52.730
engine which works really well we're
 

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.630
engine which works really well we're
able to get great performance out of it

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:55.640
able to get great performance out of it
 

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.819
able to get great performance out of it
but most importantly you've got these

00:16:57.819 --> 00:16:57.829
but most importantly you've got these
 

00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:58.390
but most importantly you've got these
images

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:58.400
images
 

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.790
images
just fantastic even at these really high

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800
just fantastic even at these really high
 

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.530
just fantastic even at these really high
zoom I'm very impressed fantastic yeah

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:05.540
zoom I'm very impressed fantastic yeah
 

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.530
zoom I'm very impressed fantastic yeah
we we did we were originally with the

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:08.540
we we did we were originally with the
 

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.880
we we did we were originally with the
older game that you were talking about

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:09.890
older game that you were talking about
 

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.600
older game that you were talking about
we were porting our apps and essentially

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:13.610
we were porting our apps and essentially
 

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.610
we were porting our apps and essentially
had two different code bases running but

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:15.620
had two different code bases running but
 

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.829
had two different code bases running but
always when we started to take this very

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839
always when we started to take this very
 

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.690
always when we started to take this very
seriously we knew that we needed a

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:19.700
seriously we knew that we needed a
 

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.910
seriously we knew that we needed a
cross-platform engine which we wrote and

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:21.920
cross-platform engine which we wrote and
 

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.890
cross-platform engine which we wrote and
probably one of the biggest challenges

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:23.900
probably one of the biggest challenges
 

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.020
probably one of the biggest challenges
was how are we gonna deal with all these

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.030
was how are we gonna deal with all these
 

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.010
was how are we gonna deal with all these
different aspect ratios and because we

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.020
different aspect ratios and because we
 

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.240
different aspect ratios and because we
knew that we were we were now dealing

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:31.250
knew that we were we were now dealing
 

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.730
knew that we were we were now dealing
with more than one screen size and just

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:33.740
with more than one screen size and just
 

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.620
with more than one screen size and just
stretching everything wasn't going to to

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:35.630
stretching everything wasn't going to to
 

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.780
stretching everything wasn't going to to
cut it you know one thing I do remember

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:37.790
cut it you know one thing I do remember
 

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.650
cut it you know one thing I do remember
too is that you know that we we had a

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:41.660
too is that you know that we we had a
 

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.910
too is that you know that we we had a
talking I think you actually if I

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:42.920
talking I think you actually if I
 

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.160
talking I think you actually if I
remember right had a an excellent blog

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.170
remember right had a an excellent blog
 

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.850
remember right had a an excellent blog
post about just how you were able to

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:48.860
post about just how you were able to
 

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.300
post about just how you were able to
grow your revenue by concentrating on

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:52.310
grow your revenue by concentrating on
 

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.640
grow your revenue by concentrating on
treating and leur Android like Android

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:54.650
treating and leur Android like Android
 

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.860
treating and leur Android like Android
instead of porting from some other

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:56.870
instead of porting from some other
 

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.180
instead of porting from some other
platform that didn't have the same

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:58.190
platform that didn't have the same
 

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.120
platform that didn't have the same
benefits and challenges right yeah it

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.130
benefits and challenges right yeah it
 

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.800
benefits and challenges right yeah it
has been a whole different it's a whole

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:02.810
has been a whole different it's a whole
 

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.630
has been a whole different it's a whole
different ecosystem and and different

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640
different ecosystem and and different
 

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.510
different ecosystem and and different
strategies have worked well for us I'm a

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520
strategies have worked well for us I'm a
 

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.210
strategies have worked well for us I'm a
coder so I'm not I probably can't speak

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.220
coder so I'm not I probably can't speak
 

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.370
coder so I'm not I probably can't speak
too much to the to the financial side of

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:12.380
too much to the to the financial side of
 

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.070
too much to the to the financial side of
things but we we have treated each

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080
things but we we have treated each
 

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.130
things but we we have treated each
platform on the engineering side it's

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:18.140
platform on the engineering side it's
 

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.680
platform on the engineering side it's
all fairly unified but the monetization

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:20.690
all fairly unified but the monetization
 

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.420
all fairly unified but the monetization
strategies are very different on each

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:22.430
strategies are very different on each
 

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.300
strategies are very different on each
ecosystem yeah that's interesting you

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:25.310
ecosystem yeah that's interesting you
 

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.290
ecosystem yeah that's interesting you
know given that you are on the

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:26.300
know given that you are on the
 

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.010
know given that you are on the
engineering side

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.020
engineering side
 

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.230

I'd like to dig a little bit deeper if

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240
I'd like to dig a little bit deeper if
 

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.820
I'd like to dig a little bit deeper if
possible to find out you know what were

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:30.830
possible to find out you know what were
 

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.350
possible to find out you know what were
some of the techniques that you use to

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360
some of the techniques that you use to
 

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.240
some of the techniques that you use to
get past the that challenge that you

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:34.250
get past the that challenge that you
 

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.560
get past the that challenge that you
said of all the different aspect ratios

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:35.570
said of all the different aspect ratios
 

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.080
said of all the different aspect ratios
and screen sizes is there something that

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.090
and screen sizes is there something that
 

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.370
and screen sizes is there something that
you can share with some of the

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:39.380
you can share with some of the
 

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.780
you can share with some of the
developers watching - you're probably

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:40.790
developers watching - you're probably
 

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.420
developers watching - you're probably
facing a lot of those same issues sure

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:43.430
facing a lot of those same issues sure
 

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.770
facing a lot of those same issues sure
sure absolutely

like a like a lot of games we're using

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:47.630
like a like a lot of games we're using

the NDK we're writing the bulk of our
 

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.660
the NDK we're writing the bulk of our
game code in C++ and the like I said

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:55.670
game code in C++ and the like I said
 

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.980
game code in C++ and the like I said
right out of the gate we knew we needed

right out of the gate we knew we needed
 

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.190

to deal with this not so much the screen

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200
to deal with this not so much the screen
 

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.910
to deal with this not so much the screen
size issue but the aspect ratio issue

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:02.920
size issue but the aspect ratio issue
 

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.650
size issue but the aspect ratio issue
some devices are extremely widescreen

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:05.660
some devices are extremely widescreen
 

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.200
some devices are extremely widescreen
others are taller you know than

others are taller you know than
 

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.419

right yeah we we don't we don't pretend

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:24.980
right yeah we we don't we don't pretend
 

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.109
right yeah we we don't we don't pretend
that it's for three we actually so since

scaling and whatnot
 

00:19:37.279 --> 00:19:39.879
scaling and whatnot
we look at the raw number of pixels on

00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:39.889
we look at the raw number of pixels on
 

00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:42.430
we look at the raw number of pixels on
the screen and based on that decide how

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440
the screen and based on that decide how
 

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.980
the screen and based on that decide how
much we're gonna have to scale the UI

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:44.990
much we're gonna have to scale the UI
 

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.100
much we're gonna have to scale the UI

that we do have high resolution assets

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:50.990
that we do have high resolution assets
 

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.169
that we do have high resolution assets
that we use if we do decide we need to

00:19:53.169 --> 00:19:53.179
that we use if we do decide we need to
 

00:19:53.179 --> 00:19:55.060
that we use if we do decide we need to
scale a button to twice its original

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.070
scale a button to twice its original
 

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.470
scale a button to twice its original
size we use a double sized art asset for

00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480
size we use a double sized art asset for
 

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.899
size we use a double sized art asset for
that so it doesn't look blurry like it

00:20:01.899 --> 00:20:01.909
that so it doesn't look blurry like it
 

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:03.489
that so it doesn't look blurry like it
would be if you just if you just scaled

00:20:03.489 --> 00:20:03.499
would be if you just if you just scaled
 

00:20:03.499 --> 00:20:04.930
would be if you just if you just scaled
it up without using a larger asset

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:04.940
it up without using a larger asset
 

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.940
it up without using a larger asset
that's a really interesting point do you

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:06.950
that's a really interesting point do you
 

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.820
that's a really interesting point do you
make that decision initially based on

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:09.830
make that decision initially based on
 

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.950
make that decision initially based on
the screen size which assets you'll load

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960
the screen size which assets you'll load
 

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.930
the screen size which assets you'll load
or do you actually make it on an asset

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:13.940
or do you actually make it on an asset
 

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.060
or do you actually make it on an asset
by asset basis trying to determine how

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.070
by asset basis trying to determine how
 

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.119
by asset basis trying to determine how
much it's going to scale we don't do the

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:19.129
much it's going to scale we don't do the
 

00:20:19.129 --> 00:20:20.950
much it's going to scale we don't do the
the second technique you're talking

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960
the second technique you're talking
 

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.480
the second technique you're talking
about would be like level of detail

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:22.490
about would be like level of detail
 

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.399
about would be like level of detail
based on how big it is decide which

00:20:24.399 --> 00:20:24.409
based on how big it is decide which
 

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:27.519
based on how big it is decide which
asset to use we don't do that we decide

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:27.529
asset to use we don't do that we decide
 

00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:30.340
asset to use we don't do that we decide
based on the the raw number of pixels in

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:30.350
based on the the raw number of pixels in
 

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.470
based on the the raw number of pixels in

the display we think we're gonna need
 

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.930
the display we think we're gonna need
you know single size assets or double

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:34.940
you know single size assets or double
 

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.359
you know single size assets or double
size assets so do you bucket them I'm

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:37.369
size assets so do you bucket them I'm
 

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:38.590
size assets so do you bucket them I'm
really curious your bucket on the same

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600
really curious your bucket on the same
 

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.419
really curious your bucket on the same
way we do or do you have a different

00:20:40.419 --> 00:20:40.429
way we do or do you have a different
 

00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:44.649
way we do or do you have a different
scheme I'm not sure if you I know in the

00:20:44.649 --> 00:20:44.659
scheme I'm not sure if you I know in the
 

00:20:44.659 --> 00:20:47.019
scheme I'm not sure if you I know in the
in the standard Android SDK there's a

00:20:47.019 --> 00:20:47.029
in the standard Android SDK there's a
 

00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:49.269
in the standard Android SDK there's a
number of folders for medium resolution

00:20:49.269 --> 00:20:49.279
number of folders for medium resolution
 

00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:51.180
number of folders for medium resolution
and high resolution and things like that

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:51.190
and high resolution and things like that
 

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.279
and high resolution and things like that
we have what we call just the single

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:54.289
we have what we call just the single
 

00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:56.320
we have what we call just the single
resolution the One X and the double

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.330
resolution the One X and the double
 

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.389
resolution the One X and the double
resolution the the two X we're not using

00:20:58.389 --> 00:20:58.399
resolution the the two X we're not using
 

00:20:58.399 --> 00:21:01.389
resolution the the two X we're not using
other intermediate sizes gotcha that

00:21:01.389 --> 00:21:01.399
other intermediate sizes gotcha that
 

00:21:01.399 --> 00:21:02.619
other intermediate sizes gotcha that
makes sense in effect we've we've

00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:02.629
makes sense in effect we've we've
 

00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:05.109
makes sense in effect we've we've
actually found that for most cases that

00:21:05.109 --> 00:21:05.119
actually found that for most cases that
 

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:07.210
actually found that for most cases that
actually works pretty well like it's not

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:07.220
actually works pretty well like it's not
 

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.619
actually works pretty well like it's not
always necessary even when you're using

00:21:08.619 --> 00:21:08.629
always necessary even when you're using
 

00:21:08.629 --> 00:21:11.499
always necessary even when you're using
the SDK to use each of those buckets and

00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:11.509
the SDK to use each of those buckets and
 

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:13.299
the SDK to use each of those buckets and
in fact when you're you know just

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:13.309
in fact when you're you know just
 

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:15.249
in fact when you're you know just
providing something very high res which

00:21:15.249 --> 00:21:15.259
providing something very high res which
 

00:21:15.259 --> 00:21:16.320
providing something very high res which
can then scale back

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:16.330
can then scale back
 

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.090
can then scale back
works pretty well until you get to the

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.100
works pretty well until you get to the
 

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.290
works pretty well until you get to the
point where you almost needed a

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:19.300
point where you almost needed a
 

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.930
point where you almost needed a
different style asset to work at the

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:21.940
different style asset to work at the
 

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.940
different style asset to work at the
reduced resolution yeah of course you're

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:23.950
reduced resolution yeah of course you're
 

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.330
reduced resolution yeah of course you're
also doing some some quite fancy scaling

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:27.340
also doing some some quite fancy scaling
 

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.710
also doing some some quite fancy scaling
work here yeah sort of zooming in on the

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:31.720
work here yeah sort of zooming in on the
 

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.760
work here yeah sort of zooming in on the
on the world

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:32.770
on the world
 

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.840
on the world
yeah we're zooming in and out and is

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:36.850
yeah we're zooming in and out and is
 

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.330
yeah we're zooming in and out and is
that just a set of mipmap textures or or

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.340
that just a set of mipmap textures or or
 

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.350
that just a set of mipmap textures or or
DUI we're actually we're we're not using

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360
DUI we're actually we're we're not using
 

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.970
DUI we're actually we're we're not using
the maps we're just using this single

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:44.980
the maps we're just using this single
 

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.130
the maps we're just using this single
the single high resolution texture

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:47.140
the single high resolution texture
 

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.110
the single high resolution texture
that's why you can zoom in as far as you

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120
that's why you can zoom in as far as you
 

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.180
that's why you can zoom in as far as you
are so that a single building fills up

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.190
are so that a single building fills up
 

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.910
are so that a single building fills up
the entire screen Wow because because we

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:53.920
the entire screen Wow because because we
 

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.800
the entire screen Wow because because we
are using those those high resolution

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:55.810
are using those those high resolution
 

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.040
are using those those high resolution
textures yeah yeah MIT maps are really

00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.050
textures yeah yeah MIT maps are really
 

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.660
textures yeah yeah MIT maps are really
nice for scaling but of course they use

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:00.670
nice for scaling but of course they use
 

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.760
nice for scaling but of course they use
a lot more memory and we are still

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:02.770
a lot more memory and we are still
 

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.520
a lot more memory and we are still
somewhat memory constrained that's

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:05.530
somewhat memory constrained that's
 

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.360
somewhat memory constrained that's
really interesting

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:06.370
really interesting
 

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.520
really interesting
why would it be well I would actually be

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:08.530
why would it be well I would actually be
 

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.640
why would it be well I would actually be
very interested to to know how that

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:11.650
very interested to to know how that
 

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:12.720
very interested to to know how that
affects your performance because

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:12.730
affects your performance because
 

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.570
affects your performance because
typically you know we'll see is new maps

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:15.580
typically you know we'll see is new maps
 

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.220
typically you know we'll see is new maps
will take up more more room in memory

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:17.230
will take up more more room in memory
 

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.300
will take up more more room in memory
obviously but they'll also I render

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:21.310
obviously but they'll also I render
 

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.240
obviously but they'll also I render
faster exactly because they're less GPU

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:24.250
faster exactly because they're less GPU
 

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.970
faster exactly because they're less GPU
bandwidth on the way in right so I'm

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:26.980

able to get this framerate with nothing

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720
able to get this framerate with nothing
 

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.190

the on the screen but for us for the
 

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.190
the on the screen but for us for the
kind of games that we're making right

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200
kind of games that we're making right
 

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.490

speed gotcha yeah it certainly it just

00:22:59.520 --> 00:22:59.530
speed gotcha yeah it certainly it just
 

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.920
speed gotcha yeah it certainly it just
looks really smooth so I think that's

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:01.930

you know for that experience I think

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:35.970
you know for that experience I think
 

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.790
you know for that experience I think
tablets as well and especially one when

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:37.800

like that back no good I can see

00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919
like that back no good I can see
 

00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:44.680
like that back no good I can see
something yeah I've seen them in that

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:44.690
something yeah I've seen them in that
 

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.419
something yeah I've seen them in that
corner oh great great yeah so we were

00:29:46.419 --> 00:29:46.429
corner oh great great yeah so we were
 

00:29:46.429 --> 00:29:49.240
corner oh great great yeah so we were
sight I think people forget actually the

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:49.250
sight I think people forget actually the
 

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.620
sight I think people forget actually the
lessons of history because if you think

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:50.630
lessons of history because if you think
 

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.760
lessons of history because if you think
about even

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:51.770
about even
 

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.410
about even
you know the the first version of

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:53.420
you know the the first version of
 

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.360
you know the the first version of
Microsoft Office for Mac for instance

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:55.370
Microsoft Office for Mac for instance
 

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:56.980
Microsoft Office for Mac for instance
and Office for Mac a lot of people don't

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:56.990
and Office for Mac a lot of people don't
 

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.490
and Office for Mac a lot of people don't
realize is actually very profitable and

00:29:59.490 --> 00:29:59.500
realize is actually very profitable and
 

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.560
realize is actually very profitable and
well-respected product but the first

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:02.570
well-respected product but the first
 

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.600
well-respected product but the first
version was universally reviled it was

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:04.610
version was universally reviled it was
 

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.830
version was universally reviled it was
mostly because they took their Windows

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840
mostly because they took their Windows
 

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.750
mostly because they took their Windows
product and plopped it directly on the

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760
product and plopped it directly on the
 

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.430
product and plopped it directly on the
Mac yeah that's never gonna fly right

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440
Mac yeah that's never gonna fly right
 

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.410
Mac yeah that's never gonna fly right
and an it doesn't fly to go back the

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:11.420
and an it doesn't fly to go back the
 

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.300
and an it doesn't fly to go back the
other way either I've had some some

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.310
other way either I've had some some
 

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.590
other way either I've had some some
things that were obviously written for

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600
things that were obviously written for
 

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.000
things that were obviously written for
Mac on my Windows machine and they just

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.010
Mac on my Windows machine and they just
 

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.190
Mac on my Windows machine and they just
don't jibe right it's all the little

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200
don't jibe right it's all the little
 

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.900
don't jibe right it's all the little
things it's like you hit a drop-down and

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:19.910
things it's like you hit a drop-down and
 

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.460
things it's like you hit a drop-down and
the drop-down in Mac and Windows is

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:21.470
the drop-down in Mac and Windows is
 

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:22.900
the drop-down in Mac and Windows is
different it's exactly the same

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:22.910
different it's exactly the same
 

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.000
different it's exactly the same
functionality but it looks different and

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.010
functionality but it looks different and
 

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.500
functionality but it looks different and
it's that cognitive dissonance where

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:26.510
it's that cognitive dissonance where
 

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.290
it's that cognitive dissonance where
you're like wait how do I select this oh

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:29.300
you're like wait how do I select this oh
 

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.040
you're like wait how do I select this oh
okay

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:30.050
okay
 

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.470
okay
that slight little pause breaks you out

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480
that slight little pause breaks you out
 

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.000
that slight little pause breaks you out
of that mindset of whatever it is that

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.010
of that mindset of whatever it is that
 

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.230
of that mindset of whatever it is that
you were doing is you don't want to have

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240
you were doing is you don't want to have
 

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.430
you were doing is you don't want to have
to think about the app you just want to

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440
to think about the app you just want to
 

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.840
to think about the app you just want to
be able to do whatever the app lets you

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:37.850
be able to do whatever the app lets you
 

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.240
be able to do whatever the app lets you
do right so respecting the platform and

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:40.250
do right so respecting the platform and
 

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.980
do right so respecting the platform and
and respect the user who chose to buy

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:41.990
and respect the user who chose to buy
 

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.540
and respect the user who chose to buy
that slat form it's like you don't have

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:43.550
that slat form it's like you don't have
 

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.160
that slat form it's like you don't have
to worry about us you know we can take

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:45.170
to worry about us you know we can take
 

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.960
to worry about us you know we can take
it but it's about the users which are

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:46.970
it but it's about the users which are
 

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.160
it but it's about the users which are
trying to you know leverage your app so

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.170
trying to you know leverage your app so
 

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.750
trying to you know leverage your app so
we've got we've got Instapaper up on the

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760
we've got we've got Instapaper up on the
 

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.130
we've got we've got Instapaper up on the
screen can you tell us a little bit

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:54.140
screen can you tell us a little bit
 

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.750
screen can you tell us a little bit
about the the way that you went about

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760
about the the way that you went about
 

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.970
about the the way that you went about
designing a tablet specific version of

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:57.980
designing a tablet specific version of
 

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.840
designing a tablet specific version of
the app and sort of what are the the key

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:00.850
the app and sort of what are the the key
 

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.400
the app and sort of what are the the key
decisions that you made and how that has

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:03.410
decisions that you made and how that has
 

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.160
decisions that you made and how that has
affected usage of the app yeah

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.170
affected usage of the app yeah
 

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.060
affected usage of the app yeah
absolutely

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.070
absolutely
 

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.310
absolutely
so I think unlike a lot of Android

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320
so I think unlike a lot of Android
 

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:09.880
so I think unlike a lot of Android
development

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:09.890
development
 

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.540
development
we started with tablet primarily we

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:13.550
we started with tablet primarily we
 

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.460
we started with tablet primarily we
actually designed out the 7-inch and

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:15.470
actually designed out the 7-inch and
 

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.380
actually designed out the 7-inch and
10-inch layouts or tablet before we even

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:17.390
10-inch layouts or tablet before we even
 

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:19.240
10-inch layouts or tablet before we even
looked at the phone based layouts that's

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:19.250
looked at the phone based layouts that's
 

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.090
looked at the phone based layouts that's
really felt like this was for for for

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.100
really felt like this was for for for
 

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.830
really felt like this was for for for
people that read no there's a lot of

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840
people that read no there's a lot of
 

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.350
people that read no there's a lot of
competition in this space now for read

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360
competition in this space now for read
 

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.850
competition in this space now for read
it later style you know consumption but

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:29.860
it later style you know consumption but
 

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.070
it later style you know consumption but
instead papers really for reading and as

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080
instead papers really for reading and as
 

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.650

soon as we picked up a 7-inch tablet we

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:35.660
soon as we picked up a 7-inch tablet we
 

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.360
soon as we picked up a 7-inch tablet we
really knew that that was that was a

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:37.370
really knew that that was that was a
 

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.960
really knew that that was that was a
great place to be we we deploy onto

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:40.970
great place to be we we deploy onto
 

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.630
great place to be we we deploy onto
Kindle as well with the same same way

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:43.640
Kindle as well with the same same way
 

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.760

outs and nook that was very important

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:45.770
outs and nook that was very important
 

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.050
outs and nook that was very important
because we wanted to get the people that

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:47.060
because we wanted to get the people that
 

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.870
because we wanted to get the people that
were we're buying primarily reading

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880
were we're buying primarily reading
 

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.240
were we're buying primarily reading
devices as well as certain people

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:52.250
devices as well as certain people
 

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.940
devices as well as certain people
in the Google Playstore that have these

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:54.950
in the Google Playstore that have these
 

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:59.140
in the Google Playstore that have these
tablets so it was a pretty easy decision

00:31:59.140 --> 00:31:59.150
tablets so it was a pretty easy decision
 

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.390
tablets so it was a pretty easy decision
to make once once we held those tablets

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:01.400
to make once once we held those tablets
 

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.090
to make once once we held those tablets

just just looking at it here I can see
 

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.130
just just looking at it here I can see
straight away what it reminds me of is

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:15.140
straight away what it reminds me of is

experience for being optimized for being
 

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.610
experience for being optimized for being
able to read content so it's it's a very

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.620
able to read content so it's it's a very
 

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.760
able to read content so it's it's a very
simple display very sparse without being

other thing that I noticed about this
 

00:33:32.419 --> 00:33:33.549
other thing that I noticed about this
design that I think is really

00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559
design that I think is really
 

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:35.890
design that I think is really
interesting as a lot of people well

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:35.900
interesting as a lot of people well
 

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.600
interesting as a lot of people well
almost everyone I think that writes a

almost everyone I think that writes a
 

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.950
almost everyone I think that writes a
tablet app will start with a two column

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960
tablet app will start with a two column
 

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.770
tablet app will start with a two column
layout there's a you know a

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:43.780
layout there's a you know a
 

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.510

detail on the right right sorry I and
you guys did not do that you you go with

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:53.150
you guys did not do that you you go with
 

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.380
you guys did not do that you you go with
a two column view that's it makes me

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:56.390
a two column view that's it makes me
 

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.360
a two column view that's it makes me
think of a newspaper and I think that's

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:58.370
think of a newspaper and I think that's
 

00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:59.590
think of a newspaper and I think that's
very effective is it's really

00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600
very effective is it's really
 

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.360
very effective is it's really
interesting layout and so that just

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:02.370
interesting layout and so that just
 

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.190
interesting layout and so that just
goes to the same tenant and we believe

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200
goes to the same tenant and we believe
 

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.900
goes to the same tenant and we believe
that the content is king and in some

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:05.910
that the content is king and in some
 

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.910
that the content is king and in some
favor and we want to give you as much

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:07.920
favor and we want to give you as much
 

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.210
favor and we want to give you as much
content without without you know we're

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220
content without without you know we're
 

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.070
content without without you know we're
not just space-filling here we put two

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080
not just space-filling here we put two
 

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.710
not just space-filling here we put two
columns up so that you could see the

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720
columns up so that you could see the
 

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.830
columns up so that you could see the
most recent articles that you saved or

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:18.840
most recent articles that you saved or
 

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.090
most recent articles that you saved or
get a little bit more content on the

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:20.100
get a little bit more content on the
 

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.770
get a little bit more content on the
screen so you can quickly and get into

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780
screen so you can quickly and get into
 

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.570
screen so you can quickly and get into
that reading experience yeah I think

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.580
that reading experience yeah I think
 

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.760
that reading experience yeah I think
it's a really good point but a lot of

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:25.770
it's a really good point but a lot of
 

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.379
it's a really good point but a lot of
the way that this is presented is like

00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:27.389
the way that this is presented is like
 

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:29.450
the way that this is presented is like
you say sort of inspired by newspapers I

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:29.460
you say sort of inspired by newspapers I
 

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.020
you say sort of inspired by newspapers I
would say you know in that you can fit

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.030
would say you know in that you can fit
 

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.940
would say you know in that you can fit
probably as many articles probably not

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:34.950
probably as many articles probably not
 

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:36.139
probably as many articles probably not
quite as many if you just had this

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:36.149
quite as many if you just had this
 

00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:38.090
quite as many if you just had this
listed vertically with the same amount

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:38.100
listed vertically with the same amount
 

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.129
listed vertically with the same amount
of text but it would look kind of weird

00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139
of text but it would look kind of weird
 

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:41.570
of text but it would look kind of weird
because you'd have these really long

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580
because you'd have these really long
 

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.280
because you'd have these really long
lines I wouldn't be nearly as readable

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.290
lines I wouldn't be nearly as readable
 

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.629
lines I wouldn't be nearly as readable
either no absolutely not

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639
either no absolutely not
 

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.070
either no absolutely not
and so here you've kind of taken that

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080
and so here you've kind of taken that
 

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.869
and so here you've kind of taken that
approach which we've learned from

00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879
approach which we've learned from
 

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:50.240
approach which we've learned from
however many decades of printing

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:50.250
however many decades of printing
 

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.430
however many decades of printing
newspapers that people can read columns

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440
newspapers that people can read columns
 

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.980
newspapers that people can read columns
much more easily than lots of long flat

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:54.990
much more easily than lots of long flat
 

00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:58.160
much more easily than lots of long flat
strings and so I love to see apps which

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:58.170
strings and so I love to see apps which
 

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.650
strings and so I love to see apps which
take things which we've learned from

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660
take things which we've learned from
 

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.030
take things which we've learned from
other industries and saying well you

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040
other industries and saying well you
 

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.960
other industries and saying well you
know what it's actually not that

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:02.970
know what it's actually not that
 

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.360
know what it's actually not that
different what you creating here is an

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:05.370
different what you creating here is an
 

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.700
different what you creating here is an
instant paper or a way for people to be

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:07.710
instant paper or a way for people to be
 

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.370
instant paper or a way for people to be
able to come to to quickly scan browsing

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380
able to come to to quickly scan browsing
 

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.830
able to come to to quickly scan browsing
and read content yeah and in fact I have

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:12.840
and read content yeah and in fact I have
 

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.690
and read content yeah and in fact I have
to say now when I when I click through

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700
to say now when I when I click through
 

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.150
to say now when I when I click through
to one of the stories and it takes up

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160
to one of the stories and it takes up
 

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.620
to one of the stories and it takes up
the entire width of the screen I'm

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:18.630
the entire width of the screen I'm
 

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:21.500
the entire width of the screen I'm
actually kind of disappointed that's

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:21.510
actually kind of disappointed that's
 

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.180
actually kind of disappointed that's
that's interesting I mean I think it's

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:23.190
that's interesting I mean I think it's
 

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.950
that's interesting I mean I think it's
one of the bigger challenges so I'd be

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960
one of the bigger challenges so I'd be
 

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.240
one of the bigger challenges so I'd be
interested to know when you're sort of

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:26.250
interested to know when you're sort of
 

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.040
interested to know when you're sort of
looking at the the detailed view for any

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.050
looking at the the detailed view for any
 

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.680
looking at the the detailed view for any
of the articles you know how much of

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:30.690
of the articles you know how much of
 

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.540
of the articles you know how much of
this is reformatted how much of it are

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:32.550
this is reformatted how much of it are
 

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.250
this is reformatted how much of it are
you displaying this just I say just are

you displaying this just I say just are
 

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.870
you displaying this just I say just are
you displaying this in a web view and

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880
you displaying this in a web view and
 

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.000
you displaying this in a web view and
just pulling the raw content out are you

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.010
just pulling the raw content out are you
 

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.090
just pulling the raw content out are you
doing any kind of reformatting to it

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:40.100
doing any kind of reformatting to it
 

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.430
doing any kind of reformatting to it
yeah so the Asteria provides the

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440
yeah so the Asteria provides the
 

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.520
yeah so the Asteria provides the
basically overall HTML content we pull

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:46.530
basically overall HTML content we pull
 

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.260
basically overall HTML content we pull
that down and cache it locally on your

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:48.270
that down and cache it locally on your
 

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.350
that down and cache it locally on your
SD card or your local storage and then

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:51.360
SD card or your local storage and then
 

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.630
SD card or your local storage and then
we have a web view that that just opens

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640
we have a web view that that just opens
 

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.650
we have a web view that that just opens
up that content and we apply a cascading

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660
up that content and we apply a cascading
 

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.210
up that content and we apply a cascading
style sheet to that and some JavaScript

00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220
style sheet to that and some JavaScript
 

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.060
style sheet to that and some JavaScript
as well and that allows you to different

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:02.070
as well and that allows you to different
 

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.050
as well and that allows you to different
things like changing the font size to

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060
things like changing the font size to
 

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.570
things like changing the font size to
change the font change the line spacing

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:05.580
change the font change the line spacing
 

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.880
change the font change the line spacing
line height the margins that kind of

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:07.890
line height the margins that kind of
 

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.290
line height the margins that kind of
stuff very cool

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300
stuff very cool
 

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.180

this whole exactly this we're just sort

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:14.670
this whole exactly this we're just sort

of clicking on the on the font control
dialog here and one of the things that I

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:19.860
dialog here and one of the things that I
 

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.230
dialog here and one of the things that I
guess I want to point out is that again

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240
guess I want to point out is that again
 

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.060

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:44.070
working I'd kind of like to see an up
 

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.530
working I'd kind of like to see an up
affordance here but that's kind of

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.540
affordance here but that's kind of
 

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.300
affordance here but that's kind of
getting a little bit nitpicky I think

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:47.310
getting a little bit nitpicky I think
 

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.180
getting a little bit nitpicky I think
that as as the up affordance becomes

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.190
that as as the up affordance becomes
 

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.870
that as as the up affordance becomes

Ice Cream Sandwich action bar that was
built so as the code base kind of

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640
built so as the code base kind of
 

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.120
built so as the code base kind of
modernizes and edie we can you know the

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:20.130
modernizes and edie we can you know the
 

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.530
modernizes and edie we can you know the
new Kindles and the new nooks that

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:21.540
new Kindles and the new nooks that
 

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.300
new Kindles and the new nooks that
they've moved off the older codebase

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:23.310
they've moved off the older codebase
 

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.340
they've moved off the older codebase
thereof Ice Cream Sandwich now so we're

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:25.350
thereof Ice Cream Sandwich now so we're
 

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:28.180
thereof Ice Cream Sandwich now so we're
gonna be able to kind of move up to

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:28.190
gonna be able to kind of move up to
 

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:31.010
gonna be able to kind of move up to
using more system frameworks which would

creative guys would like to see right
yeah now that's fair enough so I mean I

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:43.410
yeah now that's fair enough so I mean I
 

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:44.540
yeah now that's fair enough so I mean I
guess what you guys are saying is if

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:44.550
guess what you guys are saying is if
 

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.860
guess what you guys are saying is if
we'd given you a backwards compatible

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:45.870
we'd given you a backwards compatible

we'd given you a backwards compatible
action bar you would have used it but we

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:47.490
action bar you would have used it but we
 

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.510
action bar you would have used it but we
didn't say you had to do what you could

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520
didn't say you had to do what you could
 

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.460
didn't say you had to do what you could
that's a that's a familiar story yeah

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:52.470
that's a that's a familiar story yeah
 

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.570
that's a that's a familiar story yeah
honestly I there's really only one thing

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:55.580
honestly I there's really only one thing
 

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.440
honestly I there's really only one thing
after playing at the app for a while

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:57.450
after playing at the app for a while
 

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:58.970
after playing at the app for a while
that that bothered me and that's this

00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980
that that bothered me and that's this
 

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.000
that that bothered me and that's this
dis which for dark mode yeah that that

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.010
dis which for dark mode yeah that that
 

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.050
dis which for dark mode yeah that that
looks like it may have been lifted from

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:05.060
looks like it may have been lifted from
 

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.580
looks like it may have been lifted from
somewhere else yeah the the dock mode

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:07.590
somewhere else yeah the the dock mode
 

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.140
somewhere else yeah the the dock mode
switch the thing which bothers me more

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:09.150
switch the thing which bothers me more
 

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.000
switch the thing which bothers me more
so than the look is that it's it's not

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.010
so than the look is that it's it's not
 

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.880
so than the look is that it's it's not
hugely responsive yeah I found myself

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:13.890
hugely responsive yeah I found myself
 

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.620
hugely responsive yeah I found myself
wanting to swipe it right but you have

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:15.630
wanting to swipe it right but you have
 

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.720

talking about slick see what you did

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:33.100
talking about slick see what you did

that the the dock mode yeah it looks

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:37.390
that the the dock mode yeah it looks
 

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.300
that the the dock mode yeah it looks
like a yeah it's gonna change we know

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:42.310
like a yeah it's gonna change we know
 

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:46.590
like a yeah it's gonna change we know
and again some of those were yeah time

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:46.600
and again some of those were yeah time
 

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.240
and again some of those were yeah time
limitations and we really wanted to get

limitations and we really wanted to get
 

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.530
limitations and we really wanted to get
something out the market but we're

something out the market but we're
 

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.110
something out the market but we're
definitely constantly looking at this

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:52.120
definitely constantly looking at this
 

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.320
definitely constantly looking at this

very cool I mean I think that's the the

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680
very cool I mean I think that's the the
 

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.710

key to this is is it simplicity so for
 

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.090
key to this is is it simplicity so for
any of the nitpicks that we have around

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:23.710
that you don't have excessive whitespace
 

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.830
that you don't have excessive whitespace
and I think one of the tricks that a lot

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:25.840
and I think one of the tricks that a lot
 

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.270
and I think one of the tricks that a lot
of people do is they just fill it up

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280
of people do is they just fill it up
 

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.910
of people do is they just fill it up
with fragments or whatever to just have

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920
with fragments or whatever to just have
 

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.490
with fragments or whatever to just have
not as long lines and so I think that's

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:32.500
not as long lines and so I think that's
 

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.290
not as long lines and so I think that's
you know I know we've talked about this

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:34.300
you know I know we've talked about this
 

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.490
you know I know we've talked about this
a lot but I think that's what you've

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:35.500
a lot but I think that's what you've
 

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.080
a lot but I think that's what you've
done really well here is thought beyond

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.090
done really well here is thought beyond
 

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.570
done really well here is thought beyond
that as to well how can we feel this in

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:39.580
that as to well how can we feel this in
 

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.100
that as to well how can we feel this in
a way that makes it a better experience

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.110
a way that makes it a better experience
 

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.170
a way that makes it a better experience
rather than just a less sucky experience

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:43.180
rather than just a less sucky experience
 

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.600
rather than just a less sucky experience
and not just better but more appropriate

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:45.610
and not just better but more appropriate
 

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.930
and not just better but more appropriate
to the activity at hand you know we were

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:48.940
to the activity at hand you know we were
 

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.690
to the activity at hand you know we were
at the very beginning of the show we we

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:51.700
at the very beginning of the show we we
 

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.640
at the very beginning of the show we we
looked at mint calm which also filled

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:53.650
looked at mint calm which also filled
 

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.490
looked at mint calm which also filled
space really really well and they did it

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:56.500
space really really well and they did it
 

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.830
space really really well and they did it
by having sort of a multi pane view that

00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:58.840
by having sort of a multi pane view that
 

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.300
by having sort of a multi pane view that
felt like a you know a little bit like a

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:00.310
felt like a you know a little bit like a
 

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.190
felt like a you know a little bit like a
spaceship control center which i think

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200
spaceship control center which i think
 

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.130
spaceship control center which i think
was really appropriate to this idea of

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:05.140
was really appropriate to this idea of
 

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.020
was really appropriate to this idea of
controlling your money whereas this

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:07.030
controlling your money whereas this
 

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.760
controlling your money whereas this
feels a lot more like it just opened up

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:08.770
feels a lot more like it just opened up
 

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:10.830
feels a lot more like it just opened up

good observation is sort of that

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:14.230
good observation is sort of that

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:16.510
difference where mint did have sort of

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:18.250
the gradients and the and the rounding
 

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.420
the gradients and the and the rounding
to make it sort of a more rich sort of

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:21.430
to make it sort of a more rich sort of
 

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:22.890
to make it sort of a more rich sort of
3d sort of experience and this is

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:22.900
3d sort of experience and this is
 

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.390
3d sort of experience and this is
exactly the opposite this is about as

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400
exactly the opposite this is about as
 

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.209
exactly the opposite this is about as

well now no absolutely yeah and I think

00:41:52.729 --> 00:41:52.739
well now no absolutely yeah and I think

well now no absolutely yeah and I think
it more files into your guidelines than

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660
it more files into your guidelines than
 

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.019
it more files into your guidelines than
the newer guidelines actually medical

than the tablet interface does but yeah

00:41:59.239 --> 00:41:59.249
than the tablet interface does but yeah
 

00:41:59.249 --> 00:42:01.819
than the tablet interface does but yeah
we absolutely run on on phones at every

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:01.829
we absolutely run on on phones at every

which is a weird place but yeah we've

00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099
which is a weird place but yeah we've
 

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:13.549
which is a weird place but yeah we've
got layouts for for all phones very cool

00:42:13.549 --> 00:42:13.559
got layouts for for all phones very cool

so I guess the one question I had then

00:42:15.469 --> 00:42:15.479
so I guess the one question I had then
 

00:42:15.479 --> 00:42:16.999
so I guess the one question I had then
is based on that have you seen a

00:42:16.999 --> 00:42:17.009
is based on that have you seen a
 

00:42:17.009 --> 00:42:19.699
is based on that have you seen a
difference in a user engagement on

00:42:19.699 --> 00:42:19.709
difference in a user engagement on

longer on the tablet versions of those
 

00:42:23.609 --> 00:42:26.660
longer on the tablet versions of those
metrics that you guys collect yeah we do

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:26.670
metrics that you guys collect yeah we do
