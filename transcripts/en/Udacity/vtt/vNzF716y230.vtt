In addition to our cognitive development, our social and emotional development

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.206
is really important. Why do you think it is that mammals and birds are so

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:12.255
connected to our caregivers early in life, but fish and reptiles aren't? Well,

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:15.293
it's a bit complicated, but it really boils down to this: mammals and birds

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:20.988
need our caregivers to survive. Fish and reptiles don't. Warm blooded animals

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:24.774
form close bonds with their care givers. This is what psychologists call

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:28.184
attachment. Now, Greg is going to explain to you guys about the first

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:32.200
psychologist who showed us just how important attachment is in development.
