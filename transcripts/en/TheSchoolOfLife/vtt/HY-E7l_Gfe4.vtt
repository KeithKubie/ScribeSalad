00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.109
One of the most important and meaningful activities we are
ever engaged in is the creation of a home.

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.919
Over a number of years, typically with a lot
of thought and considerable dedication, we

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.720
assemble furniture, crockery, pictures, rugs,
cushions, vases, sideboards, taps, door handles

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.940
and so on into a distinctive constellation
we anoint with the word home.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.000
Our homes will not necessarily be the most attractive or sumptious environments

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.460
we could spend time in. There are always hotels
or public spaces that would be a good deal

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.030
more impressive. But after we have been travelling
a long while, after too many nights in hotel

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.230
rooms or on the beds of friends, we typically
feel a powerful ache to return to our own

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.230
furnishings, an ache that has little to do
with material comfort per se. We need to get

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.380
home to remember who we are. Our homes have
a memorialising function, and what they are

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.190
helping us to remember is, strangely enough,
ourselves. We can see this need to anchor

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.200
identity in matter in the history of religion.
Humans have from the earliest days expended

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.120
enormous care and creativity on building homes
for their gods. They haven’t felt that their

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.280
gods could live just anywhere, out in the
wild or as it were in hotels, they have believed

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.689
that they needed special places, temple-homes,
where their specific characters could be stabilised

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.670
through art and architecture. For the Ancient
Greeks, Athena was the goddess of wisdom,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.149
rationality and harmony and in 420 BC, they
completed a home for her on the slopes of

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.840
the Acropolis. It wasn’t a large home – about
the size of an average American kitchen – but

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.700
it was an exceptionally apt and beautiful
one. The temple felt dignified but approachable.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.549
It was rigorously balanced and logical, serene
and poised. It was its inhabitant artfully

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.850
sculpted in limestone. The Greeks took such
care over Athena’s temple-home because they

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.119
understood the human mind. They knew that,
without architecture, we struggle to remember

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.439
what we care about – and more broadly who
we are. To be told in words that Athena represented

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:20.379
grace and balance wasn’t going to be enough
on its own. There needed to be a house to

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.090
bring the idea forcefully and continuously
to consciousness.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.620
Without there being anything grandiose or
supernatural in idea, our homes are also temples.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.069
It’s just that they are temples to us. We’re
not expecting to be worshipped; but we are

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.290
trying to make a place that – like a temple
– adequately embodies our spiritual values

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.939
and merits. Creating a home is frequently
such a demanding process because it requires

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.896
us to find our way to objects that can correctly
convey our identities. We may have to go to

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:52.896
enormous efforts to track down what we deem
to be the ‘right’ objects for particular

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:53.896
functions, rejecting hundreds of alternatives
that would – in a material sense – have

00:02:53.896 --> 00:02:54.896
been perfectly serviceable, in the name of
those we believe can faithfully communicate

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:55.896
the right message about who we are. We get
fussy because objects are, in their own way,

00:02:55.896 --> 00:03:00.530
all hugely eloquent. Two chairs that perform
much the same physical role can articulate

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.380
entirely different visions of life.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.160
Le Corbusier chair; William Morris chair
One chair by the Swiss 20th century architect

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.299
Le Corbusier will speak of efficiency, an
excitement about the future, an international

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.670
spirit, an impatience around nostalgia and
a devotion to reason. The other, by the English

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.239
19th century designer William Morris, will
speak of the superiority of the pre-industrial

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.740
world, the beauty of tradition, the appeal
of patience and the pull of the local.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.100
An object feels ‘right’

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.720
when it speaks attractively about qualities
that we are drawn to, but don’t quite possess

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.850
strong enough doses of in our lives day to
day. The desirable object gives us a more

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.560
secure hold on values that are present, yet
fragile in ourselves; it endorses and encourages

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.189
important themes in us. The smallest things
in our homes whisper in our ears, they offer

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:56.540
us encouragement, reminders, consoling thoughts,
warnings or correctives, as we go about making

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.360
breakfast or do the accounts in the evening.
Because we all want and need to hear such

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.360
The quest to build a home is connected up with a need to stabilize and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.639
organise our complex selves. It’s not enough
to know who we are in our own minds. We need

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.850
something more tangible, material and sensuous
to pin down the diverse and intermittent aspects

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.220
of our identities. We need to rely on a certain
kinds of cutlery, bookshelves, laundry cupboards

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.620
and armchairs to align us with who we are
and seek to be. We are not vaunting ourselves;

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.000
we’re trying to gather our identities in
one receptacle, preserving ourselves from

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.920
erosion and dispersal. Home means the place
where our soul feels that it has found its

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.350
proper physical container, where, everyday,
the objects we live amongst quietly remind

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.920
us of our most authentic commitments 
and loves.
