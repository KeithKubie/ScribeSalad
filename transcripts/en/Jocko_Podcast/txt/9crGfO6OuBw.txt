Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01          This is what I think would be closer to what Henry the fifth a combat leader would have sounded like as he, as he answered some one of his subordinate leaders out there in the crowd, seen that we need more people. We need more men. I think this is what he would have sounded like. What's he that wishes? So my cousin Westmoreland. No, my fair cousin. If we are marked to die, we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men, the greater share of honor. God's will. I pray thee wish. Not One more man by jove. I am not covetous for gold nor care I who doth feed upon my cost. It earns me not if men, my garments wear such outward things dwell, not my desires, but if it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most offending soul alive. No faith, my Coz wish, not a man from England. God's peace. I would not lose so great an honor as one man more me, things would share from me for the best hope I have. Oh, do not wish one more. Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host that he which hath no stomach to this fight. Let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy shall be put into his purse.

Speaker 2:          01:58          We would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us. This Day is called the feast of Crispian. He that outlives this day and comes home safe will stand a tiptoe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of Crispian. He that shall see this day and live all the age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say, tomorrow is Saint Crispian. Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say these wounds I had on Crispin's Day old men forget yet all shall be forgot, but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that day. Then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words. Harry, the King Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester be in their flowing cups, freshly remembered this story shall the good man teaches son at Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the world. But we in it shall be remembered. We, phew.

Speaker 1:          03:36          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:37          we happy few. We band of brothers for cook for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother. The ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in England now a bed shall think themselves or curse it. They were not here and hold their manhoods cheap. Whiles any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispin's Day.
