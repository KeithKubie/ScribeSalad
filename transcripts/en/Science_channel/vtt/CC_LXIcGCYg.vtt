Narrator: IS THERE REALLY
ONLY ONE WAY TO COOK UP LIFE?

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.620
COULD LIFE FORM FROM A DIFFERENT
SET OF INGREDIENTS?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.021
SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.658
HAVE SPECULATED WILDLY
ABOUT ALTERNATIVE LIFE-FORMS,

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.527
BUT IN THE COLD,
HARD WORLD OF SCIENCE,

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:32.198
WE ONLY HAVE PROOF OF LIFE
AS WE KNOW IT.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.601
BUT IF AN OCEAN
REALLY IS CRITICAL,

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.036
DOES IT HAVE TO BE
AN OCEAN OF WATER?

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:41.507
THAT'S A QUESTION
THAT DRIVES NASA'S CHRIS McKAY.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:43.376
McKay: WHAT I'M REALLY
INTERESTED IN FINDING

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.812 line:0%
IS WHAT I CALL
A SECOND GENESIS OF LIFE,

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:50.316 line:0%
ORGANISMS THAT ARE CLEARLY NOT
RELATED TO ANY LIFE ON EARTH.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:54.487 line:0%
ALL LIFE ON EARTH IS RELATED
TO ITSELF, FORMS A SINGLE TREE.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.255
YOU CAN CALL THAT LIFE ONE.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.291
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
IS LIFE TWO --

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.959
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT RELATED.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.095
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PROFOUNDLY
DIFFERENT, BUT IT HAS TO BE

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:05.932
DIFFERENT ENOUGH THAT WE CAN SAY
WITH VERY HIGH CONFIDENCE

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.834
THAT THEY ARE NOT RELATED TO US,

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.069
WE DO NOT HAVE
A COMMON ANCESTOR.

Narrator: WHERE SUCH A LIFE-FORM
COULD FEASIBLY EMERGE

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.043
WAS ANYONE'S GUESS.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:20.112
UNTIL, IN 2005,

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.781
THE WORLD'S ATTENTION
TURNED TO TITAN,

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.919
THE BIGGEST OF THE MOONS
WHICH ORBIT AROUND SATURN.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.091
AT THAT TIME,
ALL WE KNEW OF IT WAS

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:35.761
THAT IT LOOKED GASSY,
ORANGE, AND LIFELESS.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.531
WE KNEW THAT TITAN WAS
A FUZZBALL FROM TELESCOPES.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.800
BEFORE A SPACECRAFT
EVER WENT TO TITAN,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.869
JUST LOOKING AT TITAN
WITH A TELESCOPE,

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.004
WE COULD TELL THAT IT HAD
A THICK ATMOSPHERE.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.245
THE CASSINI-HUYGENS PROBE
PASSED BY,

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:58.250
REVEALING A SURFACE
THAT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY EARTHLIKE.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.753
IT WAS DOTTED
WITH HUGE BODIES OF WATER,

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:05.558
BEARING AN UNCANNY GEOGRAPHICAL
SIMILARITY TO THE GREAT LAKES.

WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE IMAGES

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:11.063 line:0%

DIFFERENCE, THOUGH --

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.003 line:0%
THESE WEREN'T LAKES OF WATER.

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:22.508 line:0%
THEY WERE LAKES OF METHANE
AND, AT -292 FAHRENHEIT,

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.944 line:0%
THEY'RE TOO COLD
FOR ANY LIFE-FORM

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.079 line:0%

McKay: I WOULD CONTEND THAT WE
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ROLE

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.651
OF TEMPERATURE DIRECTLY IN LIFE.

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:34.354
NOW, ON EARTH, OF COURSE,

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.589
WE'RE USED TO LIVING
IN A HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUID

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.724
AT HIGH TEMPERATURE.
WE'RE IN THE FAST LANE.

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:41.361
WE METABOLIZE VERY RAPIDLY

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.063
BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING
AT HIGH TEMPERATURE, RIGHT?

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:48.200
WELL, ON TITAN, THE LIQUID
THAT'S THERE IS COLD,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.502
THE TEMPERATURES ARE COLD.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.971
IF THERE'S LIFE THERE,
IT'S OBVIOUSLY IN THE SLOW LANE.

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:56.175
IT'S METABOLIZING VERY SLOWLY,
BUT SO WHAT? WHAT'S THE RUSH?

00:02:56.175 --> 00:03:00.046
THERE'S NOT AN ABSOLUTE TEMPO
THAT LIFE MUST KEEP TO.
