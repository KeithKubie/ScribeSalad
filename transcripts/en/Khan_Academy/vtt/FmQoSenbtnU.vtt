00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.370
In the last few videos we
learned that the configuration

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.160
of electrons in an atom aren't
in a simple, classical,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.540
Newtonian orbit configuration.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.183
And that's the Bohr model
of the electron.

00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:14.320
And I'll keep reviewing it, just
because I think it's an

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.900
important point.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.900
If that's the nucleus, remember,
it's just a tiny,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.570
tiny, tiny dot if you think
about the entire volume of the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.600
actual atom.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.110
And instead of the electron
being in orbits around it,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.310
which would be how a planet
orbits the sun.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.360
Instead of being in orbits
around it, it's described by

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.680
orbitals, which are these
probability density functions.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.670
So an orbital-- let's say that's
the nucleus-- it would

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.990
describe, if you took any point
in space around the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.700
nucleus, the probability of
finding the electron.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.710
So actually, in any volume of
space around the nucleus, it

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.080
would tell you the probability
of finding the electron within

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.050
that volume.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.850
And so if you were to just take
a bunch of snapshots of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.910
electrons-- let's say
in the 1s orbital.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.510
And that's what the 1s
orbital looks like.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.440
You can barely see it there, but
it's a sphere around the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.850
nucleus, and that's the lowest
energy state that an

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.250
electron can be in.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.590
If you were to just
take a number of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.480
snapshots of electrons.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.460
Let's say you were to take a
number of snapshots of helium,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.800
which has two electrons.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.860
Both of them are in
the 1s orbital.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.830
It would look like this.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.140
If you took one snapshot, maybe
it'll be there, the next

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.170
snapshot, maybe the
electron is there.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.520
Then the electron is there.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.540
Then the electron is there.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.060
Then it's there.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.250
And if you kept doing the
snapshots, you would have a

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.870
bunch of them really close.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.150
And then it gets a little bit
sparser as you get out, as you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.160
get further and further out
away from the electron.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.498
But as you see, you're much
more likely to find the

00:01:48.498 --> 00:01:54.580
electron close to the center of
the atom than further out.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.320
Although you might have had an
observation with the electron

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.620
sitting all the way out there,
or sitting over here.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.420
So it really could have been
anywhere, but if you take

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.690
multiple observations, you'll
see what that probability

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.070
function is describing.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.220
It's saying look, there's a
much lower probability of

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.400
finding the electron out in
this little cube of volume

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.930
space than it is in this little
cube of volume space.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.610
And when you see these diagrams
that draw this

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.110
orbital like this.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.565
Let's say they draw it like
a shell, like a sphere.

00:02:23.565 --> 00:02:25.510
And I'll try to make it look
three-dimensional.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.455
So let's say this is the outside
of it, and the nucleus

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:30.200
is sitting some place
on the inside.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.830
They're just saying -- they just
draw a cut-off -- where

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.950
can I find the electron
90% of the time?

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.950
So they're saying, OK, I can
find the electron 90% of the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.930
time within this circle, if I
were to do the cross-section.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.220
But every now and then the
electron can show up outside

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.000
of that, right?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.260
Because it's all
probabilistic.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.300
So this can still happen.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.570
You can still find the electron
if this is the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.810
orbital we're talking
about out here.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.380
Right?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.660
And then we, in the last
video, we said, OK, the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.260
electrons fill up the orbitals
from lowest energy state to

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.050
high energy state.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.050
You could imagine it.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.720
If I'm playing Tetris-- well I
don't know if Tetris is the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.780
thing-- but if I'm stacking
cubes, I lay out cubes from

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.450
low energy, if this is the
floor, I put the first cube at

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.950
the lowest energy state.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.580
And let's say I could put the
second cube at a low energy

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.020
state here.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.780
But I only have this much
space to work with.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.690
So I have to put the third
cube at the next highest

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.800
energy state.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.280
In this case our energy would
be described as potential

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.930
energy, right?

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.650
This is just a classical,
Newtonian physics example.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.460
But that's the same idea
with electrons.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.540
Once I have two electrons in
this 1s orbital -- so let's

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.240
say the electron configuration
of helium is 1s2-- the third

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.980
electron I can't put there
anymore, because there's only

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.170
room for two electrons.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.230
The way I think about it is
these two electrons are now

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.970
going to repel the third
one I want to add.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.580
So then I have to go
to the 2s orbital.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.090
And now if I were to plot the 2s
orbital on top of this one,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.760
it would look something like
this, where I have a high

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.380
probability of finding the
electrons in this shell that's

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.110
essentially around the
1s orbital, right?

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.400
So right now, if maybe
I'm dealing with

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.300
lithium right now.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.820
So I only have one
extra electron.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.960
So this one extra electron, that
might be where I observed

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.460
that extra electron.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.240
But every now and then it could
show up there, it could

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.310
show up there, it could show
up there, but the high

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.360
probability is there.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.100
So when you say where is it
going to be 90% of the time?

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.730
It'll be like this shell that's
around the center.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.140
Remember, when it's
three-dimensional you would

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.030
kind of cover it up.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.800
So it would be this shell.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.070
So that's what they drew here.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.000
They do the 1s.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.050
It's just a red shell.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.100
And then the 2s.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.850
The second energy shell is just
this blue shell over it.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.560
And you can see it a little bit
better in, actually, the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.810
higher energy orbits, the higher
energy shells, where

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.400
the seventh s energy shell
is this red area.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.800
Then you have the blue area,
then the red, and the blue.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.530
And so I think you get the idea
that each of those are

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.710
energy shells.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.580
So you kind of keep overlaying
the s energy orbitals around

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.180
each other.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.290
But you probably see this
other stuff here.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.830
And the general principle,
remember, is that the

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.120
electrons fill up the orbital
from lowest energy orbital to

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.790
higher energy orbital.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.400
So the first one that's
filled up is the 1s.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.620
This is the 1.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.330
This is the s.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.530
So this is the 1s.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.460
It can fit two electrons.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.900
Then the next one that's
filled up is 2s.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.160
It can fill two more
electrons.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.230
And then the next one, and
this is where it gets

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.030
interesting, you fill
up the 2p orbital.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.180
That's this, right here.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.220
2p orbitals.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.260
And notice the p orbitals have
something, p sub z, p

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.040
sub x, p sub y.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.620
What does that mean?

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.840
Well, if you look at the
p-orbitals, they have these

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.630
dumbbell shapes.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.010
They look a little unnatural,
but I think in future videos

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.600
we'll show you how they're
analogous to standing waves.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.750
But if you look at these,
there's three ways that you

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.040
can configure these dumbbells.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.120
One in the z direction,
up and down.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.280
One in the x direction,
left or right.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.760
And then one in the y direction,
this way, forward

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.250
and backwards, right?

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.660
And so if you were to draw--
let's say you wanted to draw

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.410
the p-orbitals.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.800
So this is what you fill next.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.780
And actually, you fill one
electron here, another

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.910
electron here, then another
electron there.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.036
Then you fill another electron,
and we'll talk about

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:30.190
spin and things like
that in the future.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.750
But, there, there, and there.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.590
And that's actually called
Hund's rule.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.600
Maybe I'll do a whole video on
Hund's rule, but that's not

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.710
relevant to a first-year
chemistry lecture.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.310
But it fills in that order, and
once again, I want you to

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.010
have the intuition of what
this would look like.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.440
Look.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.240
I should put look in
quotation marks,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.470
because it's very abstract.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.810
But if you wanted to visualize
the p orbitals-- let's say

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.810
we're looking at the electron
configuration

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.240
for, let's say, carbon.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.890
So the electron configuration
for carbon, the first two

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.360
electrons go into,
so, 1s1, 1s2.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.160
So then it fills-- sorry, you
can't see everything.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.660
So it fills the 1s2, so carbon's
configuration.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.680
It fills 1s1 then 1s2.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.280
And this is just the
configuration for helium.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.210
And then it goes to the second
shell, which is the second

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.930
period, right?

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.270
That's why it's called
the periodic table.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.960
We'll talk about periods and
groups in the future.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.070
And then you go here.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.690
So this is filling the 2s.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.700
We're in the second
period right here.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.120
That's the second period.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.400
One, two.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.820
Have to go off, so you
can see everything.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.530
So it fills these two.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.390
So 2s2.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.820
And then it starts filling
up the p orbitals.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.830
So then it starts filling
1p and then 2p.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:02.360
And we're still on the second
shell, so 2s2, 2p2.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.420
So the question is what would
this look like if we just

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.030
wanted to visualize
this orbital

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.420
right here, the p orbitals?

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.600
So we have two electrons.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.090
So one electron is going to be
in a-- Let's say if this is,

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.840
I'll try to draw some axes.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.410
That's too thin.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.960
So if I draw a three-dimensional

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.470
volume kind of axes.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.340
If I were to make a bunch of
observations of, say, one of

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.770
the electrons in the p orbitals,
let's say in the pz

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.690
dimension, sometimes it might be
here, sometimes it might be

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.759
there, sometimes it
might be there.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:47.070
And then if you keep taking a
bunch of observations, you're

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:52.000
going to have something that
looks like this bell shape,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.160
this barbell shape
right there.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.510
And then for the other electron
that's maybe in the x

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.500
direction, you make a bunch
of observations.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.830
Let me do it in a
different, in a

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.640
noticeably different, color.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.580
It will look like this.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.590
You take a bunch of
observations, and you say,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.360
wow, it's a lot more likely to
find that electron in kind of

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.680
the dumbell, in that
dumbbell shape.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.600
But you could find
it out there.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.460
You could find it there.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.360
You could find it there.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.990
This is just a much higher
probability of finding it in

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.630
here than out here.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.850
And that's the best way I can
think of to visualize it.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.840
Now what we were doing here,
this is called an electron

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.980
configuration.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.610
And the way to do it-- and
there's multiple ways that are

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.210
taught in chemistry class, but
the way I like to do it-- is

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:40.890
you take the periodic table and
you say, these groups, and

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.840
when I say groups I mean the
columns, these are going to

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.610
fill the s subshell
or the s orbitals.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.750
You can just write s up here,
just right there.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:59.630
These over here are going
to fill the p orbitals.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.020
Actually, let me take helium
out of the picture.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.260
The p orbitals.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.210
Let me just do that.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.070
Let me take helium out
of the picture.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.670
These take the p orbitals.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.010
And actually, for the sake of
figuring out these, you should

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.970
take helium and throw
it right over there.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:13.230
Right?

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.810
The periodic table is just a way
to organize things so it

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.810
makes sense, but in terms of
trying to figure out orbitals,

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.970
you could take helium.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.490
Let me do that.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.690
The magic of computers.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:29.050
Cut it out, and then let me
paste it right over there.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.490
Right?

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.660
And now you see that helium,
you get 1s and then you get

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.140
2s, so helium's configuration
is-- Sorry, you

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.290
get 1s1, then 1s2.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.190
We're in the first
energy shell.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.920
Right?

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:50.910
So the configuration
of hydrogen is 1s1.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:57.030
You only have one electron in
the s subshell of the first

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.172
energy shell.

00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:02.590
The configuration of
helium is 1s2.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.380
And then you start filling
the second energy shell.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:12.240
The configuration of
lithium is 1s2.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.570
That's where the first
two electrons go.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.600
And then the third one
goes into 2s1, right?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.670
And then I think you start
to see the pattern.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.810
And then when you go to nitrogen
you say, OK, it has

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.600
three in the p sub-orbital.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.490
So you can almost start
backwards, right?

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.250
So we're in period two, right?

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.500
So this is 2p3.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.540
Let me write that down.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.200
So I could write that
down first. 2p3.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.880
So that's where the last
three electrons

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.100
go into the p orbital.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.110
Then it'll have these two that
go into the 2s2 orbital.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.240
And then the first two, or the
electrons in the lowest energy

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.020
state, will be 1s2.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.900
So this is the electron
configuration,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.020
right here, of nitrogen.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.380
And just to make sure you did
your configuration right, what

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.270
you do is you count the
number of electrons.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.600
So 2 plus 2 is 4 plus 3 is 7.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.630
And we're talking about
neutral atoms, so the

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.240
electrons should equal the
number of protons.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.540
The atomic number is the
number of protons.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.580
So we're good.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.480
Seven protons.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.050
So this is, so far, when we're
dealing just with the s's and

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.926
the p's, this is pretty
straightforward.

00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:40.070
And if I wanted to figure out
the configuration of silicon,

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.130
right there, what is it?

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.970
Well, we're in the
third period.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.990
One, two, three.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.230
That's just the third row.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.630
And this is the p-block
right here.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.670
So this is the second row
in the p-block, right?

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.830
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:56.060
Right.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.630
We're in the second row
of the p-block, so we

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.200
start off with 3p2.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.130
And then we have 3s2.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.630
And then it filled up all of
this p-block over here.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.880
So it's 2p6.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.340
And then here, 2s2.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.740
And then, of course, it filled
up at the first shell before

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.810
it could fill up these
other shells.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.390
So, 1s2.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:27.130
So this is the electron
configuration for silicon.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.510
And we can confirm that we
should have 14 electrons.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.840
2 plus 2 is 4, plus 6 is 10.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.020
10 plus 2 is 12 plus
2 more is 14.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.350
So we're good with silicon.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.120
I think I'm running low on time
right now, so in the next

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.380
video we'll start addressing
what happens when you go to

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.080
these elements, or
the d-block.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.120
And you can kind of already
guess what happens.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.900
We're going to start filling up
these d orbitals here that

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.730
have even more bizarre shapes.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.120
And the way I think about this,
not to waste too much

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.310
time, is that as you go further
and further out from

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.880
the nucleus, there's more space
in between the lower

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.360
energy orbitals to fill
in more of these

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.440
bizarro-shaped orbitals.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.770
But these are kind of the
balance -- I will talk about

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.560
standing waves in the future--
but these are kind of a

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.780
balance between trying to get
close to the nucleus and the

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.980
proton and those positive
charges, because the electron

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.290
charges are attracted to them,
while at the same time

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.940
avoiding the other electron
charges, or at least their

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.780
mass distribution functions.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.980
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
