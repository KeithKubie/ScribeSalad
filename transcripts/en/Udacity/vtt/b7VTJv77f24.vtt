00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.370
&gt;&gt; So how do scientists know which genetic factors to look at?

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.960
Couldn't there be thousands or even

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.689
millions of possible variations and mutations?

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.870
&gt;&gt; This is true. And, sometimes scientists, even have the

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.810
hard time determining what the genetic factors are for a given

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.199
complex trait. Especially if it has a moderate to low heritability.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.720
And this is a genome-wide association studies and SNVs come in.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.353
&gt;&gt; Genome-wide association

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:28.122
studies look at SNVs and other genetic factors

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:31.246
across the whole genome to find correlation between

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:34.157
specific alleles and the trait or disorder being

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:37.370
studied. The method is almost exactly the same as

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.552
the skin-rash association study we just looked at

00:00:40.552 --> 00:00:43.464
in the last exercise. Except instead of just

00:00:43.464 --> 00:00:46.884
one genetic factor, GWAS or Genome Wide Association

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:50.380
Studies look at hundreds or thousands or even millions

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.660
of factors at once. They're looking at

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.960
the whole genome. This method takes full advantage

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.620
of all of our SNVs, all of our single nucleotide variations and uses them as

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.120
sign posts for different phenotypes or traits.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.110
And although this can be a really powerful

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.150
tool, it doesn't always yield clear results as

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.930
we'll see with an example of bipolar disorder.
