&gt;&gt;Good day, Geoff Cape here from Evergreen
in Toronto at the World

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.490
Economic Forum, looking to explore the subject
of environmental issues

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.670
and how climate change, Copenhagen affairs
have essentially failed in a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.570
very substantial way.
I think the agenda going forward is to try

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.009
find a way to enable useful
governments, urban issues to be the core with

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.300
change.
Nation states have not found the will or the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.649
 -- the legal mechanisms to
effect change.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.261
But use some penalties, and could use some
urban governments both up to

00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:45.269
capacity to make quick decisions and to enable
and effect change on the

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.420
ground through huge populations in cities,
much more effectively, much

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.269
more efficiently.
And enable social change and behavioral change

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.409
of a community, citizens
far more effectively, so that the quick agenda

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.250
I think is to find a way
to bring best practices of governments, useful

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.660
governments together
around the climate change agenda.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.790
Thank you.
