00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:04.803
- [Voiceover] In this
video, we're gonna introduce

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:07.271
the idea of a step response.

00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:09.867
This is one of the most common occurrences

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:12.191
in all of electronics,
and it happens any time

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:16.369
there's some resistance and
some capacitance in series,

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.968
and in particular, it
happens billions of times

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:21.655
a second inside every computer.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.500
So, that's why we want to
study this very carefully.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.635
So, the step response is
something that happens

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:29.447
in a circuit when we drive the circuit

00:00:29.447 --> 00:00:31.114
with a step voltage.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.514
That's a step voltage shown right there,

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:37.290
and this response is
gonna be related closely

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.207
to the natural response

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:44.416
of an RC circuit,

00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:48.080
and if you haven't seen that video yet,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.636
I want to encourage you to take a moment

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:53.803
and go to watch the video
on the RC natural response,

00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:58.726
'cuz I'm gonna use that result right here.

00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:00.869
Now, in the RC natural response,

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.484
what we had was no energy
going into a circuit,

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:06.823
we had an RC circuit like this,

00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:09.433
and there was nothing connected here,

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:11.636
so the source was removed,

00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:13.636
and we had a C and an R,

00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:19.733
and there was a voltage
on the original capacitor.

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:23.742
There was some charge on
this capacitor right here,

00:01:23.742 --> 00:01:27.909
and we worked out what's the
response of the current here,

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:31.977
and what's the response of the voltage,

00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:34.477
V of T, across this capacitor.

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:38.511
And there, we found that V of T

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.438
equals V naught times E
to the minus T over RC.

00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:52.629
So, this is the natural
response of an RC circuit,

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:54.985
and now, what we're gonna
do in the step response

00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:58.408
is we're gonna actually kick
this circuit with a step.

00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:00.382
We're gonna make the circuit do something,

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:03.350
add some sort of stimulus from the outside

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.176
that pushes this RC
circuit in some direction,

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:07.761
and we're gonna see what that means,

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.384
and it's gonna be related
to the natural response.

00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:13.672
So, VS here starts at
some voltage V naught,

00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:16.761
then it times zero right here,

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.680
it makes a step, a sharp step,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.287
up to some other voltage step, VS,

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:23.937
and what we wanna do is we wanna see

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:27.183
what this circuit does, and
again, we'll label this.

00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:29.683
We wanna find out this V of T.

00:02:31.043 --> 00:02:33.764
So, what's gonna happen is, in the past,

00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:37.374
before T equals zero, this
circuit will be in some state,

00:02:37.374 --> 00:02:39.115
and we'll figure out what that is,

00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:40.791
and then we're gonna disturb the circuit

00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.070
and it's gonna settle
down in some new state,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.720
and that's gonna be called the
step response of the circuit.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.247
So, our approach here is
gonna be to look at this,

00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:51.354
first, we're gonna do this intuitively,

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:53.877
and we'll just look at a long time ago,

00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:57.731
we'll look at a long time
from now, well after the step,

00:02:57.731 --> 00:02:59.882
we'll see what the circuit's doing then,

00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:02.420
and then we'll guess at
what happens in between.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.227
So, first, we'll do this intuitively,

00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:08.212
and then we'll do it with
the formal mathematics.

00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:10.122
So, I said we're gonna break
it down into three things.

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:14.122
The first thing we're
gonna look at is long ago.

00:03:19.984 --> 00:03:21.970
What was the circuit doing yesterday,

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.364
when it was sitting here at V naught?

00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:27.281
Well, long ago, VS equals V naught,

00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:33.574
and what was gonna happen
is some sort of current

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:35.301
was gonna flow out of here,

00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:37.930
and around into this capacitor,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.097
and it's gonna leave some charge here.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.876
That charge is gonna
pile up on the capacitor,

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.975
and we know that it's related

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:52.142
to the voltage on the capacitor by CV.

00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:56.118
One of the things we're gonna
do as we analyze this circuit

00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:58.427
is track what happens to this Q.

00:03:58.427 --> 00:04:00.457
That's a good approach to thinking

00:04:00.457 --> 00:04:03.186
about what's going on here.

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:05.798
So, if a long time ago, VS was V zero,

00:04:05.798 --> 00:04:07.093
basically, what happened?

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:11.093
Some current flowed until
V here reached V zero,

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:16.921
so V equals V zero,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.016
at some time in the past,

00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:26.017
V became V naught, and what happened to I?

00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:30.090
Then, I went to zero, and the
reason we know I went to zero

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.056
is because the voltage
across this resistor,

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:36.723
let me label it like
this, we'll call it VR,

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:40.659
eventually, this side was V naught,

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.155
and this side became V naught,

00:04:43.155 --> 00:04:46.004
and that's zero volts across the resistor,

00:04:46.004 --> 00:04:48.428
so that means the current goes to zero,

00:04:48.428 --> 00:04:51.814
so this is the state a long time ago.

00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:54.231
I wanna start sketching this.

00:04:56.073 --> 00:04:58.823
We'll do some time plots of this,

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:06.453
and we'll make this I and this V,

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.491
and so, we decided a long time ago,

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.741
V was V naught,

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:24.431
and the current, we decided, was zero,

00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.514
so I can put that on there like that.

00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:31.367
So, that's our long time ago.

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:33.917
Next, what we do is we
go to super long time.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.167
Let's let T go to infinity.

00:05:38.114 --> 00:05:40.417
That's a long time from now.

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:42.362
And what's the state gonna be then?

00:05:42.362 --> 00:05:44.450
Well, the VS is gonna be--

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.283
the source voltage is gonna be VS.

00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:51.700
Tell apart between capital letters

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.436
and lowercase letters here.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.607
Capital letters is a fixed voltage,

00:05:55.607 --> 00:05:59.190
and VS is something
that changes with time,

00:06:01.317 --> 00:06:03.234
and we can do the same sort of analysis.

00:06:03.234 --> 00:06:05.491
There's gonna be some
current that will flow,

00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:09.658
Q will build up until the
voltage on the capacitor is...

00:06:10.784 --> 00:06:12.867
There'll be some current.

00:06:14.682 --> 00:06:18.265
The voltage on the
capacitor will go to VS,

00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:21.069
and the same story.

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.184
The voltage across the resistor,
then, will be zero again,

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:27.757
and that means that I will be zero again.

00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:30.507
This is for a long time from now.

00:06:32.753 --> 00:06:34.776
So, as we continue our intuition here,

00:06:34.776 --> 00:06:38.943
a long time from now, VS is
gonna be the step voltage,

00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:43.872
big V, S, and what's I gonna be?

00:06:43.872 --> 00:06:47.444
I, we decided, was gonna be zero.

00:06:47.444 --> 00:06:50.424
So, a long time from
now, out of the future,

00:06:50.424 --> 00:06:53.308
I is gonna be zero again.

00:06:53.308 --> 00:06:54.141
Okay.

00:06:57.001 --> 00:07:01.168
So now, let's go back and
look at what happens between.

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.961
Okay, this is after the switch happens,

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.354
and before a long time from now.

00:07:10.354 --> 00:07:12.350
And what we can guess,
what we can estimate,

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.017
is that V naught is
gonna become VS somehow,

00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:19.181
and that the current's
gonna start at zero,

00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:20.609
and it's gonna do something,

00:07:20.609 --> 00:07:23.735
and it has to end up back at zero.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.424
Okay, let's get a little more detailed.

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:28.110
Let's make some little better guesses.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.336
The moment after the step happens,

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:34.336
the voltage on this side goes to VS,

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:37.791
and the voltage on this side is what?

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.322
Well, the charge, there's a
bunch of charge sitting here

00:07:40.322 --> 00:07:43.921
on the capacitor, and it
hasn't had time to go anywhere.

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:47.295
So, if that's the case, then the voltage

00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:51.635
right after the switch changes
is gonna still be V naught.

00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:53.397
So, that's gonna be the
voltage right after here

00:07:53.397 --> 00:07:55.352
is not gonna jump anywhere,

00:07:55.352 --> 00:07:57.673
and that's because we
physically have some charge

00:07:57.673 --> 00:07:59.152
stored on this capacitor,

00:07:59.152 --> 00:08:02.452
and it hasn't had time to go anywhere yet.

00:08:02.452 --> 00:08:04.270
That means on this side of the resistor,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.916
just after the step happens,
this is gonna be V naught.

00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:10.201
Oh, look, now, see?

00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:12.609
Now, we have a voltage
difference across here,

00:08:12.609 --> 00:08:13.823
so there's gonna be a current.

00:08:13.823 --> 00:08:16.111
All of a sudden, there's
gonna be some current here.

00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:19.083
Let's scribble that in,
let's see what that does.

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:22.903
There's gonna be some sort
of current that happens,

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:24.606
and it's gonna be I is what?

00:08:24.606 --> 00:08:28.356
It's gonna be VS minus
V naught divided by R.

00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:33.363
That'll be the current.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.381
We'll label the current there.

00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:40.454
That's the current we're talking about.

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:43.478
All right, so we got
our current to hop up,

00:08:43.478 --> 00:08:45.463
and now there's more charge,
there's charge flowing

00:08:45.463 --> 00:08:48.428
onto our capacitor, so
the capacitor voltage

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:50.275
is gonna start changing.

00:08:50.275 --> 00:08:52.632
More charge, more voltage.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:53.876
And what's gonna happen?

00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:54.748
We can estimate this.

00:08:54.748 --> 00:08:57.921
It's gonna just do something like that.

00:08:57.921 --> 00:09:00.400
I can sketch that in.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.664
More and more charge will start flowing

00:09:02.664 --> 00:09:06.302
onto this capacitor, and the
voltage will gradually rise

00:09:06.302 --> 00:09:07.802
until V equals VS,

00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:12.495
'til the voltage across the resistor

00:09:12.495 --> 00:09:15.848
again is zero, and then
the current will stop.

00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:18.209
We had a sudden step of current

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:20.777
caused by the change in
the step voltage input,

00:09:20.777 --> 00:09:25.280
and then it's gonna just fade
out, something like that,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.710
until the current goes back to zero.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.127
V will go from...

00:09:31.569 --> 00:09:32.863
How do I write this?

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:37.030
It'll go from V naught, and
it'll eventually become VS,

00:09:39.227 --> 00:09:41.144
and I will have a step,

00:09:46.343 --> 00:09:48.510
and then, go back to zero.

00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:53.520
So, that's our intuitive understanding

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.180
of how this step response will look

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.180
for a driven RC circuit,

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.752
and next what we'll do is
we'll work this out in detail,

00:10:02.752 --> 00:10:05.237
and we'll get mathematically accurate

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:08.173
versions of what these
two currents look like.
