00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.480
We now know how the processor is predicting which instruction to fetch next. You

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.970
will put this knowledge to work in a project in this class. But some

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.410
branches are very difficult to predict. So

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.350
next lesson is about helping the compiler

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.560
completely eliminate these branches from the program

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.120
so we do not have to predict them.
