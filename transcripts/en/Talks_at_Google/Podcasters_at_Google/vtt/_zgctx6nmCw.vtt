[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.920
SPEAKER: We are here
today with Dan Carlin.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.640
He is the host of two very
popular podcasts, "Hardcore

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.710
History" and "Common Sense."

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.890
Believe it or not, he's been
in this business since 2005.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.874
DAN CARLIN: 2005.

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:21.040
SPEAKER: And he's had a
tremendous amount of success

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.320
in the podcast world.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.290
Influence in the
historical world, as well.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.940
So join me again to welcome Dan.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.820
DAN CARLIN: You have a
wonderful facility here.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.710
SPEAKER: So most of
you guys are probably

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.190
all familiar with the "Hardcore
History" podcast series.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.980
It focuses on deep dives
into historical events,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.860
and puts them in context so that
we can understand them better.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.940
So I wanted to throw Dan a
little bit of a curveball,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.020
and ask him--

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.440
he always talks about what
happens if you were there.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.880
What would the
experience be like

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.490
if you were on the ground
experiencing that history.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.590
So I wanted to
ask Dan to tell us

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.680
about a historical experience
that he experienced,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.080
on the ground, in Dan
Carlin's voice, live today.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.020
DAN CARLIN: Well,
when I got into news--

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.550
I got out of college,
I didn't know

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.610
what I wanted to
do specifically,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.460
so I got in the news
business somehow.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.374
And I remember--

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:20.290
I was a history major.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.266
And when I was a history major
at University of Colorado,

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.140
they actually had, in
the history department,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.210
these pamphlets that said
what to tell your parents

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.132
about choosing a history major.

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:32.590
Because everybody said, what
are you going to do with this?

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.830
So I got to news, and then
found out that so many

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.020
of the reporters--

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.110
I was a news guy in LA.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.964
And in LA there's two
kinds of reporters.

00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:41.380
There's the kind
that you send out

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.980
on real deep difficult stories,
and then there are the ones,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.320
you know, you send out to
do the Hollywood stories,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.630
and all that.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.100
And they're really two
different kinds of reporters.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.590
And the kind of
reporters that I wanted

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.631
to be like, I found out
an amazing amount of them

00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:55.209
had history as their background.

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:56.500
I remember seeing Connie Chung.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.270
I think she spoke at college.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.651
And I went to the get together,
and it was a journalism

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.650
department get together.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.650
And somebody raised their
hand and said, what courses

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.392
would you suggest we take that
will help us when we get out

00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:09.350
into the news business?

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.211
And she said--

00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:11.710
I'm paraphrasing
here-- but she said

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.584
this is going to be a
really unpopular answer

00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:15.407
to tell a bunch of
J students, but I

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:17.740
would take all the courses
you're not getting right now.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.980
I would go to the
geography department.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.800
I would go to the
history department.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.820
She goes, because anything
you're learning in journalism,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.260
they're going to reteach
you, your first six

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.220
months on the job.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.330
She says, the stuff
you're not going to get

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.770
is the background stuff.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.228
So when I got in the news, all
of a sudden I felt like, OK,

00:02:29.228 --> 00:02:31.700
maybe this is a place for
people who've studied history.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.337
And I didn't really realize why
until I'd done it for a while.

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:35.920
And it's because you
have the context.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.670
Right?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.770
And what was fun for
a history major is,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.660
you had this opportunity
to be at events--

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.570
to answer your question--
where history was taking place.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.605
So you'd do these
horrible stories that

00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:47.980
made you feel bad at the end
of the day, that had nothing

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.140
to do-- you know, coffee
roasters downtown opened

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.630
a new building, or whatever.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.120
But then sometimes
you'd have an LA riot.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.220
And the LA riots were
the biggest thing

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.067
that I ever
personally witnessed.

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:00.400
And I remember being in college.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.327
And I was in
college in Colorado,

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:04.660
and you'd hear these stories
about earthquakes and fires

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.290
in Los Angeles.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.840
And I'd call home, and I'd say,
I hear things are just awful.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.160
And my mom would
go, they're nothing.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.780
They're just hyping
that story up.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.000
I would say the LA riots
were the only story that

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.090
was really as big on the ground
as everybody thought it was.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.520
I mean, that wasn't
being hyped up at all.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.510
And the story was
so weird, because--

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.320
and this was the
lesson, I guess,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.160
when you're talking
about what it's

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.284
like to go through history.

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:28.569
Because you have no idea
what's really going on while

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:29.110
you're in it.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.693
And you're trying
to make sense of it.

00:03:30.693 --> 00:03:33.139
So on the first
day of the riots--

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.180
you had to go in to work.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.040
Now you guys will
all understand this,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.670
you have to go in to work
sometimes when there's

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.753
big news stories breaking.

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:41.320
So there's this unconscious
bias to downplay

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.570
the importance of the news
story if it's your day off.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.069
Right?

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.364
Because you kind of think
there, oh, this isn't so bad.

00:03:46.364 --> 00:03:48.030
I remember looking
out over the horizon,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.570
and there's multiple
fires burning.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.240
And I'm thinking, I
don't have to go in.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.970
This isn't a big deal.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.960
I don't have to go in to work.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.790
So two days later they
call me, and scream at me,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.660
and say everybody's at work.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.286
Where are you?

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:57.910
So I get in the car,
head down to work,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.493
and it's like a
nuclear bomb went off.

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:01.690
And it's traffic--

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.619
I mean, I lived 15
minutes from work.

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.410
It took me an hour and
a half to get there.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.993
And I remember thinking, OK, if
there were ever a nuclear war,

00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:09.550
nobody's getting
out of anything.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.508
So I went to the building,
and in the first day

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:13.240
were interviewing looters.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.980
And again, this is
an example of how

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.290
a story of a giant
historical importance,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.051
at least for that city, didn't
seem like it at the time.

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.550
Right?

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.374
You walk up to people carrying
stuff out of buildings,

00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:24.790
and you stick a
mic in their face,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.156
and you start interviewing them.

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:28.280
Two days later they were
shooting at the reporters,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.740
and we were interviewing
anybody anymore.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.630
So we started covering
things from the air,

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.280
with just helicopters.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.180
So I still remember Laura
Diaz-- who was an anchor at KABC

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.120
then-- coming up the
stairs, white as a sheet,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.100
saying they just
shot the helicopter.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.017
We're not going
out there anymore.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.850
And that's when we knew
we couldn't go home.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.641
They brought in cots,
they brought in food.

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:49.540
And then they put a
curfew in my home city.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.482
And I've never seen a
curfew in Los Angeles.

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:53.440
They also shut all the
lights out in Hollywood.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.856
And I'd never seen
the lights out.

00:04:54.856 --> 00:04:57.250
But they shut the lights
out because it was back

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.920
lighting the soldiers that
they'd brought into the city,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.510
and making them targets.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.060
And so we had a pass
to be out after curfew.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.470
And I'm driving in my
home city, and it's dark,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.445
and there's soldiers
on every street corner.

00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:10.070
And I have a scanner
in my car, and you

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.230
can hear these-- this
guy's being shot here.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.820
We have somebody charging the--

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.780
and it was surreal.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.780
And so I remember thinking
that this is maybe

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.430
what it must be like when
you're living through history.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.150
Because you don't
know what's going on.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
And you're piecing it
together with other people

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.340
who are living through
it at the same time.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.280
And I remember, a couple of
days later, feeling like,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.090
was that all real?

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.320
Did that really happen?

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.600
And I remember going to
pick up my dry cleaning.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.280
I had, like, three
things in my wardrobe

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.363
that could be dry cleaned--
all my nicest clothes.

00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:37.730
It was right by the TV station.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.740
And I walk into this
place-- remember, thinking,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.630
did this even really happen--

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.316
and I walk into
this dry cleaners,

00:05:43.316 --> 00:05:45.440
and there wasn't a stitch
of clothing in the place.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.700
And the windows
were all boarded up.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.116
And like an idiot, I still
presented my ticket to the guy.

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:49.754
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:49.754 --> 00:05:51.170
And like an idiot,
he looked at it

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.180
like he was considering
the fact that maybe there

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.650
were some clothes in the
back on the floor that

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.420
hadn't been taken.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.836
And then he handed it back to
me, and he said, no clothes.

00:05:57.836 --> 00:06:00.140
And that's when I remember
thinking, OK, I get it.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.390
And then I walked
out of the building,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.515
and I looked at the street.

00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:05.200
And the riot had literally taken
out one side of the street,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200
and stopped right there.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.180
And the other side of
the street was pristine.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.090
And I remember thinking,
OK, this really happened.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.100
It took me a couple of
years to really absorb--

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.680
and I had actually watched the
TV specials, and everything

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.700
on this event--

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.665
before you could really
see it the way it was.

00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:20.540
You know they say you
shouldn't write history

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.520
for a certain period
of time afterwards?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.500
I still don't think I
fully understand that,

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.780
and I was in it.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.650
So that was the biggest
historical event

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.520
I ever saw up close.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.547
And it's funny how--

00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:32.630
it'll be interesting, I
guess, is what I'm saying,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.550
to read about this
in 50 years and see

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.610
how the story's 50 year-- well,
as if I'm going to be here.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.850
But you know, how it will
differ from the experience

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.699
I saw on the ground.

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.740
And I think that's probably
a pretty good analogy

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.770
of what it must be like.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.520
It's a little confusing,
and a little hard

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.170
to put in perspective.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.000
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.083
That makes a lot of sense.

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:52.910
And a lot of your
episodes, they really

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.340
covered a vast swath of time.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.440
Everything from the Mongols
to the recent world wars.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.315
How do you hear back from
readers who have actually

00:07:03.315 --> 00:07:04.190
been in those events?

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.110
And how do they
respond to hearing

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.294
about their experiences retold?

00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:11.210
DAN CARLIN: In that
sense, it's kind of easier

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.704
to do earlier stuff.

00:07:12.704 --> 00:07:14.120
Because if I get
it wrong, I don't

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.900
have to hear from
anybody who was there.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.740
We were talking, before
we did this, about--

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.702
I did a show called--

00:07:20.702 --> 00:07:22.160
three shows, I
guess it was, called

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.570
"Ghosts of the Ostfront," once.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.300
And it was about the Eastern
Front in the Second World War.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.460
And I was looking at it
from the perspective of,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.950
if you're an American,
or someone from Britain,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.310
or France, or any of the Allies
that weren't the Soviet Union,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.370
you have a specific
view of the war.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.400
And to us it's hard to
see, either the Russians--

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.680
or certainly the Germans--
as the good guys,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.729
or the aggrieved, or victims
in any way, shape, or form.

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:47.270
So I was trying to
do this show where

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.880
I tried to look at it from
the perspective of people

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.860
who are, like, caught
in the gears of history.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.360
Right?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.060
I mean, the average person in
that war had no say at all.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.480
Especially in these
dictatorships, right?

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.940
There were few conscientious
objectors in Germany.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.362
I said there were
none, and heard

00:08:03.362 --> 00:08:04.820
from a bunch of
Jehovah's Witnesses

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.150
who said they were beheading
Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.440
who wouldn't go into the war.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.127
But I did the show.

00:08:11.127 --> 00:08:12.710
We tried to do it
from the perspective

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.020
of a bunch of people trapped
in a horrible situation.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.270
And a guy wrote me--

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.682
I heard from a lot of Germans.

00:08:18.682 --> 00:08:20.390
One guy wrote me, he
said, my grandfather

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.431
was on the Eastern Front.

00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:22.729
He's never spoken about it.

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:24.770
So he said, I got in the
car and I took a chance.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.228
We were going to
have a long drive.

00:08:26.228 --> 00:08:27.110
I put your show in.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.280
We drove for six hours.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.200
My grandfather said nothing.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.760
He said, we parked
at the location,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.100
I turned off the
audio, and he starts

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.770
babbling about everything that
happened to him that he's never

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.868
told the family.

00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:39.409
And I guess-- I'm
trying to remember,

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.783
this is years ago now-- but
the guy's point was something

00:08:41.783 --> 00:08:43.520
to the effect of,
these are people

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.269
who never felt that they
could recount the horror,

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:48.560
and the things that happened
to them, because who wants

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.800
to hear it from the bad guys?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.300
Right?

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.970
They're human
beings who suffered,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.270
but they were the bad guys.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.300
And anytime anyone brings that
up, all you can think about

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.630
is, yeah, but what about the
people on the other side?

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.760
Remembering, I think
as we must, that

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.460
truthfully, by an accident
of where you were born

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.090
and when you were born,
it could have been you.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.390
Could have been me.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.300
And so this idea
that somehow somebody

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.530
who was there listened to this
and got something positive out

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.100
of it, was so different
from saying the 15-year-old,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.562
today, living, downloaded it got
something positive out of it.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.020
The problem, of
course, is you feel

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.850
kind of like you've got
this responsibility now.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.350
And it makes it a heck of a lot
harder to walk in the studio

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.650
next time and just blithely
talk about the Eastern

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.108
Front in the Second
World War, when

00:09:32.108 --> 00:09:33.500
you realize people
that are still

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.210
trying to deal
with the scars that

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.150
were inflicted on them then,
are listening to it, also.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.830
So there's something
a lot easier

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.650
about doing a show on the
Mongols from the 14th century,

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.240
than doing a show like--

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.100
we were considering doing one on
The New Left in the late 1960s.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.650
The Weather Underground,
the bombings, and all that.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.280
And I said, do I really want
to hear from all those people?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.990
Because they're literally
going to write you and say,

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.524
I was there.

00:09:54.524 --> 00:09:55.190
You're an idiot.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.898
You don't know what
you're talking about.

00:09:56.898 --> 00:09:58.600
And Mongols are easier.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.520
But there's something,
if you do it right--

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.960
and that's a bit
of a crapshoot--

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.280
but if you do it right,
there's something really

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.620
satisfying about
somebody saying, yeah,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.200
we got something really
positive out of that.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.825
SPEAKER: Right.

00:10:07.825 --> 00:10:11.930
DAN CARLIN: So that, to
me, is an example, maybe,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.109
about what the new media
can do, a little bit.

00:10:14.109 --> 00:10:15.650
Because that's a
really niche market,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.020
speaking to Eastern Front
veterans that are still alive.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.140
But the fact that they got
something out of it was neat.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.250
SPEAKER: And so what happens if
you kind of follow this trend?

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.350
You're finding a lot
of positive experiences

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.727
from people who
do learn about it.

00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:31.310
People who learn
about it differently,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.481
despite actually being there.

00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:34.980
What happens if we
go the other way?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.145
What if we don't know
all this history?

00:10:37.145 --> 00:10:39.770
DAN CARLIN: You, know I've been
thinking about that a lot, too.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.300
Because I have kids, and
my youngest daughter,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.850
for example, is
not a big reader.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.110
Doesn't like all
this kind of stuff.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.480
And you think to yourself,
OK, if this is representative

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.540
of her generation-- and
I don't know that it is--

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.930
what would happen if the
great mass of society

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.420
really didn't know
anything about the past?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.599
If this became a specialist
endeavor, like biologist,

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:02.390
or something where if
you want to know what

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.765
happened 10 years ago, you go
to a specialist, as opposed

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:06.214
to having some sort of context.

00:11:06.214 --> 00:11:08.630
And I feel like it's a little
bit like a great experiment.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.550
Because on one hand,
I keep telling myself,

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.990
OK, most people didn't
know real history

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.490
throughout most of
human experience.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.820
So maybe there's nothing
different about it.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.790
And yet-- we were talking
about this great concept

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.510
about, in the
world of the blind,

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.530
the one-eyed man is king.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.770
If you're the person--

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.830
the one out of a hundred of
your generation likes history--

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.160
and you study it, and you
learn context from it,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.900
does that give you a
leg up in your life?

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.390
It's hard for me
to know, because I

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.120
have this weird
theory that's totally

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.750
unsupported by any
evidence that I know of,

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.642
that different people have
different ways of organizing

00:11:43.642 --> 00:11:44.600
their mental framework.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.030
So I have a friend who's
a mathematical genius.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.380
To him, everything is numbers.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:48.880
Right?

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.530
He organizes his whole frame
of thought through numbers.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.254
I organize mine in
a historical sense.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:54.920
And a lot of the
people I went to school

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.460
with that were history
majors did the same thing.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.950
So I think there's got to be a
whole bunch of different ways

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.184
to organize your mind.

00:11:59.184 --> 00:12:01.100
But the problem is, is
it makes it really hard

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.930
to imagine how other
people, who don't

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.300
organize their mind the way you
do, organize their thinking.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.480
So for me, it's all linear.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.000
A equals B, then B
happens, then C happens.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.040
And that's how I think.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.740
So I think with the podcast
we keep thinking about,

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.570
how do we make a
podcast for the audience

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.264
that the audience likes, when we
don't know about the audience?

00:12:20.264 --> 00:12:22.430
And so we decided that the
only thing we can control

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.660
is what we like.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.510
And that if we talk about
what I like to talk about,

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.330
and that interests
me, eventually you

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.736
will self-select your audience,
and they will be people

00:12:32.736 --> 00:12:33.860
who like what you like too.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.880
So you will be able
to say, OK, I'll

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.338
talk about this,
because I like it,

00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:38.630
and I know these people
will like it also.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.080
And so I think that
the people that like it

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.460
tend to be people that
organize their thinking

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.172
in a historical
linear framework.

00:12:45.172 --> 00:12:47.630
I think if you're a numbers
guy you might listen to my show

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.700
and find 900 things
wrong with it.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.010
If you're a history guy,
you listen to-- it or gal--

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.499
and you go, oh yeah, that
speaks to me somehow.

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:58.040
And so, I mean, I think part of
the new media is the ability,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.480
instead of
broadcasting and having

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.150
to appeal to everybody
out there, you can say,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.980
no, no, no, I'm targeting
this little teeny

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.660
narrow demographic.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.990
And I like to say, you're
a "Harry Potter" fan, what

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.430
are the networks giving you?

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.970
Right?

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.010
OK, but there's like three
or four podcasts just

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.940
on "Harry Potter."

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.830
So if that's really
what you like--

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.370
or 1950s science fiction comic
books, or classic motorcycles,

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.570
or whatever it is--

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.940
it might be a small audience
that's interested in that,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.480
but they're passionate about it.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.980
Right?

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.396
It's one thing to say, I watch
this TV show that everybody

00:13:27.396 --> 00:13:28.460
likes, and I like it too.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.543
It's another thing to have
somebody speaking right

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:33.320
to your soul, in a way
that you can relate to,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.370
about something you love.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.550
And I think, for
me, when I think

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.500
about what we're getting
to, history-wise,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.480
I'm not teaching
anybody anything.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.270
We're reveling in
this information.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.229
And some of it's false.

00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:47.353
And we have to acknowledge
that some of it's false.

00:13:47.353 --> 00:13:48.440
But that doesn't change--

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.439
I read these histories
from a hundred years ago,

00:13:50.439 --> 00:13:53.227
and they're full of falsities,
and romancing, and racism,

00:13:53.227 --> 00:13:55.310
and all these things that
100 years ago, history--

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.800
but it's colorful.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.987
And if you can say
to yourself, OK,

00:13:59.987 --> 00:14:01.820
I'm going to put aside
the question of facts

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.403
for a minute-- because I'm not
so sure our facts today are all

00:14:04.403 --> 00:14:06.350
that factual, sometimes--

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.240
you can really sort of
swim in that kind of thing.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.170
And if you love history,
it's immensely satisfying.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.740
And so we try to
draw some of that--

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.180
because I'm not a historian.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.460
And I think historians
today, and I've

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.260
said this before, are
better than any historians

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:18.950
we've ever had.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.450
It's all peer reviewed.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.840
They savage each other.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.930
It's like a science,
which is great

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.240
if you're looking for
factual information.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.100
But you lose something.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.780
You lose that--
you know, history

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.280
used to be a part
of the humanities.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.590
It still is at a
lot of colleges.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.965
But if you looked
at the list, it

00:14:33.965 --> 00:14:35.524
would say, humanities, history.

00:14:35.524 --> 00:14:37.190
Well, that puts you
in the same category

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.362
with law, language,
religion, poetry,

00:14:40.362 --> 00:14:41.570
and all those kind of things.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.360
It's a very different
subject than if it puts you

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.160
in the social sciences, which
puts you in with anthropology,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.280
archeology.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.680
And, again, more
scientific, more facts.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.440
But do you lose something
in the transition?

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.960
And what I've always wondered
is if maybe you don't even

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.330
have two disciplines there.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.700
History as a
humanity, and history

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.150
as a social science, because
they almost do different work.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.150
The history as a social science
is rigorously fact-based,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.390
and it's wonderful.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.630
But if I open up a history
book from 50 years ago,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.430
it fails every
test you would have

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.260
to pass to be in that category.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.150
But it's immensely
more satisfying

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.950
to a non-specialist reader.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.510
And you ask yourself why.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.640
Because there's something
more human about it.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.650
But whenever you're
dealing with people,

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.300
we are so variable and weird.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.240
I mean, how do I put you
versus you in these--

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.420
I mean, it's just-- you're
dealing with an inherently

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.340
unstable situation.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.110
And as long as you
can enjoy that,

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.120
history becomes immensely
satisfying, I think,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.997
to non-specialists.

00:15:38.997 --> 00:15:41.330
But you've got to be careful,
because it's certainly not

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.010
the way history is done today.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.269
So I often think, when
you go into a bookstore,

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:47.060
and you look at the
new books that are out,

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.050
you're going to see
a bunch of books

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.508
about historical figures, and
history, and everything else,

00:15:50.508 --> 00:15:51.230
from authors.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.420
Not historians, just authors,
because they're great

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.590
storytellers.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.679
And they know how to tell
that story in a way that

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:57.845
relates to a non-specialist.

00:15:57.845 --> 00:16:00.170
And I think the specialists
must hate that sometimes,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.820
because they generalize,
and they do all the things.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.770
But if you're creating the
next generation history fans--

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.022
and let's be honest, if
you're a history professor

00:16:09.022 --> 00:16:11.480
and you want to teach people
who are interested in history,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.110
somebody has got
to appetize them,

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.970
for lack of a better word.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:14.480
Right?

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.313
Somebody's got to create
the next generation

00:16:16.313 --> 00:16:17.840
of history professors.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.090
Victor Davis Hanson, the
historian, he's a classicist.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.300
And he wrote about how the
classicists are destroying

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.270
the next generation of people
who want to learn classics,

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.490
by making it so
devoid of that things

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.570
that an average person
would care about.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.060
So I think, and I would hope,
that we're appetizing people,

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.880
for lack of a better word.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.477
And people tell me that they've
become history majors because

00:16:38.477 --> 00:16:39.060
of this stuff.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.780
That's wonderful.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.580
And then they can
write me later and say,

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.770
I used to love your show, till
I found out all the things wrong

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.540
about it.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.126
And now that I'm a historian
I can explain those to you.

00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:51.570
But, yeah, from a standpoint
of what we're doing,

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.180
I mean, I think it's a little
bit like the way an author

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.430
writes a book about
a historical subject,

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.850
and knows how to bring out the
things that appeal to someone

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.725
who's making a TV, or a movie.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.690
It's a different thing, I think.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.829
I think history's
become a science.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.390
And I think by
becoming a science,

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.569
you lose some of the
elements that impact people

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:12.349
on a human level.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.040
Does that make sense?

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.599
SPEAKER: Makes sense.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.849
DAN CARLIN: Not intentionally,
just because somethings

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:17.150
are very hard to quantify.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.483
SPEAKER: And coming back to
that human level, we've also

00:17:19.483 --> 00:17:21.950
transitioned to an age
where some of the things

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.020
you wish you had--

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.810
on your episodes
where you say, I

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.000
wish I had known what this
person was thinking, writing,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.930
feeling.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.430
Some of that, we have now.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.340
We have people being
able to directly record

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.660
their feelings--

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.310
record what happened
in digital media.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.382
How do you think that
changes how we're then

00:17:40.382 --> 00:17:42.590
going to look back at history,
at these time periods,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.800
with this wealth of
additional direct information?

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.740
DAN CARLIN: Well, I've started
to adopt a term for what I do,

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.150
that other people use.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.670
I don't like it.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.400
But when I deal with people
who are talking about TV shows,

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.470
they all talk
about storytellers.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.232
And there's this real
dearth, apparently,

00:17:59.232 --> 00:18:00.440
of professional storytellers.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.314
Which is why you have
these movies coming out

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:06.020
that are 1970s cartoons turned
into a feature length film,

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.310
and part four.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.840
It's just a dearth of
storytellers, they tell me.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.310
So I was breaking down what a
storyteller means, if you just

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.950
use the words story and telling.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.510
And you think about
the modern world,

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.240
and how it opens up the
possibilities for anybody who

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.454
has--

00:18:21.454 --> 00:18:23.120
we'll just play with
the idea of a gene,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.370
but you know what I mean.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.746
A storyteller gene.

00:18:25.746 --> 00:18:27.620
Some of you out there
are great storytellers,

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.600
and it's almost
an innate quality.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.510
Doesn't mean you can't improve
it, but it's an innate quality.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.160
I had a grandfather who
was a great storyteller.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.040
This opens up the
door-- the new media,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.852
and everything in it--
with no gatekeepers.

00:18:38.852 --> 00:18:40.310
We've gone away
from the whole idea

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.010
that someone can prevent you
from telling your stories.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.230
Or that you somehow
have to please them

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.380
before they let you see if an
audience likes what you do.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.800
So for storytellers,
this is a golden age.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.650
Because you're going to have
more storytellers working

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.150
and telling stories
than you've ever

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.550
had in the history of the world.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.010
And I always quote this
quote that may or may not

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.270
have been a Napoleon quote.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.090
Some people say it's
a Joseph Stalin quote.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.702
But it's that quantity
has a quality all its own.

00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:10.160
And I used to go around selling
the idea of amateur content

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.060
in the 1990s.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.134
And I would go to these
executives, and they would say,

00:19:14.134 --> 00:19:15.300
nobody's going to like this.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.580
It's going to be juvenile.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.955
And if they were
any good, they'd

00:19:17.955 --> 00:19:20.030
be they'd be making money
for what they're doing.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.530
And I tried to
explain that, listen,

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.630
you're going to
have so much stuff,

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.962
that if even 0.05%
of it's good, there's

00:19:26.962 --> 00:19:28.670
going to be a ton of
good things made out

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.870
by 15-year-old kids
in their basement.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.210
So from a storytelling
standpoint,

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.030
the amount of people
doing this has exploded.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.220
Which means even if
a lot of it is crap,

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.235
for lack of a better
word, a lot of it's not.

00:19:42.235 --> 00:19:43.610
And that you have
a lot of people

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.150
that are working now, and
telling stories in a business

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.160
where there aren't that
many jobs for that.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.750
So we've improved
the number of people

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.390
who have access to telling their
stories who are good at it.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.400
The other side are the
stories, themselves.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.650
There are a lot of people
who aren't good storytellers

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.100
at all, but have lived through
things-- or have relatives,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.040
or friends, or people they know
who have lived through amazing

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.980
things--

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.100
who would love to document that.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.710
Your grandfather fought in
the Second World War, lived

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.880
through some amazing things.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.850
No one's going to know that,
right, after they're gone,

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.036
and after you're gone.

00:20:15.036 --> 00:20:16.910
But that doesn't have
to be the case anymore.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.730
You can record a
terrible podcast

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.480
with awful audio and
horrific storytelling skills,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.370
but get that information
down in a way

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.080
that future historians
will see as nuggets of gold

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.890
that they can mine later.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.195
Because if you imagine
how, 200 years from now,

00:20:36.195 --> 00:20:37.820
they're going to look
back on this era,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.620
and think about what
the historians are

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.620
going to have to work with,
compared to what we have now.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.300
If you had TV shows that you
could view now from 1750,

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.040
how would that change
your view of people

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.900
200 and some years ago?

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.697
So I mean, I think from a
storytelling standpoint,

00:20:53.697 --> 00:20:55.280
on the story side,
we're going to have

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.270
stories for historians that
dwarf any material they've ever

00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.871
had available.

00:20:59.871 --> 00:21:01.370
And we're going to
have storytellers

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.440
who would have died on
the vine somewhere telling

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.660
their friends in a bar
great stories, who are going

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.780
to be able to tell those
stories to thousands, tens

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.460
of thousands,
hundreds of thousands,

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.540
or millions of people.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.760
And not just now,
but I always try

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.780
to say if we do a show
today, how many people

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:21.210
are going to have heard that
show 100 years from now?

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.150
So I mean, there's a
long game going on here

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.525
that old media
doesn't deal with.

00:21:24.525 --> 00:21:26.840
Old media does, what's
the next ratings period,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.790
is this show going to
be around in a year?

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.150
When you put your grandfather's
World War II experiences

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.210
in an audio form,
set in digital stone,

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.930
for lack of a better
word, you die, he dies.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.210
200 years from now, some
historian finds that,

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.710
and your grandfather's
story becomes

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.200
part of a larger mosaic
of experiences that gets

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.290
added somewhere else.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.357
In other words, people are
creating history every day now.

00:21:49.357 --> 00:21:49.940
SPEAKER: Right

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.440
DAN CARLIN: In a
way that would have

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.790
been lost, even 15 years ago.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.260
SPEAKER: And that
storytelling, I

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.390
think, you focus a lot on
your Martian perspective.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.250
Have you been there?

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.708
DAN CARLIN: Yeah,
that's a nice way

00:22:01.708 --> 00:22:04.100
of saying I have a really
weird way of seeing things.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.850
SPEAKER: How do you ensure
that you retain that Martian

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:13.740
perspective in media that's
increasingly polarized

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.970
or homogeneous?

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:15.810
DAN CARLIN: Well,
I mean, I'm having

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.090
this problem with the political
show that we do, right now.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.460
The show that we started doing
first was "Common Sense,"

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.590
and that was a show that
grew right out of the radio

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.400
shows I used to do.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.120
And for lack of a better word,
politically I'm a reformer.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.630
I think we have some systemic
problems that require

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.140
us working together to fix.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.680
Now anything that requires
Americans working together

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.254
is a long shot, right
from the get go.

00:22:37.254 --> 00:22:38.670
But I talked about
this for years.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.220
And then what was
really weird to me

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.160
was that what was a long
shot when I started doing it

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.704
in the early 1990s,
all of a sudden--

00:22:45.704 --> 00:22:48.120
because I think the trends
became more obvious to people--

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.520
started looking like it
wasn't such a long shot.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.154
And maybe history
was turning my way.

00:22:52.154 --> 00:22:54.570
And a couple of years ago I
thought, this is crazy, right?

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.528
I mean, we started this
show when nobody cared.

00:22:56.528 --> 00:22:58.770
But the trends have
luckily fallen into place,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.561
to where what I'm
talking about is actually

00:23:00.561 --> 00:23:03.120
more relevant to people than
it was when I was in radio.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.324
And then, of course,
strange things

00:23:05.324 --> 00:23:06.990
began to happen in
our political system.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.690
And I sat down, not that
long ago, and I said,

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.110
I feel like my political
viewpoints have been blown out

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.970
of the water by events.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.505
And that somehow what I was
talking about went from, hey,

00:23:17.505 --> 00:23:19.380
you could actually see
it potentially falling

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.090
into place, to
forget about that.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.800
We are now so far
away from that,

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.930
that what I'm talking
about politically maybe

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.229
isn't relevant anymore.

00:23:26.229 --> 00:23:28.520
And so I haven't done a
"Common Sense" show in a while,

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.510
because it's an
inspiration-based program.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.420
And I feel, to be honest, as
lost as a lot of the country

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:33.929
does.

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:35.720
I don't feel like I
have anything to share.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.070
I feel like I'm an observer,
like everyone else.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.570
So you kind of have
to feel like you

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.860
know what you're
talking about, to talk

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.066
about these kinds of things.

00:23:42.066 --> 00:23:44.190
And all of a sudden I felt
like as much of a novice

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.898
as everyone else.

00:23:44.898 --> 00:23:47.870
I mean, I feel like we're
in an uncharted situation.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.580
That I have no more
ability to understand where

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.090
we're going than anyone else.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.760
And so I haven't felt
comfortable doing it.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.654
And so, from a
politics standpoint,

00:23:57.654 --> 00:23:59.320
I don't know what to
do about that show.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.250
In terms of Martian perspective
for the history standpoint,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.850
I mean, I feel like
that's who I am.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.600
I'm not sure I could
be anything but that.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.391
And just so you guys
know, I picked Martian

00:24:08.391 --> 00:24:10.244
because there are
no overtones to it.

00:24:10.244 --> 00:24:12.660
I mean, I tried to think, how
do you explain an outsider's

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.600
perspective without having some
baggage attached to any term

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.650
you can think of?

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.840
And I thought, well, what's the
baggage attached to Martian?

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.000
So it was a good way to say, I'm
different, but not in any way

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.095
you can easily classify.

00:24:25.095 --> 00:24:25.970
SPEAKER: Makes sense.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:26.470
Makes sense.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:31.770
And how has that perspective
evolved from the radio days?

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.290
I think a lot of people
here are obviously--

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.660
they've been sampling
from a variety of media.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.250
Radio is still a
part of our lives.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:43.440
How do you feel working in
radio versus podcasts gives you

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.612
a different perspective?

00:24:44.612 --> 00:24:46.070
DAN CARLIN: Radio
was awful for me,

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.600
so the perspective is very
different right off the bat.

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:53.080
Listen, we all understand,
we've all heard radio.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.550
It's a very specific kind
of medium that's developed,

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.719
over 50 or 60 years,
a certain way.

00:24:57.719 --> 00:24:59.760
If you go back and you
listen to old radio shows,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.650
obviously there's a
lot more creativity.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:06.590
There was a lot more theater
of the mind, as they called it.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.670
The ability to have you sit by
a box with a voice coming out,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.657
and you, in your head,
determine everything.

00:25:13.657 --> 00:25:15.740
I was trying to explain
to my kids, the difference

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.490
between reading a book
or going and seeing

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.949
the movie about the book.

00:25:18.949 --> 00:25:20.990
And the difference is, is
when you read the book,

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.406
you're all reading
the same words,

00:25:22.406 --> 00:25:24.830
but you're conjuring up
different images in your head.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.970
What does the main
character look like to you?

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:27.470
Right?

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.570
If I show you the
main character,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.700
you don't have to think
about that anymore.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.640
In radio, when you look at
the way stories were told--

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.442
and it was storytelling
a lot of the time.

00:25:36.442 --> 00:25:38.150
I mean, radio obviously
had news, sports,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.350
all the things it has now.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.990
But it also had dramas, and
all these kinds of things

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.665
that the radio format really
doesn't allow for now.

00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:46.790
And I remember an older
person who grew up on radio

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.059
said that it's like a muscle.

00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:51.350
And if you don't use it, you
lose some of that ability.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.205
So if I played an old radio
show for my 12-year-old,

00:25:54.205 --> 00:25:55.580
she's going to be
bored to tears.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.663
She's not going to get it.

00:25:56.663 --> 00:25:59.210
It's not going to
mean anything to her.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.270
And so by the time
I'm in radio, we

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.276
want to play with some
of the creative tools

00:26:04.276 --> 00:26:05.900
that audio allows
you to have, but it's

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.340
such a restrictive venue.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.590
It was then, and is more now.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.090
Right?

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.673
You have a top of
the hour news break.

00:26:10.673 --> 00:26:12.969
You have a break 10
minutes after the hour.

00:26:12.969 --> 00:26:14.510
I mean, there's all
these things that

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.094
constrain what you
can do, and then

00:26:16.094 --> 00:26:17.510
add to that the
fact that you have

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.984
to assume that your audience is
turning over every 15 minutes,

00:26:20.984 --> 00:26:21.650
in large number.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.070
Right?

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.880
You're getting into the car.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.640
You're getting out of the car.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.370
So what does that
mean I have to do?

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.800
I have to restate the same
things over and over again.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.960
I mean, my moment in radio,
where I knew I was doomed,

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.840
happened when I had yet another
fight with a consultant who

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.820
told me that everyone
in the audience

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.000
has to know where I stand
on every political issue

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.210
within five minutes of
turning on the program.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.392
Now, first of all,
nobody's saying,

00:26:46.392 --> 00:26:48.600
OK, here are my views on
all the subjects of the day.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.058
In other words,
what they meant is,

00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:52.550
you have to be so
obviously identifiable,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.140
that when they
hear you, they can

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.095
tell what your views
on abortion are,

00:26:56.095 --> 00:26:58.220
because of what your views
on this other thing are.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.500
And I said to him, that's
a cartoon character.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.083
I said, that's not
a real human being.

00:27:02.083 --> 00:27:03.770
He goes, we're not
in the business

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.386
of marketing real human beings.

00:27:06.386 --> 00:27:07.760
In other words,
they were looking

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.370
for a cartoon character.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.880
Now I didn't get
fired, so I must

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.160
have been at least passably OK.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.500
But I never went the
cartoon character route.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:22.400
And so when the chance to do
media on my terms showed up,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.190
and you said, OK, this is
your creative white space,

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.440
and it's a giant space
that's all white.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.130
There's no top of
the hour news breaks.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.020
There's no resetting what you're
talking about, or who you are.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.960
From a creative
standpoint, I lost my mind.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.620
I would do 20 different
podcasts, if I could,

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.370
because I have ideas
for all these things.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.570
Because it's just
such an amazing--

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.100
we do six hour shows sometimes.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.560
Who does six hour shows?

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.070
Who lets you do six hour shows?

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.060
Right?

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.795
And so I'm intoxicated by
the creative white space.

00:27:49.795 --> 00:27:51.170
And one of the
things about radio

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.160
was that that white
space was diminishing

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.380
the whole time I was in it.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.140
By the time the 1996
Telecommunications Act

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.170
was passed, and we went
from having a radio station

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:04.340
owner that was in the building
with you, to an owner that's

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.210
on Wall Street selling stock
and owns 1,000 radio stations,

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.465
I mean, we went from
little white space to none.

00:28:10.465 --> 00:28:11.090
SPEAKER: Right.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.580
DAN CARLIN: And so, for me,
this opened up at just about

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.760
the same time, and it
was like an escape hatch.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.520
It's perfect.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:16.730
SPEAKER: Right.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:17.771
DAN CARLIN: It's perfect.

00:28:17.771 --> 00:28:20.310
SPEAKER: And how did
this change over the time

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.590
that you worked in the space?

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.450
In 2005 you started
your podcast.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:28.400
2015, that's 10 years
later, "Serial" comes out.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.350
"Serial" hits mainstream media.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.370
You guys both win the best
podcast, in slightly different

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.020
categories, 2014, 2015.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.140
Bringing a whole new
set of listeners,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.450
and changing what it
means to be a podcast.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.940
How did that affect your
show, and how did it change

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.926
how you approach the problem?

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:50.050
DAN CARLIN: It was the
continuation of a trend that

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:50.990
was already going on.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.860
So when I got into
podcasting in 2005--

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.690
we always say we started
podcasting the same month

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.710
that iTunes started
supporting podcasts.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.340
And when we did, there were
no professional content on it.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.250
One of the great things that was
done to nurture the podcasting

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.130
space was not dividing
professional and amateur

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.930
content, and separating us.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.030
So you don't have a big
link, when you first

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.740
go on there, that says, do
you want professional stuff,

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.490
or amateur stuff.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.330
So by allowing us to compete
with anyone in the same space,

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.340
it became more of a meritocracy.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.140
Now it didn't mean
that ESPN didn't

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.120
have huge advantages over you.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.550
But it meant you're still
competing in the same space.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.884
Now I always said that once
the pros got into podcasting,

00:29:30.884 --> 00:29:32.300
it was a good thing
for everybody.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.966
Because we're all raised on-- at
least I was, in my generation--

00:29:34.966 --> 00:29:37.180
raised on this idea that
media is a zero sum game.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.970
And if you're watching one
TV network at 8 o'clock,

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.220
you're not watching the other
TV network at 8 o'clock.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.735
So no one has any interest
in telling you about what's

00:29:44.735 --> 00:29:45.610
on the other network.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.484
Podcasting's not like that.

00:29:47.484 --> 00:29:49.150
You can promote
somebody else's podcast,

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.040
it doesn't hurt
your podcast at all.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.062
So when the big boys
started coming in--

00:29:53.062 --> 00:29:54.520
and I don't remember
who was first.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.620
I think some of the sports
networks were the first ones.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.370
And all they were doing
was rebroadcasting

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.190
their other content
using podcast

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.750
as a distribution vehicle.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.950
I said, this is great.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.930
Because once you
download a podcast,

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:06.760
you're a podcast listener.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.990
It's no longer foreign.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.590
You know how to do it.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.912
And the biggest impediment
we had, when we started is--

00:30:11.912 --> 00:30:13.120
I would go to dinner parties.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.610
You want imagine uncomfortable,
you sit at a dinner party,

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:16.960
and the first question
anybody asks is,

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.430
so what do you do for a living?

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.329
In 2006, this is a 45
minute conversation.

00:30:21.329 --> 00:30:22.870
And at the end, the
guy still doesn't

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.210
know what I do for a living.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.320
Now it's not.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.070
Right?

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:30.097
And so I think what
helped us in that space

00:30:30.097 --> 00:30:31.555
is all of the
professionals saying,

00:30:31.555 --> 00:30:32.770
yeah, download the podcast.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.990
And then once you do, you
go, what are the podcasts

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.410
are there out there?

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.170
I know how to do that.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:36.910
I've got a pod catcher.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.000
I've got all these things.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.320
So I think the pros
coming into it ended up

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.030
increasing the size
of the people who

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.670
are potential listeners,
and then we could grab them.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.310
So how the industry has changed
is that we went from something

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.400
that no one knew what it was,
to something that everybody

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.630
below a certain age does.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.150
And the respectability's
gone up.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.650
No one assumes you're some kid
in a basement-- although kids

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.740
in basements can
do wonderful work.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.840
They think that this
could be anything.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.590
And they're right.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.660
I mean, when you talk about
the numbers of listeners,

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.540
it's insane, sometimes.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.270
Some of these-- "Serial" has
an insane number of listeners.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.144
SPEAKER: Yeah, right.

00:31:08.144 --> 00:31:13.000
And here at Google we certainly
cherish and celebrate the kid

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.530
in the basement with anything.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.980
So I think a lot of people
here, especially engineers,

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.870
would love to know a little bit
more about how do you build it.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.500
How do you put
together that podcast,

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.459
from idea to episode coming up?

00:31:25.459 --> 00:31:26.500
DAN CARLIN: It's changed.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.160
Once upon a time I could
walk into the studio,

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.949
and I would sit down--

00:31:31.949 --> 00:31:34.240
or stand up-- and I would
record the whole thing, boom.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.710
If I made a mistake--

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.630
a fatal mistake--

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.110
35 minutes into it, we turned
it off and we started over.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.071
So finally the engineer
said, why are you doing that?

00:31:44.071 --> 00:31:46.570
Why don't you just use-- see,
the problem started, actually,

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.800
with no cough button.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.371
So in radio, you
have a cough button,

00:31:49.371 --> 00:31:50.620
or a clear your throat button.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.072
So you push it, clear your
throat, you're off air.

00:31:53.072 --> 00:31:54.530
So there wasn't
anything like that.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.841
So you try to clear your
throat 35 minutes into it

00:31:56.841 --> 00:31:58.340
and say, ah, had
to clear my throat.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.350
We have to start over.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.580
So the engineer said, what?

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.580
Why don't you just
clear your throat,

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.080
and tell me about it, and I
will get rid of that later.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.397
Which started the process
of, OK, this show was great.

00:32:09.397 --> 00:32:10.480
I wanted to do 50 minutes.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.909
49 minutes were
great, the ending

00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:12.950
sucked, let's start over.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.075
And he's like, no, no, no,
we're not starting over.

00:32:15.075 --> 00:32:17.800
We're going to just record the
one minute that you didn't do.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.410
And so slowly but surely
it became more that way.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:21.490
And I was scared.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.980
Because as a radio guy, not
knowing where this podcast was

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.750
going, I'm thinking,
if this doesn't work,

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.464
I've got to go dive
back into radio.

00:32:27.464 --> 00:32:28.630
And what if I lose my chops?

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.250
What if I can't--
now I need editing.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:30.490
Right?

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.980
I can't go in there and speak
for 20 minutes off the cuff

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.670
anymore.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.461
He said, do you really
care so much about--

00:32:35.461 --> 00:32:39.730
so I mean it was a process of me
embracing this new opportunity

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.840
wholeheartedly in
a way that said,

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.170
what do we need to do
in this kind of venue

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.730
to do the best
show in this venue?

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.759
And forget the idea that
you have to worry about,

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:51.300
I've got to go back
to radio someday,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.700
so I better do-- you know.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.250
And once we did
that, there was not

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.140
only a liberation, but
unfortunately, maybe,

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.950
for the listeners, an extended--

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.620
I mean we'd get
longer and longer.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.325
And these shows just got so--

00:33:01.325 --> 00:33:02.950
I mean, like, when
I do six hour shows,

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.522
I don't want to do
a six hour show.

00:33:04.522 --> 00:33:05.980
That's not a feature,
that's a bug.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.126
But if I had to record
them all without stopping,

00:33:10.126 --> 00:33:11.500
there would be no
six hour shows.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.060
There might not be
40 minute shows.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.730
So the way it's changed
is the embracing

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:19.882
of the techniques of how to
do this, which we're learning.

00:33:19.882 --> 00:33:22.090
One of the things that I
talk to other big podcasters

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.880
about is, we kind of try
to share the information,

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.110
because there are no metrics.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.740
Right?

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.240
So you go, what are
you guys seeing?

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.170
And how do you make money?

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.190
And how is this working for you?

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.300
And the funny thing
is, is that if you

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.300
looked at all the top podcasts
and say, how do you make money,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.040
they actually have
different models.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.700
Because it's really
tied to what you do,

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.200
and the kind of
production you have.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.660
I mean, for example, I get out--

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.890
I'm ashamed to say--

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:48.450
about 2.5 shows a year at
this point-- history shows.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.190
If I had to live
off advertising--

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.400
and I will do more
than one ad per show--

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.800
OK, well you can't do that.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.620
But if you do three
shows a week--

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.170
like Joe Rogan
does-- and you could

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.220
do four or five ads
per show, that's

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.200
a viable monetary
solution for you.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.810
So we actually all have
different kinds of approaches.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.420
So we sell the
old history shows.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.880
After a couple of years,
take them off the free feed,

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.940
and we sell them.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.940
Well, most people have
different kinds of shows.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.170
These are evergreen, right?

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:14.219
They're as good
when you get them

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.385
a year from now, as they
were when we released them.

00:34:16.385 --> 00:34:18.780
If they sucked, they
suck just as bad.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.219
But most people can't do that.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.889
If you're talking politics,
like I do on the other show,

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:25.460
those shows are like a car,
and you drive them off the lot,

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.967
and they lose half
their value right away.

00:34:27.967 --> 00:34:30.300
And so I guess what the long
answer to your question is,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.160
we're learning.

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.159
And we've been learning.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:35.760
And it's a unique medium, and
so there are unique things.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.885
And there are no metrics, and
so we're all learning together.

00:34:38.885 --> 00:34:41.010
I was just at the podcast
convention two weeks ago,

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:44.940
and it's really interesting
hearing the different lessons

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.530
that people learn, because
they're doing different things,

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:50.370
but stuff that might
apply to what you do too.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.889
So you and I were talking
about the infancy.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:55.989
You're all employees at Google,
and you're used to all this.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:59.490
But if you think about the
fact that we are literally

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.280
at the very start of this--
it doesn't seem like it,

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.290
because I've been
doing it since 2005.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:06.720
But what is this going
to look like in 50 years?

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.587
And what's the societal
impact going to be?

00:35:08.587 --> 00:35:10.170
And you may just
think it's a podcast,

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.900
but if you're the
government of China,

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.520
and you're thinking
about your people

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.075
doing political podcasts,
that is a destabilizing force.

00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:21.200
And so I think what we're
going to find out later--

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.330
and I think we're seeing it
even now in its infancy--

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.700
this is dangerous stuff.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.600
Like every de-stabilising
technology is, right?

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:35.220
Letting people communicate to
broad masses of other people

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.250
is untested stuff,
and no dictatorship

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.320
in the history of the
world ever wanted that.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.230
So I keep trying to tell
myself that as far as we think

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.750
we come in this, we're
at the very beginning

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.920
of the beginnings, still.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.820
SPEAKER: Right.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.166
And we talked earlier about
how some of this content

00:35:51.166 --> 00:35:53.040
is so appealing, because
it feels like you're

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.010
filling a void, potentially,
in the education

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.640
that a lot of your
listeners have,

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.910
in terms of getting the
context of the history

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.140
that you describe.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.060
How do you view your role in
the broader education story?

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.170
DAN CARLIN: Yeah, I'm
uncomfortable with that.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:13.451
And I'm uncomfortable with it
because I was a history major,

00:36:13.451 --> 00:36:13.950
as I said.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.279
And one thing a history major
with a BA in history knows

00:36:17.279 --> 00:36:18.570
is that you're not a historian.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:19.069
Right?

00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:21.215
And you really understand
that really well.

00:36:21.215 --> 00:36:23.340
So I'm having dinner with
my mother-in-law one day.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.420
And I always give
her credit for this,

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.586
because I'm doing the
political podcast at the time.

00:36:26.586 --> 00:36:29.700
And I'm regaling her with one
of my wonderful dinnertime

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.350
stories, which are
bloody and horrible,

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.240
and they sound a lot
like the podcast.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.160
And I think as a
way to dissuade me

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.951
from talking like that
at dinner, she said,

00:36:36.951 --> 00:36:38.550
why don't you do a
podcast about this?

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.133
And I said, because
I'm not qualified.

00:36:40.133 --> 00:36:41.370
I said, I'm not a historian.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.300
I can't teach history.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.716
She said, I didn't
realize you had

00:36:43.716 --> 00:36:46.350
to have a PhD to tell stories.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.600
This is the first time the
storytelling thing came up.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.730
And I went, hmm.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:52.770
I said, OK, that's
an interesting point.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.290
And then I thought, well,
OK, how you tell the stories?

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.831
So if you go listen to the first
history podcast we ever did,

00:36:57.831 --> 00:37:00.190
I think it's 15 minutes long.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.340
It shows you what I was
thinking at the time.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.400
We thought we would
do a show just talking

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.119
about all the weird
stuff in a story.

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:09.160
But we weren't going to
tell you about the story,

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.630
because we assumed you'd
show up as a history fan,

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:12.720
you'd know the story.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.550
So if I'm talking about
Alexander the Great

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.500
and Hitler-- which I
was in the first show--

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.972
I assume you know that.

00:37:17.972 --> 00:37:19.680
So we just talked
about the weird things.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.677
Right?

00:37:20.677 --> 00:37:23.010
So the feedback starts coming
in, and people are saying,

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.160
yeah, we like these twisty weird
"Twilight Zone" things you say,

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.852
but we don't know the story.

00:37:27.852 --> 00:37:29.310
So you kind of go,
OK, well I guess

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.965
I've got to give
enough of the story

00:37:30.965 --> 00:37:33.090
so that you could enjoy
the "Twilight Zone" things.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.250
And slowly but surely
that leads to us

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.500
telling more of the story.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.020
So we had to figure out
why on Earth you should

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.390
trust me telling you the story.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.440
And so we had to invent things.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.877
One of the things we invented--

00:37:45.877 --> 00:37:47.460
because I think we're
the only one who

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.660
does it, because I can't
imagine anybody needs it--

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.030
we call them audio footnotes.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.300
So if I was writing
a book, and I'm just

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.900
Joe Blow with a BA in history,
why should you trust me?

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.400
I'm going to say a
fact in the book,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.080
and then I'm going to have a
little footnote at the bottom

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.760
that says, well, I got this
information from somebody

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.520
who you should trust, and you
can go look it up yourself.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.406
And there was nothing comparable
to that in the audio space.

00:38:09.406 --> 00:38:11.280
And so that's when we
started quoting people.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.905
And once again, you've got to be
careful about doing that, too.

00:38:13.905 --> 00:38:16.500
You don't want anybody's work
to be plagiarized, or anything,

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.875
but you want to
make sure though,

00:38:17.875 --> 00:38:20.430
that when I say this
happened, that I give you

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.580
somebody who you can believe.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.420
You know, so-and-so
said this happened,

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.211
and then you integrate
that into the story.

00:38:26.211 --> 00:38:30.290
Now all of us understand that
every historian self-selects.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.700
And so just because historian
A says this happened,

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.830
that doesn't mean historian
B agrees with them.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:36.910
So then you get competing
audio footnotes.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.544
So we developed this idea
of, OK, well this historian

00:38:39.544 --> 00:38:40.960
says this, and
this one says that.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.580
Well, this turned
out to be great.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.572
We had no idea that
people didn't get--

00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:46.030
because they're
not history majors.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.738
They haven't spent a
lot of time on this.

00:38:47.738 --> 00:38:50.756
They don't realize that there's
not one view of history.

00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:52.630
So one guy wrote me,
and he had a great line.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.060
He said I didn't realize there
was like an MSNBC Fox News

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.070
version of history,
and there always was.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.220
And so this is something
that in history they

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.330
call historiography.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:01.830
Right?

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:03.310
The practice of writing history.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.680
The practice of
selecting sources.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.280
Because there's always
a selection process.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:08.780
Right?

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.170
And this is something historians
have been criticized forever.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.503
So once we started highlighting
this element of history,

00:39:13.503 --> 00:39:15.310
people were like, I had no idea.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.280
But it became something that
was part of the audio footnotes.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.470
And so learning how
to do this gig--

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.370
and I would suggest we're still
learning how to do this gig--

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:28.390
required us to invent ways to
get around our own limitations.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.729
Limitation number one is I'm
a storyteller, I guessed,

00:39:30.729 --> 00:39:32.020
and I know I'm not a historian.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.080
So how do I assure you that
you're getting something

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.389
that you can trust?

00:39:36.389 --> 00:39:38.680
I quote somebody who's valid,
and who you should trust.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.180
And then I quote somebody
who disagrees with him, who's

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.388
also valid, you should trust.

00:39:41.388 --> 00:39:43.876
So learning how to do this job.

00:39:43.876 --> 00:39:44.750
SPEAKER: Makes sense.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.140
So I have really
enjoyed getting a chance

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.349
to ask you some of the
pressing questions on my mind.

00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:50.973
I'd like to open it
up to the audience.

00:39:50.973 --> 00:39:51.850
DAN CARLIN: Yeah.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.890
SPEAKER: If you'd like
to ask Dan a question,

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.540
please step up to the mic.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.248
DAN CARLIN: Love to
hear from any of you.

00:39:57.248 --> 00:39:58.820
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.450
And just line up behind the mic.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.062
DAN CARLIN: Thank you
for coming, by the way.

00:40:04.062 --> 00:40:04.770
SPEAKER: Perfect.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:06.020
If we get started right there?

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.280
AUDIENCE: Hey, Dan, huge fan.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.210
DAN CARLIN: Thank you.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:09.710
AUDIENCE: I have a
serious question.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.811
But just first, is Ben up
there with you right now?

00:40:12.811 --> 00:40:14.560
DAN CARLIN: Did you
ever want to meet him?

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.470
He's been here the whole time.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.470
AUDIENCE: Just checking.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.660
Good.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.302
So my question is
kind of about how

00:40:19.302 --> 00:40:20.510
you pick what you talk about.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.780
In July I was actually
sitting on Cemetery Ridge,

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.160
looking over Pickett's Charge--

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:25.430
DAN CARLIN: Wow.

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:27.380
AUDIENCE: --and thinking about
"Blueprint for Armageddon,"

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.850
because that was
a huge cannonade,

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.490
and it was a huge
artillery action.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.380
Well, one, could you
please do the Civil War?

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.574
But two, how do you pick?

00:40:37.574 --> 00:40:39.740
DAN CARLIN: Well, first of
all, isn't it interesting

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.739
that all of our shows
sound like they would make

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:42.948
great heavy metal band names?

00:40:42.948 --> 00:40:43.822
SPEAKER: Yeah, right.

00:40:43.822 --> 00:40:44.344
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:47.420
DAN CARLIN: You know, here's
the problem with that.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.378
And like a guy wrote me
the other day, he said,

00:40:49.378 --> 00:40:52.060
would you please talk
about 17th century India?

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.380
And it's such a compliment
to think that I could

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.102
speak about 17th century India.

00:40:56.102 --> 00:40:57.560
Because what happens
is, is that we

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.770
have this period of time where
I can do research for program.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.960
But it's not enough time
for me to educate myself

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.430
from scratch on anything.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.080
So all the topics
we pick are things

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.785
that I have a good
foundation on, myself.

00:41:08.785 --> 00:41:09.410
And it's funny.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.090
I have two kids,
and one of them has

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.890
a brain that's a little like
mine, in terms of how it works.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.010
And it's funny, because
she'll get into a subject

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:20.210
intensely, and stay into it
for several months, or a year,

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.750
and then move on
to something else.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.607
But she will remember
every single thing

00:41:23.607 --> 00:41:24.690
she learned about it then.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.900
And that's how my mind works.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.370
And so all these subjects
we talk about in the show

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:30.350
are things that I
was really into once,

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.259
and have a pretty
good foundation about.

00:41:32.259 --> 00:41:33.800
And then what I have
to do after that

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.580
is begin to re-educate myself
on all the new stuff that's

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.890
been discovered or written
about since the last time

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.445
I paid close attention to it.

00:41:41.445 --> 00:41:43.070
And so all these
subjects we talk about

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:45.070
are things that I've
already been interested in,

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:46.739
and I know something about.

00:41:46.739 --> 00:41:48.780
The Civil War has never
been an interest of mine,

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.113
because I don't like civil wars.

00:41:50.113 --> 00:41:53.150
And I don't like civil wars,
because when I was a military--

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.126
I still am a military
history nut--

00:41:55.126 --> 00:41:57.500
I don't like armies that are
fighting each other that are

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.666
mirror images of each other.

00:41:58.666 --> 00:42:00.650
This is the silliest
thing in the world to base

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.733
what you're interested on.

00:42:01.733 --> 00:42:04.221
But I like the contrast of
Greeks against Persians.

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:05.970
I don't want to see
Greeks against Greeks.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.700
So I'm not going to talk to you
about the Peloponnesian War,

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:08.570
because it bores me.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.110
Right?

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.550
So that's my problem.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.660
Civil wars are interesting
in a societal sense.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.404
But from a military
sense, I don't

00:42:14.404 --> 00:42:16.070
want to watch two
armies that are mirror

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.729
images of each other go at it.

00:42:17.729 --> 00:42:20.270
So people keep thinking, when
are you going to the Civil War?

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.185
I might do reconstruction
afterwards.

00:42:22.185 --> 00:42:23.810
I might do the period
leading up to it.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:25.820
But I find both of those
more interesting than the war

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.320
itself.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.434
I know that heresy, but--

00:42:27.434 --> 00:42:28.322
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.290
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.874
Next question.

00:42:30.874 --> 00:42:32.915
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could speak more

00:42:32.915 --> 00:42:35.270
about the structure you've
developed for the stories.

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:38.180
And maybe how you take content
and put it into buckets

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.910
to create something that's
compelling and hooks listeners.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.660
DAN CARLIN: That's a
really good question.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.000
And I don't know--

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.810
I wish I could claim more
of a conscious desire.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:50.270
I mean, sometimes I'll
sit down and I'll say,

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:52.160
could we tell this
story backwards?

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.690
I mean, there's
fun ways that you

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:55.500
sit down right at
the outset, and you

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.250
look at what you want
to say, and you say,

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.110
OK, there are multiple
ways to tell every story.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.387
The most obvious way
is the linear way.

00:43:02.387 --> 00:43:04.220
The problem is that
that's a very boring way

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.060
to tell a story.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.010
But if the story is
very complicated--

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.140
like we mentioned
the First World War--

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.242
that's a really hard
story to follow.

00:43:11.242 --> 00:43:13.700
So you end up sometimes having
to choose the linear option,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.990
because it's easier
to make sense of.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.900
But we often do sit
down-- and the one thing

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.570
I don't ever want to do is
have a template for this.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.940
So sometimes we'll
deliberately do something

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:27.260
as a way to screw up any idea in
your mind that we have a plan.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.040
Right?

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.050
We're going to make sure that
the last show was like this,

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:31.630
so this other one's
going to be like that.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.840
So that you get this idea that
you don't know what's coming,

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.000
and you don't know how
we're going to do it.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.830
And it keeps us
from getting bored,

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.420
and keeps it from
turning into a formula.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.170
So the first thing we do is we
look at what we've done lately

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.680
and say, OK, can we do this
new one differently than that?

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.930
And that's truthfully the
part that's most satisfying,

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.480
because that's the
creative process.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.100
And that's when you sit down--

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.190
and these are really hard
to do, needless to say.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.480
I mean, six hour audio
is really hard to do.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.150
But afterwards the
feeling of satisfaction,

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:04.010
if people like it, there's not
much that compares to that.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.904
And I tell my wife all the time,
because I'm such a wreck when

00:44:06.904 --> 00:44:07.820
these things are done.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.250
I mean, the studio looks
like college finals week.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.240
There's pizza boxes.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.950
There's caffeine everywhere.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.900
And you're so burnt
out that there's

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.400
a week of recovering afterwards.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.858
And she said to me once, she
said, do you really like this?

00:44:18.858 --> 00:44:20.160
And I said, I really like it.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.535
And I said I really
like the idea

00:44:21.535 --> 00:44:24.300
that I can look back on this
and say I used every brain cell.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:24.800
Right?

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.860
It killed me, but that's
how you know you really--

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.870
whatever potential is
there-- and potential's

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.250
a weird haunting
thing, isn't it?

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.560
Because you could become
the president and not

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.600
live up to your potential.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.690
But I like the idea that
I'm kicking my rear end

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.610
and using everything I have.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:43.847
And then when people like it,
on top of that, well, I mean,

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:44.930
listen, we should all be--

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.054
I mean, that's a real gift.

00:44:46.054 --> 00:44:47.310
I mean, it's really lucky.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.330
And when I think of how upset
I was in radio for so long,

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:53.090
to be doing this and have
people reacting so well,

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.831
I hope everybody gets to feel
this, because it's a great--

00:44:55.831 --> 00:44:57.080
and that's the creative thing.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.704
I mean, to be able
to do creative work,

00:44:58.704 --> 00:45:01.440
and have people like it, and
make a living doing it, I mean,

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.840
who wouldn't give your
right arm for that?

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.480
So I hope that
answers the question.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.500
That doesn't really
help you understand

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:07.374
the creative process.

00:45:07.374 --> 00:45:10.160
But there's no scripts.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.050
Because it would sound
scripted, wouldn't it?

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.466
I think that's probably how
you get a six hour show, too--

00:45:14.466 --> 00:45:17.614
no scripts, it's just
a lot of rambling on.

00:45:17.614 --> 00:45:20.030
But I simply write down the
things that I'm interested in.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:22.250
And I will say that I
thought about the difference

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.190
between history and
storytelling in this sense,

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.240
that it's a different criteria.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.850
So if you're a
historian writing, say,

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:31.220
the history of Julius Caesar,
you're going to do a triage,

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.636
and you're going to say, OK,
what has to be in this story,

00:45:33.636 --> 00:45:34.527
versus what doesn't.

00:45:34.527 --> 00:45:36.860
Some of the things that aren't
going to make your triage

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:40.070
list as a historian are going to
make my list as a storyteller.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.110
So for example, I
read something once

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.854
that said Caesar, in his home,
grew up with an ancestor wall.

00:45:44.854 --> 00:45:47.270
And I think you might have
seen this in "Game of Thrones,"

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:51.260
or something, because my friend
Dan Weiss ripped that off.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.760
But it's a wall of--

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.850
I think it was wax
faces of his ancestors--

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:57.252
with bios underneath him.

00:45:57.252 --> 00:45:59.210
So when you grow up as
a kid, you look at this,

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.710
and you see what
your family's done.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:03.650
And it's supposed to prompt
you to want to emulate that.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:06.770
Now, if you're writing a history
book about Julius Caesar,

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.689
and you've got 400
pages, and no more,

00:46:08.689 --> 00:46:10.730
you might leave that out,
because it's not really

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.170
important to the history.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.949
But in the story,
it's fantastic,

00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:15.240
and that makes it in the story.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.570
So as a storyteller
you're self-selecting

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.040
different things.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.400
I want to blow your mind
from a historical standpoint.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.634
If I'm writing to an
academic audience,

00:46:24.634 --> 00:46:26.300
different things make
it into the story.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.200
Drier things, maybe,
less interesting things.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.200
But so when we're coming
up with how we do this,

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.566
I read all these books, I write
down all the weird things--

00:46:34.566 --> 00:46:36.440
including all the
important things-- and then

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.340
you try to figure
out what makes it in.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.340
And because there's no
scripts, sometimes things

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.230
I really want in the
story don't make it in.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:43.730
And sometimes things
that I thought,

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:47.120
maybe I'll steer clear of this,
somehow make it into the audio

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.770
when I'm on autopilot.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:52.190
And so there is an
improvisational jazz format

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.620
to this, where there's
certain points I need to hit,

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.230
but within those
points I can freeform.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:59.582
And that's kind of the
design, if that makes sense.

00:46:59.582 --> 00:47:00.415
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:00.415 --> 00:47:00.980
DAN CARLIN: Sure.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.521
SPEAKER: I think we can just
try to squeeze in a couple more,

00:47:03.521 --> 00:47:04.880
real quick.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.620
AUDIENCE: So one of
my favorite episodes

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:10.460
was the talk you
had with Sam Harris.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.350
DAN CARLIN: That's
interesting, OK.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:13.990
AUDIENCE: And I
was wondering if--

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:15.110
two things.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.420
Are there any future plans
to kind of continue that?

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.280
And is there anyone
that you would

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.330
like to kind of collaborate
with on a future episode?

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:26.630
DAN CARLIN: I forgot how the
Sam Harris thing came about.

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:28.760
But Sam's got a podcast,
and I have a podcast.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.520
And we did something Sam
called a cross-cast, where

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.580
we basically did the same
show for our audiences

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.160
at the same time.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.290
There's someone who works
with Sam that got a hold of me

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:42.830
recently, and wanted to
do something on video.

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:45.170
I guess this, to me, boils
down to the same thing

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.900
the political show boils down
to, a little bit, in the sense

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.340
that I don't know
how comfortable I

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.070
am in political
discussions anymore,

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.720
because I feel like we're
a little off the map,

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.390
if you will.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:57.980
And the normal
parameters with which

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:01.590
I'm accustomed to discussing
things aren't normal anymore.

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:02.630
And I have to be honest.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:05.060
You think, OK, I've been
following this political system

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:05.750
for years.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.065
I was basically a PoliSci minor.

00:48:08.065 --> 00:48:09.940
You think you know what
you're talking about.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.000
But if you'd asked me five
years ago about the idea,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.830
for lack of a better
word, of racism coming

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.260
to the fore the
way it has, I would

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.790
have told you you were crazy.

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:24.380
I mean, I thought
this was dying out.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.671
I mean, I really thought that--

00:48:25.671 --> 00:48:27.544
I grew up watching
"All in the Family,"

00:48:27.544 --> 00:48:29.210
and you had this
Archie Bunker character

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:32.630
that was supposed to
be a middle aged man

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.210
who had all of these views
from another time period,

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:36.860
running into the
new way of looking

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.360
at things, which is much more
the way we look at things now.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.050
And the implication was that
you can't change these people,

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:45.240
but eventually
they will die out.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.370
I could not have
been more wrong.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.390
So why would you listen to me?

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:54.960
Why would I talk about this,
when I didn't see that coming?

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.080
And so to discuss
something with Sam Harris--

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.507
listen, he's a fabulously
intelligent guy,

00:49:00.507 --> 00:49:01.840
and I enjoyed our conversations.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.270
You know, if you heard it, I
think Sam was pretty serious.

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.061
But I was laughing.

00:49:05.061 --> 00:49:07.570
I was having a good time.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.210
But I'm not sure
laughing and having

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.310
a good time about the
political situation right

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.710
now is the proper approach.

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:16.537
And I don't know what
the proper approach is.

00:49:16.537 --> 00:49:18.120
So in answer to your
question, I think

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:21.300
until I figure that out, I'm
not sure how much of that

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.285
I want to do.

00:49:22.285 --> 00:49:23.160
Does that make sense?

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.800
I really feel like an
observer at this point,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.840
when it comes to that,
rather than somebody

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.430
that can explain what it means.

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:31.210
Because I didn't see it coming.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.187
Make sense?

00:49:32.187 --> 00:49:32.847
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:32.847 --> 00:49:34.680
DAN CARLIN: Do you
really want me explaining

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.550
something I'm not sure about?

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.091
That might be a
better way to put it.

00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:38.083
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:38.582 --> 00:49:39.295
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:39.295 --> 00:49:40.920
So I actually came
up here to ask about

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.020
how you draw the line
between what historians do,

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.460
and what historical
storytellers do.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.360
But I think you already answered
that in a previous question.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.660
So as long as I'm
here, I'm going

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:48.785
to go to a backup question.

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.250
DAN CARLIN: Sure.

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:52.170
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned being excited

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:54.930
about the possibility
of essentially producing

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:57.750
a much larger volume of source
material for future historians.

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.880
That anyone can get
their story down.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.820
There is no end to how
much of it we'll produce.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:06.700
But you've also mentioned
that historians see history

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.604
differently, partly because
of their perspectives,

00:50:09.604 --> 00:50:11.270
but also partly because
they've absorbed

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:13.640
different sets of source
material to different degrees.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.660
Right?

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.505
So putting those
two things together,

00:50:16.505 --> 00:50:18.380
do you think the practice
of history, as it's

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.990
done today can, survive
the explosion in the amount

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.830
of source material?

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:24.163
Is there going to be any one
that can absorb all of that

00:50:24.163 --> 00:50:24.920
and synthesize it?

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.180
DAN CARLIN: It's
an old joke, but it

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:27.770
concerns with the
difference between

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:29.660
modern and ancient history.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.950
And someone once said--

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.150
it may have been
one of my teachers--

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:33.774
had said something
about that if you're

00:50:33.774 --> 00:50:35.870
a historian of
the ancient world,

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:40.130
your job is to find
needles in haystacks,

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:41.930
but there's almost no haystacks.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.510
Whereas your job as
a modern historian

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.550
is, there are
haystacks everywhere,

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:48.590
which haystack do you pick?

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.240
I ran into the same
problem in news.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.150
Because I was in LA, and
when you open up the news

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.780
file in Los Angeles on what to
cover that day, it's that big.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:00.110
And your job is to go,
no, no, no, no, no,

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:01.850
and what makes the final cut.

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:04.149
So then I get a job
in Western Oregon.

00:51:04.149 --> 00:51:06.440
And I show up, and I look at
the file the next, morning

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.300
and there's one
piece of paper in it.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.890
And the entire job is different.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:12.080
Your job is to go find
news stories, as opposed

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:12.830
to weeding down.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:14.690
So the historian's job
is the same problem.

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:17.060
Where if you talk about a
historian 100 years from now,

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.350
think of all the
podcasts that they're

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:19.600
going to have to weed through.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.851
The blog posts, and-- so it's
not a needle in a haystack job

00:51:23.851 --> 00:51:24.350
anymore.

00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:26.870
It's oh my god, a field
full of haystacks, which one

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.930
do you think the needle's in?

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:31.970
And the process of selection
as a historian is often--

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:33.239
not to speak for them--

00:51:33.239 --> 00:51:35.530
but is often concerned with
what they're talking about.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.090
So let's say you're doing the
history of the New York Yankees

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:39.110
baseball team.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:41.510
OK, there's a
self-selection right there,

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.040
that helps you
winnow things down.

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.540
Right?

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:46.225
So you found three haystacks,
and those are your haystacks.

00:51:46.225 --> 00:51:48.140
And you start working
within that realm.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.240
The problem is, is if
somebody's writing a history

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.589
book on baseball, OK, there's
going to be crossover.

00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:55.130
But there also might
be disagreement.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.620
The guy writing specifically
about the New York Yankees

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:02.439
may come up with ideas,
concepts, views, or conclusions

00:52:02.439 --> 00:52:03.980
that are different
from a guy looking

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.470
at it on a more macro level,
with baseball history,

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.021
in general.

00:52:08.021 --> 00:52:10.520
In my mind-- and I think this
is how historians would do it.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.853
I'm not going to speak for them.

00:52:11.853 --> 00:52:15.350
But, I mean, I think the collage
of all the different historians

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:17.720
together-- this
mosaic, that if you

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.730
add them all together--
helps give you

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:22.200
a more 360 view of things.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.197
So that in the same
way today, I think

00:52:24.197 --> 00:52:26.030
if you're an intelligent
well-rounded person

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:27.680
you're reading
multiple news sources.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.350
Hopefully from multiple angles,
and if you're really good,

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.450
from multiple countries.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:35.600
Take that, and do the
same thing with history.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.320
Where you're saying, OK,
here's a Roman view of somebody

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.410
who liked Julius Caesar
versus, Suetonius,

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.070
who's a gossip
columnist who writes

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:44.390
all the bad stuff about him.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:45.973
And you throw all
this stuff together,

00:52:45.973 --> 00:52:48.030
and you realize, OK, a
lot of this may be false.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:50.720
But when I look at the
mosaic and stand back

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.390
from it, what does it convey?

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.580
And so I think that's
a good way to describe,

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.146
like when we do the
audio footnotes,

00:52:57.146 --> 00:52:58.520
but we'll give
you two historians

00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.650
who disagree about something.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.550
And the tendency is to go,
well what did I just learn?

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:02.060
Right?

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:02.780
One said it was black.

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.620
The other said it was white.

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:05.030
Did I really learn anything?

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.360
But being able to understand
that two intelligent people

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.860
who've looked at
the source material

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.980
came to different
conclusions is, in of itself,

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.796
a useful piece of
information for you today.

00:53:15.796 --> 00:53:16.670
Does that make sense?

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:17.180
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.763
DAN CARLIN: I mean, if 500 years
from now, the historians have

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:24.140
to try to figure out
21st century US politics,

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:29.600
and all they have to go on is an
MSNBC feed and a Fox News feed,

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.180
you're going to have to blend
those somehow, and come up

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.540
with a mosaic.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.200
And the funny part about
it is, 500 years from now,

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.099
you can still have as
divided a viewpoint over what

00:53:39.099 --> 00:53:40.390
that history is, as you do now.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.640
Right?

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.348
The ones who say, well
that MSNBC version

00:53:42.348 --> 00:53:43.886
is much more close to the truth.

00:53:43.886 --> 00:53:45.260
And I think maybe
that's the part

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:47.570
that people listening to the
podcast found most interesting,

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:48.720
was that there isn't just--

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.970
I mean, that history's
not like math.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:50.420
Right?

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:51.290
Two plus two equals four.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.373
The Roman Empire did this.

00:53:52.373 --> 00:53:55.040
And it isn't like that, because
it's composed of human beings,

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.030
and we're variable.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.530
Right?

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.000
And open to interpretation.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.140
Hard to quantify.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.130
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:02.690
All right, thank you so much.

00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:04.630
Thanks for all the questions.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:06.130
Thank you for your
detailed answers.

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:07.349
DAN CARLIN: That's it?

00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:09.140
SPEAKER: So I just want

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:13.640
