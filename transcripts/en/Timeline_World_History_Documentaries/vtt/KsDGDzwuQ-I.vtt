00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.020
In 1860, a french naturalist was cutting his way through the cambodian jungle in search of exotic insects.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:31.669
Henry Mouhot suddenly came across the last thing he was expecting: a massive complex of stone temples.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.080
Muhot had stumbled across one of the world's most astonishing and enduring architectural feats:

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.380
the nine hundred year old remains of

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.080
Angkor Wat.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.640
But who built these vast sophisticated temples?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.340
Why construct them deep in the jungle only to abandon them?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.360
At first there were no answers,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.630
then an amazing eyewitness account from the 13th century emerged in China.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.059
The author describes the Great temple of Angkor.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.050
A fantastic citadel and its resourceful inhabitants.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.120
How could this be true?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.120
The evidence was scant.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.529
Now science is providing unexpected proof.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.350
Archeologists are applying the latest techniques to reveal the mysteries of Angkor

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.319
and radar images from space revealed that Angkor was much bigger than originally imagined.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.559
A vast city the size of London.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:56.649
Scientists now know that Angkor wat was just a small part of one of the largest and most sophisticated cities in the world

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.800
Angkor wat one of the world's true enigmas; its size and purpose baffling.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.979
Larger than any cathedral it is truly one of the greatest structures ever built.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.249
Its towers shaped like lotus flowers were raised a hundred years before the cathedral of Chartres in France.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.889
The buildings were laid out on a vast scale, stone shrines ascending one upon the other as if reaching for the heavens.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.290
Endless corridors are carved with the longest reliefs in the world.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.150
The precise construction would be hard to match even with lasers used by Modern surveyors

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.790
Archaeologist Charles Higham has studied all aspects of Angkor and its inhabitants the khmer.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.269
Professor Higham has been crucial to understanding the extraordinary history of this ancient culture.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.159
We are standing in the middle of the world's largest religious monument. It's absolutely gigantic it stretches on and on.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.129
Angkor Wat was the temple mausoleum of one of Angkor's greatest Kings: King surya Varman the second, the sun King and

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.270
When he died his ashes would have been placed under the heart of the central register behind me

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.899
Angkor wat meaning holy Temple is symbolic in every way.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.680
Its vast square moat represents the oceans around Mount meru legendary home of the hindu gods

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.929
when Henri Mouhat stumbled across encore in 1860 he wrote

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.580
one of these temples

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.679
Arrival to that of solomon and directed by some ancient, Michelangelo might take an honourable place beside our most beautiful buildings

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.070
It is grander than anything left to us by Greece or Rome

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.109
The Frenchman suspected that the temples belong to a huge and sophisticated civilization, but he had no evidence.

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.489
Angkor wat lies in the Northwest floodplains of Cambodia just above the great Lake.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.109
When Mouhot discovered it in 1860 only a handful of buddhist monks and local Villagers lived around the ancient site

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.019
None of them knew how angkor wat had evolved or who had built it.

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.919
Legend had it that the great temple had built itself, some said that it had always been.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.410
In Europe, the publication of Mouhot journal created a sensation

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.340
Soon a stream of explorers photographers and archaeologists traveled east

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.639
keen to uncover the mysteries of this vanished world

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.029
But our Amuro's part in this puzzle came to a sudden end

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.169
Bitten by a poisonous insect he died in the jungle the year after discovering the incredible site

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.279
As early explorers began to strip away the jungle they discovered even more temples

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.799
the Walls of the vast monuments were covered in intricate carvings

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:10.158
These reliefs Illustrate legends of an ancient culture and its religion

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.349
The Sandstone sections were carved in place. They would have taken the artists decades to complete

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.309
Inscriptions here are written not only in an ancient Cambodian language

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:30.949
But also mysteriously in Sanskrit the priestly language of the hindus

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:40.248
One of the great breakthroughs has been the translation of the entire corpus of angkorian inscriptions by a french scholar

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:43.759
George sur Des in seven thick volumes and

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:51.829
So bit by bit the actual internal history of angkor has been unraveled, and that's been absolutely critical

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:05.409
To the codebreakers they disclose that the sixth centuries ankle had been the capital of the khmer the indigenous people of cambodia

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:14.769
Between the 9th and 15th centuries ad a total of 38 Kings ruled their empire from angkor

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.789
Its Borders reached from Southern Vietnam to Laos and from the mekong river to Eastern Berlin

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.880
But whose grand Vision was this great city, and why was it built in the middle of the jungle?

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.630
the deciphering continued

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.179
then an astonishing discovery was made a

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.170
Junior Chinese official on a diplomatic mission visited angkor in the summer of 1296 Ad

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.579
During his year-long visit show doug juan kept a journal

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.679
his diary tells of a major Civilization a

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:05.689
Capital much bigger and more developed than the archaeologists dared imaginable

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:09.829
But was show Doug ones account fact or myth

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.919
archeologists searched for proof of the existence of the City Joe described

00:08:19.619 --> 00:08:21.210
as

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:26.120
They pieced together this gigantic puzzle the full story began to Emerge

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:37.779
For thousands of years the indigenous people of cambodia the khmer had cut rice fields from the jungle

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.249
These farmers were a largely self-contained and peaceful race

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:49.149
But from the first century ad small feuding kingdoms developed around the country

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.800
In the eighth century a great leader emerged

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:02.830
to find a site for a brand new sacred capital the abandoned his home city in the Eastern part of Cambodia and

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.599
ordered all his subjects to cross the mekong river in a great March West

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:21.170
Having conquered his rivals. He chose the lush land between the sacred : hills and great lake for his new citadel

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:31.179
In 802 ad he had himself crowned Jaya Baumann the Supreme World Emperor King of Kings

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.629
Jiya Varma's Charisma one the people over

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.209
He came not only to rule by divine consent, but to be worshipped as a God himself

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.389
At a stroke this great and charismatic leader changed the course of Cambodian history

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:59.179
Over the next 500 years Jaya varmints descendants living God's succeeded him to reign in angkor

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.509
Each King had his own monument built to his glory destined to become his mausoleum

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.849
Since the second century ad the Kumar's had practiced hinduism

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:17.480
Each of the Royal Temples is modeled on the five peaks of Mount meru the home of the Indian gods

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:25.609
For their builders the shrines were a celebration of religion art science and power

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.119
throughout the first half of the 20th century

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.120
Cambodia was part of France's Colonial Empire

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.720
It was they who led the way in piecing angkor together

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:45.470
When they arrived and took colonial control of this part of the world the the place was an absolute shambles

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.959
I mean there were stones. Just like I found everywhere

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:55.309
There's nothing like what you see today, and so they dedicated vast amount of energy and effort into the reconstruction of the temples in

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.960
The 1960s the eminent archaeologist been Bernard Phil Croley made this comparison of angkor

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:11.660
Imagine that within the city limits of Paris you found thrown together Versailles the place de La Concorde and the Louvre.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.790
Surrounding these the cathedrals of Notre-Dame, Chartres, and Rennes

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.440
flanked by all the churches built in Paris before the 19th century

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:34.339
Since Henri Mouhot had first discovered Angkor in 1860 much had been learned about its history

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.149
But almost nothing was known about the culture

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.909
responsible for these incredible monuments.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:03.469
The largest religious monument in the world the city of the gods Angkor Wat in the heart of Cambodia

00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:10.538
But is this astonishing temple only the visible tip of a greater unseen mystery?

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.809
700 Years ago a junior Chinese official visited angkor on a diplomatic mission

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:28.559
During his 11 months stay with a cambodian family. He recorded many aspects of life in angkor

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.100
the Jo Dagwons account contains several flights of Fancy

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:44.429
For instance he describes the great temple of angkor wat as having been built in a single day by a legendary Chinese architect

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.819
He was also Openly judgemental referring to his hosts as barbarians

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.569
Archeologists have taken his writings with a pinch of salt

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:02.400
You've always got to think of it as being seen to the eyes of an educated Chinese for whom anyone Beyond the empire

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.609
was by definition of Barbarians and

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.130
in reading what he has to say one has to be certainly on occasion judicious in

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.249
Realizing the prejudices were there

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:24.659
For a hundred years french archeologists were too busy restoring the temples to pay the journal much attention. So it was largely ignored

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:37.629
Then in the 1970s the murderous regime of POl pot's stopped all work at angkor

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:48.550
His Army of Communist revolutionaries the khmer rouge laid thousands of landmines around the site rendering it off-limits for years

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:00.929
Now at last ability has returned to Cambodia and work on the temples has resumed

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.889
Today angkor has world heritage site protection with a dozen countries funding archaeological research

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:22.120
with much of the major restoration work complete the focus has shifted away from the temples at the center and

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:24.578
on to the outlying pieces of the puzzle

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:33.370
Just north of angkor wat an eight-mile wall encloses the remains of several magnificent stone temples

00:14:34.939 --> 00:14:41.139
Explorer Henri Mouhot suspected in 1860 that this was once the khmers great capital of angkor thom

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:43.899
the Holy City

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:51.609
the Perfectly square wall like angkor wat is surrounded by a moat and

00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:54.579
covers an area the size of Manhattan Island

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.809
At its center is the Bayon temple

00:15:00.439 --> 00:15:07.479
In his journal from 1296 show Doug wan describes a busy city teeming with life

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.199
Archeologists are now looking for evidence the district the great Metropolis. He was describing

00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:19.179
But any evidence has all but vanished and the Dense forests

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:30.789
In the last two years archaeologist Jacques Gouchier has started to excavate the interior of the walled City

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.789
Farrakhan elicited to the shore applauded when I started this study

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:44.198
We knew almost nothing because everything was covered in Forest energy stocks

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.730
except

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:51.920
The only surviving features were the stone temples and the foundation of the Royal palace

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:58.200
But we knew nothing of the rest of the 900 hectares within the city wall and clearly others hid firm

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.840
For a while it seemed that gaucher was fighting a losing battle

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.089
But his persistence is at last producing results

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.620
There's our care unit through the stay mad geeks

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.670
after two years of very difficult research Conrad formats

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.379
We that last began to build an impression of this city throughout the city leaders?

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:26.809
Gaucher is plotting thousands of coordinates onto an ever more detailed map of angkor thom

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:35.989
He is now able to trace an intricate grid system of canals and roads together with the sites of thousands of wooden houses

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:44.829
Back in 1860 when Henri Mouhot discovered angkor wat he had suspected that it was just part of a complex City

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.919
road ugh Juan's Thirteenth Century Journal alludes to a political and religious citadel

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:59.890
Now at last archaeologists have enough evidence to bring to life this extraordinary city as it looked 700 years ago

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.580
Anchor was a capital far bigger and far in advance of any European city of the time

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.849
Jacque go shares findings confirm the accuracy of Ja Dagwons account

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:29.059
What he describes is fact not fantasy

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:37.549
These are the monuments which have cost merchants from overseas to speak so often of Cambodia the rich and noble

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:46.039
If you are looking for gold lions gold Buddha's bronze elephants and Bronze horses. This is where you'll find them

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:54.299
from the inscriptions

00:17:54.309 --> 00:18:02.309
Archeologists know that angkor thom the holy City was built nearly a century before Joe arrived by the khmers greatest monarch

00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:09.599
Giovanna in the Seventh Ruled over Cambodia between 1181 and 1219

00:18:11.649 --> 00:18:17.008
Known as the great builder king he expanded the empire further than any other khmer ruler

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.249
Within the City Walls the King Built a palace befitting his mighty empire

00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:28.138
the Royal Palace stands to the North of the Golden Tower

00:18:29.049 --> 00:18:33.898
Lintels and Columns all decorated with carved and painted Buddhas are immense

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:40.109
The roofs - I impressive long colonnades and open corridors stretch away

00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:42.809
interlaced in harmonious relation

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.329
Jaco Shares excavations at the Royal Palace confirm shows account

00:18:52.539 --> 00:18:54.539
That within City the sukyohama

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:56.649
did they

00:18:56.649 --> 00:19:00.839
We found evidence out of this palace was a large area talking

00:19:01.269 --> 00:19:07.229
With interconnecting quarters and building a separate band that we found holes 80 centimeters in diameter

00:19:08.529 --> 00:19:13.979
Four huge supporting Columns, it would have been a very impressive sight like my snout

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:23.629
As evidence materializes about the royal palace the role of the Kumar's rulers these earthly gods becomes clearer

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:57.089
During his day Joe Dagwon had several audiences with the Ruling King

00:19:57.669 --> 00:20:01.018
Every time I was admitted to the palace for an audience with the king

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:08.369
He came forward with his chief wife and took his place in the embrasure of the Golden window in the main audience hall

00:20:09.429 --> 00:20:13.018
Joe himself came from a culture with the Ruler elevated to godhood

00:20:13.899 --> 00:20:16.619
the Chinese approved of the Kumar's devotion

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.189
These people know, what is Stewar King?

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.310
The king talked to social pyramid that stretched down to the lowest peasant

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.919
The Monarch Spoken see showed itself in a legend showed up one length out

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:39.299
Of the palace rises a golden tower to the top of which the ruler are sent nightly to sleep

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.410
It is common believed that in the tower dwells a genie

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.480
Formed like a serpent with nine heads. Which is lord of the entire kingdom

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:54.600
Every night the genie appears in the shape of a woman with whom the sovereign couples

00:20:55.270 --> 00:21:01.410
Should the genie fail to appear for a single night it is a sign that the kings death is at hand

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.679
If the king should fail to keep his tryst

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.710
Disaster is sure to follow

00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:13.539
Well, I'm not sure about that

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:16.898
He would have been fine king had he been able to do that at for any length of time

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:19.569
but I but what we do know is that it was a

00:21:20.299 --> 00:21:24.038
practice of the aristocrats to send and the regional

00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:29.978
Landed Gentry as it were to send up a woman from their family to be a member of the Kings entourage

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:31.729
to become a concubine

00:21:31.729 --> 00:21:33.379
Which would in a sense, bind?

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:40.238
The provinces to the center in a very physical manner and they wouldn't be surprising if indeed the king did have a very substantial

00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:42.909
harem from which to choose

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:49.479
Show doug juan notes that the King had five wives and a harem of 3,000 women

00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:59.079
The King was rarely seen outside the palace, but Joe describes one such occasion the New Year festival

00:22:00.229 --> 00:22:07.809
At night comes on the Kings besought to take part in the spectacle the rockets are fired and the crackers touched off

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:11.289
The Rockets can be seen from 13 kilometers away

00:22:11.869 --> 00:22:15.969
the firecrackers largest swivel guns Shakes the whole City

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:32.690
Below the King was an army of bureaucrats graded by rank as Joe describes

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.580
In this country there is a hierarchy of ministers generals

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.220
astronomers and other functionaries

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.369
Beneath these come all sorts of small employees

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.280
Differing only in name from our own

00:22:47.649 --> 00:22:54.449
These would all have been descendants of families honored by the original Jaya varmint who had founded an corps 500 years earlier

00:22:57.399 --> 00:23:01.649
What is not clear from Joe's writings is how many people lived in uncle?

00:23:03.159 --> 00:23:07.049
Sanskrit inscriptions in Temples such as tarp rom offer valuable clues

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.739
We know that the temple housed at least 12,000 people including a number of great priests?

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:21.240
I think over 650 dancers and various other officiants to maintain the the temple and to do the necessary

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Temple duties

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:32.099
If 12,000 people served a single temple, what was the overall population?

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:41.329
Jago says new research is not yet complete, but it does support an educated guess to give a number

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.349
this City could have been between

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.850
80,000 90,000 and

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.230
150,000 people in

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.829
The same period The population of London totaled no more than 30,000

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:08.959
So discoveries are confirming that what only was suspected and show doug juan alleges is correct

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.660
Uncle Tom was indeed a large well-structured city with a huge population

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:22.130
Now suspicions are aroused that the jungle conceals and called together bigger surprise

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.160
And the trouble is so vast that it's full extent can only be detected from space

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.059
The search for the hidden Empire of angkor was about to take an unexpected turn

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.600
In 1994 archaeologists persuaded, Nasa to undertake a unique task

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.850
The space Agency had developed specialist radar to penetrate vegetation

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:19.959
Their challenge was to probe the area of angkor in Cambodia as the space shuttle endeavor passed over Southeast, Asia

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:27.029
the resulting images cover an area a hundred kilometers long and ten kilometers wide

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:37.159
For the first time scientists have an accurate impression of the wider City's infrastructure a thousand years ago

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:44.599
Covering an area the size of London this rural Metropolis was immense

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:51.789
For archaeologist, Elizabeth Moore this is a major breakthrough

00:25:55.009 --> 00:25:57.339
I'm sure they had a skill to do it it is revolutionizing

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:04.629
Understanding of the size of the kingdom cause water up at first people said well you won't find anything new at angkor

00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:06.379
But what we have?

00:26:06.379 --> 00:26:13.479
What the radar has shown us is just how all the regions contributed to what then became the central zone of angkor?

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.169
the radar pictures also reveal previously unknown temples all over the angkorian basin as

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.629
Well as an intricate network of Roads and Canals all leading to the Walled City

00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:33.819
Evident for the first time is the grid plan of this once great metropolis

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:38.740
When you start looking at the radar imagery and you see that

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:47.319
Sophistication with which they were able to control and all through their terrain I've never seen the culture like it elsewhere in Southeast Asia in

00:26:47.509 --> 00:26:51.399
Terms of manipulating the landscape of using it to their benefit

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.740
Now the challenge for archaeologists was to work out at ground level what had been photographed from space

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:10.449
Archaeologist Christoph Paki is using the images as a route map to trace the layout of ancient angkor

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.639
The Newly discovered temples were at the center of Their own communities

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:28.170
Just like village churches in Europe. They indicate the size of each settlement showing the true extent of the metropolis

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.620
today 40a and his cambodian assistants in Gender

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.200
Attempt to locate a number of previously unrecorded ruins outside the walled city of angkor thom

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.300
wow together

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.070
It's a no it's a quite nice one

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:14.410
Right seems to be a garuda and very clearly carried out with his wings

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.330
exactly legal and

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.400
place interesting unfotunately has been badly damaged but

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.950
but it's nice and

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.950
compared to the side it could be a

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.300
late 9th century

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.040
maybe maybe

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.040
first part of the 10

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.369
Temples like this would have been the centres of Villages housing between one and three hundred people

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:47.499
Thought he and his colleagues have established that the number of temple sites like this in the region runs into thousands

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.380
suggesting a massive population

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.649
There was a direct relationship between these Villages and the royal capital

00:28:57.559 --> 00:29:01.989
An ancient inscription persuades archaeologists like Charles Higham of the link

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:09.650
We know that at least an eighty thousand or so people from three thousand Villages were assigned to

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:15.619
Supply all the goods that we needed annually to maintain us in a good condition

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:22.849
vast amounts of produce and thousands of people would have been transported from the Villages a

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.150
Complex Network of Roads leading to the Center is evident from the NaSa pictures

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.579
the inscriptions point to the Great Builder King Jayavarman

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:41.569
Jive Armand the seventh was a fantastic builder across his whole kingdom he had roads constructed

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:46.700
he was a great man for infrastructure one reason being that he wanted pilgrims to go and visit his places and

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.300
So he had rest houses built at one day's journey apart

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:56.329
he moved and shaped more stone than every other gang Korean king combined and

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:01.489
And he must go down in world history as one of the great builders of all time

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.330
if

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:11.000
all the outlying temples were connected in one giant conurbation then angkor can be acknowledged as a rural metropolis as

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.380
big as Modern-day London

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.989
At its heart a walled Royal enclaved the size of Westminster

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:31.050
There are hundreds with a thousand of that kind of smaller sanctuaries sprayed or around the IRa

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.380
of hong Kong with the larger Hong Kong and

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:38.370
It's not sure obviously when there was feed age

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.160
Everyone almost everywhere

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:47.069
Early research suggests that this metropolis could have had a population of a million people

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:59.579
This would make angkor at its peak between the 11th and 13th centuries one of the largest cities in the world

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:12.579
The indigenous cambodians the khmer were powerful and successful

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.979
They managed to build one of the most extraordinary cities in history in one of the world's most hostile climate

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:31.939
But how was such a large population able to survive and prosper in the heart of an email spit or jungle?

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.199
The answer lies in the commands ability to harness their most precious asset

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:59.649
Cambodia has 8 months without rain when rivers become a muddy trickle then for a few months the Monsoon brings floods

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:09.039
For this reason the anko is build close to the great lake which swells to four times its size in the rainy season

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:18.309
It not only provided precious water throughout the year, but also an inexhaustible supply of fish

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.130
Boudreau Dagwon records

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.189
Of all the fish the black carp is the most abundant

00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:31.479
Next in number detent and freshwater congas the prawns of char and weigh as much as half a kilo Apiece

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:34.239
Crocodiles their ice large as boats

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:41.470
Apart from fish the Staple diets like most of Asia was rice

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.569
Paddy Fields need a plentiful supply of water to ensure a healthy crop

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:56.020
When the founding Ruler Jaya Varman arrived at angkor there were already peasant Farmers cultivating ancient Rice fields

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:06.159
But from the 9th to the 13th centuries successive. God kings ordered thousands more acres of jungle to be cleared for rice production

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.150
Water had to be cleverly harnessed to irrigate the New Fields

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.089
If the system failed the very survival of the kingdom would be at stake

00:33:23.309 --> 00:33:26.479
Well maintained canals were also crucial to uncle

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:37.559
Every day tons of heavy stones for the construction of temples will be transported by canal from the Coulomb field

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:50.160
Planning expert Jaga believes the success of angkor is due to the elaborate system of interconnecting waterways

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.799
You are tanks of ponds which are dead to

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.469
keep also this water and you have

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:03.780
some canonization this royal palace is full of small Canalization the

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:11.610
City is full of channels and the outside theatre is also full of big channels this systems

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:17.579
Which are different level of scale they must have been connected to each other?

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.129
It was the khmers ability to harness water that made them unique

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:31.839
While the dutch were experimenting with their first canals the khmer were already past masters

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:41.019
The most recent excavation by jacques osha reveals the complexity of khmer water management within the Royal city

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:50.560
his surveys have uncovered two huge reservoirs each measuring 300 metres long and 20 metres wide a

00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:52.869
Major Road intersected them

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.530
Water needed to flow around the city

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:03.669
What go shire wanted to know was how the road could be used while water still flowed from one reservoir to the other?

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.460
So he began to dig

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.889
the excavation unearthed the stone dike where the road and reservoirs met

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.620
It also shows that the reservoirs were built on slightly different levels

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:27.489
Beneath the surface of the Road narrow channels in the dike allow water to filter from the upper reservoir into the lower

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.199
But the arrangement may have been too finely balanced

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.070
Playing at such a scale with the management of water

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:52.020
With such small differences of level. I think the system was quite fragile, and if there were any

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.140
variability in the environment

00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:01.170
Or in the maintenance of the city for social problems of political ones

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.559
I think the precision I mean the ultra

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:09.840
Sophistication can can have been a weakness in the system in a way

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:19.110
This complex system provided water throughout the royal city for drinking cooking and even bathing

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:29.580
Cambodia is an excessively hot country and it is impossible to get through the day without fading several times

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.850
There are no valve houses no basins

00:36:33.369 --> 00:36:40.859
However every family has a pond or several families of one in common men and women go naked into this pond

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:50.010
the construction of extensive water systems and great stone temples in the jungle Demanded colossal manpower

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.480
Why would the command be prepared to devote so much of their year toiling in the King's name?

00:36:59.299 --> 00:37:02.859
Why was it that the peasantry out there in the field?

00:37:03.559 --> 00:37:05.559
Contributed so much labour

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:12.939
Willingly it seems to the maintenance of the center and the answer may well be that they really believed that the king

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:18.399
Was a god and they were working in the service of the deity and this kept them going oh

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:25.420
I think without a doubt I fully agree with you right you couldn't have built city of angkor without that kind of firm belief

00:37:31.239 --> 00:37:35.939
But although the khmer people dedicated enormous effort into constructing their great city

00:37:36.369 --> 00:37:39.268
It was the addition of slave labor that made it possible

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.970
Show describes these unfortunates

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.599
Wild men from the hills can be bought to serve as slaves

00:37:46.329 --> 00:37:53.068
families of wealth may own more than 100 those of lesser means content themselves with ten or twenty

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.440
Only the very poor have none

00:37:55.660 --> 00:38:01.559
we know - again from the inscriptions that some of them had a very raw deal there was one who tried to escape from the

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:06.689
land to which he was in which he was born and was and was assigned and they found him then they brought him back and

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.819
They gouged his eyes out and cut off his ears

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.609
Punishment was severe for all subjects of angkor noted the Chinese diplomat

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:19.169
In very serious cases a digits dug outside the city

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:25.139
The Criminal is dropped into it Earth and stones are heaped on top until he is buried alive

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:34.819
Lesser Crimes are dealt with by cutting off feet or hands or by amputating the nose

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.619
The economy of angkor was based on international trade

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:53.080
The Kumar's produced food for their swelling population, but there was a surplus for trade with neighboring States

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:59.229
They won't find cloth cast huge bronze statues and exported ivory

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.499
Kingfisher feathers Beans Wax and sent abroad

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.910
their main Trading partner was China

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.670
the reliefs of the Bayan

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:16.539
reveal a Chinese trade junk coming across the waters of the great lake just south of angkor and we know that there was indeed a

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.920
great deal of trade going on because of the more recent archaeological research that has been

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:26.860
Excavating in the royal palace and there they've been unearthing a considerable quantity of Chinese ceramics

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:42.840
Jaguars Delegation were not the only chinese in angkor in fact Chinese settlers had been there for years

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:51.989
The Chinese always take a wife here as soon as they arrive deriving additional benefit from the woman's business skills in

00:39:53.980 --> 00:40:00.480
Cambodia it is the women who take charge of trade. There are no shops in which the merchants live instead

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.240
They display their goods on matting spread on the ground

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.489
women held positions of power and Authority

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.850
They owned property engaged in trade and even served as bodyguards to the King

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:22.870
But the Chinese interest in cambodian women was not driven Solely by trade

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.210
Everyone with whom I talked said that the cambodian women are highly sexed

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:34.719
One or two days after giving birth to a child they are ready for intercourse if the husband is not

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.150
Responsive he will be discarded

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.039
By the end of the 13th century angkor was at its peak

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:53.740
a succession of God Kings had built this beautiful and astonishing City a

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:59.440
Sophisticated water system made the City work Fed its people and created wealth

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:04.600
But then at its very peak cracks in the system began to appear

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.740
Cracks that would lead to the city being abandoned to the jungle

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:28.359
It took nearly 500 years for angkor to grow - the vast city that the Chinese diplomat show dog juan described in 1296

00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:47.288
Yet, just a century later the City lay deserted given up to the jungle

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:55.660
But why throughout history there are a few examples of cities being totally abandoned

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:07.660
One key Factor is known throughout and cause history the khmer had waged war with their neighbors

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:29.569
In the early years of angkor the Vietnamese chams were the khmer sworn enemies

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.469
Most of the Temple Walls around the Capitol depict Epic battles against the chance

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:55.319
But by the time of jaw dog wonka with the main threat came from the emerging Thai kingdom of siam as it expanded into Cambodia

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:08.289
Here comes recently during the war with Siam whole Villages have been laid waste

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:14.259
In the diplomats eyes the khmer army was ill-prepared for war

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:21.850
Soldiers move about unclothed and their foot in the right hand is carried a lance in the left a shield

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.860
They have no bows no missiles. No breastplate and no helmets

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.960
Generally speaking these people have neither disciplined nor strategy

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:46.039
inscriptions show that in 1431 the thais sacked angkor

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.800
they looted everything possible to

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.660
enslave them much of the population including the Kings entire hiring and

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.180
Carried them off to Thailand

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:16.559
Abandoned the city of angkor was slowly reabsorbed into the jungle from which it had emerged five centuries before

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.349
re Moreau wrote in 1861

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:30.809
Must ask what has become of this powerful race so civilized and enlightened to create these gigantic works

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:40.079
The conventional explanation is that the empire's rulers lost their grip on power and the tithe simply scared them off?

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.220
but the mystery of angkor takes another twist

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:50.760
Today archaeologists believe that there were other factors at work

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.869
Charles Higham points to the Great Builder King Jayavarman the seventh

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:03.780
perhaps because of the excesses of Giovanna and the seventh who who clearly was a

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:08.250
builder with a Frenzy of activity and

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:15.480
He may well, it said that I might be true that he exhausted the resources of the state and it went into a decline

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:22.109
Jar Varman the Seventh was the first buddhist king after several hundred years of Hindu worship

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:29.220
This more compassionate religion may have given the khmer calls to reflect on the excessive their kings

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.300
I

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:38.560
Wonder whether in fact the the slow decline that may well have set in was the result of a lack of

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:47.139
Belief out in the field there that the king was in fact a deity and that this vital link between the two began to fray

00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:01.339
Did you hack go share theorizes that while the khmers success can be attributed to the harnessing of water?

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.919
It could also have led to that undoing

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:14.359
Such was the fine balance of nature that if irrigation and the storage of water were not kept up they could easily fall into disrepair

00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:22.129
List Emerson Mirada Jeff Hegelian what heavier the water system was very fragile because it was so sophisticated

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:30.739
So and the problem is if it's not well maintained it it could easily become blots by Seda members of their following in City, Modesto

00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:37.369
The Kings who came after John baum in the seventh were less interested in Grand building plans

00:46:38.339 --> 00:46:41.718
It's also possible. They stopped maintaining the intricate water system

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:45.170
Deforestation was also a likely contributor

00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:02.979
So much jungle had been cut back for rice growing that undoubtedly the rivers and canals would have silted up

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.550
Which in turn would have led to an ecological disaster for the command?

00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:17.649
Kristof Pottier believes the clues are objects the balinese 30 of s with the water

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.100
at the end of all cords

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.890
pieces of the Forest should have been very very rare very

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:32.989
Different station is an issue is not a new program. It's an old one

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:43.190
It is most likely that it was a combination of these factors that led the khmer to Abandon their once great city

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:53.540
What remained of the khmer court re-established itself on the banks of the mekong near Cambodia's present-day capital of Phnom penh?

00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:00.109
We're not talking about the actual collapse and total demise of a civilization

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:07.819
What happened was that they moved sensibly to the east down to the mekong river and away from the Thais?

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:17.990
Now completely buddhist renouncing material wealth the khmer would never again embrace the lofty heights. They had in ankle

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:27.459
For 400 years and call a derelict and forgotten

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.449
until it's Rediscovery by or removal in 1860

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.739
Today angkor is recognized as a wonder of the world in

00:48:40.099 --> 00:48:42.099
Cambodia's new Era of stability

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.669
archeologists from around the world continue to make fresh discoveries

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.320
at last a world lost to the jungle is Reimagine a

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:03.479
Major Metropolis that for over half a millennium dominated a thriving empire

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.290
One of the greatest cities the world has ever known
