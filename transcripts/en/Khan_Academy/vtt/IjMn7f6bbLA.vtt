00:00:00.432 --> 00:00:02.254
- [Instructor] Let's do
some example questions

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:04.188
dealing with ratios.

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:07.442
So we're told, "The table shows
the number of people waiting

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:10.770
"in line for different
rides at an amusement park."

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.363
So 15 people are waiting in
line for the roller coaster,

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:15.235
four people for the slingshot,

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:17.773
12 people waiting in line
for the bumper cards,

00:00:17.773 --> 00:00:20.534
and 11 people in line for the round-up.

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:24.584
"What is the ratio of
people waiting in line

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:26.001
"for the round-up

00:00:27.128 --> 00:00:31.954
"to the people waiting in
line for the slingshot?"

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:35.275
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:38.143
So we wanna know the ratio
of the people waiting in line

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:42.294
for the round-up, this is
the round-up right over here,

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:46.461
to the number of people waiting
in line for the slingshot.

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:52.644
So, there's 11 people waiting
in line for the round-up,

00:00:52.644 --> 00:00:56.843
and there are four people waiting
in line for the slingshot,

00:00:56.843 --> 00:00:59.524
so the ratio is 11 to four.

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.666
Or for every 11 people
in line for the round-up,

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:06.833
there are four people waiting
in line for the slingshot.

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:09.778
Let's do another example.

00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:13.323
"Katie loves to read!

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:17.335
"In the last few months, she
has read three graphic novels,

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:20.832
"two mysteries, four
science fiction novels,

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:23.075
"and 21 comic books.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:27.332
"What is the ratio of sci-fi
novels to comic books?"

00:01:27.332 --> 00:01:28.911
So once again, pause this video

00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:31.598
and try to work it out on your own.

00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:34.450
All right, so we wanted to know
the ratio of sci-fi novels,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.950
so she has four sci-fi novels,

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:41.970
the ratio of that to comic books.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.887
She has 21 comic books.

00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:49.277
So the ratio is for
every four sci-fi novels,

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:51.194
she has 21 comic books.

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:54.223
Do you want me to do
that in that other color?

00:01:54.223 --> 00:01:56.118
She has 21 comic books.

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:58.368
So the ratio is four to 21,

00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:02.616
the ratio of sci-fi novels to comic books.

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:06.867
Four sci-fi novels for
every 21 comic books.

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:08.363
Let's do one more example.

00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:10.196
This is strangely fun.

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:14.113
"What is the ratio of apples to bananas?"

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:16.906
Pause this video and try to figure it out.

00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:20.368
So let's see, there are
one, two, three apples.

00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:23.747
So for every three apples,
how many bananas are there?

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.710
Well, there's one, two,
three, four bananas.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.877
So the ratio of apples to,

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:35.937
the ratio of apples to
bananas is three apples

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:40.679
for every four bananas.

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:41.637
Order matters.

00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:44.087
If they said the ratio
of bananas to apples,

00:02:44.087 --> 00:02:45.640
then this would be four to three,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.106
but they say apples to
bananas, three to four.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:52.033
Three apples for every four bananas.
