We know that for parabolas that point upward, like the two that I have shown on

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.680
the graph here. The vertex is the minimum point on the curve, or in other words,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.403
the point with the lowest y value. So let's look back at our equation right here

00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:18.137
for the green problem. Y minus 5 equals the quantity x minus 7 squared. Let's

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:21.971
take a second to dissect the different parts of our equation. Looking only at

00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:25.903
the right side, we have the quantity x minus 7 squared. Now what's the smallest

00:00:25.903 --> 00:00:29.790
value that this quantity can have? Think about different things that you could

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.618
plug in for x, and what quantities for this whole expression each of those would

00:00:33.618 --> 00:00:34.064
yield.
