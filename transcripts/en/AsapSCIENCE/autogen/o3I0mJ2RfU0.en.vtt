00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.540
 Each time a cigarette is lit, it emits more than 7,000 kinds of chemicals 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.560
 It is not surprising that smoking is one of the leading causes of death worldwide 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.460
 But with an estimated 1.3 billion smokers, what happens when a smoker stops smoking? 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.200
 Within the first 20 minutes of quitting, the blood pressure and heart rate return to normal 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.040
 This is due to the fact that the nicotine found in cigarettes released adrenaline and norepinephrine, which raise the heart rate and narrow the blood vessels 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.740
 These symptoms cause coldness in the limbs but with time the hands and feet return to normal temperature 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.760
 Because of the body's intense desire for nicotine, dizziness, drowsiness, nervous feelings, and even difficulty sleeping occur 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.900
 Because nicotine also stimulates the secretion of extra dopamine unusually 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.440
 These are the physiological responses expected after quitting 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:56.760
 Eight hours after quitting smoking, carbon monoxide inhaled by oxygen allows normal flow in the bloodstream, and there is a competition between carbon monoxide and oxygen in the hemoglobin binding in the blood 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.800
 Which leads to stretching of the circulatory system 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.140
 Once purified, it gives more oxygen 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:12.040
 But for those who have long smoked, exposure to carbon monoxide causes red blood cell hypertrophy, making the blood thick and causing an increase in blood pressure. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.320
 Surprisingly, 24 hours after you quit smoking you will increase cough and that is how your body uses the lungs to purify all toxins 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.480
 At that moment, the incidence of cardiovascular disease is also lower 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.340
 All in just 24 hours. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.320
 After 48 hours, nicotine is removed and its components completely removed from the body 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.780
 The nerve endings begin to grow again. 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.220
 Tars, cigarettes and other chemicals reduce the number of taste buds that are heavy with few blood vessels 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.100
 So start now to regain its sensitivity, which makes the taste of food better than before 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.080
 But some hard-boiled smokers may no longer have the same taste as they did 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.380
 During the first 72 hours, the symptoms of nicotine disappearance begin to appear in the form of headaches, nausea, abdominal cramps, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.920
 These symptoms appear as a result of the use of substances that cause addiction, including caffeine 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.280
 But after that, the worst phase is over 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.620
 After one month, the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease decreases 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.660
 During the third to ninth month, the damaged cilia in the lung have been almost completely repaired, with their bristles removing impurities and residues in the lung 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.900
 This leads to the disappearance of some symptoms, such as coughing and respiratory weakness almost completely. 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:35.560
 After about one year, the risk of coronary heart disease as a direct result of arteriosclerosis caused by secretions of fatty substances or scar tissue caused by the deterioration of the arterial wall condition is reduced by about half. 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.840
 In the first ten years, the proportion of lung cancer in the first ten years becomes less than half of a person who has not quit smoking 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.020
 Within 15 years, the risk of having a heart attack is reduced to the average of people who never smoked. 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.860
 No doubt these results are not certain, and the rate of cigarettes you smoke per day 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.480
 Or in the year plays an important role in the body's ability to heal 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.880
 Unfortunately, there will be some permanent damage to the lungs, and there will be an increase in susceptibility to various lung diseases 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.860
 While quitting smoking may be difficult, the benefits far outweigh the disappearance of the initial symptoms 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.160
 Ultimately, the best way to prevent all this from happening is to avoid smoking from the ground up. 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.800
