00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:10.651
Ebola has been making headlines lately and
if the hype is to be believed, we’ve all

00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.059
already died.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.690
But if you’re just mostly dead and want
to know more, here are some common misconceptions

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.670
about Ebola clarified.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.600
Hello germaphobes out there, I’m Julian
with DNews and I have some info that might

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.010
help you sleep a little easier.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.410
First let’s douse the flames of panic and
clear up that Ebola has not become airborne.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.450
It’s adapted to survive and thrive in bodily
fluids, and some pretty radical and unlikely

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.580
things would have to happen for it to change
its mode of transmission.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.800
It would need to develop proteins that could
attach to the upper respiratory pathway and

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.970
it’s lipid membrane means it doesn’t survive
out of fluids.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.960
Because it’s already doing just fine with
its current mode of transmission it doesn’t

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.530
have the need to evolve.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.400
So if you find yourself around Ebola patients,
take comfort that at least the air you breathe

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.010
isn’t trying to kill you.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.000
These limitations help put another Ebola worry
to rest; industrialized nations are going

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.659
to be able to stop the virus’ spread much
more effectively than the West African nations

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.659
that have been hit.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.180
Knowing how the virus spreads means that we
also know how not to spread it.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.109
Avoiding bodily fluids of the infected goes
a long way as casual contact with them isn’t

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.119
enough to spread it.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.399
That also means a panic over a global pandemic
is ill-founded.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.380
Ebola kills pretty quickly and has up to a
90% mortality rate (though thanks to the efforts

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.799
of humanitarian workers, it’s closer to
50% in West Aftrica).

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.249
Those horrible attributes are what makes Ebola
so scary, but it also means that the disease

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.689
doesn’t become as widespread as it otherwise
could.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.530
That’s right, Ebola could be worse if it
actually killed more slowly.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.530
Hooray?

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.219
The last misconception I’d like to clear
up is that the outbreak is on the decline.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.929
While the industrialized world probably won’t
feel the effects of it, people in west Africa

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:52.929
are still suffering.

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.130
Dr. Estrella Lasry, a tropical medicine advisor
for Doctors Without Borders, has called the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.920
international response, “slow and weak,”
with China and Cuba the only governments that

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920
have sent aid.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.760
China has sent 115 workers with a mobile lab
and another 59 pledged, while Cuba’s 165

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.320
workers are due to arrive in Sierra Leone
by October.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.530
President Obama added the United states to
that list on September 16th with a plan that’s

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.680
projected to cost 763 Million dollars over
6 months.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.790
It’s still likely not enough to contain
the outbreak; more workers and beds are needed

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.630
to treat the sick, and earning public trust
so people can be educated about Ebola is crucial

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.630
to stopping its spread.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.630
Knowledge is always a useful tool to protect
yourself.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.630
If you’d like to learn more about how fast
viruses can spread, Ross Everett breaks it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.630
down for you on this episode of DNews.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.630
How are you getting involved to make the world
a better place?

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.060
Have you volunteered or gotten involved in
the fight against Ebola?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.140
If you don’t have a story to share, I urge
you to check out doctorswithoutborders.org

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.140
to donate.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.140
Let us know if you do in the comments, because
we want to know we’re getting people involved.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.439
Stay healthy and I’ll see you next time
on DNews.
