00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:02.108
- [Voiceover] So Becca and
I have been talking about

00:00:02.108 --> 00:00:06.144
Uncle Tom's Cabin which is
this book from the 1850s

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:10.490
that Abraham Lincoln actually
said started the Civil War.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.406
So how did this book start a war?

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:16.065
So in this video we'll tell
you more about the plot.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.413
But in the previous video
we kind of discussed

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:20.467
what was going on in
the country at the time

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.039
and Harriet Beecher
Stowe again was from this

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.546
abolitionist family.

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:27.358
She was really deeply effected
by the Compromise of 1850

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:31.369
and the Fugitive Slave Act,
and also by slave auctions.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.215
So this video will get
a little bit more into

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:35.425
the heart of the plot
of the novel which does

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:38.616
have to do with the
family being torn apart.

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:41.917
- [Voiceover] So what was Uncle
Tom's Cabin actually about?

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.641
Uncle Tom's Cabin was set
on a plantation in Kentucky

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:48.309
and it starts out with this
kind of group of slaves

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.707
that are about to be sold
to other plantation owners.

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:56.216
So Eliza and her son actually run away.

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:59.606
They run up North, so Eliza goes up North

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:02.773
and Uncle Toms is sold down the river.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.707
- [Voiceover] So, Eliza
is trying to make sure

00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:10.338
that she and her son are
not separated by being sold.

00:01:10.338 --> 00:01:12.033
So she decides that she is going to escape

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:15.021
and take her son with her up to Canada.

00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:17.228
But Uncle Tom, he's not actually related,

00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:19.902
he is sold in the opposite direction.

00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:22.054
He's getting farther away from freedom

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:24.836
by heading down the Mississippi.

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:27.557
When you think about
the geography of slavery

00:01:27.557 --> 00:01:30.155
it's a much more urban
environment than some of

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.395
the more coastal areas.

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.793
So you might be in
Charleston, or you might even

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.906
be in Baltimore as an enslaved person.

00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:39.144
You might have a pretty
high degree of freedom

00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:42.590
and also a possibility of escape either

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.402
by crossing the border or by boat.

00:01:45.402 --> 00:01:49.569
When you're sold into the
deep South area you are deep

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:52.993
in plantation country
and there might not be

00:01:52.993 --> 00:01:57.084
another soul that you could
rely on to help you escape

00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:58.667
for 100, 200 miles.

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:02.316
- [Voiceover] And I think
this is really something

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:05.253
that Harriet Beecher Stowe
wants to help point out

00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:08.046
in the book, that there
was this sense of doom

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:09.323
for Uncle Tom.

00:02:09.323 --> 00:02:11.420
However, his Christian
faith was the only thing

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.003
that really kept him going.

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.138
He bonded with this young
white woman that he met, Eva,

00:02:16.138 --> 00:02:17.717
just about their Christian faith.

00:02:17.717 --> 00:02:19.377
And really, reading
his Bible was the thing

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:21.128
that got him up in the morning.

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:25.053
So where were those feelings
about religion coming from?

00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:26.481
- [Voiceover] You can definitely see

00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.926
that Harriet Beecher Stowe is influenced

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:31.686
by her own family's
faith which is influenced

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:34.281
by the Second Great Awakening.

00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:36.470
The Second Great Awakening
was this flowering

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.053
of religious belief in
the 1830s and 1840s.

00:02:41.424 --> 00:02:44.939
It was kind of a reaction
against the Era of Enlightenment

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.350
which was what had inspired the founders

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.531
of the United States to think
of a more humanist world,

00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:54.064
a more rational, scientific world.

00:02:54.064 --> 00:02:55.733
People start going to camp meetings,

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:58.129
they have religious revivals.

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.734
They experience religious conversions.

00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:04.740
And in this time period
there's a shift in thinking

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.991
about God in the United States.

00:03:06.991 --> 00:03:08.511
If you think back to
the puritans they have

00:03:08.511 --> 00:03:12.823
this incredibly punitive
sort of Old Testament

00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:15.341
destroyer God, right?

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:19.327
One of the most famous early
sermons in the United States

00:03:19.327 --> 00:03:21.699
is sinners in the hands of an angry God,

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.782
that at any moment God might
release you into the flames.

00:03:24.782 --> 00:03:28.699
Well there's a new emphasis
on Christ-like love

00:03:29.624 --> 00:03:31.791
in the early 1830s, 1840s.

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:36.760
New interpretation of
God as being forgiving

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.410
and gentle, family oriented,
it's very Victorian.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.261
Where God was seen as this punisher

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.922
who condemned most people to hell,

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:50.730
in the Second Great Awakening
there's a new emphasis

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.230
on a forgiving, kind family-oriented Jesus

00:03:56.742 --> 00:03:58.551
who will save everyone.

00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:01.901
That's very incompatible
with the ideas of slavery.

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.463
- [Voiceover] Exactly, and I
think that Uncle Tom's Cabin

00:04:04.463 --> 00:04:06.048
can really be considered a part

00:04:06.048 --> 00:04:07.327
of the Second Great Awakening

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:09.642
because of the way that it
points out these fundamental

00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:14.097
inconsistencies and contradictions
between Christian faith

00:04:14.097 --> 00:04:15.580
and human bondage.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.190
How could a religion that
says treat thy neighbor

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.679
as thyself actually sanction slavery?

00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:25.401
- [Voiceover] So Uncle Tom is
this martyr character, right?

00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:28.651
He is a devout believer in Christianity

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.122
and the forgiveness of God right up until

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:34.614
his very end.

00:04:34.614 --> 00:04:37.676
So how does Uncle Tom's
Cabin actually end?

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:40.977
- [Voiceover] Uncle Tom's
Cabin ends with Uncle Tom

00:04:40.977 --> 00:04:42.677
is beaten by his overseers.

00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:46.161
He's sold through this chain
of different slave families

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:50.189
in the deep South and he
ends up with just a terrible,

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:54.213
terrible slave holder
who requests his death,

00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:56.051
actually partially because he was reading

00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.134
all of this religious text.

00:04:59.134 --> 00:05:01.676
[Voiceover] And this slave
owner was named Simon Legree.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.105
And this name, Simon Legree,
has actually stuck with us

00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:07.944
in popular culture to
mean a really evil, cruel,

00:05:07.944 --> 00:05:09.687
punitive master.

00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:12.286
- [Voiceover] The rest of the
family actually meets back up.

00:05:12.286 --> 00:05:14.867
Eliza is reunited with
a bunch of other people

00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:17.027
that were on the original
plantation and they really

00:05:17.027 --> 00:05:20.711
think about Uncle Tom as this
martyr, the hero's death.

00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:25.190
He's looked at as this sacrifice
for the cause of freedom.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.349
- [Voiceover] Right, also
Uncle Tom, he dies never having

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.118
renounced his Christian faith.

00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:34.535
His example of martyrdom
actually leads everyone

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:37.385
who witnesses his death,
including Simon Legree,

00:05:37.385 --> 00:05:40.968
to convert to Christianity
and to vow never

00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:44.610
to hold slaves again.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.380
- [Voiceover] But I think
the ending of the book

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.567
really points out this main theme within

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:51.512
a lot of Second Great
Awakening texts which was that

00:05:51.512 --> 00:05:55.356
if you just paid attention
to how you are falling away

00:05:55.356 --> 00:05:58.237
from your Christian
commitments then you could get

00:05:58.237 --> 00:06:01.151
back on track and maybe
bring people together

00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:04.992
by utilizing Christian
faith in a productive

00:06:04.992 --> 00:06:06.762
and public way.

00:06:06.762 --> 00:06:09.156
- [Voiceover] The book
is published in 1852,

00:06:09.156 --> 00:06:10.656
then what happens?

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.937
How do people receive this book?

00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:16.541
- [Voiceover] We'll talk about
this Tom-mania that ensues

00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:18.041
in the next video.
