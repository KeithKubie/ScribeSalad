00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.000
 We aim to facilitate and simplify shopping 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 Users in the entire travel market 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.099
 Search for flights and hotels. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 We deluded ourselves as an online market driven by research. 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.699
 We launched our application for Andriod devices in early 2014 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.199
 Since then, growth has been really rapid. 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.199
 There is an active forum of developers 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.500
 Are developing software for Android. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 So it really makes it easier for our team to participate 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.700
 Their experiences are also learning from other developers. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 Moving to multidimensional design came as a natural step forward. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.600
 We wanted to provide a local language experience 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.100
 More realistic users. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.799
 And provide a user interface they can simply understand 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:48.899
 It is not taught to use specifically with the WEGO application 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.899
 But to be used with every mobile application being installed. 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.400
 Last year when we decided to redesign our entire application 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.599
 Using the principles of multidimensional design, it was 

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.900
 The first thing we did was transfer to Andriod Studio 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200
 It took time to get used to it. 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.200
 Then things went very smoothly 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.200
 Thanks to the new libraries provided by Google. 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.900
 We moved to the stylish designs of multidimensional 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.099
 With bold colors and widescreen printing 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.299
 To draw attention to the content. 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.000
 Check the action button in the floating ad 

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:37.599
 We've made a lot of improvements to the app 

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.599
 The experience with the app made good and really fast. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.600
 Within two months, 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.700
 The most important thing we are proud of is that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.800
 Our application ratings were almost 

00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:01.500
 During less than a year, it improved to reach 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 Increasing your app ratings incrementally, 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
 With also getting millions of new users 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.100
 Of the best achieved in the industry.
