RICK: What do we have here?

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.040
I have an antique clock.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.620
It's been my family for
about four generations.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.960
It's brass.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.830
It's an antique carriage clock.
RICK: OK.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.120
Cool.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.710
This carriage clock
design came along,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.540
I think, right around 1800ish--
somewhere around there.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.210
And they were sort of
like a fashion thing,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.380
which I don't understand at all.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.120
My kids tell me
this all the time.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.000
Constantly, I'm walking out
the house, and my daughters go,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you're really gonna wear that?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.210
[laughs]

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.040
JEANNE: The clock has been
stowed away for a long time.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.420
And I discovered it
recently after we were

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.920
cleaning my mom's apartment.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.750
I'm looking for
$1,500. $1,500 will

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.710
buy a lot of really fun shoes.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.250
RICK: It's really, really cool.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.040
This carriage clock
design-- it was basically

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.920
designed to be a travel clock.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.170
You just couldn't
jump on the plane

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.580
and go to New York
for the weekend.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.080
That's right.
RICK: You were gone for months.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.580
And rich people brought
tons of baggage with them.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.920
So why not bring a
clock with you, too?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.250
So, you know,
carriage clocks were

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.000
originally portable clocks.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.540
But the portable clocks, they
still made sort of like this.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.250
This looks 1900ish to me
just the way the design is

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.380
and the way the movement is.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.880
Does it run?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.120
JEANNE: I'm not actually sure.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.620
I do have the original winder.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.540
RICK: It's called the key.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.250
The key.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.290
RICK: OK.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.080
Well, we'll find out real quick.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.380
That's scary.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.960
I just wound it and saw
that this was already wound.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.210
It's broken.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.710
OK.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710
So did you have an idea
of what you wanted for it?

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.790
JEANNE: Well, I was
originally thinking $1,500.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.790
I think it's kind of cool that
it's got the original case

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.620
and the original key.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.580
RICK: It's great
history and everything,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.000
but even if it was running, this
thing's worth maybe $100-$150.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.170
OK.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.330
RICK: It'd cost me
more to fix this

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.620
than what I can sell it for.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.460
JEANNE: I understand.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.000
So there's no offer?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.500
No offer.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.330
But thanks for bringing it in.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.500
It's really cool.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.080
And it's a great
conversation piece.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080
JEANNE: Of course.
RICK: OK.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.620
Have a good one.
- Thanks.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.960
You too.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.580
I feel a little
disappointed that there's

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.290
no interest in the clock.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.670
I'm going to take the clock home
and display it on our mantle

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.670
proudly.
