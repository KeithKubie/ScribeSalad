This exercise has illustrated the construction of an analysis model for

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.370
the text browser problem. We haven't yet begun to solve the problem,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.080
which is what design is all about. To begin thinking about design ask yourself,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.110
what is the key design question with which any implementation of

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.530
the text browser must deal? We're not going to answer that question right now,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.950
but we will come back to this a little while later, and maybe by that time you

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.470
will have thought through what it would take to actually to do a design here.
