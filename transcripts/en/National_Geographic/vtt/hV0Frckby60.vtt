DAVID LANG:<i>A few years ago, I
 had this big epiphany.</i>

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.671
<i> How do we shift</i>

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.839
<i> from just something
 we're building together</i>

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.543
<i> to all of these ways that we
 could be exploring together?</i>

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:13.379
<i> We're building the largest
 ocean observation network</i>

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.148
<i> in the world and we're
 doing it with other people.</i>

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.951
<i> It's powered by citizens.</i>

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.922 line:0%
<i> So I'm gonna start my 
 story four years ago.</i>

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:26.191 line:0%
I met this amazing person
named Eric Stackpole

00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:28.327 line:0%
and he told me this
wonderful story about

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:31.296 line:0%
this underwater cave that was
filled with gold supposedly.

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:32.732
<i> And he told this whole story</i>

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.834
<i> of treasure hunters who
 had tried to find it,</i>

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.237
<i> and then he showed me this
 little underwater robot</i>

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.939
<i> that he was trying
 to build to explore.</i>

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.208
<i> It's called an ROV, a
 remotely operated vehicle,</i>

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.644
and how it works is it goes
down underneath the surface.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.212
It's got a camera, it sends
live video up a thin tether

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:49.014
to the operator on the
surface who can see

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.349
what it's seeing and drive it.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:53.052
I was captivated
by Eric's story.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.488
We didn't have any money to buy
one of these ROVs ourselves,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.523
and unfortunately,
we also didn't know

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.591
how to build one ourselves.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.460
We had an early prototype,
but it didn't work.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.661
So we did what anybody
would do in our position,

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:03.996
we asked the internet for help.

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:04.797
( laughter )

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:08.067
<i> We created a website
 called OpenROV.com</i>

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.003
and we started asking
people to critique

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.739
our designs and
help us improve it.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.708
At first, it was just me
and Eric asking questions

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:19.511
to each other about buoyancy
and basic engineering,

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:24.484
and slowly, people began to add
feedback and give us advice.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.085
I think they just
took pity on us,

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.853
but eventually, we
got to the point

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:30.122
<i> where the robot was good
 enough to take to the caves,</i>

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.959
<i>so we got our friends together,
we mounted a little expedition,</i>

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.129
<i> and we sent the robot
 into the back of the cave</i>

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.530
<i> and it went down, down.</i>

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.865
We found millions
of dollars of gold.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:40.867
( laughter )

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.535
Actually, we didn't.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:50.710
We didn't find anything,
but we learned a lot,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.678
and that was the
important thing.

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.613
And one of the important
things we learned

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.416
was that this low cost
underwater robot kit

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.185
<i> was something that
 other people wanted.</i>

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.254
<i> And so, we decided to
 put it on Kickstarter,</i>

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.922
<i> and we raised $100,000.</i>

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.457
<i> This was back in
 2012 when that was</i>

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:06.926
<i> a lot of money on Kickstarter,</i>

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.761
<i> and it was certainly
 more than we expected,</i>

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.730
<i> and it caused us
 to really quickly</i>

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.299
outgrow our garage operation.

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.201
I remember the day when
the boxes showed up

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.171
and I was thinking, oh, my gosh.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.572
But we got them together
and we got them shipped out,

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:22.008
<i> and over the past three years,</i>

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.642
<i> we've shipped thousands
 of these things</i>

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.210
<i> to every corner of the globe.</i>

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.679
<i> They've gone to the bottom
 of the Earth in Antarctica.</i>

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:28.981
<i> They've gone to the
 top of the Earth.</i>

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.050
<i> I got this photo last
 week from an explorer</i>

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.519
<i> who was studying glacial
 lakes in the Himalayas.</i>

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.688
<i> These are schools in Oakland.</i>

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.490
<i> These are communities
 in Papua New Guinea.</i>

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.625
<i> We have people who
 are discovering</i>

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.761
<i> glass sponge reefs
 in British Columbia.</i>

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.229
<i> We have people who are
 creating 3D visualizations</i>

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.166
<i> of habitat for
 Caribbean monk seals.</i>

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.836
<i> I mean, the community just
 continues to surprise us.</i>

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.237
<i> This was from last week.</i>

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.438
<i> We were up at Lake Tahoe.</i>

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.606
<i> We found a shipwreck
 at 120 meters</i>

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:56.042
<i> and we were
 streaming it all live</i>

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.044
<i> to Facebook and
 Ustream and Twitch TV.</i>

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.747
<i> It was pretty exciting
 moment for us last week.</i>

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:02.882
Our latest design
is the Trident.

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:04.750
So, we took all the
things that we've learned

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.718
over the past three
years and we put that

00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:08.821
<i> into a new design
 for underwater robots</i>

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.923
<i> that we think is a
 evolutionary step forward</i>

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:12.425
<i>for low cost underwater drones.</i>

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.927
<i> This thing is fast, it
 flies like a fighter jet,</i>

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.696
<i> but it's also
 super maneuverable,</i>

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.299
<i>and still costs less than $1500.</i>

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.035
<i> So other people
 wanted this, too,</i>

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.271
<i> and so we raised $810,000
 for this on Kickstarter</i>

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.740
<i> last October and we're
preparing to ship it in the fall</i>

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.009
<i> of this year, so we're
 really excited about that.</i>

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.778
<i>I think this is pretty amazing.</i>

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:36.181
In just a few years, two
guys in a garage have

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:39.452
<i> turned into a global
 community of ocean explorers.</i>

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:42.121
<i> We're building the largest
 ocean observation network</i>

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.657
<i> in the world, and we're
 doing it with other people.</i>

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.592
<i> It's powered by citizens.</i>

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.093
<i> This is Laura James.</i>

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:49.962
<i> She was one of the
 first people to notice</i>

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:53.065
<i> that sea stars were dying
 around the Puget Sound</i>

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.068
<i> and she notified scientists
 and they confirmed</i>

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.102
<i> that it was part of
 this widespread die off</i>

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.238
<i> that was going on
 around the Pacific coast</i>

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:00.773
<i> called sea star
 wasting syndrome.</i>

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:01.975
<i> They didn't know
 what was causing it,</i>

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.910
<i> and Laura was not
 content with that answer,</i>

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.545
<i> so she started a
 citizen science project</i>

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:09.115
<i> to get people to notice
 and contribute data.</i>

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:11.383
That data was then part
of Pete Raimondi's work

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:15.954
at UC Santa Cruz, and they
did this amazing PBS story

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:17.789
about Laura and her
citizen science project

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.859
<i> and all the people
 that are contributing,</i>

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.496
<i> and a Congressman saw that
 and decided to introduce</i>

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:25.264
the Emergency
Marine Disease Act,

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:27.266
and so there's this bill
in Congress right now.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.268
You can call and
help push it along,

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:31.236
but I love this story
because this is it.

00:04:31.603 --> 00:04:33.105
You know, this isn't
just a headline

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:34.306
that sea stars are dying.

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:36.108
This is people who
are getting involved.

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:38.110
This is congresspeople
who are taking notice

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.413
and action is happening.

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.047
Laura and her team
are still out there.

00:04:42.047 --> 00:04:43.682
Now they're monitoring
storm water runoff

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:44.750
to see if that's the problem.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.252
They're looking at urchins to
see if the virus is spreading.

00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:50.356
It's the scientific method,
actually becomes the message.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.191
There's this whole
architecture for participation.

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:54.393
That's a big deal.

00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:56.328
So I don't wanna
go into the details

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:57.830
of what's going on in Flint.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.833
<i> It's an ongoing disaster and
 all of you know about it.</i>

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.202
But I do wanna point
out that that, too,

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.004
was a citizen science project.

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:07.606 line:0%
<i> Professor Mark Edwards
 at Virginia Tech</i>

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:09.242 line:0%
<i> was sick of the
 institutional failure</i>

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.143 line:0%
<i> so he gave out 300 kits
 to the community and said,</i>

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:13.513 line:0%
"You guys need to start testing
your water and take action."

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.014
And they did.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.616 line:0%
There's a fantastic
piece in<i> Wired.</i>

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:19.118 line:0%
<i> My favorite paragraph
 is towards the end</i>

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:21.053 line:0%
<i> it said, "This kind
 of citizen-powered,</i>

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:23.088 line:0%
"apocalypse-averting
science is spreading."

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:24.556 line:0%
And he went on to
list a whole host

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:26.726
of citizen science projects
that were doing similar work.

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:29.461
At the end of that paragraph,

00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:31.063
I love this line,
I'm gonna read it.

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:33.432 line:0%
<i> "Researchers are learning
 that there's a difference</i>

00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:36.435 line:0%
<i> "between publishing

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:38.003 line:0%
<i> "you know, getting them."</i>

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:42.075
( laughter )
( applause )

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:50.216
And so that's where we are.
That's what's going on.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:54.119
The tools are getting
really good, really fast.

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:57.423
<i> All of the micro-controllers
 and sensors and cameras</i>

00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:00.259
<i> and GPS are now building
 blocks that makers can use</i>

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.761
<i> and all of these maker
 spaces are popping up</i>

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.598
<i> all over the world, in
 classrooms, in museums,</i>

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:07.633
in libraries, and
just in neighborhoods.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.368
It's profound, and
people have access

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.803
to powerful digital
fabrication tools

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:12.804
like laser cutters
and 3D printers.

00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:14.840
It would've been
impossible for Eric

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.544
to do what we did
just five years ago.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.713
I mean, we're really at
the very beginning of this.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:24.216
This is our same garage; this
is our roommates at the time,

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:28.387
and they had this idea to
create low cost satellites

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.956
using these same components,
and so they prototyped

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:33.125
this satellite in the
garage, and they have since

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.360
started a company, raised
hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.863
<i> and launched a constellation
 of hundreds of satellites</i>

00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:39.197
<i> that are now getting an image</i>

00:06:39.197 --> 00:06:40.899
<i> of every location
 on Earth every day.</i>

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.535 line:0%
<i> It's a big company and
 they're doing important work.</i>

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:45.704 line:0%
<i> This is an illegal gold
 mining operation in Peru</i>

00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:47.306 line:0%
<i> that they found
 encroaching on this river.</i>

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.641 line:0%
It's really extraordinary.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.010
I mean, this used to be
the stuff of nation states,

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:53.445
and now it's our roommates
starting this in the garage.

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:54.580
( laughter )

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.714
It's extraordinary.

00:06:56.014 --> 00:06:58.550
<i> This is not just a Silicon
 Valley story either.</i>

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.918
<i>These are DIY drones being used</i>

00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:01.520
<i> in Indonesia for conservation.</i>

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.522
<i> Fifty-cent microscopes,
 tens of thousands</i>

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:05.391
<i> of people are exploring
 the microcosmos.</i>

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.759
<i> Creating DIY Geiger
 counters to monitor</i>

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.695
<i> the radiation after Fukushima.</i>

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:12.732
<i> There's all sorts of low-
 cost, DIY bio equipment</i>

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.866

 to power garage labs</i>

00:07:14.866 --> 00:07:17.703
<i> and community bio
 labs across the world.</i>

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:20.039
<i> The list goes on and on.</i>

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:22.974
<i> We need everyone to see
 themselves as explorers.</i>

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:25.711
We need everybody to
recognize that they have

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.547
the agency to be
curious, to ask questions

00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:31.717
because I promise you,
when you give people

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:34.720
the tools to ask questions,
they will surprise you

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.389
with what they ask and
with what they discover.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:38.457
Thank you.
