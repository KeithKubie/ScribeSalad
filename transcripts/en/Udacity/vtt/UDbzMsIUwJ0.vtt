00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.010
In 1985, two scientists from AT&amp;T labs published

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.310
a paper on graphical perception and methods. The study

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.060
determined how accurately people read the visual cues that

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.080
are presented here. This resulted in a ranked list

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.140
of most accurate to least accurate visual cues. So

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.390
you can see that position is more accurate. Where

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.930
as hue is less accurate. What does accuracy mean

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.580
here? Well, in this case, it just means how

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.970
easily are people able to perceive the values in

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.500
your data set given the visual encoding that you've

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.380
chosen. You might wonder why saturation and hue are

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.590
considered inaccurate. Well, this is a great example. One should

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.650
be a little bit cautious when using color, hues

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.230
and saturation as visual cues. Like all aspects of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.780
visual perception, we don't perceive color in an absolute

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.690
manner. For example, these are all different shades of gray.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.570
When trying to compare and contrast them, it's difficult to

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.490
know which shades of gray correspond to exactly which values,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.210
or just how much darker one shade of gray is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.630
than another. For this reason, it's really hard for viewers of

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.930
your visualization to really know what a different shade of

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.020
gray might mean. How much bigger is one data point

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.090
than another? Because of this, you should be careful when

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.780
using color, hues and saturation, to encode information in your visualization.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.750
This ranking up here is really a oversimplification of

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.010
how visualization works. So you should really use it as

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.490
a guide, rather than a definitive rule buck. Efficiency and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.650
exactness are not always the goal of our visualization. Sometimes

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.630
color, saturation or color, hue or volume or area can

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.850
be really effective to communicate what we are trying to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.380
tell the viewer. However it's good to know generally how

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.850
well people will be able to read different visual cues.
