00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.160
As the artists and storytellers at Pixar Animation
began to crank out successful movies set in

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.050
the fictional worlds of children’s toys,
sentient cars, and culinary rodents, it didn’t

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.820
take long for fans to realize the stories
weren’t as separate as they had thought.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.590
Fans have spun wild theories on a single unified
“Pixar Universe,” blurring the lines between

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.980
Pixar’s superheroes, animals, toys, and
everyday people.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.090
One overall story may be impossible to find,
but hunting down each easter egg is more than

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.090
worth the effort.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.170
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Amazing Hidden
Details In Disney Films Part 2.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.580
The Illustrated Bug’s Life

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.790
One of Pixar’s earliest films following
on Toy Story’s success, the story of one

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.791
insect’s pursuit of a great adventure has
proven just as worthy of easter eggs,and hidden

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.740
nods throughout Pixar’s talented team.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.720
As proof that the film is still worthy of
attention, a scene in Toy Story 2 shows even

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.930
Mrs. Potato Head is a fan, reading an illustrated
version of A Bug’s Life’s story.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.320
Is it merely a nod to an underrated film,
or explicit confirmation that A Bug’s Life

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.210
is a work of fiction to Andy and his toys…?

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.210
Bugs &amp; Monsters

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.609
There’s no doubt that the fantastical adventure
based on the monsters that keep children up

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.140
at night caught more attention than A Bug’s
Life, but the two are directly linked.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.329
A good chunk of the insect adventure is set
in the shadow of a mobile home, parked alongside

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.969
the infamous Pizza Planet delivery truck – one
of Pixar’s signature easter eggs, appearing

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.939
in nearly every one of their films.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.020
When the villain of Monsters, Inc., Randall
is sent into the home as punishment, and forced

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.850
to deal with its gator-hating inhabitants.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.539
Monsters, Inc. doesn’t miss out on its own
nod to the movie that started it all, either.

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.539
Where’s Woody?

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.159
When Sully returns the mischievous Boo to
her very own bedroom at the end of the first

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.380
Monsters adventure, she isn’t ready to leave,
showing off her toy collection to what she

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.200
thinks is her big blue “kitty.”.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.679
The “Luxo Ball” from Pixar’s earliest
animated shorts can be seen, but Boo takes

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.819
particular pride in her cowgirl Jessie doll,
well-known to fans of Toy Story 2, and apparently

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.349
a hit with more than just Andy.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:06.569
Buzz Down Under

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.479
For a movie based in the oceans, Finding Nemo
hints at more connections to Pixar’s other

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.900
properties than you would expect.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.700
When the wayward Nemo finds himself living
in a dentist office aquarium, viewers are

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.810
given more than a few glimpses of the waiting
room and its sometimes-terrifying patients.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.560
Among the toys scattered around for children
to play with is the unmistakable profile of

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.640
Buzz Lightyear, one star of the Toy Story
series that was apparently even popular in

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640
Australia.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.640
One Incredible Comic

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.200
The Toy Story movies always implied that there
were thousands of each toy scattered around

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.720
the world, but another nod in Finding Nemo
isn’t so easily explained.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.000
A young boy can later be seen reading a comic
book in the dentist’s office waiting room

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.640
clearly showing a young Mr. Incredible on
its cover.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.140
Whether it’s a real adventure from the golden
age of Pixar superheroes, or a sign that The

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.970
Incredibles are merely comic book characters
in Pixar’s universe… that’s for fans

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.680
to debate.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680
Car People

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.470
It may not be the most critically-acclaimed
of Pixar’s movies, but the commercial power

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.780
of Cars made it an overnight sensation – and
the wealth of easter eggs spread across the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.360
studio’s other movies show the designers
have a soft spot for the story of humanized

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.360
vehicles.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.600
Although the world of Cars is lacking human
beings, the characters in the Toy Story series

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.250
are clearly fans: the third film in the series
includes a simplified version of star Lightning

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.480
McQueen, a child wearing a t-shirt boasting
his logo and number, and even Andy is a fan,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.900
with a calendar in his room showing a more
realistic version of the sneezy Snot Rod.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.150
Jurassic Gas

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.810
As an added bonus, the gas company seen to
sponsor the film’s famous Piston Cup – Dinoco

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.280
– is also a gas company in the world of
Toy Story.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.990
And if viewers look close enough, the unmistakable
dinosaur on the company’s logo can be spotted

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.130
on a lighter in Wall-E’s collection of human
artifacts.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.130
Incredible Underwear

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.050
The story of a runaway rat with a flair for
high-end cooking may seem to have little in

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.080
common with Pixar’s other releases, but
it turns out comic book superheroes are just

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.540
as popular in the film’s version of Paris
as they are in the real one.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.540
As evidenced by the “Incredibles” logo
on Linguini’s underwear.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.270
A Telltale Shadow

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.440
But the timeline of the Pixar universe is
also played with in the movie, as Remy’s

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.730
adventures through Paris end up bringing him
dangerously close to an unseen dog.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.420
But a closer look at the dog’s shadow reveals
it to be a dead ringer for Dug, the fan-favorite

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.070
canine from Pixar’s Up, appearing here years
before his own movie hit theaters – and

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.000
apparently before a groundbreaking collar
allowed him to speak English.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Wall-E

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.470
As light-hearted and hopeful as Pixar’s
movies tend to be, Wall-E showed that if every

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.930
story is set in the same fictional world,
then all are headed for a seriously depressing

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.930
end.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.460
Set decades in the future, Wall-E follows
a single sanitation robot charged with cleaning

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.629
up the Earth after it’s been turned into
one massive landfill.

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.469
One big box retailer – Buy n Large – is
to blame for the mess, with their corporate

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:47.840
logo spread throughout the movie.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.050
Leaving no doubt that all of Pixar’s humans
are headed for this fate, the BnL logo is

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.449
shown on Buzz Lightyear’s batteries in Toy
Story 3.

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.659
He’ll at least have company, since Rex can
also be spotted in Wall-E’s collection.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.810
So what do you think of our list?

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.699
There are far too many easter eggs to fit
in one place, so be sure to let us know your
