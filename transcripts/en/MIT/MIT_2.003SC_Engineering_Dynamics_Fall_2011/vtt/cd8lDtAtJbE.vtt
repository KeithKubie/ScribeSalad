00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:25.800
PROFESSOR: And I have
put on the second board

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.260
just a quick review of
the key equations that we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.690
use to do the direct method.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.140
So straight from Newton's
second law, the first one,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.850
second one-- the summarization
of torques about some point a.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.370
a may be g, in which case
things get much simplified, g

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.270
being the center of mass.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.210
And if point a is moving,
then you have this extra term.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.150
And this is a new
equation over here,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.060
which I got frustrated with
this equation a few days ago

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.170
and derive something, which
I think is easier to use.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.260
So I'll do a problem today
using that expression.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.530
So I won't talk more about
it now-- show it to you

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.610
in a minute.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.450
And then finally, it's
convenient at times

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.800
to express angular
momentum with respect

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.400
to a point a as angular
momentum about g

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.580
plus the position vector from a
to g times the linear momentum.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.340
So that's kind of the
covered on the quiz.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.200
And we're going to
use these equations.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.250
Today, what I'm going to do
is look at a few problems

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.730
from the point of view
both equations of motion,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.800
by the direct method
and the Lagrange method,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.150
and kind of talk about and
which one's easier, when should

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.580
you choose this one,
when to choose that one.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.370
That's the nature of today's
lecture to sort of get

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.460
you prepped for the quiz.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.355
And a little bit more
on generalized forces.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:25.800
You have questions about
what's going to be on the quiz?

00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:31.979
AUDIENCE: What is that
last word-- balancing of?

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:33.270
PROFESSOR: Balancing of rotors.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.060
There's a rotor-- any thing
that we spin about an axis.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.980
A rigid body spinning
about an axis,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.040
you can call a
rotor of some kind.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.050
And balancing is usually--
the axes are fixed.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.970
And so is this one--
this axis passes

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.365
through the center
of mass-- so is

00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:04.771
this rotor statically balanced?

00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:05.270
Right.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.790
Is this rotor
dynamically balance?

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.120
Would you expect to
when this is spinning,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.335
it's direction of spin
is vertical, right.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.820
Is the direction of the
angular momentum of this

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.000
object in the same direction
as the angle of rotation?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.500
No.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.420
And so that's an indication
of dynamic imbalance.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.370
Angular momentum is not
in the same direction

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.720
as angular rotation, right.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.090
All right.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.170
And, well, while
we're on that subject,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.730
we'll just hit it briefly here.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.115
One other prop I need.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.960
So another rigid
body, and I don't know

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.755
where g is on this rigid body.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.760
So does-- this is
rotating about an axis.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.050
Is this object
statically balanced,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.246
just doing this experiment?

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:16.329
We're doing an experiment.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.089
We're sticking this
on an axis, and we're

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.130
letting it do it's thing.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.540
And I'm asking you is
it statically balance.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.290
How do you know?

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.736
AUDIENCE: Because if you were to
flip it upside down and do it,

00:04:27.736 --> 00:04:29.220
it would still come to a stop.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.240
PROFESSOR: So it goes
to a low point, right.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.190
And that tells you what about
the position of this axis?

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.686
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:39.060
PROFESSOR: The
center of mass has

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.200
got gravity, puts a force
at the center of mass,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.610
creates a torque which
brings it to the low point.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:54.100
Does this object
have any symmetries

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.230
that you could point out?

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.960
Or in other words, can you
without doing any math tell me

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.400
one principal axis
of this object?

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:15.098
AUDIENCE: Where the dotted line
is, that's a plane [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:17.480
PROFESSOR: So you say I've
got a dotted line around here

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.920
and that's a plane of what?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.570
AUDIENCE: Plane of symmetry.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.180
PROFESSOR: So there's a
plane of symmetry cutting

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.310
this thing through here.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.840
So if you can identify
one plane of symmetry,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.350
then where can you tell
me that for sure you

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.090
know that you can
make a principal axis?

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.550
He says perpendicular
to that plane.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.390
Any place on that plane
perpendicular to it?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.240
What do you think?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.570
For now, we've identified
it has a plane of symmetry

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:57.100
and that an axis perpendicular
to it-- a principle axis should

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.440
be perpendicular to that plane.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.430
But the question is
where do I put it?

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.750
Where, perpendicular
to that plane

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.385
can this axis be and
be a principal axis?

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.530
She says through g.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.160
Do you agree with that?

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.510
So certainly through g.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.490
Let's say that that really is
g and I put it through here.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.647
And if it was
exactly through g, it

00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:25.980
wouldn't rotate to the low spot.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.900
This is pretty close.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.760
It struggles to get there.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.350
That's definitely a principal
axis, but are there more?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.390
This is kind of the real
point of the question.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.900
Are there other
allowable principal axes

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.675
in this direction?

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.520
So we haven't talked
about this very much.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.710
Any axis-- if this
is a principal axis,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.200
any axis parallel to
it is a principal axis.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.860
It's no longer through g.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.430
It's no longer statically
balanced about that point.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.460
But it's still a principal axis.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.830
And one measure of
whether or not something

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.360
is a principal axis-- if
you know the principal axes

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.820
of an object and you write
the mass moment of inertia

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.410
matrix of it with
respect to g, what

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.150
does that matrix look like?

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.190
Where does it have
0s and non-0s?

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.870
It's a diagonal matrix.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.800
So if i about g
is diagonal, that

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.420
means you're computed
the moment, mass moment

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.980
properties with respect
to three principal axes.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.800
If it's diagonal, and those
axes all pass through g,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.950
if I now take one of
those axes and say,

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.560
I want to move it
over here, and you've

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.480
re-computed the inertia matrix,
would it still be diagonal?

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:55.580
So you've moved just one axis
to another spot, parallel

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.090
to its original one.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.040
You know this one
is a principal axis.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.480
I'm going to move
it just parallel.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.200
Only that one axis-- the other
two are saying where they are.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.600
I've just moved it parallel.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.410
Is that also a principal axis,
or another way of saying it,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.990
does that mass matrix, mass
moment of inertia matrix stay

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.130
diagonal?

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.910
Do any of the
terms in it change?

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.500
Let's say this is the z
principal axis and I move away.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.380
So now you have this new
mass moment inertia matrix.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.680
Does the Izz term change?

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.564
Yeah, by how much?

00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:42.059
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.340
PROFESSOR: He said ml
squared, l being what?

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.300
AUDIENCE: The length you moved.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.370
PROFESSOR: Here.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.690
And that's this thing though
as parallel axis there, right?

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:57.920
If you move one axis, any axis
parallel to one of those axes

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.940
is also a principal axis.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.360
So that's a subtle point.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.390
We don't often talking about it.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.730
Any axis parallel to a principal
axis is also principal axis.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.230
Well, let's think
about a problem.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.760
We've done this problem before.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.090
But now we have
all the full tools.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.870
We have Lagrange, we
have direct method.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:31.835
So that's this problem of the
wheel on a horizontal plane.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.080
Kind of a complicated
distribution of mass

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:51.320
for which we know Izz about g
is some mass radius and gyration

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.820
squared.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.540
Maybe we measured it
rather than computed it.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:03.630
So this thing is sliding
on ice, and it has cord

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.190
wrapped around it.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.360
I'm pulling with a
force F, call it F1.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.815
I'll provide the inertial frame.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:29.600
And it's got some
radius R. And we'll

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.233
say the surface is frictionless.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.200
So I don't have a
string wrapped around.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.730
But we're really talking
about this problem.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.425
I'm pulling on the
string and this thing

00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:51.070
can slide and rotate.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.270
Take a second.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.980
Think about how
many different ways

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.810
can you think of solving for
the equations of motion of this?

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.180
So if this on a quiz,
I want you to find

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.057
the equations of motion.

00:11:13.057 --> 00:11:14.140
What method would you use?

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:17.640
And what's this?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.624
And then you're
confronted with, well,

00:11:19.624 --> 00:11:20.790
I know more than one method.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.280
What's the simplest method?

00:11:26.483 --> 00:11:28.290
And before that,
you need to decide

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.399
how many coordinates
you're going to need,

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.690
how many equations you're
going-- so let's start there.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.470
How many independent coordinates
do you need to do this problem?

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.220
We'll back up one
more question, then.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.680
Is this a planar motion problem?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.430
So it's confined to one plane.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.860
I see a lot of heads nodding.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.250
And it rotates only with one
degree of freedom of rotation,

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.100
axis perpendicular to the plane.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.599
So this is a planar
motion problem.

00:11:58.599 --> 00:12:00.140
So in general, planar
motion problems

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.420
have found many degrees
of freedom per rigid body?

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.580
So I see a bunch of 3's.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.259
Does this one have any
constraints on those three

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:10.050
degrees of freedom?

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.860
So this has three
degrees of freedom.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.680
You conceivably need
three equations of motion.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.267
What are the choices
for getting them?

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:23.100
I want you to think
about this for a minute.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.360
You decide what way
you would do, and let's

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.900
take a poll in a minute.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.650
You think about it,
and then let's take

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.865
a poll for how people
would do this problem.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.390
So what's your favorite?

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.720
How would you do it?

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.440
He'd use the direct method.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.780
Do you need a torque equation?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.630
About what point?

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.630
He'd use center of mass.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.979
So he'd say, direct method
and for the torque equation,

00:13:30.979 --> 00:13:32.270
do it about the center of mass.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:36.340
Anybody have a different way
they would do this problem?

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.400
Is there another way to do it?

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.610
He wants to do Lagrange.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.960
Everybody agree it
could be done that way?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.620
So I agree, and let's
quickly do this problem.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:14:00.100
And so direct method-- I'm going
to make it easier on myself

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.600
here.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.970
So the three coordinates,
you're going to need an x, a y,

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.070
and a theta is what I've chosen
for the three coordinates

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.000
to do this direct method.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.810
And to make it
easy on myself, I'm

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.120
going to align the force
with my coordinates.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.085
So I'm going to
essentially make theta 0.

00:14:39.593 --> 00:14:43.820
Essentially aligning F1, my
force F1 with the x-axis.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:49.770
And if I do that, then I can say
the sum of the forces in the y,

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:54.440
the external forces in the y
direction are nonexistent, 0.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.820
So that must be my double
dot, so y double dot is 0.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.000
So that simplifies the problem.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.040
Summation of forces in the
x direction, external forces

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.660
are F1I.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:15.350
And they must equal to the
mass times the acceleration

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.280
in the x direction.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.080
And I'm basically done
with that equation.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.876
AUDIENCE: Is that a
rotating [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:28.730
PROFESSOR: Well, I'm doing this.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.230
I'm saying this is
my inertia frame.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.950
You add an inertial frame?

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.000
Sure.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.670
Now I can-- I don't
have to break this force

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:52.255
into components, F1 cosine
theta in the x direction

00:15:52.255 --> 00:15:55.350
and F1 sine theta
in the y direction

00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:00.810
and get two-- get a finite
amount, a nonzero amount

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.710
for y double dot and non-0
amount for x double dot.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.860
I end up with three equations
I have to work with.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.670
Just by realigning it, I can
make this problem even simpler.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.660
So just to do it quickly,
that's what I did.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.800
So I've got two of the
three equations done.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.340
And finally, the sum
of the torques about g.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.390
And we know the angular
momentum of this

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:41.120
would be some izz
g times omega z

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.190
would be the angular momentum.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:51.150
And it's d by dt of that
izz about g, omega z dot,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.790
which is theta
double dot, right?

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.240
And what are the
external torques?

00:17:02.852 --> 00:17:03.560
So figure it out.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.440
What's the external
torque in this problem?

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.190
What is its size and
what's its direction?

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:33.460
So, somebody give me--
what's the external torque

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.200
with respect to
where, to start with?

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.870
So we're summing torques
about g, the center of mass.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.355
R cross F, right, which
comes out in what direction?

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.170
k direction, right?

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.150
And minus or plus?

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.210
Do your right hand rule.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.040
And notice I've
drawn x and y such

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.250
that positive z
is into the board.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.710
So this is positive.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.250
I put a positive z into
the board on purpose

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:13.660
so that this would just work
out R F1 in the k direction.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:22.360
And that's equal to Izz
about g theta double dot.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.380
And since it's all
with respect to k,

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.000
you can drop the
unit vectors here.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.170
And so we have one equation.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:35.100
We have two equations.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.730
And we have three equations.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.461
And that's all we
need to complete this,

00:18:40.461 --> 00:18:42.960
is three degrees of freedom to
completely define the motion.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.459
Yes?

00:18:43.459 --> 00:18:46.965
AUDIENCE: Do you want us
to have a trivial case?

00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:51.240
PROFESSOR: Do you mean the
my double dot equals 0?

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:57.600
Well, in general-- when
I started this one, when

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.952
I didn't align them, then you're
forced to use the three, right?

00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:03.410
So the only difference
between what

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:09.390
I did and this probe making a
problem slightly more messy,

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:14.120
is if I had let theta, this
angle, be other than 0, I

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.940
would have had to have
come up with three

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:22.400
non-zero acceleration equations.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.110
So I'd say technically, or I'd
just say I think it's prudent.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.280
If you're ever not
sure, if you can

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.630
look at it and by inspection
write down, my double dot is 0,

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.230
you've essentially just
written an equation of motion.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.720
Rather than say
let's just ignore it,

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.630
I'd keep it in your-- I'd
just put it on the paper,

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.670
my double dot equals 0.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.100
And that's your first
trivial equation of motion.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.880
But it is an equation of
motion, because this body

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.480
has a true degree of
freedom in that direction.

00:19:57.911 --> 00:19:58.910
That's really the point.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.080
Don't confuse trivial
results because there's

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.860
no external forces
with constraints.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.260
It's unconstrained
in the x direction,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.190
or in the y direction
the way I've set it up.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:17.640
So I think you're
safer if you do just--

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.195
say the torques or the forces
in that direction are 0

00:20:20.195 --> 00:20:22.640
and you write it down.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.390
Let's look at this problem from
the point of view of Lagrange.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.930
It's also equally
simple, the Lagrange,

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.370
except for the
generalized forces.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.102
Actually, Lagrange
is harder because you

00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:38.310
have to think your way
through the generalized forces

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.420
in this problem.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.690
And I got myself in a
pickle with this problem

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.110
and I spent hours
trying to figure out

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.210
a good explanation
of a conundrum I

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.800
ran into with the
generalized forces.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.644
So let's look.

00:20:50.644 --> 00:20:52.310
I'll tell you what
that was in a second.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.268
Let's look at Lagrange.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:07.310
So you need T. And we're
pretty good at this now,

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.900
I with respect to g
zz, theta dot squared.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.220
That's your rotational
kinetic energy.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:19.430
1/2 mx dot squared
plus y dot squared.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.950
Translational kinetic
energy associated

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.080
with the center of mass.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.360
Notice this is with
respect to the center

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.260
of mass.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.290
How about v?

00:21:35.096 --> 00:21:36.470
Potential energy
in this problem?

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.710
Any?

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.810
It's all 0's, right?

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:42.810
There's no springs.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.820
There's no gravity in this
plane, operating in this plane.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.337
So this is 0.

00:21:48.337 --> 00:21:50.295
This problem's going to
be particularly simple.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:23.340
So in the theta direction
here, this derivative

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.760
with respect to Q dot
gives us Iz theta dot

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.910
and the time derivative of
that zz theta double dot.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:40.930
T with respect to
theta-- nothing.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.850
V with respect to theta?

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:43.675
Nothing.

00:22:43.675 --> 00:22:50.710
And on the right hand side,
we need to get Q theta here.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:58.940
And the other equation,
it's the x equation.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.930
Well, actually, we
can have x and y.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.930
So what about the x equation?

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.570
Derivative with
respect to x dot?

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.170
I get an mx dot, time
derivative, mx double dot.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.420
And with respect to y.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.900
The thing about Lagrange, if
you can do Lagrange, just write

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.140
down the total expression
and just crank it out,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.380
because if you say, oh,
well, I know this is trivial,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.410
then you're actually
employing some information

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.554
from the direct method.

00:23:30.554 --> 00:23:33.220
If you're saying, I know the sum
of the forces in this direction

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.310
is 0.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.440
So when you straight out
in applying Lagrange,

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.340
you can do it without any
reference at all to Newton.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.830
So in this case, we just blindly
clunk along and we say, well,

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:49.190
what's the derivative now
with respect to y dot?

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:55.810
Will I get an my dot time
derivative y double dot.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.490
This derivative would be 0.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.910
This derivative is 0.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.760
And over here I get Q1.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.620
Now I'm left-- so the left hand
side of Lagrange equations--

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.855
remember, you just add
these terms together.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.225
And these are going to be
our three equations of motion

00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:19.430
that result. And now
the remaining work

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.640
is to get these three
generalized forces.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.980
Let's go back to our picture.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.480
If we had lined it up
like this, and now we

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.470
give it a general little
virtual displacement delta

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.940
y, how much work gets done?

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:43.680
None.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.780
And so you suddenly realize,
oh, I went to a lot of work

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.680
for nothing here.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.900
This equation is trivial.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.980
Nothing happens there.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.370
And so now it's reduced
to doing the Qx and Qy.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.700
So just to give
us some practice,

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:10.350
let's do Q theta and Qx
the rigorous kinematic way.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.420
I'm going to draw the
general picture here,

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.225
because this is where I
got myself into trouble.

00:25:42.225 --> 00:25:43.600
You're working
along on a problem

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.310
and then something doesn't
quite work for you.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.647
I had set this problem to
do generalized-- to compute

00:25:49.647 --> 00:25:50.605
the generalized forces.

00:25:50.605 --> 00:26:00.030
And I set it up looking like set
it up like this so theta is 0.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.540
It's lined up like that.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.430
And I started thinking
about, then generalized,

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.470
my little virtual
displacements, and I

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.426
got into a conceptual problem
that I couldn't sort out

00:26:11.426 --> 00:26:11.925
for a while.

00:26:11.925 --> 00:26:17.699
And I'll work it into
the explanation here.

00:26:17.699 --> 00:26:19.490
So I'm going to set
this up more generally.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.290
I have an angle theta
here, and this is my F1.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.400
So to do this by
this kinematic way,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.020
I need to find the
position vector.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.720
Here's a point-- I'm
going to call it D,

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.800
and this is my point
G, and here's O.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.580
So I have a position
vector going to here--

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.490
it's RG; and a position
vector going to here-- that's

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:54.000
R of D with respect to G; and
a position vector from here,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:07.000
and that's RD in O. And RD in O
is RG in O plus RD with respect

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.639
to G. I can write that.

00:27:08.639 --> 00:27:09.305
They're vectors.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.510
So I'm going to need those.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.830
So what is RG in O?

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.900
Well, I have this
coordinate system.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:27.560
It's going to be some XI plus
YJ in the inertial frame.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:33.380
And then RD with
respect to G-- I

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.500
need to have some kind of
a coordinate system that

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.200
rotates with the body.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:47.240
So I'll call this
y1, and this x1-- how

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.380
it's rotating with the body.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:58.170
So now, this one down here is
minus R in the j1 direction.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:07.400
So that's the position of this
point D with respect to O,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.040
written as the sum
of two vectors.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.690
And I'm eventually going to
need to be able to express

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:33.480
this j1 in an inertial frame.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.500
So here's just this
little vector j1,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:46.810
and I need its components
in the J and I directions.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:51.220
So it's made up of a piece
like that, a piece like this,

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:57.120
and this angle here is theta.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:13.365
So little j1-- so
I can converge.

00:29:13.365 --> 00:29:17.790
I can move from this unit
vector system to that one

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.239
by this transformation.

00:29:19.239 --> 00:29:20.697
I'm going to need
that in a minute.

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:29.020
Actually, I'll
invoke it right now.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.555
So my position vector here
is-- the x component is x.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.270
Can't read my plus.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.620
I crossed out a plus and minus,
so I got to sort this out

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.575
carefully here.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.545
Is this right?

00:30:15.077 --> 00:30:17.701
What do you think?

00:30:17.701 --> 00:30:18.950
Laura, what have I done wrong?

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.480
So this is the plus I direction.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:32.400
This piece here
is-- so minus sine

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.015
theta in the I plus cosine theta
in the J are the components.

00:30:37.015 --> 00:30:39.441
So I'm missing a
minus sign there.

00:30:39.441 --> 00:30:39.940
OK.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.070
So I want to collect
the I pieces together.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.250
So I have an X in
the I, and I have

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.690
a minus R minus sine theta.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:31:00.660
So, plus R sine theta--
this is the I contribution.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:09.600
And then over here I have
a Y and a minus R cosine

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:15.720
theta in the J. Then I have
this vector all worked out

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.780
in my inertial frame.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:29.810
So now I can say
that-- remember, Qj dot

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:38.290
dR-- it's a sort of virtual
deflection for the jth

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:39.920
contribution.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.965
So in this case, I'm interested
in, say, the 1 in the-- which

00:31:44.965 --> 00:31:48.195
one should we do
first-- The x direction.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:32:02.530
So this is the F1 in the I dot
derivative of RD with respect

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:08.900
to x delta x.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.100
But now I have an--
I can work this out.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.150
I can figure this
one out directly now,

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:17.690
because I have an
expression for R--

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:22.780
that vector-- in terms of
one set of unit vectors,

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.160
and I can take the
derivative with respect to x.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.812
And the only x that
shows up in here

00:32:27.812 --> 00:32:29.645
is this, so the derivative
is pretty simple.

00:32:29.645 --> 00:32:31.490
It's just 1.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:38.710
So this is F1I dot I delta x.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:45.670
So this tells us
that Qx equals F1.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.610
No great surprise.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.920
We knew the answer
to that from before.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:57.760
And I-- oh, I made a mistake.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.620
What didn't I-- I
was mixing the two.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.085
I did a simplification
when I did the direct one.

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.186
Is F1 in the I direction?

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.390
So F1 has components.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:33.420
Vector F1 has a magnitude F1
times cosine theta I plus sine

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.000
theta J. And so
down here, I need

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.020
to put those in and
take the dot product.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:44.980
So the only dot product that
will matter is the I component.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:50.372
This is going to be
F1 cosine theta I

00:33:50.372 --> 00:33:54.460
dot this, which we know
this gives us just and I.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.830
So I'm leaving out the J piece.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:02.010
So I end up here
with F1 cosine theta.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.630
Does that look right?

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.990
So here is your theta.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.680
Here is your-- this
is F1 cosine theta.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.159
So for our coordinate system
that's squared up like this,

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.730
it's only that term that's
in the F1 direction,

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.610
and this would
come out correctly.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:25.149
Now

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:28.790
And if we let-- if we now
reorient our coordinate system

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:36.199
so that theta is 0, then this
would just turn out to be F1.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.719
If you can see that this is
F1 cosine theta without going

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:42.489
through all the work,
what's Qy for this system?

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:47.900
Sure.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.359
F1 sine theta.

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:51.734
We won't go through
all the work,

00:34:51.734 --> 00:34:55.300
but you go through
the same taking

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.500
the derivative-- in this
case, the derivative of R

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.880
with respect to y, and
then dot it with F,

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.900
and you get F1 sine
theta in the J direction.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.020
So there's Qy.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:22.540
Now, the problem I ran
into, conceptually,

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.570
is around this other piece.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:31.000
So Q theta, the virtual work
done in the theta direction,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.360
we know has to do with rotation.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:41.460
And that is going to
be sum F1 dot-- now

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.421
this is the derivative of RD
with respect to theta delta

00:35:46.421 --> 00:35:46.920
theta.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:36:02.632
So RD is here, and it's indeed
a function of theta, right?

00:36:02.632 --> 00:36:04.840
And so I can take a derivative
with respect to theta,

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.010
and I'll get derivative
of that R sine theta term,

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.996
and I'll get a derivative
of the R cosine theta term.

00:36:10.996 --> 00:36:12.620
But here's how I got
myself in trouble.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.190
It took me-- and this
is the sort of thing

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.273
that happens to all of us.

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:18.407
You're working a problem,
throw in a simplification,

00:36:18.407 --> 00:36:19.740
and then something doesn't work.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:31.290
Well, what if you had
oriented the axis, initially,

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:38.720
so that the force is aligned
with x and perpendicular to y?

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:45.780
Then this theta
angle is 0, right?

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.670
And you know, when
you set it up,

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:53.980
you don't end up with-- the
cosine of 0 is 1, and sine of 0

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.672
is 0.

00:36:55.672 --> 00:36:58.260
You don't end up with the
cosine and sines in there

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.140
to take derivatives of.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.450
You just jump to
the simplification,

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:13.060
and you just find out that
you just have R in the J.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.480
There's no R sine theta term.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.380
It's just vanished on you.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:21.400
And now you need to take that
derivative to do this step.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.010
And I do count with it as huh?

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.600
What have I done wrong?

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.550
In order to do this
method, you need

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:37.040
to leave it in the sort
of general formulation,

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.010
and then let theta be 0 at the
end, if you want to do that.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:45.340
So if I had then
finished it, I can

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.690
do this for this
general problem,

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.520
and then let theta go
to 0, and the answer

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.520
will come out all right.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.140
So should we do this?

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.460
So this is F1 dot this.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:09.920
So, F1 dotted with
the derivative of R

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.010
with respect to theta.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:21.957
So I get an R cosine
theta in the I,

00:38:21.957 --> 00:38:23.915
and the derivative of
this term will be-- well,

00:38:23.915 --> 00:38:26.150
the cosine theta
is minus sine theta

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:36.550
times a minus is a plus R sine
theta in the J delta theta.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.810
And I do this dot
product, so I get

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:46.715
the I times the I's, and the
J terms times the J terms.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.510
And it all works out nicely.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.090
Sine squared plus cosine
squared-- you get 1.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:19.390
And you find out that the torque
doesn't care about the angle.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.839
And does that make sense?

00:39:20.839 --> 00:39:21.755
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:25.434 --> 00:39:26.350
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.160
I did this on purpose to give
us a little more practice using

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.330
this kinematic
grind it out method.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.870
But, for sure, the
intuitive method

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:41.390
would have yielded result
a lot faster here, right?

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.500
We would've said, let's have
a little deflection delta x.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.870
What's the virtual work, then?

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.700
Well, would have been
F1 cosine theta delta x.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.740
It would be Qx delta x.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:40:00.140
Qy delta y would be F1 delta
y sine theta, and we're done.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.660
And the rotation one-- we
would have looked at this

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.130
and said, how much-- in a
little motion delta theta-- how

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.370
much does this move?

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:15.565
It moves R delta theta
crossed with the F

00:40:15.565 --> 00:40:19.440
that it moves through, or dot
product with that distance,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.550
would have given you
F1 R delta theta equals

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.130
Q theta delta theta.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.215
So we could have
done it in a minute.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:30.840
And sometimes, doing
it the hard way

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.360
is what will get you in trouble.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.869
I didn't have the cosine
theta and sine thetas

00:40:35.869 --> 00:40:38.160
working out in this and I
couldn't take the derivative.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.540
What did I do wrong?

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.084
And I finally realized, I
made the problem too simple,

00:40:43.084 --> 00:40:46.840
simplified it too soon.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.810
So I wanted to use this
as a stepping stone

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:55.147
to something I meant to
cover perhaps weeks ago.

00:40:55.147 --> 00:40:56.605
And there's a
general little lesson

00:40:56.605 --> 00:40:59.860
that we can learn from
this, which you've probably

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.990
been taught before, but
I'm going to remind you.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.840
Here's a rigid body.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.440
Got some center of mass.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.840
And I've got a force
acting on it here,

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.880
just some arbitrary
position and angle.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.410
So that force has
a line of action,

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:25.680
and perpendicular to
that line of action

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.825
is a distance, which
I'll call d here.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.580
And we know that
in R cross F, we

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:44.290
can-- this force exerts a moment
about G that would be R cross

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:47.160
F, where R goes
from here to here,

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.830
but it's only the component
perpendicular to it.

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.060
So we know that this is
going to create a moment.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.570
And I won't draw pictures
yet here for a moment.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:00.555
This diagram is
the same as-- well,

00:42:00.555 --> 00:42:03.510
I could draw the
same peanut here.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:09.740
It's the same as the following--
a force here, that's F,

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.540
and another force at G,
that's F. Equal and opposite,

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.340
so it's like adding
0 to the problem.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:19.310
So I can do that with
impunity, and I still

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.970
have my force F down here.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.882
So this problem's
equal to that problem.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:36.260
But now, this force and this
force, equal and opposite,

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.860
cancel one another,
but create what's

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.440
called a couple-- a moment that
we can compute about my point G

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.340
here.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.110
So these two forces
create just a pure torque,

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:51.670
leaving this as a force.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.550
They're equal and
opposite, so no net force.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:56.280
But they create a torque
in this direction,

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.910
and there's a remaining
force on the center of mass.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:04.110
So this whole thing
is also, then,

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:12.220
equal to the
equivalent of a torque

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.400
around the center
of mass and a force

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.620
applied at the center of mass.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.520
And in this case, the
torque would be dF.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.750
This problem is
easier to do if you're

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:34.200
trying to compute generalized
forces than the one we started

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:39.600
with, because now, the
position vector that we need

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.035
goes only to the center of mass.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:50.890
And the general rule for
this-- you have a body,

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:59.590
you have several
forces-- F1, F2, F3.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:15.800
That's equal to the body
with G, with a F total on it,

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.700
and a moment-- a torque-- total.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:27.430
And F total-- it's a vector--
is a summation of the Fi's.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:32.890
And T, the torque
total, is the summation

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.630
of each of these guys.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.920
Here's G. This has an R1.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.490
Here is an R2.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:49.020
Here's an Ri to the ith force.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:55.380
So this is a summation
of the Ri cross Fi's.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.240
So if you sum all the forces and
compute the equivalent torque

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.555
about the center of
mass, sum all the forces

00:45:00.555 --> 00:45:03.030
and apply it at
the center of mass,

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:07.440
then this problem is
equal to that problem.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.540
So this can come in
handy when you're

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.785
trying to simplify problems.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:38.800
And for this particular problem,
let's draw our hockey puck.

00:45:46.745 --> 00:45:51.400
Going to put my force in
the simplest direction here.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.260
But there's my force.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:46:00.520
This problem is equal,
doing the same thing here.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.925
It's the same thing as if I
had drew forces like this.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.060
And that gives me an
equivalent problem,

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:22.420
where I have-- this couple
here produces a torque,

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:28.200
and there is a net force
acting on the center of mass.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.980
So this problem is equal
to this problem now.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.410
A torque and a force both
acting at the center of mass,

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:43.250
and the torque is RF1 in the k.

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:50.530
And the force is just F1 in
the positive I direction.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:58.500
And R-- but now, what
is the little R vector?

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.650
If we're going to do
this the kinematic way?

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:08.210
From here to G, this
is R1, I'll call it.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:09.470
And that's it.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:13.700
I only-- now I have
everything acting here.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:26.740
And Qx delta x is F1
dot derivative of R

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.610
with respect to x delta x.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.375
But what is R?

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.610
It's XI plus YJ.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:49.310
The derivative of R1 with
respect to x is just 1

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:52.940
in the I, and the derivative
of R with respect to Y

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:58.460
is just J. So this becomes
a trivial calculation.

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:07.060
F1I dot I-- I get Qx
equals F1 delta x.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:15.910
Then I get Qy is F1, which is
in the I direction dot J is 0.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:19.600
And I get Q theta-- ah, Q theta.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.270
Now, do I use this expression?

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:27.100
So, I'm not dealing with little
changes in distance anymore.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.400
When you can put rotation--
when you put moments

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.500
about the centers of
mass, it's just easier.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.790
This one-- you call
intuitive, but this is just

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:38.960
going to be the
sum delta theta is

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:46.070
equal to the total
torques acting

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:53.070
at the center of
mass dot delta theta.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:56.110
And in this case, the torque
is in the k direction,

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.210
delta theta's in
the k direction,

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:12.910
and this is RF1k dot k delta
theta, which just gives us

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:16.740
RF1 equals Q theta.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:20.252
So the torque equations you
can derive straight out.

00:49:20.252 --> 00:49:21.710
You don't have to
take derivatives.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.140
It doesn't have anything to
do with change in position.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.554
It's just a little
rotation, delta theta.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.920
So it simplifies this problem
and, actually, totally avoids

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.180
the conundrum I got into.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.060
If I work everything
about the center of mass

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.010
of that rigid body,
the R gets easier,

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.580
the derivatives get
easier, and the torque

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.050
becomes obvious how it applies.

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:21.330
We'll talk about-- I
have a pendulum in kind

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.060
of a weird shape.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:34.400
But the pendulum has the
following properties.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.760
So that weird shape--
that may be this.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:45.100
It's got one plane of
symmetry like this does.

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:49.650
And I'm going to put--
what did I do with my axle?

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:53.780
I'm going to put the axis
of rotation perpendicular

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:57.510
to that plane of symmetry,
somewhere not at G,

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:01.280
not at the center of mass--
so, just what I've done here.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:07.790
I can make any object that
has a plane of symmetry--

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:13.940
if I have it rotate
about an axis that's

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.030
perpendicular to that
plane of symmetry,

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:19.440
it becomes a simple pendulum.

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:27.210
And you can write down
with my inspection

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:28.930
what the equation of motion is.

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:33.720
So, how many degrees of
freedom does this system have?

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.870
So first of all, then,
is it planar motion?

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:45.760
So it has, at most,
3, and how many--

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.900
and it has a pin through
it that doesn't allow it

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.590
to move in x or y.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:51.945
How many constraints is that?

00:51:51.945 --> 00:51:52.599
AUDIENCE: 2.

00:51:52.599 --> 00:51:53.140
PROFESSOR: 2.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.240
So how many you got left?

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:55.740
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:56.281
PROFESSOR: 1.

00:51:56.281 --> 00:51:59.580
So this is a single
degree of freedom problem,

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:04.070
and I've chosen to have
it move about an axis that

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:08.450
is-- is this axis a
principal axis of this body?

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.390
Absolutely.

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:13.330
And so, if I ask you, what's the
mass moment of inertia of this?

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:18.217
If I gave you Izz about G for
this thing, and this distance,

00:52:18.217 --> 00:52:19.800
what would you tell
me the mass moment

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.380
of inertia about the pivot is?

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.925
I'll give you this.

00:52:34.534 --> 00:52:35.450
What's the rest of it?

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.155
Not a G. You've got
some distance here,

00:52:41.155 --> 00:52:46.860
which you're given--
L, we'll call it.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:47.390
Correct.

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:50.060
So, parallel axis--
remember, ML squared.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:55.350
So we know that that's true, and
the G is over here someplace,

00:52:55.350 --> 00:53:00.120
and this is this distance L. And
what's the equation of motion

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:00.990
for this?

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:03.860
And gravity acts.

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.660
No damping for now.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:08.204
What's the equation of motion?

00:53:08.204 --> 00:53:09.370
Right off the top your head.

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:10.602
You've done enough of these.

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:16.960
I'll give you one
minute think about it.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.690
We'll figure out the equation
of motion for this problem.

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:32.205
I highly recommend you
don't do the Lagrange.

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:37.170
Somebody give me their
equation of motion.

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:58.210
So, what method would
you choose to use?

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:01.440
Simplest one you could think of.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.130
Direct?

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:03.576
About what point?

00:55:03.576 --> 00:55:04.390
AUDIENCE: Around A.

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:05.848
PROFESSOR: About
A. And what do you

00:55:05.848 --> 00:55:09.940
say is-- what
equation do you apply?

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:11.487
General equation.

00:55:11.487 --> 00:55:16.927
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] It's
just AIzz [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:16.927 --> 00:55:19.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that would
be part of the answer.

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:21.468
And the equation-- remember,
I wrote a list of them-- 1, 2,

00:55:21.468 --> 00:55:22.770
3 over there.

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:23.860
Which one do you use?

00:55:27.077 --> 00:55:28.660
AUDIENCE: You just
use the second one.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:30.250
PROFESSOR: Just a
second one, right.

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:33.086
And do the nuisance
terms go away?

00:55:33.086 --> 00:55:34.410
Point A's not moving.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:37.010
So some of the torque
is equal to dHdt,

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:38.890
and it's H with
respect to A, right?

00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.670
So that's H, right?

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:12.880
d by dt Izz with respect
to A theta double dot k

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.650
equals the sum of
the external torques.

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:18.320
And the rest of the problem is
finding the external torques.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.130
What's the free body
diagram look like?

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:39.400
So, here's the object, possibly
A and Rx, and an Ry, and an Mg.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.650
Those are your possible--
that will set your free body

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.280
diagram, right?

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.530
So here's the Mg down.

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:51.800
What's the torque that
gravitational force

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.570
puts on this object
with respect to point A?

00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.500
R cross F, right?

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.582
R cross F into the board.

00:57:05.582 --> 00:57:06.790
Is that positive or negative?

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:11.510
And what's the link to this R?

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:19.520
Well, from here to here
is, I guess-- oh, that

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.395
is L. So the length of this
side and that triangle?

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:28.820
L sine theta?

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.890
L sine theta cross Mg.

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:36.260
And it is positive or
negative-- what did we decide?

00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:42.790
Looks like it's-- this is
positive theta xy system.

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:51.180
It gets negative minus MgL
sine theta, and we're done.

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:59.780
So, generically-- and this
is also in the k direction,

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.200
so we can drop the k's now.

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:08.680
We have our equation of motion
Izz theta double dot plus MgL

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.530
sine theta.

00:58:15.843 --> 00:58:24.520
Is there any then single degree
of freedom pendulum made out

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:30.320
of a rigid body, and
rotating about an axis

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:35.161
that is a principal axis that
has that equation of motion?

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.400
Any of them, no
matter what the shape.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.090
If you can rotate it
about a principal axis,

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.790
and not through G,
because if you put--

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:53.680
what's the natural frequency
if you run the axis through G?

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.516
What's the torque?

00:58:55.516 --> 00:58:56.015
0.

00:58:56.015 --> 00:58:58.999
Nothing happens, right?

00:58:58.999 --> 00:59:00.290
It doesn't want to do anything.

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:03.980
But as soon as it's not through
G, then the things oscillates.

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:06.860
And that's because this is
now a differential equation.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:11.320
And I need to say
this equals 0 here.

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.340
There's no other forces.

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.548
If you've got a damping
force, then it would show up.

00:59:14.548 --> 00:59:18.060
But this is a generic,
undamped equation

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:22.250
of motion for any single
degree of freedom pendulum

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:27.400
rotating about one of
its principal axes.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.980
And if the body
you're shown or given

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:33.280
has a single plane
of symmetry, then you

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.010
can figure out one
way, immediately,

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:38.790
that you know this will--
that equation applies.

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:42.540
An axis perpendicular to that
plane of symmetry is a pendulum

00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:45.210
and it is that equation.

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:50.970
And the i respect to A you can
get from simple parallel axis,

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:54.960
if you're told what i
with respect to G is.

01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:00.720
Questions?

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:16.670
I'm going to put up two
additional problems.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.659
And I'm not going to solve them.

01:00:18.659 --> 01:00:19.950
We're going to talk about them.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.366
You're going to tell me how
you would go about doing them.

01:00:22.366 --> 01:00:24.930
And they wouldn't be
bad problems for you

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:25.980
to practice on.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:40.200
And you've actually seen
both of them before.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:51.935
So, the first one-- pulley
rotating about that fixed axis.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.895
And this is that thing
we call Atwood's Machine.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.075
How did I draw my coordinates?

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:21.250
So I have my Izz about G.
It's sum M3 kappa squared.

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.790
You're given the radius of
gyration of this pulley.

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:27.090
So that's its mass moment
of inertia about the center.

01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:34.755
And you know R. You
could specify a theta.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:48.500
And we have a pair of masses--
start off like this, M1, M2.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.440
And this, now-- so I've
going to say, no slip.

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:59.390
And this rope goes over the
pulley, no slip, initially

01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:00.425
stationary.

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:02.580
I let go.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.310
I want an equation of
motion for this system.

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:07.490
So how many is
it-- first of all,

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.800
is it a planar motion problem?

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.530
OK.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:12.500
How many rigid bodies?

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.980
How many potential
degrees of freedom?

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:18.750
AUDIENCE: None.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:20.360
PROFESSOR: None.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.810
How many do you
think they really

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:23.270
are going to end up with here?

01:02:27.982 --> 01:02:29.590
How many do you expect to find?

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:34.330
How many necessary
coordinates are you

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:36.870
going to need to completely
describe the motion?

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.220
I see some 1's going up.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.660
Everybody believe that?

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.040
Lots of constraints.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.870
We're not going to
let this-- we're

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:46.895
constraining this to
move in-- only allowing

01:02:46.895 --> 01:02:48.000
it to move up and down.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.060
These can't rotate, so
there's one for each.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:57.870
These can't go in this
direction, so two more.

01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:00.990
This can only rotate,
no translations.

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:03.660
So you end up with 1.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:05.800
And finally, there's
this no slip condition,

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.015
which means that
R theta equals x,

01:03:11.015 --> 01:03:14.650
and that's one final one that
you'd need to write down.

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:17.780
So if you had that,
gotten this far--

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.550
find the equation of motion.

01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.110
What method would you use?

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:31.335
So, your choices are here--
direct method, Lagrange.

01:03:31.335 --> 01:03:31.960
Think about it.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.479
How would you-- what's
the easiest way for you to

01:03:34.479 --> 01:03:35.145
do this problem?

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.110
Maybe an ancillary question
is, how many ways can you

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:48.110
think of that you
could do this problem?

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.340
How many different
approaches could you use?

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:22.585
So, how many ways can you think
of doing this problem, Kristen?

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.010
I'm just picking on her, but--

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:30.093
AUDIENCE: I'm not Kristen.

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:34.410
PROFESSOR: Give me
an answer anyway.

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:34.951
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:04:38.258 --> 01:04:40.522
I think you could do two,
but I would choose Lagrange.

01:04:40.522 --> 01:04:42.480
PROFESSOR: You would want
to do it by Lagrange.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.625
Helen, how else could you do it?

01:04:44.625 --> 01:04:48.270
If you did it by Lagrange,
got the answer, and said,

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:50.635
I want to check it,
what would you do next?

01:04:50.635 --> 01:04:52.610
AUDIENCE: The direct method.

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:53.360
PROFESSOR: Direct.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.990
But where would do apply?

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:57.220
Would you use torques?

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.710
Would you use forces?

01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:00.170
How would you go
about doing this?

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:03.800
AUDIENCE: I would use torques
about the center of the pulley.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.300
PROFESSOR: Torques
about the center.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.120
We did that.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.620
I mean, I worked
that-- I actually

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.830
did this problem by that
method earlier in the term.

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.980
Torques about A.
Let's have the pivot.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:14.730
Works fine.

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:17.950
Actually, it's pretty efficient.

01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:22.380
So, Lagrange or torques
about A. You only

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.260
need-- there's one
degree of freedom, right?

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.920
How many equations do you need
to write to do this problem?

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.420
Just one.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:32.870
So the sum of the torques about
A will give you the answer.

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:36.330
Lagrange equation will
give you the answer.

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:40.425
That's a good problem
to practice on.

01:05:40.425 --> 01:05:46.815
Another problem--
this is not very big.

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:51.420
It's basically this problem.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.891
This is just-- you've seen this.

01:05:52.891 --> 01:05:55.390
I'm sure you've been shown this
in physics and stuff before.

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:59.170
This is the falling
stick problem.

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:02.620
You can't set this up
without having some friction.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.150
So there's definitely
friction on the table.

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:07.930
But until it hits,
it's doing some things.

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.020
And so, there's two
problems that you

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.170
could set up and try to do.

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:19.070
One is the problem with no
friction-- frictionless table.

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:22.940
And then, you could
allow friction.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.990
Tricky thing about
allowing friction

01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:28.130
is-- you think there's
a normal force.

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:30.920
So let's say our usual friction
model is-- the friction force

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.940
is mu times the normal force.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.687
Does the normal force change
with time in this problem?

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.000
So, standing up, what's
the normal force?

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:51.060
Mg, right?

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:54.010
And the sum of the forces
in the vertical direction

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:58.700
is mass times acceleration
in the vertical direction.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.870
And what are the-- if
you draw a free body

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.495
diagram of this problem--
so let's draw it now.

01:07:03.495 --> 01:07:08.070
Here's my-- if there's
no friction force,

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:09.445
I still-- without
friction force,

01:07:09.445 --> 01:07:12.260
I still have a normal
force, and I still

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.350
have Mg pulling down here.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:19.180
So the sum of the
forces in the y

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:26.160
certainly have a
minus Mg plus N equals

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:31.440
the mass times the acceleration
in the y direction.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:44.020
And if you solve for N,
do you-- then the issue--

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:47.110
my question is, does
this remain constant?

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:51.930
Depends on whether or not
ay remains constant, right?

01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:55.310
Do you think the acceleration
in the y direction of this thing

01:07:55.310 --> 01:08:00.670
will change as it goes
more and more horizontal?

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:02.970
There's some nods, up and
down, and left and rights.

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:04.178
I think it's going to change.

01:08:04.178 --> 01:08:07.840
For sure, you can't assume
that it won't change.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.530
So you have to
assume it'll change.

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:11.820
And that means N-- this
normal force becomes

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:15.400
a function of time, which
makes certain ways of doing

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.410
this problem a little harder.

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:22.080
So how many ways?

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:38.310
Let's say the friction-- let's
do a, no friction, and b,

01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:39.729
with friction.

01:08:39.729 --> 01:08:44.630
No friction-- first of all,
is it a planar motion problem?

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:47.029
Yeah, we can do that.

01:08:47.029 --> 01:08:48.729
So, at most three
degrees of freedom.

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:51.939
How many does this one have?

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:53.229
Work this one out.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.970
Figure out how many degrees
of freedom this problem has.

01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.712
How many separate equations
do you need to come up with?

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.600
So, you decide what
your-- let's say

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.120
we're going to use Lagrange.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.200
What would your
generalized coordinates

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.425
be to do this problem?

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.930
So, problem a-- no friction.

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:26.914
How many generalized
coordinates?

01:10:26.914 --> 01:10:28.080
How many degrees of freedom?

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.955
How many generalized
coordinates do you need?

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:34.275
I heard a three.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.388
I hear one.

01:10:38.388 --> 01:10:39.730
Somebody give me two.

01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:41.340
I got a two.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.250
All right.

01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:45.560
Obviously a good question.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.040
So, at most there can
be three, because we've

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.090
agreed that it's planar motion.

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:51.830
Does this problem
have any constraints?

01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:56.230
Where?

01:10:59.513 --> 01:11:03.130
AUDIENCE: The bottom of
the line can't move the y.

01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:06.080
PROFESSOR: So it can't
move in the y direction.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.860
So if any part of a body
can't move in-- translate,

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.840
then there's no translation
in that direction,

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.660
pure translation of the
body in that direction.

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.290
So there's a
constraint in the y,

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:23.550
if we draw a
coordinate system here.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.440
Constraint in the y.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.040
True.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.260
So we're down to two.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.877
Are there any other constraints?

01:11:34.877 --> 01:11:38.162
AUDIENCE: I would say that,
yes, because the upper line--

01:11:38.162 --> 01:11:40.370
PROFESSOR: No, no, it's not
leaning against the wall.

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:42.585
This is just a skip.

01:11:42.585 --> 01:11:43.450
This is the problem.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:52.890
So it definitely can't
move through the table.

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:54.500
So it's constrained in y.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.215
We've got that so now that
leaves us, at most, two.

01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:02.070
Are there any other constraints?

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:09.500
How many say no?

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.169
How many say yes?

01:12:11.169 --> 01:12:13.210
If you say yes, you've
got to tell me what it is,

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:14.740
but I don't see any others.

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.910
So we're left with two.

01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:19.370
We need two coordinates.

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:20.500
What might we pick here?

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:28.500
What would you pick?

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.620
You're now confronted
with this problem.

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.036
Do you have
rotational-- if you're

01:12:32.036 --> 01:12:34.660
going to use Lagrange do you
have rotational kinetic energy

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.500
in this problem?

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.509
You're probably going
to need an angle.

01:12:39.509 --> 01:12:40.550
What else would you need?

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:44.454
So we're going to need
an angle for sure.

01:12:44.454 --> 01:12:44.995
Say it again?

01:12:44.995 --> 01:12:47.120
AUDIENCE: The height
of the center of mass.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.150
PROFESSOR: You're going
to need the height

01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:49.165
of the center of mass.

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:51.540
Yeah, you're going to need a
potential energy expression,

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:55.590
but we've decided
that y is constrained.

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:58.410
So you can't have
a theta and a y.

01:12:58.410 --> 01:12:59.642
Let's make this our theta.

01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:06.470
What else is there?

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.970
AUDIENCE: x.

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:07.750
PROFESSOR: x.

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:09.480
You're going to need an x.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.320
So our generalized
coordinates are

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:16.740
going to be an x and a theta.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.370
But you do need to be able to
write down a potential energy

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:22.220
expression, and it
involves motion in the y.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.220
So what do you do?

01:13:26.771 --> 01:13:27.270
Right.

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:29.670
So what's the
height of this thing

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:37.755
is-- above the ground-- is sum
L over 2 cosine theta equals y.

01:13:37.755 --> 01:13:38.880
Something like that, right?

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.260
And I might have a-- depending
on whether you make--

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.630
I haven't thought this through.

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:45.180
Whether or not it's xy
this way or xy that way,

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:47.490
theta might be plus or minus.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:50.760
This could be-- there
might be a sine in there.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:56.690
But basically, this is--
theta and y are constrained.

01:13:56.690 --> 01:13:58.554
If you know one,
you know the other.

01:13:58.554 --> 01:14:00.720
So you do your potential
energy expression this way.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.130
Now we've gotten that far.

01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:09.650
We know we need two coordinates.

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.200
We're going to use x and theta.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.750
But now you have to
decide what method to use.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:18.380
Direct method using one
of these, or Lagrange?

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.750
What would you do?

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:21.833
How would you go about it?

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:22.340
It's a quiz.

01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:26.580
You got 20 minutes
to finish, and you

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:30.153
want to do this in the
safest, quickest possible way.

01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:36.270
What would you try?

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:39.640
And this is the realistic
situation, right?

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.680
Next Tuesday.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.251
What do you trust
yourself to do the most?

01:14:44.251 --> 01:14:46.542
It's probably what you ought
to do in a quiz situation.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.800
Anne, how many ways can
you think of doing this?

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.657
How many ways could
you do this, Rob?

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:56.240
AUDIENCE: Two.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.010
PROFESSOR: Two.

01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:58.120
Any way.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.070
Direct, indirect,
what would you use?

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:02.210
Where would you
choose to-- you're

01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:04.570
going to need a torque
equation to do this problem,

01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:05.484
if you use direct.

01:15:05.484 --> 01:15:07.150
Where would you take
your torques about?

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:13.784
Think about that.

01:15:13.784 --> 01:15:15.950
For this problem, if you're
doing the direct method,

01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:17.390
where are you going to
compute the torques?

01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:18.170
About what point?

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.700
So you can do it
about that-- you

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:30.630
could call this point A here.

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:32.950
And what equation
would you-- now

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.790
you've got to use that
equation that's got

01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:37.250
the problematic
terms in it, right?

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:38.380
But it's all right.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.060
You can punch those
through and do it.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.490
That will work.

01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:43.692
And if you use Lagrange?

01:15:43.692 --> 01:15:45.150
You've got to be
able to figure out

01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:47.630
the potential and kinetic
energy, and so forth.

01:15:56.710 --> 01:16:01.109
So could all of you
do this by Lagrange?

01:16:01.109 --> 01:16:02.650
This is a good one
to go practice on.

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:03.661
It's not that hard.

01:16:03.661 --> 01:16:04.160
Do it.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.860
It's a good practice problem.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.100
Now add friction.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.070
So, the b problem.

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:13.105
It now has friction.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:26.334
Can you-- I don't think--
is Lagrange a good choice

01:16:26.334 --> 01:16:27.292
if it now has friction?

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:37.620
I think it's got a problem, and
I'd be careful using Lagrange

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.540
if it had friction.

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:42.550
Not that-- Lagrange
is perfectly--

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:43.860
it is certainly valid.

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.430
It's just hard.

01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:47.255
Why is it hard?

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.870
Well, yeah, it might
be hard to find.

01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:57.610
What do you need
to know to-- so,

01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:00.850
are there any external
non-conservative forces

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.550
in the problem with friction?

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:03.480
AUDIENCE: Friction.

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.010
PROFESSOR: Friction.

01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:09.169
You're going to have to
figure out the friction force.

01:17:09.169 --> 01:17:10.710
And to figure out
the friction force,

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:14.900
you're going to have
to apply direct method.

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.410
No other way.

01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:19.050
You are going to have to
apply some direct method to do

01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:22.530
this problem, no matter what.

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:26.750
So you can't just
say-- Lagrange is not

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:29.060
going to bail you
out and not have

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:32.400
to solve some of
the F equals ma,

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.920
and torque, and
those sort of things

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.820
to figure out what friction is.

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:41.620
So there are problems that
Lagrange-- isn't all as simple

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.300
as we sometimes
make it out to be.

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.050
All right, I've run a
couple minutes over.

01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:46.570
Thank you.

01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:48.820
We'll see you in
class on Tuesday.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.030
We'll do some more review.
