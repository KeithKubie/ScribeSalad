00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.184
- [Voiceover] Let's now
dig a little bit deeper

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:06.180
into the Lorentz Transformation.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.759
In particular, let's
put some numbers here,

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:09.570
so that we're, we get a little bit more

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.503
familiar manipulating and

00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:12.883
then we'll start to get a
little bit more intuition

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:15.263
on how this transformation
or sometimes it's

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:19.355
spoken of in the plural,
the transformations behave.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.965
So let's pick the scenario in
which our friend passes us by,

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:24.729
and this is the same scenario
that we've been doing

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:26.993
in previous videos, with
a relative velocity,

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:30.698
from my frame of reference,
at half the speed of light.

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:33.623
So the magnitude of her velocity
is half the speed of light.

00:00:33.623 --> 00:00:37.698
She is moving in the
positive x direction and

00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:42.040
our space-time diagrams,
they coincide at the origin.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.942
And so let's pick an event in space-time.

00:00:44.942 --> 00:00:47.252
And so let's say in my coordinate system,

00:00:47.252 --> 00:00:50.422
in my frame of reference,
this event that we focused on

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:53.252
in the last video, let's say that is at

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:56.398
x is equal to one meter...

00:00:56.398 --> 00:00:58.616
Let's use the same color...

00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:01.920
X is equal to one meter and let's say

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.855
that time or ct is also
equal to one meter.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:08.573
And like we said in, I think
it was several videos ago,

00:01:08.573 --> 00:01:10.211
we could do this as a light meter,

00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:12.637
the time it takes for
light to go one meter.

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:15.213
So we will also say this is one meter.

00:01:15.213 --> 00:01:17.606
So in my coordinate system,
in my frame of reference,

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:21.053
this would be the point one comma one.

00:01:21.053 --> 00:01:26.053
One meter in the x direction,
one meter in the ct direction.

00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:29.051
Now, based on that, think about what

00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:31.467
would be the prime coordinates.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:33.869
What would be the coordinates
in her frame of reference?

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.012
And I encourage you to pause the video,

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:39.731
evaluate the Lorentz Factor using v and c,

00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:44.027
and then evaluate what x
prime and ct prime would be.

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:46.756
All right, I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:48.230
Now let's work through this together.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.912
So first let's figure out
what the Lorentz Factor...

00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:52.153
Actually, let's first figure
out what beta would be.

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:53.871
That will simplify everything.

00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:57.772
So, beta, we'll do it in the blue color,

00:01:57.772 --> 00:02:02.569
beta in this case is going to
be equal to zero point five c.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.724
That's her relative velocity
in my frame of reference.

00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:09.615
The ratio between that
and the speed of light,

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:13.864
so that's just going to be
equal to zero point five.

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:15.763
You could just view beta as

00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:16.953
what fraction of the speed of light

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:21.770
is that person traveling
in my frame of reference

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.112
since we're using that as kind of the

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:27.271
non-primed frame of reference.

00:02:27.568 --> 00:02:30.634
And so let's now think about
what gamma is going to be,

00:02:30.634 --> 00:02:31.795
the Lorentz Factor.

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:34.849
The Lorentz Factor is going to be...

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.441
We'll do it in that reddish
color not the magenta...

00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.704
it is going to be, so gamma is going to be

00:02:40.704 --> 00:02:45.638
one over the square root
of one minus beta squared.

00:02:46.508 --> 00:02:50.626
Beta squared is, zero point five squared

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:54.828
is going to be zero point two five.

00:02:54.828 --> 00:02:56.876
Actually let me just write
zero point five squared

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.640
just so you can see what I'm doing.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.333
So this is zero point five squared

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:03.819
and if we were to evaluate that...

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.079
Let's see this is going to be
one minus zero point two five.

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.972
So that's going to be point seven five.

00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:14.917
This is going to be equal
to one over the square root

00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:19.242
of point seven five,
one over the square root

00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:22.028
of zero point seven five.

00:03:22.028 --> 00:03:23.247
Let me get my calculator out.

00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:24.628
We can at least approximate it.

00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:28.819
So point seven five, let's
take the square root.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.278
And I'll just take the reciprocal
of that, so approximately

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:35.529
one point one five.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.510
So our Lorentz Factor is
approximately one point one five.

00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:45.415
And now using that we can figure what

00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:47.927
x prime and ct prime are going to be.

00:03:50.418 --> 00:03:54.602
X prime is going to be
equal to my Lorentz Factor

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:57.307
which is approximately one point one five.

00:03:57.307 --> 00:03:59.942
So maybe I'll write it as approximately

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:02.763
going to be equal to one,
we'll do that same color,

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:06.908
it's going to be one point,
I'm having trouble switching

00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:10.849
colors today, one point one five.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.463
One point one five times, now we're saying

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:20.463
x is one meter, so x is
one meter minus beta,

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:26.477
beta is zero point five,
so zero point five.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:30.193
And ct we're also saying is one meter,

00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:32.567
so times one.

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:37.913
And then t prime or I should say ct prime,

00:04:37.913 --> 00:04:42.603
ct prime is going to be
approximately the Lorentz Factor

00:04:42.603 --> 00:04:45.981
one point one, I always have
trouble switching colors

00:04:45.981 --> 00:04:48.535
for the Lorentz Factor,
it's going to be approximate

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:50.802
to one point one five times...

00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:53.772
Well, ct is one.

00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:55.327
I think you see a little
bit of symmetry here.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:56.874
This one in particular because

00:04:56.874 --> 00:05:00.004
it had the same x and ct coordinates.

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:03.725
So one minus beta, one minus beta,

00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:10.749
so zero point five times
x, which is once again one.

00:05:11.508 --> 00:05:13.172
So times one.

00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:16.434
So in this particular
case, it simplifies to half

00:05:16.434 --> 00:05:20.393
of the Lorentz Factor because
this one minus zero point five

00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:23.469
times one that's just going
to be zero point five.

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.849
And same thing over here, zero point five.

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.626
So these things are going
to be approximately equal to

00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:33.410
zero point five times the Lorentz Factor.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.827
We already had the Lorentz
Factor in my calculator,

00:05:34.827 --> 00:05:39.215
so let me just multiply
by zero point five.

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:43.347
And I get, it's approximately
point five, I'll just say

00:05:43.347 --> 00:05:45.083
point five eight.

00:05:46.623 --> 00:05:51.623
So, zero point five eight,
zero point five eight.

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.787
And once again the units are in meters.

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:57.318
So even though this is one meter and

00:05:57.318 --> 00:06:02.156
one meter, this over here x
prime is zero point five eight,

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:05.882
zero point five eight meters and

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:10.807
ct prime is also zero
point five eight meters.

00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:15.860
So this is also equal to
zero point five eight meters.

00:06:16.353 --> 00:06:19.650
So one way to think about
it, if right when our two,

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.506
right as she was passing
me at x equals zero,

00:06:22.506 --> 00:06:25.037
time equals zero in my frame of reference,

00:06:25.037 --> 00:06:28.025
If I were to shoot my lazer gun or

00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:30.497
I were to turn my flashlight on and

00:06:30.497 --> 00:06:33.938
that very first photon starts traveling

00:06:33.938 --> 00:06:36.852
and so I could think about
it's path through space-time,

00:06:36.852 --> 00:06:40.013
it would look, that very first photon

00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:43.328
would look something like that.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.544
When I think that a, when
I think that that photon

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:53.793
has traveled one meter in
the positive x direction

00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:57.079
and one light meter of time has passed,

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:59.585
from my friend's frame of reference,

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:01.305
she would say, "No, no, no, no."

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:04.067
At exactly that moment,
let's say it hits an asteroid

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:06.005
at that moment, it lights up an asteroid.

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:07.867
She would say, "No, no, no, no, no."

00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:10.673
That happened zero point
five eight light meters

00:07:10.673 --> 00:07:12.635
after she passed me up.

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:15.770
And it happened zero
point five eight meters

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.953
in the positive x direction.

00:07:17.953 --> 00:07:21.075
So something very, very,
very interesting is going on.

00:07:21.075 --> 00:07:23.954
And I encourage you to think
about what's actually going on

00:07:23.954 --> 00:07:27.576
with these different parts of
the Lorentz Transformations.

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:29.654
The most interesting is
what's going on, well,

00:07:29.654 --> 00:07:30.687
actually it's all interesting.

00:07:30.687 --> 00:07:32.099
In fact, the symmetry's interesting.

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:34.816
But the Lorentz Factor, think
about what's happening here.

00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:37.497
Think about what's happening
here for low velocities when

00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:40.195
v is a very, very, very small fraction

00:07:40.195 --> 00:07:41.530
of the speed of light.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.513
Well then beta is going to
be pretty close to zero,

00:07:44.513 --> 00:07:45.667
and then the Lorentz Factor

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:48.767
is going to be pretty close to one.

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:49.747
And think about what happens when

00:07:49.747 --> 00:07:52.347
v approaches the speed of light.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.216
Well then this thing just booms.

00:07:54.216 --> 00:07:57.374
This thing gets larger and
larger and larger as we see

00:07:57.374 --> 00:08:01.007
this denominator getting
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:08:01.007 --> 00:08:03.817
If v were actually equal
to the speed of light,

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.882
well then you're going
to be dividing by zeros.

00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:09.068
Well, you know, that's when

00:08:09.068 --> 00:08:10.961
all sorts of silliness starts to happen.

00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:13.562
So I really encourage you to
try out different numbers.

00:08:13.562 --> 00:08:16.635
We tried very high relative velocity,

00:08:16.635 --> 00:08:17.657
half the speed of light,

00:08:17.657 --> 00:08:19.972
incredibly, incredibly high velocity.

00:08:19.972 --> 00:08:21.876
Try it out for something more mundane

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:24.592
like the speed of a bullet
or something like that.

00:08:24.592 --> 00:08:26.415
But definitely get very
familiar with this.

00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:28.098
And also manipulate it algebraically.

00:08:28.098 --> 00:08:29.654
In fact, maybe in the next
video I'll manipulate this

00:08:29.654 --> 00:08:31.917
a little bit algebraically
so that you can reconcile

00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:33.811
the way I've written the
Lorentz Transformation or

00:08:33.811 --> 00:08:36.131
the Lorentz Transformations
with the way that

00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:39.365
you might see it in your
textbook or other resources.
