Speaker 2:          00:05:23       What is a couch for in their world other than to throw too many fucking pillows on it. See, can't even fucking sit down. And the second year it's like they know the second year fucking Goddamn assets. The couch and your head's on the pillow and you grabbed the remote to watch a little college football. What happened?

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:05:43       Hi.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       sorry. I am in a mood. I'm actually happy married guy. I don't even know why I'm doing this. I'm just trying to make you guys laugh. All right. Cause I bet in those relationship. All right, my wife's coolest shit though. You know, the other night I was hanging out, right? Smoking a Sega, uh Oh no, I wasn't supposed to hang out. I ended up just fucking partner called me up and we ended up hanging out and she's like, you know, she sent me the usual texts and I was like, I'm down the comedy store, I'm smoking a cigar. Some buddies of mine, we did a spot, uh, sorry. And she goes, she goes, now hang out with your friends, have a good time. And I texted her back. Best wife ever. Right? You can't complain if your wife does that once a fucking year you, you got a gym, you know, and my wife consistently does that unless, you know, at two three, you know, the next night when I went out again, that took a little four day vacation is what I did here as I stayed on my diet. By the way, I had a couple of little missteps here or there, but generally speaking, I've been drinking a little fucking smoothie here. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       I don't know what I'm doing. I've got to add some cardio, but you don't accept that I got this fucking Shit beat out of me by some God damn bugs. I don't even know where they always go after my left foot, you know? I'm like the fucking Daniel Day Lewis, a bug bites my left foot. They just go after it right now it is on fire.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       You know, I literally have to put like some that oxy 10 on it and then I got to put a sock on it like so I won't scratch it. Like, you know, when you put a fucking the Goddamn I, someone said chandelier a fucking lamp shade over dogs fucking, you know, so you can't turn around by itself. The problem is that's why should I just stick a fucking one of those lampshades on my uh, on my ankle. But the problem is I'm a God damn human being made in the image of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. So I have the ability to figure out how to take off said lamp shade and start scratching the fuck out of my ankle. It was so bad the other night actually woke me up like nothing could touch it. It was on fucking fire and a dude. These are next level. These are next level global warming. Fucking mosquitoes. All right. If you've got a pair of jeans on or Dungarees as they used to be called, they'll bite right through them. They don't give a shit, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       I wish I could be some assassin fucking mosquitoes. Right. And rather than just bite and regular old fucking people and given a malaria and that shit, like I could just blue,

Speaker 6:          00:08:35       cool.

Speaker 2:          00:08:35       Fucking just go find one of those Bilderberg meetings. I just find who the fuck is in front of all his goddamn madness.

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       Sorry guys. I don't know. This is why I don't watch the fucking news. Um, yeah, just go on a 100 million fucking miles an hour into the brick wall and all these fucking rich people think that somehow they're going to have a parachute. And I guess what the rest of us are all going to die. Is that what it is? Oh, Bill, come on. It's a holiday. All right. All right, let's talk football here. Let's talk football. BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp um, how about those red sox lost of the white sox last night, eight to nothing for the first time. We're actually kind of playing like 500 ball and I think it's a great thing. I don't want to go to the fucking playoffs. Not knowing what losing feels like. Like, wait, what's this? Are the wheels coming off? I wanted to more be like, oh yeah, this, we got out of this.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       All right. Sales still on the disabled list as far as I know. And I don't know if price is a pitch since he got hit by that comebacker liner off his wrist. X Rays were negative, were dealing further fucking studies. So a, we shall see. We'll see what's gonna happen. Um, last day. So, um, the Astros, the team to beat the defending world series champions getting zero respect out there in Houston. You know, you would think that the baseball team was as fat as the average person in Houston. And, and don't even fucking wrinkle your Goddamn snout up at me. If you fucking live in Houston, you guys went back to back. You had a goddamn dynasty of being fucking, uh, nominated or winning the fattest city in the United States of America. All right. And this is the fattest fucking country evidently. Okay. You are, you are a fat person's fatty Houston.

Speaker 5:          00:10:40       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:10:41       Down there. Fucking barbecue and everything aren't, you know, do you know I was just actually was actually just in Houston, there is not a p a juice joint and that entire city lettuce is illegal. This is, this is a US city.

Speaker 5:          00:11:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Now, are you wondering why they had that Biblical flood down there? Maybe God was like this. This is a level of slough that I have never seen. See, that's why there's never a flood out here in Hollywood, okay? Because we are so righteous.

Speaker 5:          00:11:23       We are so living day to day

Speaker 2:          00:11:30       in his image, in his word. I want you all right now. I want you to close your eyes. I want you to close your eyes right now and just know that Jesus, he wants you to live in Hollywood. He wants you to go there. He wants you to do some coke. He wants you to get a girlfriend, tried to fuck her friend and try to get both of them to fuck you at the same time. He wants that. I'm sorry, that was my Joel Olsteen. That's why he didn't open the Goddamn doors when that, when that flood fucking came in, just like, I don't have enough fucking, what am I fucking Jesus going to keep pulling out fucking barbecued fish for these people. I, I don't. I simply do not have enough wafers to sustain this. That's going to be a riot. They can, they're gonna rip up my blue carpet.

Speaker 5:          00:12:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:17       Um, he was content to let those fatties just float right by the arena. Right. Well, you know what I would've done? I would've put some fucking moorings. Is that what you call those things? You get dock a boat too. I would have thrown some rope out there. And you said those fatties fucking, you know, now they're like a bunch of dinghies until the water came down. I mean, what was Joel Olsteen supposed to do?

Speaker 5:          00:12:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       Joel Osteen's in shape. He lives in Houston. You know why that is? It's America. I, Hey, I saw the image of a skinny Joe Olsteen and my pop tart the other day when I was in downtown Houston. You ever take two pop tarts or heat them up and you stick a glaze down in, in the middle of it? Cause she don't, you know, live in Houston. He lay in a bath, this laugh, um, I to drink smoothies more before I do a podcast. I have incredible energy and a new level of disrespect for a lot of things. Dude, my fucking foot, my fucking foot is driving me nuts. And then I got, I got a bug bite on the back of my arm and then I got another one on my lower back, like just to the right of where a tramp stamp would be. Did I ever tell you guys I was dumb enough to get one of those in the nineties? I did. I got a Boston Bruins stamp. Tramp do, you know, and I said Real men wear black and I had that right above my ass and I had to, I had to work so hard.

Speaker 2:          00:14:00       I'm sorry, in stand up to finally be able to afford enough money to begin my laser treatments to remove it. I know a lot of you probably always wondered why I never wear a half shirt on stage. Well that is why.

Speaker 5:          00:14:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:19       I mean, I guess my big fault is that I'm a hockey fan. Okay. There I said it. Um, did you guys watch any college football yesterday? How about college football? Just taking over this weekend. The way the NFL does towards the end of the year, the NFL is give a fuck that you got Christmas shopping to do. They don't care that you got you're Jewish and you got to buy. Fuck was an eight gifts. Nine gifts for each fucking person, right? Is that candle fucking goes candle number one. What do you got? Well, how do you do what? Jewish people? D a d. A. D a build the build up the gifts. That's why you gotta do it, right? You gotta start with the weakest thing you got right. What do you guy got a pair of socks,

Speaker 7:          00:15:05       you know,

Speaker 2:          00:15:07       and you just gradually build the whole outfit up.

Speaker 7:          00:15:13       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:15:14       To show up and for Kwanzaa, right to the NFL does not give a fuck. Come the end of the year. They like, we own all the weekends. We're taking all the fucking money.

Speaker 7:          00:15:26       All right.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       We're showing games on Saturday that we thought were going to matter, but don't, we're kicking off the NFL season this Thursday. This Thursday. The NFL season is back. Ladies and gentlemen, NFL football is back.

Speaker 7:          00:15:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       And for the next 17 fucking weeks

Speaker 7:          00:15:51       with the bye week

Speaker 2:          00:15:53       I ever fucking long the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the fucking season is now the regular season.

Speaker 7:          00:15:59       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       I like to think that this country can set aside all of the issues that are weighing us down and we can lose ourselves in the bread and circus that is professional football. And when does it start bill all? What? Put it up. Put it on. It starts Thursday night, Thursday night with yellow defending super bowl champions. The Philadelphia Eagles. Did you ever think you'd ever hear that in your fucking life? People of Philadelphia? You know you didn't.

Speaker 7:          00:16:38       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       Don't even act like you did. Right? Where the fuck am I? You guys are playing the dirty birds down there and fucking Atlanta. It's, it's, it's the battle of the birds this Thursday night. This is the only Thursday game worth watching for the entire fucking season. You might not have asked because this is the only one with a fucking teams didn't play four days earlier and they're all banged up. Yes. The Eagles who will be wearing green on green. Yes. The Falcons will be wearing, I don't know, black and red on black and red. It's a home game for the eagles. They're probably going to bring the, the, the, the, the championship flag up there. And can you imagine how many people in the city of Philadelphia are not going to be able to time their alcohol intake to when the flag is going to be raised and they'll be in that little jail in the Eagle's stadium looking out, you know? Well, the police laugh at them. The local cops as they play iron maiden's Ryman, the ancient mariner,

Speaker 7:          00:17:43       right.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       Some are combined Ryman, the ancient Mariner with the of Monte Cristo. I'm on, he's looking out the fucking his jail cell and he could see the ocean. You could see how free, you know, see the boats going by and he was just sitting in there. Um, and then later he got a Gig on sesame street. Anyways, it starts with the eagles and the falcons. Now I got you. If you're asking yourself, will this be a hangover game? Are The eagles still celebrating?

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       Who am I? Patriots playing? Tom Brady coming up, one of his great games as a pro against the eagles. A lot of people forget that [inaudible] taught, taught the fucking ball. He threw for over 500 yards in a Superbowl and lost. Okay, now let's the patriots go to the Superbowl again this year. You tell me when the fuck that's ever going to happen again.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       Everybody talking about Joe Dimaggio, Oh, oh 56 game hitting streak, whatever. Anybody can fucking do. That 56 game hitting streak is, is uh, is pretty, God dammit. Impressive. You know, to the point, they literally were writing songs, Jolt Tin, Joe Dimaggio, whatever they were doing, right? President was paying attention than anybody write a fucking song with Tom Brady threw for 500 fucking yards and a goddamn super Superbowl. People have thrown for half that much, smoked a cigar and paraded around with them. He threw enough yards to win to fucking trophies in one game and the man lost. So everybody's sitting around going, how it can Tom keep doing it? He's fucking old and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. And I'm sitting over here with no more hair left on top of my head. The pullout going, the problem is not Tommy. I would say it's our defense. That's what I teach. I would say that that was the fucking problem.

Speaker 2:          00:19:58       That was such a fucking weird game. Um, I would love to go back and watch it at some point and just try to figure out how there was only fucking two plants are three pumps. The whole fucking game. The weirdest Goddamn game I've ever seen in my life. Um, it's like both on offenses showed up to play and the e in the fucking defense was just like this. This is a Superbowl. I just can't get comfortable. Um, what else we could, we got the bangles or the bangles is, uh, is Paul verse. He calls them the bangles, calls them the girl group there and he calls the girl group the bangles. Okay. But Paul Versey, he marches to the beat of his own drummer is playing the cult. Andrew Luck. And I'm gonna tell you something right now. I'm tasting right now by an Andrew Look. All right. If you're fucking sitting there right in life, keeps kicking you in the Dick and you're landed face down in the dust, you know, and you just don't want to get up anymore. Watch Andrew Luck. Take a fucking hit. It does give a fuck. Gets up. He congratulates the gay. Great job man. I'll probably be filling that in my early fifties. Congratulations. See on the next play. I love that guy. This is me actually saying something popped positive about the Indianapolis Colts. As much as I hate him or say,

Speaker 2:          00:21:13       all right, Andrew luck the way he conducts himself out there with such fucking class. I see. It actually actually transcends the fact that he takes a paycheck from that corrupt piece of shit that Flim flam the boss hog or the fucking NFL. Um, anyways, the bills are playing the ravens. This is what I got to be asking my, if I'm a buffalo bills fan and I got my face in a plate full of fucking wings over at anchor bar or fucking Duffy's, whatever the fuck you supposed to go. I got to be asking myself, is this the year where the bills for the finally return to their AFC championship winning glory? Do the bills finally get back to their peak going to a Superbowl?

Speaker 5:          00:22:09       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       Sorry. You know, I'm going to get people in the AFC east. A lot of shit. The Buccaneers and the saints, uh, drew breeze, by the way. Not a lot of people realize this guy. He's second all time. I think he's strong for more yards than Tom Brady and nobody pays attention to him. Who's, who's kidding, who? He's not dreamy. Like Tom Brady. He's not as tall as Tom Brady. You know, supermodels are not knocking on his door. He is a regular Joe. He's a family man, you know, and he's down there and [inaudible] a fucking city that the devil is even scared to go to. And he has gone. He's been able to maintain the, the, the fucking values that he was, he was brought up. And I would say that is actually more impressive to me than actually the amount of yards he's thrown in his career were taken collars.

Speaker 5:          00:23:02       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       Patriots are playing the Texans. Right. And that fucking saint quarterbacks coming back, I already forgot everybody's names. Was that kid from Louisville. So Clemson animal, the fuck he's from. But um, I know he's amazing and JJ watts is back. So this should be an early test for these delinquent patriots. The 40 niners verse, the Vikings, I don't even know what's going on over there. Okay. Is Kaepernick still kneeling on the ground? Kapnik doesn't have a Gig. The Vikings, the vikings who are at their peak right now.

Speaker 5:          00:23:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:23:41       Doing what they do. Come in, fucking it up. Waiting to the next season. And they are on the rope. Can they finally, can they finally turn the fucking corner? What else? What else is going on? The giants are looking good. They got that maniac running back from fucking Penn state. They're playing the Jaguars, the browns, they got that fucking dude from Oklahoma, right? Or that the other, the guy on TV said was undrafted bl and he went on his fucking show with an undrafted will short. They got this kid, little bit of swagger, the Cleveland browns playing the Steelers right out of the gate. Jesus Christ. Those two cities don't even get a chance to put their fucking feets up. I cannot fucking wait. I am taping all of these games. And your Los Angeles Rams versus the Oakland, soon to be last Vegas Raiders. I mean, how great a fucking game is that going to be? That's the game right there. That's the game of the week right there. Rams first Raiders. As far as I'm concerned. That's the one I want to see. Oh, the 49 is have, what's his face? Seattle's a Richard Sherman. They got him coming back from the, the, the fucking dreaded Achilles tendon injury. See what he can do for the 40 niners you know what I mean? Um, all right. There you go. So good luck to all you guys unless you're playing the patriots. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:25:13       and now let's talk college football. How great was it? College football? You know, they were smart enough to not have all those cupcake games the beginning of the year. I mean, when I was growing up, like September was a joke. You get your football cad from your bookie and what would they be saying? It'd be just like Nebraska would be favored by 59 against like Kent State and you'd take Kenn state and then like they would be up like, like fucking 35 to nothing at the half. And you're like tea they would cover.

Speaker 5:          00:25:42       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:43       Um, anyways, I watched my Lsu, my adopted Lsu Tigers against the Miami hurricanes and a good friend of mine is a huge Miami hurricane fan to the point that I actually root for the Miami hurricanes because I'm friends with him. Not that I was ever a hurricane fan, I wasn't. So he was playing my adopted Lsu Tigers. His team was playing my team. So I texted him before the game. I said the Miami tropical depression, you know, like when they think it's going to be a hurricane and then they downgraded to a tropical storm. Well, the downgrade of tropical storm is tropical depression, I believe, according to the weather that I looked up. So he's like, fuck you man. So we bought him a better rounded drinks, some cigar. I can't even fucking remember. And I gotta tell you right now, I thought, you know, Lsu the entire time I've been a fan of these guys since like 2008 when I moved out here, 2007, 2008. So 2007 when I came out to La and I actually had time to watch college football.

Speaker 8:          00:26:46       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:26:47       And I'd like less Meyers and how he would go for it on fourth down and trick plays and all that shit. And you know, and I just, I wasn't going to just jump on the Alabama bandwagon. Isn't it amazing that they're still at the peak 10 years later?

Speaker 8:          00:27:01       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:27:02       There's still the team to beat. Uh, so I was like, I'm going to go with these guys. So I've been watching them for 10 years and for 10 years we have not had a fucking quarterback. They were doing that awful thing, like that old school college football thing where it was just like, this is a running down put in the black quarterback. This is oh passing down, put in the white quarterback. They were doing that shit in the two thousands. Right.

Speaker 8:          00:27:25       Um, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       And then I think there they're all time rushing leader was their quarterback, you know, which is not a good stat. They've had these beats at defense. They actually had Odell Beckham at one point. My buddy was saying like, what a fucking waste. They had nobody to throw it to throw it to them. Um, so I'm watching the game yesterday. This kid Joe Burrow I guess transferred some from some other college. Um, I was losing my mind watching this guy. This guy's a fucking quarterback, you know, people getting in his face, giving them shit. He's giving them shit back. He's fucking, he's reading the blitz, you know, he's, he was doing all this type of shit and I was all excited. And then I was just like, this guy has got to have like 250 yards. He only had a hundred, 144. That's how much the QB position is suffered.

Speaker 2:          00:28:19       While I've been watching these guys, uh, that I was excited that there was a guy in the middle of the third quarter. I had 144 yards passing. Um, and their new coach, I hope I say his name right. Uh, ed or Darren or Jerome, I don't even know how to say his name, but all I know is he's, he's got that by you fucking accent and he, he sounds like fucking Hulk Hogan. He sounds like he's doing a wrestling promo. I was waiting for me. Let me tell you something brother. Um, I'll try and get you a clip of him and he flips out and screams and yells at the players add, uh, that reminds me of what a football coach was when I was a kid. Uh, Lsu for the most part just handled 25th ranked. Lsu just handled eighth ranked Miami, tropical depression, Miami hurricanes.

Speaker 2:          00:29:06       And uh, but in typical Lsu fashion, they still scared me towards the end when all of a sudden l a Miami started coming back and then it was just like, it was 33 to 17 with six minutes left and Miami stopped him again. I'm like, they are two drives in to two point conversions. Touchdown. Two point convergence away from tying this fucking game. Only Lsu could make me this nervous after being up like 33 to 10 or some shit like that. Um, but they held on they want and all of that. So I am excited. Uh, I know it's the first week of the season before all you negative concept there are going to be fucking, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:29:46       you know, a little baby. My baby was all over overrated

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       much. You know, like that's some sort of like that people just hate people being excited.

Speaker 7:          00:29:56       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:56       Oh, well what are you happy about? Something? How can I fucking shit all over this?

The rest of that read my head was actually, I've already made the Burger patties. Okay. Now next thing I'm going to do in my cup to the tomatoes, the lettuce have all the pickles have everything ready to fucking go. And this year, for the first time ever, I am going to do a practice burger just to make sure my temperature is right, to know how long.

Speaker 2:          00:39:17       So for all the people who want it, medium rare, medium, well, well done, all of that fucking shit. I made my patty small this year. I made him Finn. All right. Better than Mcdonald's or old school Mcdonald's. Not Quite. Wendy's. All right. Right in the fucking wheel house. Cause I used to work, I used to work in a uh, this place called the sable cafe in um, and Cary, North Carolina. I worked there, I swear to God, 31 years ago. I worked there for nine months and unfortunately the restaurant was gradually going out of business. I was a busboy and then I became the bus boy and dishwasher. And then at one point I swear to God I was the grill chef, the bus boy and the dishwasher. As I took on these extra jobs, they would give me like a 50 cent raise and I was so bad with math, it never dawned on me like, hey, minimal wage is 350 an hour and, and, and the dishwasher was getting paid 350 an hour and I was getting paid three 50 an hour. So you paying two people $7 an hour to do these two jobs and now I'm doing both jobs. That other person doesn't have a job and I'm only making $4 an hour.

Speaker 8:          00:40:31       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:40:31       Then I became the grill chefs and I think I was making four 75 an hour or five bucks an hour to do three fucking jobs. And I would be out there and, uh, I would be, I was glassed in on a mesquite grill with the chef hat and underneath my apron I had the bow tie fucking, um, busboy outfit. It was literally like, you know, when Peter Brady had two dates in one night, right. And, um, I fucking wood duck down when I saw a table almost done eating. And I would run out there, busted table, run back, throw out the dishes in the dishwasher and then run, fuck it back out without washing my hands. It's just food. But you still, you know, I'm just handling your food and then I would continue fucking cooking.

Speaker 8:          00:41:17       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       And that, that's when I learned that little trick. You know, where you, you know, I learned it this way. You put you, if you put your, uh, you just touch your thumb to your index finger and then touch the fleshy part of your, uh, of your hand that connects to your thumb and you press on that, that's rare. Then you just move it to your middle finger. That's like medium rare than the ring fingers. Well, and then the fucking pinkies well done. Now that's fucking works. Provided you do the in, and I'll put it all depends on how thick the patty is, an how high your fucking heaters. So you gotta balance all of that out so you can use that because that actually fucking works unless you heats up too high and your meats too thick and then you think it's well done and all you did was chatty the outside and inside, it's a fucking Friday the 13th.

Speaker 2:          00:42:11       So I'm going to do that and have myself a tasty fucking burger before anybody even arrived. I'm going to have my timer. I'm going to adjust my fucking heat and I'm going to, I'm going to be ready full fucking Freddy. You know what I mean? That's, that's my deal here. Okay. That's how I'm doing it and I'm going simple this year. Burgers and dogs. Fuck you, but you don't like it. Get the fuck out this country. I'm not smoking anything. I'm not fucking, I'm not doing any of this bullshit. Burgers and dogs. We got potato chips. We have the standard fucking condiments, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, onions, mustard. All right, now fucking Asian infused fucking this or Italian influenced that. Oh, Billy ballgame. I'm going the fucking, I'm going old school.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       We got cheese. What kind of cheese you want? You want the white or the yellow? We don't have any margin.

The all things comedy festival is um, is uh, is coming back to Phoenix. It's coming back to Phoenix in October. Hey, and by the way, and I will be there doing a live podcast. This is a pre fucking promo. Okay. I don't have any dates. Shit. I'm just letting you know. Keep your October open. It's October 20 something I believe. Um, anyways, Shit's probably already on sale. I don't even know. Speaking of other things that I need to promote, I did a movie last year called the front row.

Speaker 2:          00:45:45       All right. And um, the trailer starring Hugh Jackman, the trailer who's already getting Oscar Oscar buzz, he's getting Oscar buzz old freckles. All right. And I actually made the trailer, um, you realize how much I'm moving up in the world that I'm actually in the movie trailer. Now, I'm not saying that if you drop a piece of popcorn, you look down and kick it under the seat in front of you that you won't miss me in the trailer. I'm just saying that I am in it for a second with one of the best actors of today. Who is getting Oscar Buzz Repeat Oscar buzz. Um, this weekend I'm going to be in, um, some casino north of, uh, the hell's in Sacramento. And then the next day on going to the Toronto Film Festival for the Premiere of the Front runner starring Hugh Jackman who's getting Oscar buzz.

Speaker 2:          00:46:50       Okay. And then, um, in the movies directed by the Great Jason Raymond, by the way, if you want to fucking win an Oscar, okay. It's starting to become work with all freckles here. All right? We had to Oscar winners last year, two or three from, fromF is for family. Fucking Sam Rockwell wanted, Alison Janney won it. I think Laura dern guy like a golden globe. I don't watch award shows. Okay. I don't have time. I'm busy focusing on things that don't matter like sports. Um, and now we'll look what happens. I have about seven lines in this movie and all of a sudden, not coincidentally, Hugh Jackman is now nominated or when I was getting Oscar buzz I should say. Okay, and why is that? Because he's unbelievably talented because he puts the work in because he's a pro. Maybe, maybe, but I think more so is that he had half a scene with me.

Speaker 2:          00:48:05       I think that's what it is. See, once I go in the scene and they see what I look like and where my acting is deck at, right? I'm going to set hack and act at the same time. Then whatever you're doing as the other actor is just going to be so fucking elevated, then all of a sudden you're, you know, you're going to be in the running. Okay. And that's what I bring to Hollywood. All right, put your box everybody and the all things comedy festival or by the way, congratulations to Jason Reitman and Hugh Jackman for getting all this great and everybody else sits in the fucking movie, you know, forgetting all this awesome reviews, which is a very hard thing to do this day in age with all the cans out there in the Internet. It's really difficult to try to get some sort of positive feedback.

Speaker 2:          00:48:53       Um, and I'm, I'm, I'm just happy just to be a small part of it. You know what I mean? I'm like, Bill Walton when he joined the Celtics. Okay, my feet are fucked up. I'm just happy, you know, every once in awhile throw it to me and I'll get a couple of points. The crowd would go nuts because I am on the scoring sheet that that's, that's where I'm at. Butcher your box pork at the all things comedy festival. Hey Bill, huge fan. Just writing into, thank you for the butcher block. Block plug. I'll listen to this. This dude tried the pork shop that I've been raving about. The heritage bread. Fucking pork. Okay. You talk about the pork chops, you talked about the port trucks and how great they were. So I had to get my hands on them. My wife, who is an amazing cook, seasoned these chops so well I have to share it with you.

Speaker 2:          00:49:35       She put extra virgin olive oil on them and salt and pepper. Then let them rest for like 45 minutes. Look at that. I mean that's about as standard of rub as you could possibly get. That's all you have to do. About a half a teaspoon per chop. Then she just cooked them in the oven for like 25 minutes. You said the over cook them in the over for like 20 to 25 minutes. I'm assuming that meant of it bill. It was the best goddamn pork chop I ever had. I fucking told you. He goes, when you get a cheat day, uh, try that recipe. Uh, thanks again. Can't wait to see you in Phoenix in October. So I guess the, the tickets are already on sale. Um, yeah guys, I'm telling you, man, who fucking knew that there was a pure bred fucking pig out there, which bloodlines can be traced back to the original white people, the Oh gee whities over there in Europe. Um, I'm telling you, I did mind differently. I took out a black skillet and, uh, I got that heat going, right? And I, I, I forgot what I, I, I don't even know what I put on the fucking thing. I probably didn't know. And me German, Irish guy that I am, I seared both sides and then I finished it in the oven and then I brought it out and I did a, like a rosemary, uh, butter bath. Ugh.

Speaker 2:          00:51:01       I mean, I didn't even need a fucking side who's every bite I took? I was just punching the fucking table. It was, it's, it's that fucking good. All right. If you're a kind of war there, you gotta get the fucking heritage bread, pork. They're not even paying me for this. This is how fucking good at is all right. Urban mayor, although that's a real slick way to get some fucking a advertising in for free. Be Somebody that fucking writes in with their own experience. Uh, urban Myer or Mayer. How would spelled is that John Mayer? But it's urban Meyer. Is it John Meyer? Hey, Billy Beluga whale. What are your thoughts about urban Meyer and the Osu scandal? Do you think he should have been fired? Uh, you know, I stopped falling that he gets fired over that. What the fuck was this? Is this jerseys again? Urban mayor fired reason let we go.

Speaker 2:          00:51:55       Bump, bump, bump bomb. Boto why is urban Meyer, uh, he suspended. It doesn't say, oh, he's not fired. He suspended. He's gonna say Jason Law head would have been fucking tweeting all in capitals at the whole fucking world. Maybe he was. Why is urban Meyer's suspended? Here's the short and the long answer. I'll state suspended urban Meyer, uh, for the first three games of Ohio state's 2018 season. Who the fuck did he play in fuckhead you? Is that this is the non suspension suspension. He's misses the Buckeye season opener against Oregon state. A likely blow out win for weeks two and three against Rutgers. Another likely blow out when and Tcu a tougher game and a trip to Texas tec use kind of fell off while we happened to tacy. You come up from, um, mayor can coach during the week before sitting out the game itself off offensive coordinator.

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       Ryan Day is acting head coach while Meijer is out. Yeah. And he has a headset on the whole game. Ci. Who the fuck you think he's talking to? Uh, the short reason for the head coaches suspension, uh, school commission investigation decided he mishandled domestic abuse allegations against his former receiver's coach Zach Smith. Oh, this is a little more serious, but they didn't think, is it bill? Is it a little more serious than fucking players selling their own jerseys? But they didn't think mayors conduct was egregious enough to merit firing. One of the most successful coaches in college history. Subtext a was only one broad. All right, we got a national championship with this guy. A below is the longer reason. A recap to the details smiths. Now ex wife Courtney Smith has repeatedly accused him of domestic violence going back to 2009. So how does this fall on on urban Meyer?

Speaker 2:          00:53:44       He supposed to be a fucking cop. Two, 2009 Zach Smith, then a staffer on Meyer at Florida, went to a party at Meyer's house. Smith came home with a woman, coworker who had been drinking and planned to have her stay on Smith's couch according to investigation. All right. It sounds like a standard party. They said Courtney Smith strenuously objected and drove the woman to her home that began a disagreement. Courtney's called nine one one and alleged that Zack picked her up and threw her against the wall. Police arrested Zach for Acra aggravated battery and later dropped the charge. Meyer says Zack and Courtney met with them at his Florida office and told him Zach's arrest was based on false information. Courtney gave to the police. Yeah. In other words, she told the fucking truth and then when they fucking sobered up or calm down, they were like, this could cost us a lot of money.

Speaker 2:          00:54:39       Don't do it again and we'll say that I lied. Courtney denies that she attended that meeting. And Zach also recalled a to Osu as investigators that she wasn't there. Okay. So he sounds like he's lying, uh, to the investigative team. Courtney Smith denied recanted her allegations. She has never walked back any allegations in public interviews either. All right. No charges were ultimately filed against Zach for the 2009 incident. Um, yeah cause they were working for a big university when Meyer, well, how does this go on urban Meyer? Mayor Meyer hired him at Ohio state in 2011 a university background check didn't turn up and arrest my, I didn't tell anyone else at Ohio state about it because he told investment charges weren't filed and he didn't think Zach had actually committed any domestic violence between October and November, 2050. And, and what's the show that he even saw this shit? Um, in October and November, 2015 police twice went to court on the home to investigate abuse allegations against Zach to this one is deals with, it's like, well, you just fucking break up already. Um, that year Courtney texted with Mayor's wife Shelly about Zach. Shelly expressed sympathy and fear for Courtney and in our own message. And Courtney has said, Shelley told her, she informed the head coach about Courtney's allegations. Yeah, but she could have been lying. You know, both mayor

Speaker 2:          00:56:09       Meyer maintain to Osu investigators that Shelly never did inform urban about the text messages. But Meyer has acknowledged both in a public statement, early August and two investigators that he did know of an allegation in 2015

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       I don't

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       understand it. So what? So he knows about it. So call the fucking cops like I don't understand like why this is on the football fucking program. They are, they are not the cops. They are not judges. They are not juries. This whole fucking thing now where like the judge and the jury and all of that shit is now on social media and all of this shit. It's fucking, I don't, I don't get this. It's like if he fucking did something, call the cops. The cops go there, they fucking arrest him and he fucking goes to jail. I don't understand how the cops go there. I recanted it. No, you didn't. All right, we dropped the fucking charges, but then the cops dropped the charges, but then the school is supposed to go. No, but you're still fucking guilty.

Speaker 7:          00:57:18       I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:57:22       I mean, unless he was there and saw him doing that shit, what the fuck is he supposed to do? This is why you have cops. This is why the cops don't coach a football team. Um, I dunno. I have no idea. I don't, I don't get that. I get that. Um, if the university fired that guy,

Speaker 7:          00:57:43       you know, I don't get why urban

Speaker 2:          00:57:48       mayor Meyer, why that guy gets dragged into this shit. I mean, if he was beating the shit out of her at, at a fucking football practice, and I guess urban was there going, hey, settle down, settle down. Nothing to see here. And I guess he implicated himself. Bye Bye.

Speaker 7:          00:58:08       That, I mean, I don't, you know, I mean

Speaker 2:          00:58:13       the t visa, these are fucking adults here. That guy knows he's not supposed to be beaten up his fucking wife. He's an adult, so he should pay the fucking price. I don't get why this guy has to now. You know what I mean? When some gold digging whore, fucking, uh, you know, take some guy's house. Uh, does she go to jail? Does she lose her job? Does her friend that knew she was a gold digging hoard is she then lose her fucking position in the fucking world? I, I don't get it. It's just, it's just, it's just like, it's a fucking one side of the street here.

Speaker 2:          00:58:44       If a guy does something to a woman that he shouldn't be doing, not only is he going to get punished now everybody around them is going to get fucking punished. But if a woman does something, do a guy, eh, it's all right. Everything's fucking fine. It's fucking bullshit. That's what I say. I think it's fucking bullshit. If they are doing this on both sides of the fucking fence, if you could sum up, prove that this guy actually fucking knew this shit. Granted, I'm just going off for one website here. All right. From what I read on the Internet, which doesn't mean shit. Now, what do you guys ask me these fucking questions? All right. Dancing. Hey Bill. I'm a 16 year old kid from Minnesota, Minnesota, and I'm starting my junior year in high school week. I'm not a loser and I'm not the coolest kid either. I'm right. Yeah. Here you go. You're in the middle. That's where I was. I feel like I'm being held back by my inability to dance.

Speaker 2:          00:59:30       What do you go to fame? High School. It's not that I don't have rhythm. I play three instruments. My Band leader told me to dance like I was playing an instruments. The problem is I never know what to do with my hands and I can't exactly be playing air sacks at dances this year. I really don't care that much. It's just that I know I can dance, but I haven't figured out moves yet all. Then start dancing there, buddy. Go on the fucking Internet. I'll go on the Internet right now. Find your fucking video and then practice by yourself and do it in the mirror like the chicks do, right? All right. You Tube, you tube. You can dance to. All right. Search.

Speaker 5:          01:00:11       Yeah.

Put a little stank on your face and Eh, you know, pump up fucking couple drinks and yourself, not on a, you're under age. Uh, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. Just do it. Learn how to, how did you learn how to get good at saxophone?

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       Did you sit there going, you know, I know I can play saxophone, but you never did it. Just go out and do it. You'll be fine. All right. Solo, fucking POW. Dear bill, this old house, I'm a home owner like yourself and like yourself. I looked into solar power. Hey too. Not from nothing. I want to be a candy or do you have you paid off your house? Cause if you haven't paid off your house, you're not a homeowner. All right. What you own is the debt on the house. Okay. I hate when people go, oh you, you ran home. I am now. You're dumb. You don't know. You don't own it until they give it to you that they'd fucking goddamn piece of paper. Sorry. And like yourself. I looked into solar power bill. When I tell you I spent over 200 hours reading up on solar and talking to different installers.

Speaker 2:          01:02:09       I'm telling you the truth. I had zero luck finding anything that made sense. Yeah, I think there's a lot of taxes and shit. There's a lot of oil and coal kind of jockeying against shit. Um, the more research I did, the more discouraged I got. I went in thinking there was no way I wouldn't come out with some type of solar panel subsidizing the energy I use. Yeah. Now they do this thing with the electric company. They used to buy back your power. Now they just claim the shit that you don't even use. Um, I hate to be cynical, but I feel like solar is useless until the technology gets better. I don't know if you've ever followed through, but I was hoping to get an update. Um, I don't think it's useless. I understand. Um, anything that is going to help us slow down fucking global warming is going to be an asset if you can't afford to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:54       I understand. Um, I have not done it yet. Um, I keep telling my wife I want to do and she's this like, this is going to be loud and it's just like, you know, I would love to do it. Um, I have some Spanish style, not are on all the whole roof. My roof is flat and then this little lip of Spanish tiles, but like a Tesla is allegedly coming out with those, those Spanish tiles that are also solar powered. Um, I mean, that fucking guy is like actually addressing what's going on. And I wish there was a way that he could fucking hire coal miners to fucking work in the solar industry so they didn't have to take away 30% of our beautiful public parks to continue using this fucking form of energy that is fucking with the planet. That, but for some reason you're not allowed to bring it up if you do. You're crying snowflake.

Speaker 5:          01:03:46       MMM,

Speaker 2:          01:03:49       I dunno. It's, it's

Speaker 5:          01:03:51       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:53       I have no idea. And I have not read up as nearly as much as you have a, I have, I have not even overheard as much as you've probably read on it. Um, I'll read up on it. I should do it. I would love to do it. Um, you know, but I just, every time I fucking go to do something, I'm fucking something in my house. I only tell you guys what I'm fucking dealing with right now. I don't even want to fucking fill you. What on fucking deal with that here. Have you ever heard a roof? Rats.

Speaker 5:          01:04:21       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:21       Roof rats. Uh, evidently somehow some we have a crawl space between our roof and you know, you can't stand up, but it was enough that these fucking mice got up there and I, we have an exterminator come up there. You know, God knows what they did in the walls. Thank God they didn't chew through any fucking wires. And uh, you know, so then I got to go up there and you know, get rid of the dead mice. That's my life. Okay. Sobriety. Hey Billy Bama set.

Speaker 5:          01:04:53       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04:53       I'm a 27 year old male and I just wanted to truly say thank you for helping me onto the wagon of sobriety. Forget the past few months, every as you started listening to your podcast and have heard you bitch and moan the whole time about being sober from drinking. This made me think to myself, hey, if this can, this, this can can do it. So can I. It's been a few weeks now and I've been clean from drugs and alcohol and I've never felt better. Yeah, it was fucking amazing. None living a clean, I mean at night it sucks that that's when you get squirrely, but if you just fucking pushed through it and you wake up in the morning stone sober, it's like you feel like you've compared to, you know, being hung over and shit. And I never even fucked with drugs other than alcohol, which is a drug in all fairness.

Speaker 2:          01:05:34       Um, you feel like an eight year old when you wake up. He says, I don't have friends because they're dead beat drug addict, losers. Everyday at my job I lose. I literally listened to eight hours of the podcasts a day. Um, see, see, you're learning how to take your addictive personality and Admin pointing it at shit that's more positive. Hopefully this positive is more pod positive. So in a sense, you're my only friend, so thanks for that as well. Thanks for helping me through these trying times and I really look forward to maybe seeing your set at one of your Chicago shows in November. Hey, you know, I was hanging out Friday night with a buddy of mine who's been sober for nine months and he just wanted to do it for a month, but just after a month, all this shit that you've been putting off, all of a sudden he started getting shit done. He said, I'm going to go two months and now he's just staying sober. He was saying just out of superstition that I don't want to go back to that and um, that's a great thing. So I'm going to try to go September without drinking today. I have, I have, my big cheat thing is I have a glass bottle of grape Phanta, um, that I am going to have, um, with my burger and then I'm right back on the wagon, but a pretty, but I'm going to be eating,

Speaker 7:          01:06:45       you know,

Speaker 2:          01:06:47       eating healthy the rest day. I hate that. No Jane, when people say I'm eating, I've been eating clean.

Speaker 7:          01:06:53       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:06:54       I like, I, I just, I don't like that now. You know, just clean eating and eating clean. Okay. It's like you don't even know what the fuck you're reading. I go to these farmer's markets and you have no idea where this shit came from. There's nobody down there like I've heard, like the FDA basically polices like 3% of the food. You have no idea where the fuck it came from. You have no fucking idea. You have no idea what it's been sprayed with and all of that shit. But it says organic and it gets in your fucking head. Ooh, I'm leaving fucking clean. You have no fucking idea unless you grew it yourself. Um, dilemma. Um, all right, dear Billy Brown belt, would you rather be forced to eat protein bars every meal for the rest of your life or eat one meal every four days? MMM. Can I survive? Can I survive eating one meal every four days? I don't know if you could survive doing that bad. That's a good one. No, I'd rather you want me to let me four days. I think it'd be more healthy than those protein bars. Cause you don't know what the fuck's in those things either. You mean you flip that thing over like a Django. Anyone thinks fucking overrated, GNC, all those powdered fucking chemicals like that Maca powder. Every time I put that in there and go, what the fuck is this shit?

Speaker 7:          01:08:12       You know,

Speaker 2:          01:08:14       the plant protein powder and all that at Cisco, we'll go eat a fucking plant. Um, anyways, number two, all right. Now the dilemma, um, I wouldn't want to be Billy Clif bar for the rest of my fucking life cause once every four days I could actually, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:08:36       I could actually have something that I liked, you know, chicken and dumplings, some shit like that. Something really fancy. Maybe there'll be like having a death row fucking meal every four days. Yeah, that would be tremendous. Um, as long as you, I could do that in a healthy way. Yeah, I would do that. You get used to that quick. Um, number two, you're going to die, but you can save your life if you succeed at one of two things, which do you have more confidence in doing successfully? Having one year to study and get a perfect score on the sats? Yeah. Fuck that. Or come in first place in a game of monopoly. I have one year to come in first place in a game of monopoly. How many games can I play?

Speaker 2:          01:09:25       Um, is it a monopoly tournament? My playing with a bunch of old ladies that have been playing since the fucking depression and they're going to kick my ass. All right. Having one year to study and get a perfect score on the sats. You know what, Dude, I would love to try to do that and it would take me way more than a year with the math. Um, all I know is that I took a college, uh, sat prep course and I still got, I got a three something combined. I'm not even fucking lying to you guys. Like I, that sounds like a joke, but I, I mean you, they'll give you like to be an employee just to sign the paper. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 5:          01:10:06       I know.

Speaker 2:          01:10:09       I forget what I got. I got, did I get a four, 10 or a three 90? It was bad. And I remember getting laughs at my sat score.

Speaker 5:          01:10:18       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:10:21       That's how, you know, that's how I always did. I was fucking made fun of myself and I, and I got laughs. So I actually, I remember I didn't give a shit. I never gave a shit. I always kind of, I always kind of had this feeling and I was going to do all right in life. You know, I had an overall positive outlook despite everything that I was doing. You don't have two years of a language. Yeah. Y'All is fucking stupid shit. You know what I mean? That's not a, life is not about those things. All right? I'm not saying don't try, don't fucking try to do well on the thing and all that shit. I'm not fucking saying that. Well, what are you saying, bill? I'm just saying that there's, there's a million ways to skin a cat. Okay. How the fuck did that come about? Huh? I gotta look that one up. It's more than one to skin a cat, right?

Speaker 1:          01:11:17       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:18       There's more than one way to skin a cat origin.

Speaker 1:          01:11:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:11:23       An early appearance is in way down east. Fuck Jesus Christ. Well, what, what? Okay. Etymology of the phrase, this more than one, more than one, which you know, so many times when you look these up, it's just not satisfying. MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:11:40       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       So there's actually only two ways to skin a cat while it's alive or while it's dead. Well, I mean, you could also start at the head. You could start at the back. Didn't want to say the ass. There are two ways. One, one of them is you skin a cat because you are a bad person. The other is you don't skin a cat. You are a nice, or the cat never existed. The third one, weight is both you skin a cat and at the same time you don't scan it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:12:14       Okay. This is just people writing. I find your use of boiled down in this context disturbing. You knew this would, this would bring out all the fucking animal lovers. Right? Let's see if there's any comments from the fucking Peta people, PT people, Peta, Peta people. There's more than one way to skin. A cat is not referring to the removal of flesh from our feline friends, but rather a phrase that originated from the Mississippi River region that pertains to the preparation of a catfish.

Speaker 4:          01:12:43       Oh, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:12:49       well, maybe that's what it is. I have no idea. I don't fucking know. Anyways, that's the podcast. Happy Labor Day to y'all. Happy Labor Day to you. Woo. Woo. I'm fucking check in on you this Thursday

Speaker 10:         01:13:07       day. Hey,
