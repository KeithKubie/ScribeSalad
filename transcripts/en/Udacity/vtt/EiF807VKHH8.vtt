00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.840
All right.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.200
Let's see where we are.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.490
If you were able to get the preview
view controller delegate set up.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.840
Your app probably looks
something like this.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.000
I open up the app to
an empty collection.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.820
I'm able to see my GIFs in a collection.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.970
But when I close out of
the app completely, and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.390
then I relaunch, my GIFs are gone.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.910
So we can check off Save a GIF, and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.280
we can check off View saved
GIFs in a collection.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.700
Now, I know we still need to
set up our detail view but so

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.250
we don't have to generate test GIFs
every time we relaunch the app,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.170
let's go ahead and
persist the GIFs first.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.990
In order to do that,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.460
we'll need to be sure that the GIF class
conforms to the NSCoding protocol.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.050
We'll need to save the GIFs
to the documents directory

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.320
using the NSKeyedArchiver method,
archiveRootObject.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.167
I will need to retrieve those saved
GIFs using the NSKeyedUnarchiver method,

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:53.681
unarchiveRootObject.
