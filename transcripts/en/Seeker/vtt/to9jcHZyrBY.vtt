00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.019
LAURA LING: These trucks,
filled with 14 tons

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.510
of perfectly good food,
would have normally gone

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.880
straight to the dump.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.840
But this time, they didn't.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.770
KOMAL AHMAD: We partnered with
Super Bowl 50 and the NFL.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.787
We recovered 14 tons of food.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:17.370
And to put that in
perspective, that's

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.260
four 16-foot refrigerated trucks
filled to their absolute brim

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.940
with high quality food that fed
over 23,000 people in just two

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.530
days.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.180
LAURA LING: At
just 22 years old,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.520
Komal Ahmad set out
to create an app

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.940
called Copia, which connects
businesses with excess food

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.374
to communities in need.

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:38.790
KOMAL AHMAD: Just
as easily as you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.469
can use your phone to swipe
right or request an Uber,

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.260
you could use that same
piece of technology

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.140
and know for 100% fact
that that food is actually

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.960
going to be consumed by
people who are in need.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.660
Copia operates in the
San Francisco Bay Area.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.210
Businesses sign up with
the app, and within minutes

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.810
of a request, Copia will be
there to take perishable food

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.070
to people in need.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.850
It can range from stadiums,
arenas, grocery stores,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.010
catering companies, anyone with
surplus, large volume of food.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.880
Will pick it up.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.685
We will provide
data and analytics

00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:12.751
on how to reduce that
waste in the future.

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:14.250
And we will also
directly connect it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.920
to the nonprofits that are in
need at that day at that time

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.410
and can use that exact
quantity of food.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.060
LAURA LING: Copia's
drivers, called food heroes,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.920
transport and
distribute the food

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.020
to nonprofits around the city.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.790
On any given day, how much food
would you say you're saving?

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.070
And how many people
are benefiting?

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.530
KOMAL AHMAD: On a weekly
basis, we are feeding well

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.990
over 10,000 people a week.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.290
LAURA LING: So there's brown
rice, broccoli, spare ribs,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.150
mushrooms, romaine salad.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.950
There is a lot of food here.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.840
And this is just
from one company.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.680
It's crazy to think that
this all might have gone

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.020
into the trash, been dumped.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.510
But not today,
because this is going

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.690
to be delivered to about
three different organizations

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.590
to people who are hungry, who
could really benefit from it.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.900
Copia is just one
of countless groups

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.860
trying to eliminate food waste.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.370
But technology could be
the much needed component

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.590
to accelerate the movement.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.830
It is astounding to me knowing
that over 133 billion pounds

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.170
of food goes to
waste every year.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.390
Do you think hunger
can be eliminated?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.830
KOMAL AHMAD: Absolutely.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.810
Hunger in America is definitely
not an issue of scarcity.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.580
It's an issue of logistics.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.800
We waste three
times as much food

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.390
as there are mouths to feed.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.820
LAURA LING: Copia charges
businesses a small fee

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.770
per pound of donated food.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.220
In turn, companies can claim
a tax deductible right off.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.040
Komal hopes that this will be
an incentive for more companies

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.570
to get involved.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.060
Copia is a for profit entity.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.550
Why did you decide to structure
it that way, as opposed

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.690
to a nonprofit?

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.060
KOMAL AHMAD: We decided to
be for profit for scale.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.930
We want to solve this problem.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.650
And we think it's a
better use of resources.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.630
Instead of just trying
to do it small scale

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.020
in specific communities, we've
received over 60,000 requests

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.590
for global expansion.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.320
So from senior
government officials

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.312
in Germany and Austria who
say, we want this technology,

00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:15.770
we want to help
you expand, to help

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.470
redistribute food
and other resources

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.970
to the Syrian migrants.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.220
And that's just one
really exciting case.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.105
LAURA LING: How has technology
been a game changer?

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:25.480
LAURA LING: I
think by and large,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.820
for the first time
in human history,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.910
we can solve some of the
world's largest problems.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.450
And with technology, it's better
and faster than ever before.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.280
We're moving perishable
food, and we're

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.070
trying to move it as quickly
and as safely as possible.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.870
So that's where
technology really helps

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.377
to connect the moving pieces.

00:03:44.377 --> 00:03:46.210
LAURA LING: On another
episode of "Seeker--"

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.300
INTERVIEWER: Not that
long ago, environmentalism

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.490
was a fairly bipartisan issue.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.010
But all that changed.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.410
And it might be because
of this guy and this guy.
