00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.750
- Hi, I'm Jason.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.040
Welcome to Lubbock, Texas.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.830
Let me give you a tour
of my shop.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.500
I've got a treadle hammer
that's foot-powered,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.000
like that, see?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.210
<i>Also have
a spring helve power hammer</i>

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.830
that I spent
the last month building.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.670
This will be its maiden voyage.
I hope it goes.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.000
Come on in.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.620

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.210
Inside my shop, I've got
my main knife-making tools--

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.170
belt grinder, drill press,
heat-treat oven,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.710
and a band saw.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.750
- Today we're gonna do
something a little different.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.540
We're gonna do a mini segment
called "Fire It Up"

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.960
with your host, Spicy Mike.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.540
Today we're gonna make a sauce

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.920
that resembles exactly
what I tasted in round one.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.210
So we're gonna use habañeros
as our spice,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.880
and we're gonna use bananas to
make Will's fiery nanner sauce.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.830
So we're gonna go--at least try
to shoot for a 50/50 mix

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.420
of habañeros and bananas.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.710
So now that we have our
ingredients in the blender,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.170
it's gonna take a liquid to
kind of pull it all together,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.210
so we're gonna add a little bit
of apple cider vinegar.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.710
So now we're gonna puree it.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.750
[blender whirring]

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.120
- I've been in Texas
my whole life.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.080
My family's been here
since the 1850s,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.960
and so I try to incorporate
Texas history

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.420
into my knife work.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.330
One of the things I like to do
in my knife work

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
is use historical
Texas materials.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.920
For example, I've got some wood

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.250
that came from the grounds
of the Texas capitol.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.460
I've got a wrought-iron
wagon-wheel rim

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.580
that belonged
to my great-great-grandfather

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.250
who lived in Spicewood, Texas.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.920
And I've got a piece of
railroad rail

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.080
that's made of wrought iron.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.380
This is from the first railroad

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.830
that ever went into Dallas
in 1872.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.620
My knife making is really
about taking materials,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.880
whether it's a historical story
or just a bar of metal,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.710
<i>and making something tangible
out of it.</i>

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.580
<i>That's what drives me
in this work.</i>

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.080
So that's the basic shop tour.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.960
I'm glad to have you along
with me this week.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.000
- All right, so just to tie
everything together

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.670
just a little bit better,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.290
because both habañeros
and bananas are a little sweet,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.290
we're gonna add
just a little bit of honey.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.620
Don't want to get crazy with it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.330
because they're both
already sweet,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.580
but honey does add a little bit
of extra flavor to it.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.620
Now, you can eat it right now
if you want to.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.210
It's totally ready to eat.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.620
But if you want to put it
in a jar, leave the lid loose,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.120
and set it in a warm area--

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.290
not very sunny,
just kind of in a warm area--

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.170
and let it ferment
for about five to six days,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.250
it'll taste a whole lot better.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.250
This Will's fiery nanner sauce.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.330
Cheers, Will.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.670

That's really good.
