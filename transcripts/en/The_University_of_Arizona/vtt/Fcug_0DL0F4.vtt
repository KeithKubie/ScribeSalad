00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:04.966
My name is Will Sikes.

00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:09.666
Currently I'm a plant science major
here at the University of Arizona.

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:11.766
I play wheelchair basketball.

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:16.886
The main reason I chose to come to the
University of Arizona is the mild winter climate

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.556
and the campus is also very accessible.

00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:25.426
I also came because of the
academic and athletic opportunities.

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.866
One thing that I noticed when I first came

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:31.476
to the DRC was mainly the
variety of equipment they had.

00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:35.066
There wasn't just one or two machines.

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:39.366
They really had a wide variety
of machines to work

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.206
out that work out different parts of the body.

00:00:41.306 --> 00:00:43.646
It also provides a sense of community.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:48.556
It's a place to interact with other people.

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:53.046
You meet all kind of people, and you
can see people that you already know,

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:59.866
and it just acts as a nexus point for a sense
of community that we have here at the DRC.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:06.146
Here at the U of A we have a
great wheelchair basketball team.

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:07.546
We have a great coaching staff...

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.366
great facilities....

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:10.986
great players on the team.

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:16.326
And it's very physical, a
very physical and active game.

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:19.956
And even though there's a lot of
competition within the team, you know,

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:22.036
we're all striving for the same goal.

00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:26.726
We're out here to make it be known
that we're an official program.

00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:27.586
We're here to stay.

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:30.556
You know, we want to bring home a
championship at the end of the year.

00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:34.466
Society doesn't have a whole lot of
wheelchair sports available for people,

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.786
especially at the university level.

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.556
UA is, like, top notch.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:44.576
The advice I'd give a new student is that it
takes a lot of dedication and mental focus.

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:48.316
But at the same time you have
to remember why you're here.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.036
And that is to enjoy the experience...

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:51.636
to have fun.

00:01:51.636 --> 00:01:52.976
I mean you're going to grow.

00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:57.826
You're going to meet a lot of new people, and
you're going to have some challenges to face.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:01.786
But in hindsight, you know,
don't forget to breathe.

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:06.566
You know, just enjoy the
experience and relax and have fun.
