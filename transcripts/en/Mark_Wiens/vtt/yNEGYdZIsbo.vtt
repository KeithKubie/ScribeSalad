00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:03.093
- This beef dish looks
particularly awesome.

00:00:03.093 --> 00:00:06.260
Oh, I think that's all sichuan pepper.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.083
(samba music)

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.918
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:19.245
It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:22.498
It's a beautiful morning in Lisbon.

00:00:22.498 --> 00:00:23.927
We are walking to the Metro,

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:25.991
we're gonna take the Metro and
then we're gonna take a tram.

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.574
And we are on our way to Belém.

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.221
Just got off the Metro at Cais do Sodré,

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.619
and we should be able to take the tram

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:39.702
or train from right here.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.358
We ended up waiting at the tram stop

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:49.957
for, I think, almost 45 minutes.

00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:54.124
So it's, so much for trying
to get an early start.

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:58.116
(uplifting music)

00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:07.338
Once we got onto the tram,

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:10.338
that took about 20 minutes, I think.

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:18.324
Francois is worried from the one.

00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:19.235
- [Ying] Mm-hmm.

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:21.663
- Francois sells the best one
- (Ying laughs)

00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:24.146
- It's not the best imitation of this one.

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:27.691
- [Waiter] One tart, one chocolate donut,

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:29.428
and uh cappuccino,
- Cappuccino.

00:01:29.428 --> 00:01:30.848
and two coffees, right?
- Yes.

00:01:30.848 --> 00:01:32.260
Our first stop this morning

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.181
is the legendary Pastéis de Belém,

00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:38.752
which is maybe one of the
most well-known places

00:01:38.752 --> 00:01:41.421
in all of Portugal, and
maybe in the entire world,

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.298
for Portuguese egg tarts.

00:01:43.298 --> 00:01:46.089
And Portuguese egg tarts
are famous the world over,

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:48.856
from Macao to even in Thailand.

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:51.385
Did they have it on, did they
have it on KFC in Thailand?

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:52.393
I think
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:55.416
- They also have it at KFC in Thailand.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.378
But Portuguese egg tarts,

00:01:57.378 --> 00:02:00.054
we're about to have our
first one so far in Lisbon,

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:01.843
and a cup of coffee.

00:02:01.843 --> 00:02:04.865
They have both take-away and sit in,

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:06.733
and, luckily, we are here early enough

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:08.421
where we just got a table

00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.485
and got to sample this
world famous egg tart.

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:12.323
Thank you.

00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:14.029
- [Waiter] One, two.

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:17.051
- [Ying] (laughs) Thank you.

00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:19.266
- [Waiter] This one's cinnamon and sugar.

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.941
- The Pastéi de Belém has arrived.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.457
Ying and I got one, and then we also got

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:25.817
a chocolate-filled Portuguese donut.

00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:27.775
And then I knew one coffee
would not be enough,

00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:30.260
so I went ahead and ordered
two at the same time.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.045
I better begin with the egg tart.

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:35.256
And, by the way, this
place dates back to 1837.

00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:37.056
And before I take a bite,
I just want to point out

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:40.570
that flaky, crispy
crust on the edges here.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.792
Looks like little layers of pastry.

00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:45.157
And then it has this
slightly yellow, golden,

00:02:45.157 --> 00:02:49.575
and slightly browned top,
little crust on that egg tart.

00:02:49.575 --> 00:02:52.158
(crunchy bite)

00:02:57.071 --> 00:02:58.655
Oh, wow.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:02:59.488
Okay.

00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:03.777
That is the best egg tart I've had.

00:03:03.777 --> 00:03:05.363
What's really awesome about that egg tart

00:03:05.363 --> 00:03:07.646
is actually the crust, the outer wrapping,

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:10.431
which is incredibly crispy.

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:13.318
And then it has a salty
flavor to it, as well,

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:18.001
which contrasts the pudding-like
egg tart in the center,

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.457
which is sweet.

00:03:19.457 --> 00:03:23.290
Okay, let me follow that
with a sip of coffee.

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.306
Good combination.

00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:39.894
Whoa.

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:41.807
Yeah.

00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:44.570
That combination of the crispy crust

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.070
with the warm, gooey pudding-like interior

00:03:50.332 --> 00:03:52.582
is a, yeah, that is a pair.

00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:55.077
- [Ying] Bite, bite.

00:03:55.077 --> 00:03:56.330
- Bite it, huh?

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.266
Just look how much chocolate
is filled into there.

00:03:58.266 --> 00:04:00.844
You can feel the bread isn't that light

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:04.151
because there's so much density
of chocolate in the middle.

00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.984
Whoa.

00:04:05.924 --> 00:04:09.924
Yeah, this is like a
little chocolate hamburger.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:14.704
Mmmmm, mmm.

00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:18.687
That chocolate is really good.

00:04:18.687 --> 00:04:20.652
Really rich and smooth.

00:04:20.652 --> 00:04:23.582
It has a really strong chocolate flavor.

00:04:23.582 --> 00:04:26.394
And the bread is really fluffy and soft.

00:04:26.394 --> 00:04:27.947
And then it's coated in sugar.

00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:29.447
Coffee number two.

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:32.941
When Ying and I came to this place,

00:04:32.941 --> 00:04:35.475
we just sat down at the
nearest table we could find,

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.167
which was right near the entrance.

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:39.076
But I just went to use the restroom,

00:04:39.076 --> 00:04:41.138
and this place is huge.

00:04:41.138 --> 00:04:45.252
There are just, like, multiple
rooms filled with tables.

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:47.357
I can see hundreds of people.

00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:49.730
You can actually get lost back here.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.313
This place is huge.

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:54.025
And there are antiques around.

00:04:54.025 --> 00:04:57.008
You can smell the egg
tarts and the coffee.

00:04:57.008 --> 00:05:00.336
I'm trying to find my
way back to our table.

00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:03.724
But you would never know how
big this place actually is

00:05:03.724 --> 00:05:06.455
from just looking at it from the outside.

00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:07.384
One thing that I should mention is that

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:09.522
Ying and I just split one
egg tart and also that

00:05:09.522 --> 00:05:12.261
Portuguese donut and had some coffee,

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:15.254
but I'm not really too much into sweets.

00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:17.050
If I just have a couple
of bites of sweets,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.296
that's good for me.

00:05:18.296 --> 00:05:20.784
However, most people eating there

00:05:20.784 --> 00:05:23.453
I think they were eating
two to five, per person.

00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:25.591
So, definitely, if you love sweets,

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:26.939
you're gonna wanna eat a couple

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.914
of those egg tarts when you come.

00:05:28.914 --> 00:05:30.947
We're walking past Jerónimo's Monastery

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:32.945
which I'll come back to.

00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:36.214
But I wanted to go first
check out the Torre de Belém,

00:05:36.214 --> 00:05:38.297
which is the Belém Tower.

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:46.137
That strong ring light.
(Ying laughs)

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.926
- [Ying] (speaks in foreign language)

00:05:48.926 --> 00:05:50.131
Behind the scene.

00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:51.060
- Behind the scenes.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.899
Oh, Ying, we need a video
about behind the scenes.

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:56.732
(uplifting music)

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:03.964
Belém is a section of Lisbon.

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:06.192
And when you come to Belém
one of the top things to do

00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:10.458
is to visit the Tower of
Belém, which is a fortified

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:14.485
military tower which was
built on the mouth of the

00:06:14.485 --> 00:06:17.318
Tagus River and completed in 1519.

00:06:18.153 --> 00:06:20.463
It is a Unesco World Heritage site.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.893
The tower is built mostly of limestone,

00:06:22.893 --> 00:06:26.936
and it 30 meters in
height, a four-story tower.

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:30.548
And because the spaces inside
are so tight and so small,

00:06:30.548 --> 00:06:34.784
they only allow 150
people to enter at a time.

00:06:34.784 --> 00:06:38.617
So that's why it can
take some time to get in.

00:06:48.102 --> 00:06:52.269
I'm making my way up the
narrow spiral staircase now.

00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:02.883
93 steps, it is spiral stone staircase,

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:07.680
and now at the top, some
great view of the bridge

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.173
and of the Tagus River.

00:07:10.173 --> 00:07:11.756
Yeah, this is nice.

00:07:13.378 --> 00:07:16.211
(uplifting music)

00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:22.091
Tight squeeze here.

00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:24.642
Tryin' to get a lookout from
this little lookout tower.

00:07:24.642 --> 00:07:27.475
This is an awesome place to chill.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.283
What I really liked was the architecture

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.391
as well as the stonework.

00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:32.968
It's very impressive.

00:07:32.968 --> 00:07:36.771
What I didn't like were the
long lines and the crowds.

00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:38.494
But that was cool to see.

00:07:38.494 --> 00:07:39.895
And now I need to find Ying.

00:07:39.895 --> 00:07:43.089
Ying decided to wait it
out in this park right here

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:46.014
because she doesn't like waiting in lines

00:07:46.014 --> 00:07:50.424
or crowds of people, so she
decided to just let me go in.

00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:52.295
And she's somewhere relaxing in this park

00:07:52.295 --> 00:07:53.927
in the shade somewhere.

00:07:53.927 --> 00:07:55.330
Ying!

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.479
Oh ho ho ho.

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:57.312
- So nice, so nice.

00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:59.992
- [Mark] Relaxing to the max.

00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:01.797
Your shoes are off.

00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:02.630
- So nice.

00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:05.005
- [Mark] How is Ying?

00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:06.714
- Yeah yeah.

00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:07.966
- We are now walking back

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:10.304
towards Jerónimo's Monastery,

00:08:10.304 --> 00:08:12.622
which is the place we're gonna visit next.

00:08:12.622 --> 00:08:14.276
But I have to tell you
guys that I'm having

00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:18.753
a little bit of a
challenging time in Portugal

00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:21.283
finding restaurants to eat at.

00:08:21.283 --> 00:08:22.536
Not because there's a lack of restaurants,

00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:24.639
but because I think it has
to do with the fact that

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:27.770
we're here on the weekend,
so today is a Sunday.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.275
But, many of the restaurants
that I had on my list

00:08:31.275 --> 00:08:35.442
that many of you recommended
are all closed on Sunday.

00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:39.750
(uplifting music)

00:08:41.107 --> 00:08:44.618
And again this is a very
impressive architectural wonder,

00:08:44.618 --> 00:08:48.118
and there's a huge crowd standing outside.

00:08:51.789 --> 00:08:55.128
The monastery was commissioned
and built in the late 1400s

00:08:55.128 --> 00:08:58.210
to commemorate Vasco da Gama's route

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.267
of the discovery to India.

00:09:00.267 --> 00:09:03.519
Built in Manueline architectural style.

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:06.157
And I can just imagine at
the time that it was built

00:09:06.157 --> 00:09:08.852
it must have been a showcase of the power

00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:11.201
and the influence of Portugal.

00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:13.851
We just waited in line for over an hour

00:09:13.851 --> 00:09:17.807
in the hot sun, finally got our tickets.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.492
Phsew, that was a long, long wait.

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:23.242
But we have finally gotten inside.

00:09:23.242 --> 00:09:26.742
This is the cloister area, and it is, wow.

00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:29.156
It's beautiful, actually.

00:09:29.156 --> 00:09:32.829
The architecture, the stonework,
the courtyard in the middle

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:34.526
and the garden and the fountain.

00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:37.109
(bright music)

00:09:42.378 --> 00:09:47.038
It measures 55 meters by
55 meters with two stories,

00:09:47.038 --> 00:09:49.148
so I'm about to go up to the upper level.

00:09:49.148 --> 00:09:52.278
But the detail of the
stonework is really impressive.

00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:53.943
Walking through the
halls of this monastery

00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:57.243
kind of reminds me of the Taj Mahal.

00:09:57.243 --> 00:09:59.993
(cheerful music)

00:10:03.717 --> 00:10:05.206
Finished walking around the cloister,

00:10:05.206 --> 00:10:07.405
and they also have a couple of museums.

00:10:07.405 --> 00:10:11.572
And now walking over to the
main entrance of the church.

00:10:13.808 --> 00:10:15.315
It is huge on the inside,

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:19.328
and while the outside is
bright and white in color,

00:10:19.328 --> 00:10:21.495
inside it has kind of dark

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.403
medieval but Manueline feel to it.

00:10:28.803 --> 00:10:31.553
(cheerful music)

00:10:37.426 --> 00:10:40.259
And this entrance doorway is huge,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.259
and also the detail within
this doorway is amazing.

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:48.321
But I think the highlight
for me of visiting

00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:51.988
Jerónimo's Monastery
was that cloister area.

00:10:54.372 --> 00:10:57.075
We've decided to catch
the bus back towards town

00:10:57.075 --> 00:11:00.658
and gonna have lunch
at the TimeOut Market.

00:11:05.429 --> 00:11:08.122
We've made it to Mercado de Ribeira,

00:11:08.122 --> 00:11:12.190
which is also known as the
TimeOut Mercado in Lisboa.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.921
And there is a traditional market,

00:11:14.921 --> 00:11:17.722
fresh market, on the right hand side.

00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:19.743
But, again, because it's
Sunday, it's all closed.

00:11:19.743 --> 00:11:23.573
So we are just in the food court area.

00:11:23.573 --> 00:11:26.660
Looks like there are a lot
of different food choices.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.539
And this is one place
that is open on Sunday.

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:32.230
There's a lot of variety to eat.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.761
There's a lot of, kind of,
modern twists, I think,

00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:36.528
to food, as well as some gourmet food,

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:38.308
as well as some international food.

00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:41.432
There's even an Asian place with Pad Thai

00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:42.929
and some Asian dishes.

00:11:42.929 --> 00:11:45.857
There is pizza, there is Portuguese food.

00:11:45.857 --> 00:11:48.131
But it has a, it does have
a very nice feeling to it.

00:11:48.131 --> 00:11:51.696
It's modern, it's kind
of on the trendy side.

00:11:51.696 --> 00:11:56.248
And I just ordered some
salted cod with garbanzo beans

00:11:56.248 --> 00:12:00.415
and they give you a buzzer,
so it should buzz pretty soon

00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:02.924
and I'll have my plate of lunch.

00:12:02.924 --> 00:12:05.703
I'm not sure if it's actually
salt cod if it's fresh cod.

00:12:05.703 --> 00:12:07.983
And then on the bottom is
a puree of garbanzo beans

00:12:07.983 --> 00:12:11.650
and I think that's olive
oil surrounding it.

00:12:14.694 --> 00:12:16.939
Oh, that tastes like hummus.

00:12:16.939 --> 00:12:20.743
It's a little bit salty,
and the garbanzo beans have

00:12:20.743 --> 00:12:24.255
a little bit of a sour
taste in them as well,

00:12:24.255 --> 00:12:25.958
maybe some lemon juice in there.

00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:30.041
My very, yeah, it's like
a dip of garbanzo beans.

00:12:35.253 --> 00:12:37.052
And this is a pretty gourmet version.

00:12:37.052 --> 00:12:38.764
The piece of fish is very good, though.

00:12:38.764 --> 00:12:40.514
It's flaky and moist.

00:12:43.457 --> 00:12:46.329
It was very good, a little
bit on the plain side for me,

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:48.644
but I did enjoy that fish especially,

00:12:48.644 --> 00:12:51.838
and the puree of garbanzo beans.

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:53.315
We are heading out of here,

00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:57.116
and gonna try to take
the Metro to a museum

00:12:57.116 --> 00:12:59.236
which is a little bit north

00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:02.260
in the northern part, I think, of Lisbon.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.962
And they shut at 6pm, it's about 4pm now,

00:13:04.962 --> 00:13:08.795
so I think we'll be able
to get there in time.

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:14.104
We got off the Metro at
São Sebastião station,

00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:16.883
and it should be a pretty
short walk from here.

00:13:16.883 --> 00:13:19.020
And this is a famous art museum.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.603
It's called the Calouste
Gulbenkian Museum.

00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:33.916
The really good news is on
Sunday that it's free entrance.

00:13:33.916 --> 00:13:35.925
So I just put my bag in the cloak room,

00:13:35.925 --> 00:13:39.014
and we're gonna walk around the museum.

00:13:39.014 --> 00:13:41.582
(cheerful music)

00:13:41.582 --> 00:13:43.662
This museum has a significant collection

00:13:43.662 --> 00:13:47.992
of both Western and
ancient, even Egyptian art.

00:13:47.992 --> 00:13:50.742
(cheerful music)

00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:58.632
Portrait of an Old Man
by Rembrandt from 1645.

00:14:00.275 --> 00:14:02.533
It was not too big of a museum,

00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:05.713
but they did have some
very famous pieces of art.

00:14:05.713 --> 00:14:08.494
And I enjoyed the paintings,

00:14:08.494 --> 00:14:10.332
some of the paintings within the museum.

00:14:10.332 --> 00:14:12.227
But the garden alone outside of the museum

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:13.664
is well worth a visit.

00:14:13.664 --> 00:14:15.703
I think for the museum,
you definitely need

00:14:15.703 --> 00:14:18.620
to really appreciate and enjoy art.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.210
(cheerful music)

00:14:25.909 --> 00:14:27.579
From the museum, we took the Metro

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:30.088
back to the Rossio Square area,

00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:33.325
and we're on our way to go eat dinner.

00:14:33.325 --> 00:14:36.641
(cheerful music)

00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:38.964
We're walking through this
awesome little side neighborhood,

00:14:38.964 --> 00:14:43.493
really narrow streets,
art, and it's kind of like

00:14:43.493 --> 00:14:47.660
little Chinatown, little
India, little Mozambique.

00:14:50.548 --> 00:14:51.732
We're looking for this one restaurant,

00:14:51.732 --> 00:14:54.106
which I think we have come up to,

00:14:54.106 --> 00:14:55.597
right behind me this grey building.

00:14:55.597 --> 00:14:57.301
There's no sign or anything.

00:14:57.301 --> 00:14:58.940
And so it's kind of a secret restaurant,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.361
but I think it's up there where the sheet

00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:04.238
is hanging from the balcony.

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:06.257
Yeah, I hope we're not showing up

00:15:06.257 --> 00:15:08.427
to somebody's house for dinner tonight.

00:15:08.427 --> 00:15:11.594
Actually, that wouldn't be a bad idea.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.235
Oh, we came to the right restaurant.

00:15:21.235 --> 00:15:24.058
And this is a Chinese restaurant.

00:15:24.058 --> 00:15:26.447
There's no sign from the outside.

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:28.015
And you just walk up the steps.

00:15:28.015 --> 00:15:29.570
It doesn't look, just looks like

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.828
somebody's home in the neighborhood.

00:15:31.828 --> 00:15:34.317
And then you come up
here and it just opens up

00:15:34.317 --> 00:15:37.509
into there's, it's full of long tables,

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:40.383
and it definitely is a Chinese restaurant.

00:15:40.383 --> 00:15:42.942
I was honestly wanting to eat some

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:47.601
traditional Portuguese food,
but I had some complications.

00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:50.017
Number one my phone
died, with the Internet,

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:51.237
so I ran out of information.

00:15:51.237 --> 00:15:53.161
And then I searched, I
literally searched through my

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:56.925
entire list of restaurants
and every Portuguese

00:15:56.925 --> 00:16:01.365
traditional restaurant I wanted
to try was closed on Sunday.

00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:04.725
So Ying and I decided to
make the executive decision

00:16:04.725 --> 00:16:06.484
to have Chinese food for dinner.

00:16:06.484 --> 00:16:09.028
And both of us are ready
for some Chinese food.

00:16:09.028 --> 00:16:11.031
The menu is only in
Chinese and Portuguese.

00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:13.609
So I'm using my Spanish to sort of

00:16:13.609 --> 00:16:16.854
translate into Portuguese
to translate into English.

00:16:16.854 --> 00:16:19.163
And so this one for sure,

00:16:19.163 --> 00:16:22.300
Ying and I are gonna get
the sopa ácido picante.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.529
Okay, actually I'm doing really poor

00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:26.930
on my translation skills.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.012
I'm kind of just writing down some dishes,

00:16:29.012 --> 00:16:32.824
I'm kinda blindly choosing
a couple of dishes.

00:16:32.824 --> 00:16:36.907
I'm gonna order the carne
de galinha com camarão.

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:48.343
I forgot to mention this before,
but we got a great table.

00:16:48.343 --> 00:16:49.368
Right in front of the window,

00:16:49.368 --> 00:16:52.030
the cool cool breeze is coming through.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.239
You can see the Portuguese flag waving,

00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:58.732
potted flowers and I think
Ying and I might've got

00:16:58.732 --> 00:17:01.110
a little bit excited that
we're having Chinese food,

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.615
and we ordered quite a,

00:17:02.615 --> 00:17:05.397
the dishes are huge in portion size.

00:17:05.397 --> 00:17:09.397
Ying just dished me a
bowl of hot and sour soup.

00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:15.034
Oh, it's hot.

00:17:17.014 --> 00:17:18.097
Yeah, it's...

00:17:18.935 --> 00:17:21.699
There's tofu in it, there are
little pieces of mushroom,

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:24.829
and I think egg drop as well.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.061
Also, a plate of chow
mein has just arrived.

00:17:27.061 --> 00:17:30.112
Egg, there's some vegetables in here,

00:17:30.112 --> 00:17:33.516
Lemme put some of this on my plate.

00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:35.890
Also a side of chili sauce.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:36.791
Oh ho ho!

00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:38.374
It's been too long.

00:17:42.653 --> 00:17:47.479
The smokiness in that wok
hei flavor is fantastic.

00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:50.646
And then this was one of the
dishes I think I guessed on.

00:17:50.646 --> 00:17:53.167
But it's chicken, there
are shrimp in here,

00:17:53.167 --> 00:17:55.160
Is it chicken, or is this the pork dish?

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.002
I think it's chicken.

00:17:56.002 --> 00:17:59.448
And there are cucumbers
and peppers in here.

00:17:59.448 --> 00:18:00.447
Let me stick this on my rice,

00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:04.197
I gotta go for some more
of that chili sauce.

00:18:12.168 --> 00:18:13.001
Oh yeah.

00:18:14.873 --> 00:18:16.325
That's salty.

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:19.965
I have to say, I had no idea
the portions were going to be

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:23.218
this big because the menu,
the prices are not high,

00:18:23.218 --> 00:18:26.270
the prices are very very
reasonable for Europe.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.778
But the dishes are huge, and
it's only Ying and I eating.

00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:32.148
But I'm not complaining.

00:18:32.148 --> 00:18:34.862
This beef dish looks particularly awesome.

00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:35.917
The beef on the top.

00:18:35.917 --> 00:18:38.875
I think sichuan pepper and chilies

00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:42.149
and on the bottom here
is cabbage, I think.

00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:44.061
This smells and looks unbelievable.

00:18:44.061 --> 00:18:46.339
Okay, I just gotta take
a bite immediately.

00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:49.506
Oh, I think that's all sichuan pepper.

00:18:53.075 --> 00:18:53.908
Oooh!

00:18:58.272 --> 00:18:59.696
Oh, yes!

00:18:59.696 --> 00:19:02.906
That is sichuan pepper, it's garlicky,

00:19:02.906 --> 00:19:06.307
it's filled with, like, garlic oil.

00:19:06.307 --> 00:19:09.390
And chili oil, tender slices of beef.

00:19:10.964 --> 00:19:12.669
Lots and lots of garlic in there.

00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:14.163
Cilantro.

00:19:14.163 --> 00:19:15.663
Mmm, that's, yeah.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.671
I'm glad I wrote down this dish

00:19:19.671 --> 00:19:22.092
without knowing what
it was, and ordered it.

00:19:22.092 --> 00:19:23.514
This is the vegetable I ordered,

00:19:23.514 --> 00:19:25.244
which I just wrote down, too.

00:19:25.244 --> 00:19:26.914
And I think it's jicima.

00:19:26.914 --> 00:19:28.106
It wouldn't have been my first choice

00:19:28.106 --> 00:19:29.967
had I known what it is.

00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:32.076
I would've liked more of
a green leafy vegetable,

00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:33.409
but that's okay.

00:19:35.031 --> 00:19:35.948
Mmm, mmmmm.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.533
That is jicima, but it does have

00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:42.495
a really wonderful smokey flavor again.

00:19:42.495 --> 00:19:44.122
I actually forgot all about these

00:19:44.122 --> 00:19:46.124
because they came last,
and like five minutes after

00:19:46.124 --> 00:19:47.892
all the rest of the food.

00:19:47.892 --> 00:19:49.912
But we also got the fried dumplings.

00:19:49.912 --> 00:19:51.798
Oh, and these look fantastic.

00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:52.821
Look how big this plate is, though.

00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:54.821
There's so many of them.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.987
A dip in vinegar, I think.

00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:02.334
Mmmmmm.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.590
Those are hot and fresh.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.450
Filled with minced meat, they're garlicky.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.270
They're crispy and oily.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.054
That's wonderful.

00:20:15.054 --> 00:20:17.636
Ying are stumbling down the staircase

00:20:17.636 --> 00:20:19.430
out of this restaurant.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.263
That meal absolutely hit the spot.

00:20:23.248 --> 00:20:26.998
That beef dish, in
particular, was fantastic.

00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:31.862
What a wonderful little
family-run restaurant.

00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:35.095
I think within this lovely
little neighborhood,

00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:37.382
this is the perfect place
to end today's vlog.

00:20:37.382 --> 00:20:39.674
Ying and I are walking back
to the hotel from here.

00:20:39.674 --> 00:20:41.653
Thank you all very much
for watching today's video.

00:20:41.653 --> 00:20:44.232
Please remember to give it a
thumbs-up if you enjoyed it.

00:20:44.232 --> 00:20:45.364
And also make sure you subscribe

00:20:45.364 --> 00:20:47.592

00:20:47.592 --> 00:20:49.235
And I will see you on the next video.

00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:51.453
Good night from Lisbon.

00:20:51.453 --> 00:20:53.323
I had already ended the vlog for today,

00:20:53.323 --> 00:20:56.133
but Ying and I are just
leisurely strolling home,

00:20:56.133 --> 00:21:00.240
and I came across this place
that I think I remember

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.185
Anthony Bourdain having a drink
here in one of his episodes

00:21:05.185 --> 00:21:08.102
that I watched a couple years back.

00:21:19.877 --> 00:21:23.130
I think it's a cherry
liquor, and then you bring,

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.845
you just walk in there,
it's only take-away,

00:21:25.845 --> 00:21:28.372
and then he pours you a little cup

00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:32.539
and puts in a little, puts
in a berry at the bottom.

00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:36.484
Ooh.

00:21:37.551 --> 00:21:39.134
Wow, that's strong.

00:21:40.036 --> 00:21:41.502
Mmmm.

00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:45.419
It's sweet and strong
and I think it is cherry.

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:49.254
It does have like a fruity,

00:21:49.254 --> 00:21:52.087
a fruity sweet cherry taste to it.

00:21:55.221 --> 00:21:57.720
Ooh, yeah, that is strong.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.305
But that is very good.

00:21:59.305 --> 00:22:02.445
This is a real legendary place, though.

00:22:02.445 --> 00:22:06.166
This is really going to be the
conclusion for today's video.

00:22:06.166 --> 00:22:08.637
And yeah, we had, I had
no plans to stop there,

00:22:08.637 --> 00:22:09.995
but I just remember seeing it

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:13.377
in Anthony Bourdain's Lisbon video.

00:22:13.377 --> 00:22:17.544
Cheers to everyone and
goodnight from Lisbon, Portugal.
