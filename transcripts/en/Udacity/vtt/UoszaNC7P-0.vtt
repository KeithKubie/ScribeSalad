00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.260
So now that we've factored our Move method to be outside of the body of

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.170
the car function, what would you expect the parameter of

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.330
this to refer to when we invoke .move on this last line?

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.250
Of course, since Ben is on the left of the dot when we invoke move,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.900
the parameter of this will be bound to Ben.
