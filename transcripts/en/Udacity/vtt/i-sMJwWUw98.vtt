00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The edge that should be different is the one on the left.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's trace through it to see why.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We know when we run this program that it should say "hello gracie."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When we're running a function, our official rule is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
you take the function body--here's the function body--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
"right greeting" plus "person"--and you evaluate it in that frame--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"right greeting" plus "spaces" plus "person."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We go to look up "greeting." Do we have it?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
No. Let's go ask our parents.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Oh, our parents do have a greeting--it's "hola."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Look up "person"--do we have it?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes, it's "gracie."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
With the bug, this program will mistakenly

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
print out "hola gracie."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's not what we wanted. That doesn't match the semantics.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If instead I erase this edge and draw it correctly,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
having this function point back to the environment

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in which it was defined, now when I try to write

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"greeting" plus "person," do I have "greeting?"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
No. How about my parent?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Oh, my parent does, and it's "hello."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
How about "person," "gracie?"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We'll write out "hello gracie."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So with the bug we get "hola gracie."

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Without the bug we get, correctly, "hello gracie."
