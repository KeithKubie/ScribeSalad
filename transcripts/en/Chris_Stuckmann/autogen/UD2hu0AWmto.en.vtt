I like the first ant-man a lot more I
definitely did too I think the first one

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.090
definitely did too I think the first one
just from a screenplay is much stronger

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
just from a screenplay is much stronger
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.400
just from a screenplay is much stronger
movie building off of infinity war which

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
movie building off of infinity war which
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.959
movie building off of infinity war which
i think is a movie we both really like

this film it just it felt sort of like
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.000
this film it just it felt sort of like
filler to me when compared to that film

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010
filler to me when compared to that film
 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.740
filler to me when compared to that film
yeah infinity war is sort of like a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
yeah infinity war is sort of like a
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.590
yeah infinity war is sort of like a
steak dinner and then a mana wasp is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
steak dinner and then a mana wasp is
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420
steak dinner and then a mana wasp is
sort of like a hamburger from the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
sort of like a hamburger from the
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.789
sort of like a hamburger from the
McDonald's dollar menu that's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
McDonald's dollar menu that's
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.590
McDonald's dollar menu that's
interesting comparison and I think for

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600
interesting comparison and I think for
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.980
interesting comparison and I think for
some though that's okay which is fine it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
some though that's okay which is fine it
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.219
some though that's okay which is fine it
felt very much so like an extra thing

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
felt very much so like an extra thing
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.649
felt very much so like an extra thing
and the two ant-man movies kind of rely

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
and the two ant-man movies kind of rely
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.780
and the two ant-man movies kind of rely
on that they sort of hang on to the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
on that they sort of hang on to the
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.420
on that they sort of hang on to the
coattails of a bigger more epic Marvel

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
coattails of a bigger more epic Marvel
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.600
coattails of a bigger more epic Marvel
movie and get the aftermath that's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
movie and get the aftermath that's
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.859
movie and get the aftermath that's
exactly what happened with the first one

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
exactly what happened with the first one
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.450
exactly what happened with the first one
which came out after age of Ultron

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
which came out after age of Ultron
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.670
which came out after age of Ultron
you're right yeah it did and this one

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
you're right yeah it did and this one
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.679
you're right yeah it did and this one
you know after infinity war in so I

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689
you know after infinity war in so I
 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270
you know after infinity war in so I
think it's kind of a marketing tactic

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
think it's kind of a marketing tactic
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.410
think it's kind of a marketing tactic
from Marvel's standpoint where they're

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
from Marvel's standpoint where they're
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.899
from Marvel's standpoint where they're
like we're gonna release a literally

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
like we're gonna release a literally
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420
like we're gonna release a literally
smaller-scale movie after like this big

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
smaller-scale movie after like this big
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.160
smaller-scale movie after like this big
epic film and people will feel sort of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
epic film and people will feel sort of
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990
epic film and people will feel sort of
like it's refreshing and and like a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
like it's refreshing and and like a
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.789
like it's refreshing and and like a
change of pace 20 years from now

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
change of pace 20 years from now
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.230
change of pace 20 years from now
nobody's gonna care about when this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
nobody's gonna care about when this
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.609
nobody's gonna care about when this
movie came out they're just going to

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
movie came out they're just going to
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260
movie came out they're just going to
watch the film and judge it on its own

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
watch the film and judge it on its own
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.609
watch the film and judge it on its own
merit so I don't really think the film

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
merit so I don't really think the film
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260
merit so I don't really think the film
is any better simply because it comes

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
is any better simply because it comes
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.780
is any better simply because it comes
out after infinity war in fact if

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
out after infinity war in fact if
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.180
out after infinity war in fact if
anything it looks worse to me because I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
anything it looks worse to me because I
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.949
anything it looks worse to me because I
really did like infinity war and this

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
really did like infinity war and this
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.140
really did like infinity war and this
movie feels sort of like almost like a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
movie feels sort of like almost like a
 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.430
movie feels sort of like almost like a
TV episode in the end

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
TV episode in the end
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.750
TV episode in the end
you like it might belong and one of the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760
you like it might belong and one of the
 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.490
you like it might belong and one of the
Netflix shows but with obviously it has

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
Netflix shows but with obviously it has
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.930
Netflix shows but with obviously it has
a higher budget yeah it's like you said

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
a higher budget yeah it's like you said
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.330
a higher budget yeah it's like you said
it feels like part of a TV show it feels

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
it feels like part of a TV show it feels
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580
it feels like part of a TV show it feels
like a fragment and I didn't really feel

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590
like a fragment and I didn't really feel
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.100
like a fragment and I didn't really feel
like you compare to the last three or

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
like you compare to the last three or
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.360
like you compare to the last three or
four Marvel films that have come out

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
four Marvel films that have come out
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.540
four Marvel films that have come out
black panther Avengers infinity war thor

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
black panther Avengers infinity war thor
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.730
black panther Avengers infinity war thor
ragnarok yeah this movie compared to all

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740
ragnarok yeah this movie compared to all
 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.400
ragnarok yeah this movie compared to all
those is definitely the the weakest link

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
those is definitely the the weakest link
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.140
those is definitely the the weakest link
and it's strange because a lot of the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
and it's strange because a lot of the
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.330
and it's strange because a lot of the
more praiseworthy reviews are using that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
more praiseworthy reviews are using that
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.150
more praiseworthy reviews are using that
exact comparison but as a way to say

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
exact comparison but as a way to say
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.100
exact comparison but as a way to say
it's good like this is different and

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
it's good like this is different and
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.470
it's good like this is different and
better and smaller and that's why it's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
better and smaller and that's why it's
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.660
better and smaller and that's why it's
better but I think that's kind of what

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
better but I think that's kind of what
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.710
better but I think that's kind of what
Marvel is hoping and again that's fine

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
Marvel is hoping and again that's fine
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.750
Marvel is hoping and again that's fine

know we've been doing this for a couple
 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.699
know we've been doing this for a couple
years and you can predict the outcome of

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709
years and you can predict the outcome of
 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.860
years and you can predict the outcome of
a lot of situations so I like to save

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
a lot of situations so I like to save
