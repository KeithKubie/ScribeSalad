00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.015
Sperman's theory of intelligence address the question how intelligent are you?

00:00:05.015 --> 00:00:10.250
And the evidence for this theory is fairly strong. Sperman found that the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.680
correlations across the three domains were about positive .6 and .7. Now this

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.620
is on a correlation scale between negative 1 and positive 1. And because it's

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.060
positive, the 2 scores will go in the same direction. So as one score

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.340
increases, so does the other score. Still to this day modern tests of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.760
intelligence show that the 3 primary domains of intelligence are positively

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.210
correlated. Supporting the view that intelligence is one general ability. Now

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.200
it's important to remember That theories drive scientific research. A theory

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.790
doesn't necessarily mean it's a law, regardless of how strong the correlations

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.340
are. Theories can change and be adapted over time. The theory that intelligence

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.190
is one, basic set of related skills is known as the g-factor theory of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.960
intelligence. This is the foundation for the idea that intelligence Can be

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.200
represented by a single number. This theory organizes intelligence into a

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.530
hierarchy. With general intelligence. Or g at the top. And from there extends

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.678
three specific domains. Your spatial abilities. Your mathematical abilities.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.150
And your verbal abilities. Until recently, all of the major tests of

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.730
intelligent, has been based on Sprimen's theory.
