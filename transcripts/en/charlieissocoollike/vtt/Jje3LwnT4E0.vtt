00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.170
So, YouTube celebrity culture is a
topic that seams to have been 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.250
talked about near to death on this website
recently, and with good reason too. 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.440
It is very important. 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.560
Personally, I didn't want to
jump in unless I felt like 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.060
I had something new and valuable
to add to the conversation, 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.820
but I think I finally think I do.
I think I finally think I do. 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.570
There are a lot of worthy videos
surrounding this topic, 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.230
and so what I'll do is I'll make a
playlist of some of my favorites 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.370
and link to that at the end should
you want to watch some more, 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.590
but there was one video in
particular that I saw yesterday 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.110
that really struck a
chord with me. 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.880
It's by a YouTuber called
"VickyThePixie," 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.730
and everything that I have to say today
is directly inspired by her video. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.000
The bulk of the conversation, so far,
about YouTube celebrity culture 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.170
has surrounded this idea
of the ever widening gap 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.490
between big famous YouTube
stars and their fans. 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.810
Where previously I used to be pretty
uncomfortable with the idea of 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.650
referring to big YouTubers as
"YouTube celebrities," 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.890
nowadays I don't even bother adding the
"YouTube" to the beginning of that phrase. 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.820
These people appear on
magazine covers, 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.820
they're on the sides of buses,
they get stopped in the street, 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.150
they can draw crowds of
thousands of people. 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.680
In my mind, the biggest of the big
YouTubers are just celebrities now. 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.210
And while I have to assume that a lot of these
now celebrities feel very happy being just that - 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.710
maybe it was what they were always
hoping for when they started out -

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.850
not everybody who has that popularity
feels as comfortable with it. 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.770
Being screamed at when you walk into
a room can be terrifying for some people

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.110
Being told that you're somebody's idol
and that they look up to you 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.690
as a perfect example of
humanity when you know that 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.520
there are many flawed sides to you
that you're not showing them, 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.260
for some people, can
be very worrying. 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.910
The big YouTubers on this side of things,
I think, they don't want to feel "other." 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.860
They don't want to feel special.
They want to feel normal. 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.190
They want you to see
them as human beings. 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.670
They don't want you
to idolize them. 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.510
They want you to imagine
them complexly, 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.040
and I do genuinely think that
that is all good advice. 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.020
I know that point of view very well because
I've been there many times myself, 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.880
and I think it also shows that those
people who are giving that advice 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.470
are taking their positions as
role models very seriously, 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.390
and that's also a
good thing,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.520
but, and there is a "but,"
and it's a very big "but," 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.900
and I'm going to touch
that "but" now. 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.680
We've talked nice and loud now
about our big YouTuber problems, 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.190
and, apparently, we've
decided as a group that 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.960
you are going to be the ones
to fix our problems for us. 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.640
It's your job now to
think more about us,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.950
to imagine us more complexly because
we're people too, you know, 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.500
and we're forgetting that this gap that
exists that we're trying to close 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.540
exists between two groups of people
because we're treating it, I think, 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.920
in a very one-sided way. 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.780
What Vicky talked about in her video,
and that I agree with, 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.920
is that some big YouTubers, not all, but some,
have just as much of an issue imagining 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.420
their audiences complexly as some
members of their audience

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.740
have imagining them complexly. 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.070
And I believe this, not as a hunch,
but because when I've spent time 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.800
with some big YouTubers in the past and
they decide to tell stories about their fans,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.890
the only stories they
seem to want to tell 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.120
are those about their crazy
fans or their stupid fans. 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.140
And I don't even know if I can remember a
time when I've heard those same YouTubers 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.160
talk about their experiences
with their friendly fans 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.300
or their considerate fans
or their intelligent fans 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.390
because I think they have a hard time
remembering that those people exist. 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.960
And I wish that I could attest to being a perfect
example on the other side of that coin, 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.630
but I can't because, let's be fair, it's hard
enough to imagine one person complexly 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.470
let alone hundreds of thousands
of people or millions of people, 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.510
but at the same time, I don't think
that means we shouldn't try. 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.910
Maybe there is something different about
the people who I've met who watch my videos 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.820
because I've always felt very proud
to have a group of people 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.870
who support my work who are
so considerate and respectful 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.040
and intelligent and friendly, 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.870
but my guess is that my audience
isn't unique in that respect 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.510
and that most people who
watch YouTube are like that. 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.430
There are always going to be
those individuals that I meet 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.620
who do seem to see me as being
something otherworldly, 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.090
but the assumption that I think is right
to make is that you already know 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.880
that you're not watching
a person right now, 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.790
that this is a YouTube video that
I have written and performed 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.160
and edited and uploaded
for your enjoyment. 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.170
You don't need me to tell you that
because I believe you are smart enough 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.290
to figure that out for yourself. 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.800
And so that is what I would like to offer as a
potential first step towards closing this gap 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.030
is that I believe we need some
more respect on both sides.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.300
Hopefully that wasn't too mean.
Thanks for watching. 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.630
STEPHEN FRY VOICE: You've just had the almost
imponderable joy of watching charlieissocoollike,

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.570
which makes you, like, cool. 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.910
Okay, gang, you know the drill. 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.870
Here's my most recent video
in case you missed it. 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.990
Here's the playlist that I mentioned,
starting with the video from Vicky, 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.530
and I'm not going to try and
say anything funny right now 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.620
because it doesn't feel appropriate
for some reason. Goodbye.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:40.313
