00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:18.150
In 1996, I was commissioned
by the Guggenheim Museum

00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:24.389
to execute a large body of work
called "Uses of Evidence."

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.894
It was a cube --

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:29.997
a very well large cube, at that.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.529
Each side had a window

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.953
in order for the spectators
to view the interior of the structure.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.045
The exterior of the structure
was a collage of Africa and Africans

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:47.971
as portrayed in the Western
media and literature.

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:54.645
A look through the windows
revealed a sharp contrast:

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.851
within the cubes are tranquil,
civilized, domestic images

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:06.717
of African family members, friends

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:09.577
and Nigerian professionals,

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:15.942
ranging from writers, poets,
fashion designers, etc.

00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:18.686
The thing is,

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.894
both the exterior and the interior
images are quite true.

00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:31.947
But the images captured by Western media

00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:38.896
overwhelmingly depict Africans
as basically primitive at best,

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:44.074
or barely distinguishable
from the African animals.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.021
Not much has changed,
I'm afraid, since 1996,

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:53.605
when I executed this work.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.986
I began my professional
photography practice in 1994,

00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:06.669
but my passion and enthusiasm
for photography

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.470
goes back to childhood,

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:15.290
when my parents arranged
for us to be photographed

00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:18.204
by a professional photographer

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:20.625
on almost a monthly basis.

00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:28.119
It was also an opportunity for my siblings
to dress up in our latest gear,

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.193
made by our tailor.

00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:33.823
Later, when I was in boarding school,

00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:37.492
my friends and I bought Polaroid cameras,

00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:42.593
and then I began to experiment
with self-portraiture,

00:02:42.617 --> 00:02:44.217
or what I would call

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:48.605
"proto-selfie auto-portraits."

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.479
(Laughter)

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:54.907
"Cover Girl 1994" was my first major work

00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.932
that was critically well received
in the US and Europe

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:06.069
and quite instantly became
a part of the school anthologies

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:08.211
at universities and colleges.

00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:10.442
With the "Cover Girl" series,

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:14.839
I wanted to reimagine the magazine cover

00:03:14.863 --> 00:03:21.331
with imagery totally unexpected,
yet profoundly reasonable.

00:03:21.355 --> 00:03:26.121
The "Cover Girl" series
proposed a different way

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:32.169
the African can be represented
in a more complex manner.

00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:37.160
Like "Cover Girl,"
the "Sartorial Anarchy" series

00:03:38.104 --> 00:03:41.490
is made up of self-portraits.

00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:46.613
It is an ongoing body of work,
started in 2010.

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:53.594
In each image, I married
disparate costumes

00:03:53.618 --> 00:04:00.283
from widely diverse traditions,
countries and time frames.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:04.855
And in mixing eras, cultures,

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.703
I was able to bring harmony, as it were,

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:12.406
to their similarly
irreconcilable differences.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.545
These differences became a source

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:22.704
of inspired artistic celebration.

00:04:23.822 --> 00:04:25.206
For example,

00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:29.267
in "Sartorial Anarchy #4,"

00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.029
I mixed a boater hat,

00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:38.649
inspired by the traditional
Eton-Oxford College Boat Race,

00:04:38.673 --> 00:04:42.883
with a green Afghan traditional coat

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:46.696
and an American Boy Scout shirt --

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.972
a culture clash that works.

00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:53.032
In "Sartorial Anarchy #5,"

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:56.537
I wore a macaroni wig,

00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:02.129
inspired by eighteenth-century
macaroni headgear from England.

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:07.110
This was paired with
a British Norfolk jacket,

00:05:07.903 --> 00:05:10.867
Yoruba Nigerian trousers,

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.547
and, improbably, a South African
Zulu fighting stick.

00:05:17.575 --> 00:05:21.259
All harmoniously coexist on one body.

00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:27.371
And with "Sartorial Anarchy,"
I began to invest more

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:30.525
into the organization of my pictures.

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:36.770
I also began to investigate
the vast possibilities of color:

00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:39.923
its emotional values,

00:05:40.693 --> 00:05:42.457
psychological impulse,

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.671
poetic allure

00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:52.233
and a boundless capacity beyond
the realm of meaning and logic.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.727
Now, enter Nollywood.

00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:57.863
In October of 2014,

00:05:57.887 --> 00:06:03.307
I returned to Lagos, Nigeria,
after over three decades away

00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:07.864
and took photographs
of 64 Nollywood personalities.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.053
I captured a cross section
of the industry,

00:06:13.844 --> 00:06:18.452
as well as the next generation
of rising stars.

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:25.403
Nollywood is the first time that you have
a school of African filmmakers

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:31.728
truly, truly, profoundly in charge
of telling African stories.

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:34.437
In their varied movies --

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:40.967
from romantic movies, horror films,
gangster movies to action movies --

00:06:41.491 --> 00:06:47.561
one sees Nigerians portrayed
with many layers of complexities.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:54.376
All the Nigerian, or "Naija," archetypes,
if you allow, are there --

00:06:55.264 --> 00:07:00.348
from the divvers, the "Shakara,"
the coquette,

00:07:00.372 --> 00:07:05.245
the gangsters, the rich,
the corrupt politicians,

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:07.181
the whore, the pimp --

00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:08.682
all in their swagger.

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.958
And of course, you have the lowlifes
and the losers, too,

00:07:12.982 --> 00:07:15.311
all vividly portrayed.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:20.394
Nollywood is Africa's mirror
par excellence.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.087
Typically, I direct all of my portraits,

00:07:25.658 --> 00:07:29.756
from the way my subject
conducts his or her head,

00:07:30.776 --> 00:07:33.049
the way the neck is tilted,

00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:36.137
the expression of the fingers,

00:07:36.728 --> 00:07:38.731
the gestures of the hands,

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:40.845
to the gaze

00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:43.737
and overall bearing and countenance.

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:47.004
Let me describe
some of the photographs for you.

00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:48.740
Genevieve Nnaji.

00:07:49.228 --> 00:07:51.439
She is the reigning queen of Nollywood.

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:57.668
Here, I was quoting from the grand,
Pharaonic African cultures

00:07:57.692 --> 00:08:00.355
of the Nile Valley civilizations;

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.878
namely, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia,

00:08:03.902 --> 00:08:10.484
so as to imbue her with a stately,
ironic, calm grandeur.

00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:16.613
Taiwo Ajai-Lycett is
the grande dame of Nollywood.

00:08:17.283 --> 00:08:22.537
Every aspect of her being
commands attention.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:27.256
So I posed her with her back
to the audience.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:33.378
Her face turned to meet us
with a redoubtable gaze.

00:08:34.276 --> 00:08:37.314
She doesn't need to seek our approval.

00:08:38.157 --> 00:08:39.429
She's all that.

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:41.608
Sadiq Daba.

00:08:42.592 --> 00:08:47.703
There was an unspoken
authoritarian and imperial bearing

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:51.803
that Sadiq Daba exudes upon meeting him.

00:08:52.522 --> 00:08:56.655
In this portrait, he simply sat

00:08:57.847 --> 00:09:03.379
and allowed his massive,
massive Nigerian caftan

00:09:03.403 --> 00:09:05.434
to signal his status.

00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:08.415
Quite an accomplishment.

00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:10.759
Belinda Effah.

00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.933
Belinda Effah's portrait allowed me
to indulge my passion for color,

00:09:15.957 --> 00:09:22.561
dressed in a long, fitted blue dress
that emphasizes her curves,

00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:26.804
seated on an upholstered
green velvet bench.

00:09:26.828 --> 00:09:30.862
I gamely employed the multicolored carpet

00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.406
and a vibrant color,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:41.424
in order to evoke the splendor
of the multicolored painted bunting bird.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:48.776
Everything was designed to harmonize
the figure of Belinda within the frame.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.479
Monalisa Chinda is, shall we say,

00:09:53.503 --> 00:09:57.768
the epitome of the luxe
existence and lifestyle.

00:09:57.792 --> 00:10:01.974
Her picture, or portrait,
pretty much speaks for itself.

00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:07.196
Alexx Ekubo is a sharp study

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.664
in simplified elegance and dignity

00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:15.268
and a harmony in blue and white, as well.

00:10:16.371 --> 00:10:20.247
Enyinna Nwigwe
is a Nollywood matinee idol.

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:25.958
There is whiff of the rake about him,

00:10:25.982 --> 00:10:28.902
and that gives him an enchanting edge.

00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:34.182
That's what I felt when I designed
and organized the portrait.

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:38.919
Now, Nollywood is a new phase of Africa.

00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:44.204
It is modern, post-modern,

00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:47.339
meta-modern, bold

00:10:47.363 --> 00:10:50.244
sexy, shrewd

00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:55.387
and with a contagious
attitude worth catching.

00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:58.093
As the finale of the project,

00:10:58.117 --> 00:11:01.466
I assembled the Nollywood stars

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.768
into a group grand portrait
of 64 subjects,

00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:10.145
called "The School of Nollywood,"

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:15.750
which was inspired
by Rafael's "School of Athens,"

00:11:15.774 --> 00:11:19.624
that was done circa 1509.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.890
It is at the Vatican.

00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:25.841
This grand group portrait

00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:31.315
is the exact same size
as Rafael's "School of Athens."

00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:36.331
It measures roughly 27 feet in width

00:11:36.355 --> 00:11:39.771
by six and a half feet in height.

00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:44.291
Nollywood also exemplifies
a type of modernity

00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:46.181
never before seen in Africa.

00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:48.179
Think of it:

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.111
there has never been anything
so ubiquitous

00:11:53.135 --> 00:11:55.462
with such iconic optics

00:11:56.097 --> 00:11:57.617
to come out of Africa

00:11:57.641 --> 00:12:02.093
since the Nile Valley civilizations

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:06.229
of Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia.

00:12:07.553 --> 00:12:09.379
Outside of Nollywood,

00:12:09.403 --> 00:12:15.728
the image of Africa remains frozen
in the old "National Geographic" mode

00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:17.426
and safari perspective.

00:12:18.703 --> 00:12:25.600
But as Africans continue to step
and see themselves portrayed by Nollywood

00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:29.760
in their varied
and fantastic complexities,

00:12:29.784 --> 00:12:33.631
they will, in turn,
propagate and perpetuate

00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:36.022
the positive image of themselves.

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:40.112
This is what Hollywood did
and continues to do for the West.

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:42.625
As shocking as this may be,

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:46.664
it is almost a taboo in the art world

00:12:46.688 --> 00:12:50.255
to show Africans in a modern framework --

00:12:51.094 --> 00:12:55.457
that is to say, as polished, dry-cleaned,

00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:59.219
manicured, pedicured and coiffed.

00:12:59.998 --> 00:13:04.815
(Applause)

00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:09.646
Part of my job is to keep
beautifying Africa for the world,

00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:13.403
one portrait at a time.

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:14.587
Thank you.

00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:21.398
(Applause)
