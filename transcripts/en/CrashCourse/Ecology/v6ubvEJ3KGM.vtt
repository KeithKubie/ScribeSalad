00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
There's a lot of ideas that we just assume that we know a lot about because we hear about them all the time.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.500
For instance, I know what pop music is, but
if you were to corner me at a party and say,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.160
"Hank, what is pop music?",

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.360
I'd be like, "It's, uh...it's like, uh...the
music that plays on the pop station?"

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.190
Just because we're familiar with a concept
does not mean that we actually understand it.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.540
Ecology's kind of the same way, even though
it's a common,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.630
everyday concept and "ecosystem" is a word
that we hear a lot,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.409
I think most of us would be a little stumped if somebody actually asked us what an ecosystem is,

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.020
or how one works, or why they're important,
etc.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.260
I find it helps to think of an ecosystem

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.160
-- a collection of living and nonliving things interacting in a specific place --

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.699
as one of those Magic Eye posters, for those
of you who were sentient back in 1994.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.420
An ecosystem is just a jumble of organisms,
and weather patterns, and geology,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.120
and other stuff that don't make a lot of sense
together until you stare at 'em long enough,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.700
from far enough away and then suddenly a picture
emerges.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.600
And just like with Magic Eye posters, it helps if you're listening to Jamiroquai while you're doing it.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.160
So the discipline of ecosystem ecology, just like other types of ecology we've been exploring lately,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.480
looks at a particular level of biological
interaction on Earth.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.800
But unlike population ecology, which looks at interactions between individuals of one species,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.070
or community ecology, which looks at how bunches
of living things interact with each other,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.330
ecosystem ecology looks at how energy and
materials come into an ecosystem,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.520
move around in it, and then get spat back
out.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.070
In the end, ecosystem ecology is mostly about
eating --

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.840
who's eating whom and how energy, nutrients, and other materials are getting shuffled around within the system.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.140
So today, we're setting the record straight: no more not understanding how an ecosystem works, starting now!

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:41.660
[Theme Music]

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.939
So ecosystems may be a lot like Magic Eye
posters,

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.319
but the way that they're not like a Magic Eye poster is in the way that posters have edges.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.060
Ecosystems, I'll just come out and say it:

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.500
NO EDGE, only fuzzy, ill-defined gradients
that bleed into the ecosystems next-door.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.720
So actually defining an ecosystem can be kind of hard; mostly it depends on what you want to study.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.860
Say you're looking at a stream in the mountains.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.700
The stream gets very little sunlight because it's so small that the trees on its banks totally cover it with shade.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.400
As a result, very few plants or algae live in it, and if there's one thing that we know about Planet Earth,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.090
it's that plants are king -- without plants,
there are no animals.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.490
But somehow, there's a whole community of animals living in and around this mountain stream,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.340
even though there are few plants in it.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.940
So what are the animals doing there, and how
are they making their living?

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.000
From the land, of course --
from the ecosystems around it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.860
Because no stream is an island, it isn't there all by itself.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.680
All kinds of food, and nutrient,s and other
materials drop into the stream from the trees,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.680
or are washed into it when it rains.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.760
Leaves and bugs, you name it, flow down from
neighboring terrestrial ecosystems.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.970
And that stuff gets eaten by bigger bugs,
which get eaten by fish,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.739
which in turn are eaten by raccoons and birds
and bears.

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.379
So even though this stream's got its own thing
going on, without the rest of the watershed,

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.080
the animals there wouldn't survive.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.580
And without the stream, plants would be thirsty and terrestrial animals wouldn't have as many fish to eat.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.040
So, where does the ecosystem of the stream
start and where does it end?

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.720
This is a perennial problem for ecologists
because the way it works:

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.269
energy and nutrients are imported in from
some place,

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.720
they're absorbed by the residents of an ecosystem and then passed around within it for a little while,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.019
and then finally passed out, sometimes into
another ecosystem.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.900
This is most obvious in aquatic systems where
little streams eventually join bigger and

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.420
bigger waterways until they finally reach
the ocean.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.730
This flow is a fundamental property of ecosystems.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.710
So at the end of the day, how you define an
ecosystem just depends on what you want to know.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.840
If you want to know how energy and materials
come in, move through,

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.400
and are pooped out of a knot in a tree that has a very specific community of insects and protists living in it,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040
you can call that an ecosystem.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.900
If you want to know how energy and materials
are introduced to, used,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.080
and expelled by the North Pacific Gyre, you
can call that an ecosystem.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.180
And if you want to know how energy and materials
move around a cardboard box

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.659
that has a rabbit and a piece of lettuce in
it, you can call that an ecosystem.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.090
I might tell you that your ecosystem is stupid,
but go ahead, do whatever you want.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.040
The picture you see in an ecosystem's Magic Eye is actually dictated by the organisms that live there,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.020
and how they use what comes into it.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.489
An ecosystem can be measured through figuring
out things like its biomass,

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.150
that is, the total weight of living things
in the ecosystem, and its productivity --

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.940
how much stuff is produced and how quickly stuff grows back, how good the ecosystem is at retaining stuff.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.740
And of course, all these parameters matter
to neighboring ecosystems as well

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.450
because if one ecosystem is really productive,
the ones next-door are going to benefit.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.000
So, first things first, where do the energy
and materials come from?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.460
And to be clear, when I talk about materials, I'm talking about water or nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.860
or even toxins like mercury or DDT.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.580
Let's start out by talking about energy because
nothing lives without energy

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.040
and where organisms get their energy tells
the story of an ecosystem.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.420
You remember physics, right?

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.490
The laws of conservation state that energy
and matter can neither be destroyed or created;

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.920
they can only get transferred from place to
place to place.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.440
The same is true of an ecosystem.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.340
Organisms in an ecosystem organize themselves
into a trophic structure,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.840
with each organism situating itself in a certain
place in the food chain.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.380
All of the energy in an ecosystem moves around
within this structure,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.160
because when I say energy, of course I mean
food.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.180
For most ecosystems, the primary source of
energy is the sun,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.700
and the organisms that do most of the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy -- you know this one.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.280
Who rules the world?
The plants rule the world.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.320
Autotrophs like plants are able to gather
up the sun's energy,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.820
and through photosynthesis, make something awesome out of it: little stored packets of chemical energy.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.140
So whether it's plants, bacteria, or protists
that use photosynthesis,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.400
autotrophs are always the lynchpin of every
ecosystem --

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.620
the foundation upon which all other organisms
in the system get their energy and nutrients.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.200
For this reason, ecologists refer to plants
as primary producers.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.020
Now obviously, the way that energy gets transferred from plant to animals is by the animal eating the plant.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.680
For this reason, herbivores are known as primary
consumers,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.140
the first heterotrophs to get their grubby
paws on that sweet, sweet energy.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.640
After this stage of the trophic structure,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.320
the only way to wrestle the solar energy that was in the plants that the herbivore ate is to -- you guessed it --

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.200
eat the herbivore, which carnivores, known as
secondary consumers, are very happy to do.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.060
And assuming that the ecosystem is big enough
and productive enough,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.840
there might even be a higher level of carnivore that eats other carnivores, like an owl that eats hawks,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.930
and these guys are called tertiary consumers.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.020
And then there are the -vores that decompose
all the dead animal and plant matter, as well

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.800
as the animal poop: detritivores.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.160
These include earthworms and sea stars and
fiddler crabs and dung beetles and fungi

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.480
and anything else that eats the stuff that none of the rest of us would touch with a three-meter pole.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.460
So that's a nice hierarchical look at who's getting energy from what or whom within an ecosystem,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.720
but of course organisms within an ecosystem
don't usually abide by these rules very closely,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.740
which is why these days we usually talk about
food webs rather than food chains.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.860
A food web takes into consideration that sometimes a fungus is going to be eating nutrients from a dead squirrel,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.880
and other times squirrels are going to be
eating the fungi.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.020
Sometimes a bear likes to munch on primary
producers, blueberry bushes,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.810
and other times it's going to be snacking
on a secondary consumer, like a salmon.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.120
And even at the tippy-tippy top, predators
get eaten by stuff like bacteria in the end,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.020
which might or might not be the same bacteria that eat the top predator's poopies. Circle of life!

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.320
It's also worth noting that the size and scope of the food web in an ecosystem has a lot to do with things

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.990
like water and temperature, because water
and temperature are what plants like, right?

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.480
And without plants, there isn't going to be
a whole lot of trophic action going on.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.090
Take for example the Sonoran desert, which
we've talked about before.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.750
There aren't many plants there, compared to
say, the Amazon rainforest,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.690
so the primary producers are limited by the
lack of water,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.490
which means that primary consumers are limited
by lack of primary producers.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.710
And that leaves precious few secondary consumers:
a few snakes and coyotes and hawks.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.040
All this adds up to the Sonoran not being a terribly productive place, compared to the Amazon at least,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.900
so you might only get to the level of tertiary
consumer occasionally.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.920
Now all this conversation about productivity leads me to another point, about ecosystem efficiency.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.720
When I talk about energy getting passed along
from one place to another within an ecosystem,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:50.460
I mean that in a general sense organisms are sustaining each other, but not in a particularly efficient way.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.300
In fact, when energy transfers from one place to another, from a plant to a bunny or from a bunny or a snake,

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.870
the vast majority of that energy is lost along
the way.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.940
So let's take a cricket. That cricket has
about one calorie of energy in it.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:06.100
And in order to get that one calorie of energy,
it had to eat about 10 calories of lettuce.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.920
Where did the other nine calories go?
It is not turned into cricket flesh.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.720
Most of it is used just to live, like to power its muscles or run the sodium-potassium pumps in its neurons.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.940
It's just used up.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.900
So only the one calorie of the original 10 calories of food is left over as actual cricket stuff.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.860
And then right after his last meal, the cricket jumps into a spider web and is eaten by a spider,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.720
who converts only 10% of the cricket's energy
into actual spider stuff.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.760
And don't get me started on the bird that eats the spider; this is not an efficient world that we live in.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.750
But do you want to know what's scary efficient?
The accumulation of toxins in an ecosystem.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.190
Elements like mercury, which are puffed out
of the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants,

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.140
end up getting absorbed in the ocean by green
algae and marine plants.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:50.200
While the tiny animal that eats the algae only stores 10% of the energy it got, it keeps 100% of the mercury.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.480
So as we move up the chain, each trophic level
consumes ten times more mercury than the last.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.600
And that's what we call bioaccumulation.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.160
Concentrations get much higher at each trophic
level

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.530
until a human gets ahold of that giant tuna
that's at the top of the marine food chain,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.210
and none of that mercury has been lost.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.420
It's all right there in that delicious tuna
flesh.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.270
Because organisms only hold on to 10% of the
energy they ingest,

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:15.300
each trophic level has to eat about ten times
its biomass to sustain itself.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.800
And because 100% of that mercury moves up
the food chain,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.460
that means that it becomes ten times more
concentrated with each trophic level it enters.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.920
That's why we need to take the seafood advisory
seriously.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.480
As somebody who could eat anything you wanted, it's probably safest to eat lower on the food chain:

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.720
primary producers or primary consumers.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.350
The older, bigger, higher-in-the-food-chain,
the more toxic it's going to be.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.750
And that's not just my opinion, that's ecosystem
ecology.
