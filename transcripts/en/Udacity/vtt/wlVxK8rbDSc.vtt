00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Before we address the question of what the potential energy is let's just take a moment

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and imagine what's going to happen when we release this charge q.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, if this charge is positive, it's going to accelerate in this direction.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If this particle accelerates, it's going to gain kinetic energy.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we know from Unit 4 that the change in kinetic energy of the particle

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is equal to the work done on the particle.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And what's this work equal to? Well the work is just the force

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that the electric field is applying on the charge over the distance that it's being applied over.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This means that if the charge moves all the way over to the negative plate, then the work done

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
by the field will equal the force applied by the field times that distance x.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And what's this force equal to?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well we know that's just equal to this electric field strength times the charge of the particle.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
All right so putting this together, we found that the change in kinetic energy

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is equal to the electric field strength times the charge of the particle

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
times the distance it moves through x.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
All right. Now let's use conservation of energy to relate this change

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in kinetic energy to a change in potential energy.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In this case because there aren't any extra forces doing any work on the charge

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
only the field is doing the work we know that the change in kinetic energy

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is in fact exactly equal to the change in potential energy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And the change in potential energy is just equal to the difference

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
between the original potential energy and the final potential energy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We know that if the charge moves all the way to the negative plate,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it has 0 potential energy so we can cancel out this term, which leaves us

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that the change in kinetic energy is exactly equal to the original potential energy.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We know that the change in kinetic energy is equal to Eqx

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so this gives us that the original potential energy was equal the Eqx.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is our nice formula for the potential energy of a charge in a constant electric field.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And you might notice something really cool about this.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This formula is actually effectively the same as our gravitational formula mgh.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In this equation, the gravitational field strength is replaced with the electric field strength.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And the mass of the particle is replaced with the charge of the particle and the distance away

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
from the negative plate is essentially the same as the height above the ground.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
What we see here is that this formula is completely analogous

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to our gravitational potential energy formula, which is awesome.

00:02:12.000 --> 09:59:59.000
All right. If you are able to get this equation, great job.
