00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.460
What Started World War I

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.100
The commonly held notion that WWI was started
out of outrage over the assassination of Archduke

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.550
Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie
at the hands of Serbian nationalist secret

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.110
society known as the “Black Hand” isn’t
entirely correct.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.840
In fact, the Emperor Franz Josef himself expressed
relief over the assassination because it rid

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.420
him of an heir whom he deeply disliked.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.350
The Emperor commented that “God will not
be mocked.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.609
A higher power had put back the order I couldn’t
maintain.”

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.320
Indeed, it wasn’t just the Emperor who was
relieved; it was reported by an Austrian newspaper

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.229
that the general consensus among the various
political circles was that the assassination,

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.159
though a tragedy, was for the best.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.309
As far as the Austrian people were concerned,
it was noted “The event almost failed to

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.170
make any impression whatever.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.879
On Sunday and Monday, the crowds in Vienna
listened to music and drank wine as if nothing

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.879
had happened.”

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.429
Indeed, it took the government itself a full
three weeks to react.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.010
As you’ll see shortly, the “treaty alliance
system” that was prevalent in Europe with

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.500
numerous treaties interconnecting the various
states was really at the heart of why what

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.280
would have been a small conflict, not noteworthy
in any way in history, escalated into one

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.860
of the bloodiest wars in human history with
over around 37 million casualties.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.030
Somewhat ironically, the spark that set it
all off was the assassination that nobody

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.780
really cared about.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.960
So why go to war over an assassination, if
nobody cared?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.160
Because, while nobody seemed to much care
about the assassination itself, Austria-Hungary

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.070
had been looking for an excuse to wage a “preventative
war” against Serbia as a state in order

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.830
to weaken or destroy them so as to take back
territory in the Balkans, which had been taken

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.150
during the Balkan Wars.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.370
They had not taken it back up to this point
because they lacked Germany’s support; without

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.460
that support, they feared Russia too much,
because of the treaty Russia had with Serbia.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.600
With the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
and his wife on June 28th, 1914, Austria-Hungary

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.130
was able to secure the promise from Germany
that it would aid in a war with Serbia and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.190
possibly Russia, if Russia chose to enter
the fray due to their treaty with Serbia.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.909
It should be noted here that Austria-Hungary
did not really expect Russia to enter the

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.079
fray as they expected this to be a very small
war that would be over quickly, before Russia

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.170
would be obligated to respond.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.190
Now with Germany’s support if Russia did
enter the fray, Austria-Hungary issued an

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.450
ultimatum to Serbia with remarkably severe
terms that Serbia would be sure to reject,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.090
thus giving Austria-Hungary an excuse to go
launch a limited war on Serbia to reclaim

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.870
territory in the Balkans.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.439
Surprisingly, Serbia responded relatively
well to the ultimatum, but they did dispute

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.540
a few minor clauses, which gave Austria-Hungary
the excuse they needed to go to war.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.480
At this point, the following general series
of events happened due to a variety of existing

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.480
treaties between various nations, which escalated
this minor clash into the first “Great War”.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.290
• Russia bound by their treaty with Serbia
decides to come to Serbia’s aid.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.970
• Germany, with the recent treaty with Austria-Germany,
declares war on Russia.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.670
• France, bound by an existing treaty with
Russia, now was at war with Germany by association.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.079
Germany then invades Belgium to have easy
access to France.

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.510
• Britain, allied to France with an existing
treaty, declared war against Germany.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.599
This was unexpected by Germany as they expected
Britain to stay out of the war, due to the

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.919
fact that the treaty with France was loosely
worded and not entirely binding.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.639
However, Britain also had a 75 year old treaty
with Belgium.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.529
So because of both of these treaties, they
decided to declare war on Germany.

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:38.079
• With Britain now warring with Germany,
Canada, India, Australia, New Zealand, and

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.590
South Africa enter the war as they were colonies
of Britain.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.010
• Japan honored an existing treaty with
Britain and declared war on Germany.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.909
• Austria-Hungary declared war on Japan
for declaring war on Germany.

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.219
• The U.S. tried to stay out of the war
but in 1917 decided to enter due to Germany’s

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.180
submarines hindering the United States’
commercial shipping due to the fact that the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.180
U.S. was shipping a lot of supplies to the
Allies.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.389
So in the end, a small quick war over a minor
land dispute got turned into a lengthy war

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.150
that was joined by powers all over the globe
due to a variety of existing treaties dating

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:29.370
back as much as 75 years before the war started.
