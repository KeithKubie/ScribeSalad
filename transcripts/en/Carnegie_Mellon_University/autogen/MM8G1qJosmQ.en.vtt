as we have I think in this case with the
 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.809
as we have I think in this case with the
oli modules for your course yeah thank

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819
oli modules for your course yeah thank
 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.600
oli modules for your course yeah thank
you you advised me all along you know

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610
you you advised me all along you know
 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.820
you you advised me all along you know
about getting my learning objectives

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830
about getting my learning objectives
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.150
about getting my learning objectives
clear and aligning my activities and

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
clear and aligning my activities and
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.340
clear and aligning my activities and
assessments with those objectives I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
assessments with those objectives I
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.590
assessments with those objectives I
really learned a lot in the process so

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600
really learned a lot in the process so
 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.110
really learned a lot in the process so
one thing I'm curious about is how you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120
one thing I'm curious about is how you
 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.479
one thing I'm curious about is how you
think your students experience has

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489
think your students experience has
 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.600
think your students experience has
changed from before you had these oli

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610
changed from before you had these oli
 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.940
changed from before you had these oli
modules to now when students can work

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
modules to now when students can work
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.910
modules to now when students can work
with the oli modules right I think it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
with the oli modules right I think it
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.490
with the oli modules right I think it
really changed for the better for

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500
really changed for the better for
 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.050
really changed for the better for
example my first lecture on programming

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060
example my first lecture on programming
 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.470
example my first lecture on programming
used to be hard both for me and for the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480
used to be hard both for me and for the
 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.840
used to be hard both for me and for the
students because I had to start with

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850
students because I had to start with
 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.780
students because I had to start with
some basics about programming to even

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
some basics about programming to even
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.970
some basics about programming to even
get to the more interesting parts that I

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980
get to the more interesting parts that I
 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.900
get to the more interesting parts that I
wanted to focus on but in that initial

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910
wanted to focus on but in that initial
 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.270
wanted to focus on but in that initial
part i would lose most of my students

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
part i would lose most of my students
 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280
part i would lose most of my students
you know by the time I got to the point

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
you know by the time I got to the point
 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.430
you know by the time I got to the point
that I wanted to really focus on the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
that I wanted to really focus on the
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.819
that I wanted to really focus on the
students would be you know thinking

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829
students would be you know thinking
 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.789
students would be you know thinking
about other things so I thought for

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799
about other things so I thought for
 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.670
about other things so I thought for
example having one one module on that

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680
example having one one module on that
 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.580
example having one one module on that
material and asking the students to

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590
material and asking the students to
 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.650
material and asking the students to
engage with that before coming to the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660
engage with that before coming to the
 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.670
engage with that before coming to the
class would be really helpful and I

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680
class would be really helpful and I
 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.110
class would be really helpful and I
experienced what I expected they

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120
experienced what I expected they
 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.760
experienced what I expected they
they came to class ready to ask

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770
they came to class ready to ask
 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.140
they came to class ready to ask
questions the participation was way way

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150
questions the participation was way way
 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.280
questions the participation was way way
more you know my experience is all

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290
more you know my experience is all
 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.070
more you know my experience is all
positive but I really want to go beyond

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080
positive but I really want to go beyond
 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.800
positive but I really want to go beyond
these observations and just anecdotal

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810
these observations and just anecdotal
 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.159
these observations and just anecdotal
evidence we have all this data collected

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169
evidence we have all this data collected
 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.020

this is a place that you can help you
with well one of the great things about

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210
with well one of the great things about
 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.240
with well one of the great things about
using online learning resources

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250
using online learning resources
 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.850
using online learning resources
especially with the oli modules as in

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860
especially with the oli modules as in
 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.310
especially with the oli modules as in
your course is that we have a way to

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320
your course is that we have a way to
 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.510
your course is that we have a way to
instrument or collect data on students

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520
instrument or collect data on students
 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.570
instrument or collect data on students
as they're learning so we can go to look

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580
as they're learning so we can go to look
 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.240
as they're learning so we can go to look
at the data online to see what your

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250
at the data online to see what your
 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.360
at the data online to see what your
students have how they've performed what

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370
students have how they've performed what
 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.129
students have how they've performed what
they've done and remember we also

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139
they've done and remember we also
 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.490
they've done and remember we also
created a pretest and a post-test so

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500
created a pretest and a post-test so
 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.650
created a pretest and a post-test so
that we can compare students performance

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660
that we can compare students performance
 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.260
that we can compare students performance
before they used your modules to their

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270
before they used your modules to their
 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.290
before they used your modules to their
performance after they use the modules

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300
performance after they use the modules
 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.490
performance after they use the modules
this can be really helpful because we

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500
this can be really helpful because we
 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.650
this can be really helpful because we
can see how they improved we can also

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660
can see how they improved we can also
 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.379
can see how they improved we can also
see the areas where they still could use

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389
see the areas where they still could use
 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.390
see the areas where they still could use
some more support and that can help us

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400
some more support and that can help us
 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.180
some more support and that can help us
refine the modules themselves right I'm

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190
refine the modules themselves right I'm
 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.860
refine the modules themselves right I'm
glad you thought of setting up that

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870
glad you thought of setting up that
 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.159
glad you thought of setting up that
pretest because is it you know if I only

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169
pretest because is it you know if I only
 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.589
pretest because is it you know if I only
told using traditional methods I

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599
told using traditional methods I
 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.900
told using traditional methods I
wouldn't have remembered to set up that

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910
wouldn't have remembered to set up that
 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.360
wouldn't have remembered to set up that
pretest okay great well maybe we should

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370
pretest okay great well maybe we should
 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.939
pretest okay great well maybe we should
take a look at your data so here is the

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949
take a look at your data so here is the
 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.089
take a look at your data so here is the
post test data so you can see the number

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099
post test data so you can see the number
 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.610
post test data so you can see the number
of students who completed it in the last

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620
of students who completed it in the last
 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.400

getting each question correct so you can

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919
getting each question correct so you can
 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.040
getting each question correct so you can
really see on some of the items they did

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050
really see on some of the items they did
 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.870
really see on some of the items they did
really well yes but there are a few

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880
really well yes but there are a few
 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.270
really well yes but there are a few
items where students performance was not

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280
items where students performance was not
 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.990
items where students performance was not
so good so sometimes what is a pretty

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000
so good so sometimes what is a pretty
 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.930

efficient strategy is to first target

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940
efficient strategy is to first target
 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.330
efficient strategy is to first target
the questions where students performance

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340
the questions where students performance
 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.390
the questions where students performance
was not so high and see if you based on

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400
was not so high and see if you based on
 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.110
was not so high and see if you based on
your experience teaching in you're not

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120
your experience teaching in you're not
 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.409

edge of the subject matter can identify

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419
edge of the subject matter can identify
 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:46.700
edge of the subject matter can identify
what might be going on if there was a

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710
what might be going on if there was a
 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.430
what might be going on if there was a
misconception or if maybe the material

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440
misconception or if maybe the material
 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.770
misconception or if maybe the material
was confusing or if there's something we

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780
was confusing or if there's something we
 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.180
was confusing or if there's something we
might want to do differently next time

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190
might want to do differently next time
 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.210
might want to do differently next time
yep so I think we can look at this

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220
yep so I think we can look at this
 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.420
yep so I think we can look at this
question here this is a question that is

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430
question here this is a question that is
 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.460
question here this is a question that is
what is the value returned by the

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470
what is the value returned by the
 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.719
what is the value returned by the
following function mm-hmm it's a common

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:04.729
following function mm-hmm it's a common
 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:08.570

problem students usually get confused

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580
problem students usually get confused
 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.710
problem students usually get confused
between the function print and return in

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720
between the function print and return in
 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.719
between the function print and return in
return statement so it's actually

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729
return statement so it's actually
 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.620
return statement so it's actually
expected I try to address this in the in

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630
expected I try to address this in the in
 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.900
expected I try to address this in the in
the class but the fact that it's still

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910
the class but the fact that it's still
 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.029
the class but the fact that it's still
you know it still shows itself in the

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039
you know it still shows itself in the
 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:29.360
you know it still shows itself in the
post-test makes me think maybe we should

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370
post-test makes me think maybe we should
 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.150
post-test makes me think maybe we should
address it even more carefully we could

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160
address it even more carefully we could
 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.670
address it even more carefully we could
now what we can do is we can go back to

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680
now what we can do is we can go back to
 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.710
now what we can do is we can go back to
do you know where in the course this

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720
do you know where in the course this
 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.629
do you know where in the course this
material would have been addressed right

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639
material would have been addressed right
 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.930
material would have been addressed right
the initial module okay so this is the

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940
the initial module okay so this is the
 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.029
the initial module okay so this is the
module where that concept would be

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039
module where that concept would be
 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.250
module where that concept would be
introduced right this learning dashboard

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260
introduced right this learning dashboard
 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.800
introduced right this learning dashboard
page shows students performance and

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.810
page shows students performance and
 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.750
page shows students performance and
they're learning during that initial

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:50.760
they're learning during that initial
 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.940
they're learning during that initial
exposure to that topic so maybe we can

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:52.950
exposure to that topic so maybe we can
 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.100
exposure to that topic so maybe we can
dig in and see is one of these more

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.110
dig in and see is one of these more
 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.320
dig in and see is one of these more
relevant to what we just tell just maybe

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.330
relevant to what we just tell just maybe
 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.409
relevant to what we just tell just maybe
the part okay nice try that so this

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419
the part okay nice try that so this
 

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:04.070
the part okay nice try that so this
shows us in this area students were

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080
shows us in this area students were
 

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.400
shows us in this area students were
answering questions about defining and

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:07.410
answering questions about defining and
 

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.070
answering questions about defining and

using their own straight line functions
 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.860
using their own straight line functions
using built-in functions now the

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:12.870
using built-in functions now the
 

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.650
using built-in functions now the
built-in functions would be most likely

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:15.660
built-in functions would be most likely
 

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.320
built-in functions would be most likely
okay point so we can click on here and

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.330
okay point so we can click on here and
 

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.129
okay point so we can click on here and
see students performance on those items

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:22.139
see students performance on those items
 

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:24.950
see students performance on those items
in the module was pretty strong right

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960
in the module was pretty strong right
 

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.589
in the module was pretty strong right
except for on this one let's do that

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599
except for on this one let's do that
 

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:30.320
except for on this one let's do that
yeah let's view it in the course so

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.330
yeah let's view it in the course so
 

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.600
yeah let's view it in the course so
that's an interesting phenomenon that

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.610
that's an interesting phenomenon that
 

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.579
that's an interesting phenomenon that
when they're first learning about this

00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:34.589
when they're first learning about this
 

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:36.500
when they're first learning about this
topic and they're focused on it they

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.510
topic and they're focused on it they
 

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.690
topic and they're focused on it they
seem to be doing quite well but then

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700
seem to be doing quite well but then
 

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.390
seem to be doing quite well but then
when some time goes on right they need

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:41.400
when some time goes on right they need
 

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.459
when some time goes on right they need
to retain that conceptual understanding

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:43.469
to retain that conceptual understanding
 

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:46.250
to retain that conceptual understanding
and transfer maybe to a new situation

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260
and transfer maybe to a new situation
 

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.600
and transfer maybe to a new situation
like that print function it's a common

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:50.610
like that print function it's a common
 

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.160
like that print function it's a common
challenge for students learning to

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.170
challenge for students learning to
 

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.780
challenge for students learning to
retain and transfer what they've learned

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:53.790
retain and transfer what they've learned
 

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.430
retain and transfer what they've learned
so giving the

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440
so giving the
 

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.380
so giving the
even more practice and more distributed

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:57.390
even more practice and more distributed
 

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.690
even more practice and more distributed
practice might be a good strategy so I

00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700
practice might be a good strategy so I
 

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.930
practice might be a good strategy so I
could think of injecting similar

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940
could think of injecting similar
 

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.400
could think of injecting similar
questions in other modules yes exactly

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:06.410
questions in other modules yes exactly
 

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.600
questions in other modules yes exactly
so then they learn it here and they're

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:08.610
so then they learn it here and they're
 

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.060
so then they learn it here and they're
doing well but then you can come back to

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.070
doing well but then you can come back to
 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.070
doing well but then you can come back to
it and check their understanding and

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080
it and check their understanding and
 

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.790
it and check their understanding and
help them practice it and refine it we

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800
help them practice it and refine it we
 

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.260
help them practice it and refine it we
could see then if you make that change

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:18.270
could see then if you make that change
 

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.390
could see then if you make that change
if the post-test performance looks

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:20.400
if the post-test performance looks
 

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.370
if the post-test performance looks
better yeah let's try to do that next

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380
better yeah let's try to do that next
 

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.190
better yeah let's try to do that next
time yeah but in the meantime let's see

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200
time yeah but in the meantime let's see
 

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.460
time yeah but in the meantime let's see
what this question holds similarly are

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:28.470
what this question holds similarly are
 

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.700
what this question holds similarly are
the interaction between print and the

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:31.710
the interaction between print and the
 

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.850
the interaction between print and the
return value of a function yes yes and

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.860
return value of a function yes yes and
 

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.080
return value of a function yes yes and
that was the one with the worst

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.090
that was the one with the worst
 

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.000
that was the one with the worst
performance during the module right

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.010
performance during the module right
 

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.870
performance during the module right
that's right but if you compare how they

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880
that's right but if you compare how they
 

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.790
that's right but if you compare how they
did during the module on this problem

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800
did during the module on this problem
 

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.620
did during the module on this problem
with their performance on the post test

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:48.630
with their performance on the post test
 

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.510
with their performance on the post test
post test is slightly bed a little bit

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:50.520
post test is slightly bed a little bit
 

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.520
post test is slightly bed a little bit
better a little bit so I got actually

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:52.530
better a little bit so I got actually
 

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.550
better a little bit so I got actually
important idea that you know coming back

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560
important idea that you know coming back
 

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.740
important idea that you know coming back
to its more practice is a really good

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.750
to its more practice is a really good
 

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.410
to its more practice is a really good
idea in fact even right around this page

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420
idea in fact even right around this page
 

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.320
idea in fact even right around this page
since students were doing not so well on

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.330
since students were doing not so well on
 

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.980
since students were doing not so well on
that item maybe even having some more

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:05.990
that item maybe even having some more
 

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.540
that item maybe even having some more
instruction or another activity right

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:08.550
instruction or another activity right
 

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.120
instruction or another activity right
there as well as the distributed

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.130
there as well as the distributed
 

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.700
there as well as the distributed
practice that's a great idea this is

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:13.710
practice that's a great idea this is
 

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.160
practice that's a great idea this is
something we see a lot that when faculty

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.170
something we see a lot that when faculty
 

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.640
something we see a lot that when faculty
members are using an online

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:18.650
members are using an online
 

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.870
members are using an online
instructional resource like oli they can

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880
instructional resource like oli they can
 

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.520
instructional resource like oli they can
target their instruction to the places

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:25.530
target their instruction to the places
 

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.360
target their instruction to the places
where students need it most right so

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:28.370
where students need it most right so
 

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.490
where students need it most right so
that's a specific way we can look to

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500
that's a specific way we can look to
 

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.230
that's a specific way we can look to
edit the course and make it better for

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240
edit the course and make it better for
 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.810
edit the course and make it better for
next time yeah I'll remember this one

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820
next time yeah I'll remember this one
 

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.270
next time yeah I'll remember this one
great joy to look at the post-test some

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:38.280
great joy to look at the post-test some
 

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.930
great joy to look at the post-test some
more so if you look at this a particular

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940
more so if you look at this a particular
 

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.380
more so if you look at this a particular
learning objective all the students seem

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:45.390
learning objective all the students seem
 

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.160
learning objective all the students seem
to have done pretty mediocre on that one

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.170
to have done pretty mediocre on that one
 

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.520
to have done pretty mediocre on that one
right maybe it's me writing the activity

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:52.530
right maybe it's me writing the activity
 

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.010
right maybe it's me writing the activity
maybe it's not a really well-designed

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.020
maybe it's not a really well-designed
 

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.800
maybe it's not a really well-designed
activity that I should improve on so

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:57.810
activity that I should improve on so
 

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.340
activity that I should improve on so
what this bar is showing is a lot of

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.350
what this bar is showing is a lot of
 

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.550
what this bar is showing is a lot of
students did not do that much that's why

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560
students did not do that much that's why
 

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.680
students did not do that much that's why
it's still gray and those students who

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:06.690
it's still gray and those students who
 

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.020
it's still gray and those students who
did work on activities related to this

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.030
did work on activities related to this
 

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.940
did work on activities related to this
learning objective yeah they didn't

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:10.950
learning objective yeah they didn't
 

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:16.130
learning objective yeah they didn't
excel exact so one reason for that is

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140
excel exact so one reason for that is
 

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.260
excel exact so one reason for that is
just what you're saying that maybe they

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:18.270
just what you're saying that maybe they
 

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.110
just what you're saying that maybe they
did not have enough practice to get

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120
did not have enough practice to get
 

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.500
did not have enough practice to get
strong right in that skill another

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:23.510
strong right in that skill another
 

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.579
strong right in that skill another
hypothesis is that there were enough

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:25.589
hypothesis is that there were enough
 

00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:28.460
hypothesis is that there were enough
practice opportunities but students were

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.470
practice opportunities but students were
 

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.860
practice opportunities but students were
still struggling so we can click on this

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:30.870
still struggling so we can click on this
 

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.380
still struggling so we can click on this
link here and see how many activities of

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:33.390
link here and see how many activities of
 

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.810
link here and see how many activities of
practice were there and we can

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820
practice were there and we can
 

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.210
practice were there and we can
distinguish between those two hypotheses

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220
distinguish between those two hypotheses
 

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.170
distinguish between those two hypotheses
and it looks like there were only really

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180
and it looks like there were only really
 

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.970
and it looks like there were only really
three so three practice opportunities

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:45.980
three so three practice opportunities
 

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.340
three so three practice opportunities
may not be enough for students to master

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.350
may not be enough for students to master
 

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.220
may not be enough for students to master
that skill okay that's good that we

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:52.230
that skill okay that's good that we
 

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.670
that skill okay that's good that we
found that out absolutely so if we look

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680
found that out absolutely so if we look
 

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.280
found that out absolutely so if we look
at one of these do you think there would

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:58.290
at one of these do you think there would
 

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.470
at one of these do you think there would
be some other activities like this that

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480
be some other activities like this that
 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.690
be some other activities like this that
you could add for practice sergeant ya

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700
you could add for practice sergeant ya
 

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.930
you could add for practice sergeant ya
next time great
