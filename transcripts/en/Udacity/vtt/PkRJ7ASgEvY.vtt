00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so Huygens wanted to look at a pendulum to measure time.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's analyze what's going on exactly with a pendulum

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well, a pendulum is just a mass on a rod.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When we pull it back, like we have here, away from the equilibrium position,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which I've drawn in dotted lines, it's going to swing back and forth.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If there's no friction or air resistance, it'll just do that forever.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We expect this pendulum to give us simple harmonic motion,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which means we expect that when we work out the forces in the acceleration

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we want to get acceleration that looks like minus something times x.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's look at the forces and see if we can get that,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because we want to understand what's going on here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's imagine pulling our pendulum by some angle θ.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Well, of course, our pendulum has some mass.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I said simple pendulum so that what means--I should explain--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is that all of the mass is in the bob at the end,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which is just some really tiny little point mass at the end,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and there's no mass in the rod, and everything is going to swing without friction.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The pendulum has mass or weight pulling down, and there's only one other force.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That's the force of tension supplied by the string or rod.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I know that when I release this pendulum, if I've pulled it back here and I release it,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it's going to swing this way--down back towards the equilibrium.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Actually, what we want to do is break this mg into a component this way

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that will balance the tension and a component in this direction and a component in this direction.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This picture is starting to get a little cluttered, so let me pull it off to the side and make it a little bigger.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I can see that this angle is the same as this angle over here.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If that's the case, well, I can do my trig.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is a right triangle with a hypotenuse,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and there is this side, which is mgcosθ.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This side is pretty uninteresting, because I know it's going to exactly balance tension.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
How do I know that?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Well, because the mass never accelerates towards the pivot point or away.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It only accelerates perpendicular directly back towards the equilibrium point.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That force that's doing this acceleration is mg times sin θ.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Okay, this is the force.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Actually, I should say that it's negative,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because if I pull it back to the left I would normally call that a negative angle.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The force is to the right, so this negative sign is actually important.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So, we have this force doing our acceleration minus mgsinθ.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Let's use our good old friend F = ma.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
In this case -mgsinθ = ma.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
When we check it out, the m's cancel,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and we're left with this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The acceleration is equal to -g times sinθ.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We're in a big of a pickle here because--uh, oh--this does not look like a = 1 something x.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Have no fear. We're going to do some sly massaging of this equation

00:02:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to figure out what's going on.
