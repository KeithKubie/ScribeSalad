you guys are gonna

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:15.682 align:start position:0%
be trying to
come into this club to dance,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.751
and this guy here is gonna say,

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.519 align:start position:0%
"Hey, why don't we dance
together?"

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.324 size:75% position:38%
And you all...will think
it's a great idea, okay?

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:27.460
Is that good? Cool?
- Yeah, sounds good to me.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.861
- Yeah, great.
- Let's shoot one, huh?

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.896
It's gonna be fun.

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:34.300
- All right, and...action.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.838
- Hey, kids, let's party
together.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.373
[together]
Yeah.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.141 align:end position:100%
- I for sure want to party with
this guy.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.878
- Well, then, all right.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:49.115 align:start size:38% position:63%
- And...cut.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.617
- Good job. Awesome.
That was really, really good.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:52.885
- Sam.
- Great job, guys.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.453
- Sam.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.256
- What is that?
- Oh, here come some notes.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.389
Flying in notes.

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:58.858
This is all part of it.
It's fun.

- [whispering indistinctly]

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.699
- Yeah, okay, great job on that
last one, guys.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.301
I'll tell you what, we've got
to do it one more time,

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.937
because I had a little sound
issue.

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:11.938
The boom was in the shot.
You could see it.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.006
- Dang it, Tommy.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.041
- Tommy, come on.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.810
So let's do it one more time,
and just so we have it,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.314
all right, Lea, we can do it
again, but this time,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.517
maybe it would be fun
if you said

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:27.319
they can't come in and dance in
the club, so, you know,

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.156
so we have it like we had
in the original script.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.225
- Right, but my only thing is,

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.293 align:end position:100%
why wouldn't they
want him to dance?

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.563 align:end position:100%
Like, they kind of see him as,
like, a friend

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.864 align:end position:100%
and as, like,
a guy they look up to.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.465 align:start size:53% position:47%
He's also a peer.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.033 size:84% position:42%
- Yeah, maybe--I just think
so that we had it at least

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.602 size:75% position:38%
both ways so we could...

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.470
- I'm not into the other way.
- Yeah, okay.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.839 align:end position:100%
- I've--I've seen it.
I've seen that done before.

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.340 align:start position:0%
- Uh...

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.376
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:56.916 align:start position:0%
- Ah...let's just do it
the same way again then.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.718
- Thanks. Thanks, Sam.
- Yeah.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.587 align:end position:100%

Same again, guys.

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:04.223 align:start position:0%

Yeah.

party with this guy.

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:14.867
- All right.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:18.604
Give me some skin.

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:19.938

- Sam.

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:20.940

- Come on.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.274
What's--what's...

00:02:22.274 --> 00:02:24.110 align:start position:0%
What's going on here?
Is it just me?

[both mumbling indistinctly]

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.215 align:end position:100%
- That was good for me,
but one thing is,

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.884
the kid who's supposed to say,

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.385 align:end position:100%
"I for sure want to
party with him,"

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.987 align:end position:100%
he's, like, kind of squinting
his eyes.

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:36.455 align:start size:59% position:41%
It's, like, I don't
really believe him.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:39.058 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, no shit, 'cause why
would he say that?

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.227
- This is supposed to be
a commercial

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:44.964
for a club where teens can go
and have a cool,

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.699
safe space to hang out.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.936
And now it's a commercial
where a bunch of cool teens

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:54.707
want to hang out with...
an adult,

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.509
who legally wouldn't be allowed
in the club in the first place.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.210 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, that's
the whole point, though.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.413 align:end position:100%
He doesn't go into the club.
They just want him to.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.716 size:84% position:42%

party with a weird old man?

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:04.984 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Who's a weird old man?

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.719

- Me?

How am I old or weird?

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.358

- Strongly disagree.

- Everybody shut up.

Watch this.

Hey, kids, if this wasn't
a commercial,

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:23.235
this was real life, and I came
up to you in a teen club,

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:25.305
would you dance with me?
