00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.520
Let's explore the scientific method. Which at first might seem a

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.518
bit intimidating, but when we walk

00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:13.363
through it, you'll see that it's actually

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:15.561
almost a common-sense way of looking

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.448
at the world and making progress in our

00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:20.397
understanding of the
world and feeling good

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:22.365
about that progress of our understanding

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:23.743
of the world.

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:25.508
So, let's just use a tangible example

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:27.454
here, and we'll walk through what we could

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:29.933
consider the steps of the scientific

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.396
method, and you'll see different steps

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:33.326
articulated in different
ways, but they all

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:35.541
boil down to the same thing.

00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:38.263
You observe something
about reality, and you say,

00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:40.722
well, let me try to come up with

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:44.694
a reason for why that observation

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:47.831
happens, and then you try
to test that explanation.

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:48.937
It's very important that you come up with

00:00:48.937 --> 00:00:50.949
explanations that you
can test, and then you

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.683
can see if they're true, and then based on

00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:55.723
whether they're true, you keep iterating.

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:57.639
If it's not true, you come
up with another explanation.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.670
If it is true, but it
doesn't explain everything,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.320
well once again, you try
to explain more of it.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.440
So, as a tangible example,
let's say that you live in,

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:08.931
in I don't know, northern
Canada or something, and let's

00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:10.211
say that you live near
the beach, but there's

00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:13.488
also a pond near your
house, and you notice that

00:01:13.488 --> 00:01:15.778
the pond, it tends to
freeze over sooner in

00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:18.876
the Winter than the ocean does.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:21.680
It does that faster and
even does it at higher

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.057
temperatures than when the ocean seems

00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:25.601
to freeze over.

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:27.691
So, you could view that
as your observation.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.840
So, the first step is you're
making an observation.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.200
Observation.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.880
In our particular case
is that the pond freezes

00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:38.208
over at higher temperatures than the ocean

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:41.660
does, and it freezes over
sooner in the Winter.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.592
Well, the next question that you might

00:01:43.592 --> 00:01:45.931
wanna, or the next step you could view as

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.068
a scientific method.

00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:48.775
It doesn't have to be
this regimented, but this

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.540
is a structured way of thinking about it.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.062
Well, ask yourself a question.

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:55.866
Ask a question.

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:59.993
Why does, so in this
particular question, or in

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:03.589
this particular scenario,
why does the pond tend

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:06.440
to freeze over faster and
at higher temperatures

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.739
than the ocean does?

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.211
Well, you then try to answer
that question, and this

00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:13.982
is a key part of the scientific method,

00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:16.540
is what you do in this third step,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.651
is that you try to create
an explanation, but what's

00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:23.126
key is that it is a testable explanation.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:27.268
So, you try to create a testable

00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:30.147
explanation.

00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:32.524
Testable explanation,
and this is kind of the

00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:34.900
core, one of the core
pillars of the scientific

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.780
method, and this testable
explanation is called

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.260
your hypothesis.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.440
Your hypothesis.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.140
And so, in this particular
case, a testable

00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:49.631
explanation could be
that, well the ocean is

00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:52.302
made up of salt water, and this pond is

00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:54.620
fresh water, so your testable explanation

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.671
could be salt water,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.660
salt water has lower freezing point.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.214
Has lower freezing,

00:03:05.214 --> 00:03:08.384
freezing point.

00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:09.785
Lower freezing point, so it takes colder

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:14.840
temperatures to freeze
it than fresh water.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.180
Than fresh water.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.959
So, this, right over here, this would

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.483
be a good hypothesis.

00:03:20.483 --> 00:03:22.196
It doesn't matter
whether the hypothesis is

00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:23.017
actually true or not.

00:03:23.017 --> 00:03:24.869
We haven't actually run
the experiment, but it's

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:26.998
a good one, because we can construct an

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.965
experiment that tests this very well.

00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:32.402
Now, what would be an example of a bad

00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:34.124
hypothesis or of something
that you couldn't

00:03:34.124 --> 00:03:35.844
even necessarily consider as part of the

00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:37.112
scientific method?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.080
Well, you could say that there is a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.840
fairy that blesses that blesses, let's

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.719
say that performs magic,

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:54.719
performs magic

00:03:55.463 --> 00:03:57.038
on the pond

00:03:59.286 --> 00:04:01.499
to freeze it faster.

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.597
Freeze it faster.

00:04:05.597 --> 00:04:08.401
And, the reason why this
isn't so good is that

00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:11.367
this is not so testable,
because it's depending

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:14.293
on this fairy, and you
don't know how to convince

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:16.223
the fairy to try to do it again.

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:17.310
You haven't seen the fairy.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.017
You haven't observed the fairy.

00:04:19.017 --> 00:04:21.516
It's not based on any observation, and so

00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:23.147
this one right over here, this would not

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:26.311
be a good hypothesis for the scientific

00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:30.747
method, so we would
wanna rule that one out.

00:04:30.747 --> 00:04:34.093
So, let's go back to our
testable explanation,

00:04:34.093 --> 00:04:35.266
our hypothesis.

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:38.227
Salt water has a lower freezing
point than fresh water.

00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:42.920
Well, the next step would be to

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.380
make a prediction based
on that, and this is the

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.940
part where we're really
designing an experiment.

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:50.474
So, you could just view
all of this as designing.

00:04:50.474 --> 00:04:52.434
Let me do this in a different color.

00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:54.421
Where we wanna design an experiment.

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:58.516
Design an experiment.

00:05:00.654 --> 00:05:03.194
And in that experiments
lets say, and let's see,

00:05:03.194 --> 00:05:06.019
the next two steps I will put as

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:09.483
part of this experimental.

00:05:09.483 --> 00:05:10.641
Whoops.

00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:11.187
I messed up.

00:05:11.187 --> 00:05:13.957
Let me, I did my undo step.

00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:17.306
So, the next part that I
will do is the experiment.

00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:21.069
Experiment.

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.882
And there you go.

00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:27.214
So, the first thing is,
we'll say I take, you know,

00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:29.470
there's all sorts of things
that are going on outside.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.816
The ocean has waves.

00:05:31.816 --> 00:05:34.336
You know, maybe there are boats going by

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:36.083
that might potentially break up the ice.

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:39.189
So, I just wanna isolate
that one variable that

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.817
I care about, whether something is salt

00:05:40.817 --> 00:05:42.402
water or not, and I want a control for

00:05:42.402 --> 00:05:43.621
everything else.

00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:46.282
So, I want a control for whether there's

00:05:46.282 --> 00:05:48.659
waves or not or whether
there's wind or any

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.402
other possible explanation for why the

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:53.400
pond freezes over faster.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.021
So, what I do, in a very
controlled environment

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:58.107
I take two cups.

00:05:58.107 --> 00:05:59.195
I take two cups.

00:05:59.195 --> 00:06:02.405
That's one cup and two cups, and I put

00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:04.665
water in those cups.

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:07.036
I put water in those cups.

00:06:07.036 --> 00:06:10.952
Now, let's say I start with
distilled water, but then

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:13.985
this one stays, the
first one right over here

00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.936
stays distilled, and
distilled means that through

00:06:15.936 --> 00:06:17.914
evaporation I've taken
out all of the impurities

00:06:17.914 --> 00:06:20.084
of that water, and in the second one

00:06:20.084 --> 00:06:23.392
I take that distilled
water, and I throw a bunch

00:06:23.392 --> 00:06:24.848
of salt in it.

00:06:24.848 --> 00:06:28.888
So, this one is fresh,
very fresh, and in fact,

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.345
far fresher than you would find in a pond.

00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:31.726
It's distilled water.

00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:35.922
And then this is over
here, this is salt water.

00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:38.481
So, you wouldn't see the
salt, but just for our

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.599
visuals, you depict it.

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.885
Then we would make a prediction, and we

00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:44.039
could even view this as step 4,

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.756
our prediction.

00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:49.392
We predict that the fresh
water will freeze at

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:51.343
a higher temperature than the salt water.

00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:56.079
So, our prediction,
let's say the fresh freezes

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.470
at zero degrees Celsius,

00:07:04.492 --> 00:07:07.824
but salt doesn't.

00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:09.293
Salt water doesn't.

00:07:11.796 --> 00:07:15.703
Salt water doesn't.

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:19.608
So, what you then do is that
you test your prediction.

00:07:19.608 --> 00:07:21.254
So, then you test it.

00:07:21.254 --> 00:07:22.290
And how would you test it?

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.220
Well, you could have a
very accurate freezer that

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.776
is exactly at zero degrees
Celsius, and you put

00:07:27.776 --> 00:07:31.616
both of these cups into
it, and you wanna make

00:07:31.616 --> 00:07:32.804
sure that they're identical
and everything where

00:07:32.804 --> 00:07:33.911
you control for everything else.

00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:35.603
You control for the surface area.

00:07:35.603 --> 00:07:37.589
You control for the material of the glass.

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:39.559
You control for how much water there is.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.006
But, then you test it.

00:07:41.006 --> 00:07:44.279
Then you see what happened from your test.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:46.543
Leave it in overnight,
and if you see that the

00:07:46.543 --> 00:07:49.573
fresh water has frozen
over, so it's frozen

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:51.828
over, but the salt water
hasn't, well then that

00:07:51.828 --> 00:07:56.003
seems to validate your
testable explanation.

00:07:56.003 --> 00:07:58.644
That salt water has a
lower freezing point than

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.469
fresh water, and if it didn't
freeze, well it's like,

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:04.354
okay, well maybe that, or if
there isn't a difference,

00:08:04.354 --> 00:08:05.959
maybe either both of them
didn't freeze or both

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.498
of them did freeze, then
you might say, well, okay,

00:08:08.498 --> 00:08:10.246
that wasn't a good explanation.

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:11.505
I have to find another explanation for why

00:08:11.505 --> 00:08:15.280
the ocean seems to freeze
at a lower temperature.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.798
Or, you might say, well that's part of the

00:08:16.798 --> 00:08:18.260
explanation, but that by itself doesn't

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.117
explain it, or you
might now wanna ask even

00:08:20.117 --> 00:08:21.775
further questions about, well, when does

00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:24.559
salt water freeze, and what
else is it dependent on?

00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:25.798
Do the waves have an impact?

00:08:25.798 --> 00:08:27.440
Does the wind have an impact?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.080
So, then you can go into the process

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.660
of iterating and refining.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.040
So, you then refine,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.194
refine,

00:08:38.194 --> 00:08:41.650
refine and iterate on the process.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.656
When I'm talking about iterate, you're

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.733
doing it over again, but then, based on

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.049
the things that you've learned.

00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:48.122
So, you might come up with a more refined

00:08:48.122 --> 00:08:50.336
testable explanation, or you might come up

00:08:50.336 --> 00:08:51.962
with more experiments that could get you

00:08:51.962 --> 00:08:53.648
a better understanding of the difference

00:08:53.648 --> 00:08:55.111
between fresh and salt water, or you might

00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:57.205
try to come up with experiments for why

00:08:57.205 --> 00:09:00.167
exactly, what is it
about the salt that makes

00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:02.598
this water harder to freeze?

00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:04.223
So, that's essentially the essence of

00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:06.366
the scientific method,
and I wanna emphasize

00:09:06.366 --> 00:09:08.957
this isn't some, you know, bizarre thing.

00:09:08.957 --> 00:09:12.194
This is logical reasoning.

00:09:12.194 --> 00:09:14.666
Make a testable explanation for something

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:16.799
that you're observing
in the world, and then

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:19.102
you test it, and you
see if your explanation

00:09:19.102 --> 00:09:22.239
seems to hold up based
on the data from your

00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:24.365
test. And then whether or not it holds up,

00:09:24.365 --> 00:09:27.121
you then keep going, and
you keep refining. And you

00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:29.234
keep learning more
about the world, and the

00:09:29.234 --> 00:09:31.428
reason why this is better
than just saying, oh well,

00:09:31.428 --> 00:09:33.907
look, okay, I see the pond
has frozen over and the

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.548
ocean hasn't, it must be the
salt water, and you know,

00:09:36.548 --> 00:09:38.438
I just feel good about
that, is that you can't

00:09:38.438 --> 00:09:39.677
feel good about that.

00:09:39.677 --> 00:09:41.119
There's a million
different reasons, and you

00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:43.700
shouldn't just go on
your gut, 'cause at some

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.488
point, your gut might be right 90% of

00:09:45.488 --> 00:09:47.459
the time, but that 10%
that it's wrong, you're

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:51.481
going to be passing on
knowledge or assumptions

00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:53.736
about the world that
aren't true, and then other

00:09:53.736 --> 00:09:55.441
people are going to build
on that, and then all

00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:57.699
of our knowledge is going
to be built on kind of

00:09:57.699 --> 00:10:01.136
a shaky foundation, and
so the scientific method

00:10:01.136 --> 00:10:04.830
ensures that our foundation is strong.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.472
And I'll leave you with
the gentleman who's often

00:10:07.472 --> 00:10:10.183
considered to be the father, or one of the

00:10:10.183 --> 00:10:12.126
fathers of the scientific method.

00:10:12.126 --> 00:10:16.373
He lived in Cairo, and in what is now Egypt,

00:10:16.373 --> 00:10:20.422
nearly 1,000 or roughly
1,000 years ago. And he

00:10:20.422 --> 00:10:24.240
was a famous astronomer and
phycisist and mathematician.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.584
And his quote is a pretty
powerful one, 'cause

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.479
I think it even stands today:

00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:31.641
"The duty of the man who
investigates the writings

00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:36.641
of scientists, if learning
the truth is his goal, ..."

00:10:36.874 --> 00:10:38.433
Let me start over, just
so I can get the dramatic

00:10:38.433 --> 00:10:39.469
effect right.

00:10:39.469 --> 00:10:42.029
"The duty of the man who
investigates the writings

00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:45.260
of scientists, if learning
the truth is his goal,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.755
is to make himself an enemy of all that

00:10:48.755 --> 00:10:52.714
he reads, and ... attack it from every side.

00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:55.413
He should also suspect
himself as he performs

00:10:55.413 --> 00:10:58.535
his critical examination
of it, so that he may

00:10:58.535 --> 00:11:02.490
avoid falling into either
prejudice or leniency."

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.964
Hasan Ibn al-Haytham,
and his Latinized name

00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:07.834
is Alhazen.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.968
So, he's saying be skeptical,
and not just skeptical

00:11:09.968 --> 00:11:12.253
of what other people
write and read, but even

00:11:12.253 --> 00:11:15.093
of yourself. And another
aspect of the scientific

00:11:15.093 --> 00:11:17.190
method which is super
important is, if someone

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.648
says they made a hypothesis
and they tested and they

00:11:19.648 --> 00:11:23.069
got a result, in order for
that to be a good test and in

00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:25.613
order for that to be a good
hypothesis, that experiment

00:11:25.613 --> 00:11:27.419
has to be reproducible.

00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:28.851
Someone can't say, oh it's
only, you know, a certain

00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:31.895
time that only happens once
every 100 years and not,

00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:33.626
that that's why it happened that day.

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:35.981
It has to be reproducible,
and reproducible

00:11:35.981 --> 00:11:37.962
is key, because then
another skeptical scientist

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:40.148
like yourself can say, let me see if I can

00:11:40.148 --> 00:11:40.942
reproduce it.

00:11:40.942 --> 00:11:43.299
Let me not just believe
it, because that person

00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:45.468
looks like they're
smart, and they said that

00:11:45.468 --> 00:11:47.200
it is true.
