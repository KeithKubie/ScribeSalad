INTERVIEWER 1: You recorded
your videos together, sort of

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:08.810
are partners.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.257
ANDREA DESROSIERS: Yeah.

00:00:11.257 --> 00:00:13.424
INTERVIEWER 1: Are
you excited, nervous?

00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:14.840
ANDREA DESROSIERS:
You're excited.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.000
I can tell.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.740
He was all bouncy
when he came in.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.656
INTERVIEWER 1: Really?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.308
What was the hardest
part about the class?

00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:25.766
Or maybe about
making the projects.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.550
ANDREA DESROSIERS:
So I'll go first.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.500
For me, it was a lot of
psychological barriers.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.150
First of all, being on camera.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.420
And I think you have
shared that as well.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.880
And then just channeling the
rusty, disused, artistic part

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.419
of my brain, which really
only comes to the fore

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:51.960
when I'm under
extreme pressure and I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.610
know I have 24 hours
to get something done.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.600
But that's when I felt
the most creative.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.702
It had to be a lot
of pressure though.

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:04.077
INTERVIEWER 1:
Nathan, how did it

00:01:04.077 --> 00:01:06.604
feel doing the
second cut this time?

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:09.270
NATHAN HERNANDEZ: The second cut
I thought I had a better chance

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.840
to fix the little things and
work on putting the finishing

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.800
touches, I guess.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.275
INTERVIEWER 1: Do you feel
different-- better, worse--

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:25.750
about being in
front of the camera?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.476
Same?

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:27.976
NATHAN HERNANDEZ:
Probably the same.

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:28.790
INTERVIEWER 1:
Probably the same.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.180
NATHAN HERNANDEZ: I don't think
it got any worse, at the very

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.001
least.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.925
INTERVIEWER 1: That's good.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:34.849
INTERVIEWER 2: How are
you feeling right now?

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:36.265
INTERVIEWER 1:
Yeah, like you guys

00:01:36.265 --> 00:01:38.860
are being super natural
right now, totally on camera.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.636
NATHAN HERNANDEZ: I have my
nervous leg [LAUGHTER] shake.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.130
INTERVIEWER 1:
But, I don't know.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.612
I feel like a lot of people
were selling themselves short,

00:01:49.612 --> 00:01:51.604
thinking that they were
not good on camera.

00:01:51.604 --> 00:01:53.596
But you guys were on
camera the entire time

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:54.592
the class was going on.

00:01:54.592 --> 00:01:56.584
And everyone's very compelling.

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:59.074
Everyone's very natural.

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:01.066
What piece of advice
would you give

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.058
to people who would be
interested in making

00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:04.054
educational videos?

00:02:06.684 --> 00:02:08.100
NATHAN HERNANDEZ:
I guess it would

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.990
be to try not to worry too
much about the actual part

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.770
where you're on camera
because it's painful,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.770
but if you keep doing
it enough times,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.760
eventually you'll get a
cut where you say something

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.260
all right.

00:02:30.656 --> 00:02:34.592
INTERVIEWER 1: So this
class was super high-paced,

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:36.068
very condensed.

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:40.496
Do you think it would work
as a semester-long class?

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:42.707
Or do you prefer it as
sort of this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:42.707 --> 00:02:44.290
ANDREA DESROSIERS:
Oh, I would love it

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.110
as a semester-long class, in
particular because learning

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.400
editing, more advanced editing
techniques, learning more about

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.900
animation, which I think
for an educational video is

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.730
really critical to convey
the ideas that you want to.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.430
And I know that's one thing I
didn't really have time to do.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.690
And that made me sad.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.734
Oh well.

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.520
INTERVIEWER 1: How
about you, Nathan?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.520
NATHAN HERNANDEZ: More
or less the same feeling.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.880
I feel like there's things
that could be expanded on.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.680
But I also do like the idea
that you just have three weeks,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.560
and at the end you've
got something out

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.373
of it, which is also cool.
