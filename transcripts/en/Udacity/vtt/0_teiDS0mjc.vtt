00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
When it comes to paid marketing, you're
going to want to give it some extra

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.973
thought, and consider a few
things before going out there and

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:07.543
paying to acquire new customers.

00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:11.025
After all, we are a start-up so
we want to spend our money wisely.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.825
Now, if you want to make sure
your growth is sustainable and

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:16.865
your money is well spent,
you want to keep in mind a few metrics.

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:21.767
Starting with ARPU or your average
revenue per customer, the LTV or

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:26.501
lifetime value per customer, and
the CPA cost per acquisition.

00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:29.652
Now, you want to think about how much
money you're willing to spend per

00:00:29.652 --> 00:00:31.132
customer to get them in the door.

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:34.523
So these are the things you need
to consider to determine this.

00:00:34.523 --> 00:00:37.529
So there's your ARPU,
your average revenue per user.

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:41.398
So how much money are you going to
make per given customer over a certain

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:42.127
time frame?

00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:46.401
Knowing your ARPU and your retention
rate, so how long you're keeping your

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.358
customers with you can help you
calculate your lifetime value or LTV.

00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:53.094
Your LTV is the amount of money
you're likely to make from

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:56.742
a given customer over the time that
they're affiliated with your company.

00:00:56.742 --> 00:01:00.818
Okay, let's take the lifetime
value of a gym member for example.

00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:05.269
So let's say the member spends $20
a month over three years on their

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.180
membership.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.213
So that's $20 a month for
12 months for three years,

00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:13.589
giving you a total
lifetime value of $720 for

00:01:13.589 --> 00:01:17.964
that one customer in total revenue,
about $240 per year.

00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:21.385
Now, for startups who haven't
acquired any customers yet,

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:24.164
determining your LTV is
nearly impossible to do.

00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:27.526
But since it's so helpful in
helping you define your goals and

00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:31.921
setting a baseline, It's really worth an
effort to at least estimate it based on

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:35.607
the number of transactions a given
customer will make over a month or

00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:36.598
even over a year.

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:38.501
Okay, let's take a aBARKment for
example.

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:43.144
We charge $20 a month as a fee for
sitters to be listed on our site.

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:47.338
And every time they get a sitting job,
we get 15% of what they're charging,

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:49.982
which averages out to be
around $15 per month.

00:01:49.982 --> 00:01:54.241
And most sitters stay with us for
about 24 months, so

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.680
this makes their lifetime value $840.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.568
Your LTV and average revenue per
user is going to help drive how

00:02:01.568 --> 00:02:05.005
much you're willing to
spend to get new customers.

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.866
So, if our cost per acquisition is
too close to our lifetime value or

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.551
average revenue per user,
then we're doing something wrong.

00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:16.937
However, if our cost per
acquisition is $70 per sitter,

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:21.583
we're profiting about $770 per
sitter we have on our site.

00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:25.599
This should make our average revenue
per user higher than how much it costs

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.665
us to gain that user,
which is really what your goal is.

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:33.009
One thing I want to point out is you
should be looking at your LTV or

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:34.306
ARPU per segment.

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:36.338
Think back to market
segmentation about this.

00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:40.038
That way you can determine how much you
could have paid to acquire different

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:41.690
users from different segments.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.588
For example, if we decide to have our
dog owners pay a $50 monthly fee,

00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:49.748
and then we get 15% of
all of their bookings,

00:02:49.748 --> 00:02:54.488
which average out to about $22.50
a month and they stay with us for

00:02:54.488 --> 00:02:58.280
three years,
we're looking at an LTV of $2,610.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.312
So we know we can spend more to
gain dog owners, because their

00:03:01.312 --> 00:03:05.362
lifetime value is significantly higher
than the lifetime value of dog sitters.

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:08.143
Now, if your company has
different subscriptions,

00:03:08.143 --> 00:03:11.540
you may see that people in one
subscription group have a much lower

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.962
lifetime value than somebody
from another subscription group.

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:18.718
That'll help you determine how much you
want to spend on getting people into

00:03:18.718 --> 00:03:20.396
different subscription tiers.

00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:24.006
For example, if people in the lowest
paying subscription don't stay with

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:24.635
you as long,

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:27.918
you're not going to want to spend as
much to acquire them as a customer.

00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:31.439
However, if people in, say your
platinum level stay with you for

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.807
a long time and
spend a ton of money with you,

00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:37.601
you can be willing to spend a little
bit more to acquire that customer.

00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.677
Now having said that,
our company is a marketplace.

00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:45.549
So in order to maintain this healthy
marketplace We have to ensure both

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.962
supply and demand.

00:03:46.962 --> 00:03:50.593
So sometimes we may need to spend more
on sitters to sustain our supply or

00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:52.116
else the company would fail.

00:03:52.116 --> 00:03:55.007
Being a company the offers to
babysit your dog without people

00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:57.967
to actually babysit the dog,
it wouldn't work out too well.

00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:02.497
So these metrics are valid across online
customer acquisition channels and

00:04:02.497 --> 00:04:04.132
they're just beginning.

00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:05.977
You can also consider conversions.

00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:10.872
So, how many people actually become
customers, bounce rates for emails and

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:14.197
even traffic from specific channels and
much more.

00:04:14.197 --> 00:04:17.632
We'll talk more about a few of these
during this lesson and the next.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.814
So let's hear from Talley about
her advice on paid marketing.

00:04:20.814 --> 00:04:23.880
And then, we'll start talking
about our first channel, SEM, or

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.150
search engine marketing.
