00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's start. I am Atsuku Matsumura president of the Diamond Dining Group

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's begin

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.000
Skip this

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.000
At Diamond Dining Group we work in the restaurant business

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.000
Amusement business and overseas wedding business as a company listed on the first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.058
It may not be obvious, but I am a president of a Tokyo Stock Exchange listed company

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.000
And

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.000
Our company has about 5000 employees, and over 277 stores

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.000
We have 192 stores along major stations on the Yamanote line

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.905
The 192 stores in Yamanote major stations

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.000
Is the most in restaurant companies

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.000
Then

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.454
For everyone here working in Roppongi Hills

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:02.833
I would like to introduce 13 stores that we have around the Roppongi and Azabujuban area

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.000
First, since I am from Koushi prefecture

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.000
This is the Kouchi's local dish Katsuo Warayaki

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.000
It is very delicious

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.000
Next is

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:16.263
Imaiya main branch in Roppongi, it is a Yakitori restaurant

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:18.182
This is also in front too

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:21.000
Then we have Bishokumaimon

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.000
This is by the entrance of Imoaraizaka

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.000
Then

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.000
1967

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.000
This is because I was born in 1967

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.000
Myself, along with Kenichi Inamoto from Zetton

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:41.000
There is a designer named Yasumichi Morita who happens to also be the husband of Mao Daichi

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.000
This is a store created by the 3 of us, and we were all born in 1967, so we named it that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.000
There is a lot of champagne in this place

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.000
When you get to your seat, there is a champagne cooler right in front of you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.000
And champagne bottles sticks out from there

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.000
The champagne just opens up on its own

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.000
In a month, there was a time that we sold 800 bottles of Moet

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.000
It is a champagne filled store

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.000
Next is

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.000
Public Six

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.000
It is a new sports bar in front of 1967

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.000
And then we have

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.000
Carpet Tokyo

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.000
A lot of money had been spent on this one

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.000
It is on the 2nd floor where Public Six is, and a lot of money was spent on the carpets

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.000
It is definitely a classy restaurant

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.000
Yakitori Shinoda

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.000
This is a membership only store

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.000
It is the most expensive Yakitori restaurant in Japan

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.000
Please ask your boss to take you

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.000
Then

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.000
Also a membership only restaurant

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.000
Since I am from Tosa of Kouchi prefecture, we made the Tosa Cuisine Restaurant "Katsuhama"

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.000
Then we have

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.070
This place called Under

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:57.448
This is also a membership only bar

00:02:57.531 --> 00:02:58.574
Then

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.000
There is a hotel in front of the station

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.000
Within the Roppongi Hills district

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.000
Here, we have a beer themed store Glass Dance

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.000
The Steak Roppongi, this is a steakhouse

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.000
We also have in our amusement section called Bagus

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.000
You can play billiards, darts, table tennis

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.000
There is also golf simulation, and various games and entertainment

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.000
You can easily get hooked when you go

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.000
In line with this

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.000
We also have a cyber café, or an internet café

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.000
It is a Manga café

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.000
This is also something we have

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.000
So

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.000
Let's get into today's topic

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.000
I'd like to present today's topic

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.000
I, Matsumura, read "Ten Things I Know to be True"

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.000
I was strongly moved, and thought about the affinity it had on my business

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.000
The title is

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.000
"Atsuku Matsumura's Ten Things I Know to be True"

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.000
Thank you for finding it funny

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.000
Focus on the user and all else will follow.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.000
Focus on the user and all else will follow.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.000
Always think form the perspective of the user

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.000
Our company philosophy when we were founded is to "provide joy to the customers"

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.000
It has something in common

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.000
How can we give an enjoyable experience to the user, or the customers that come in

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.000
Not from what is beneficial to the company, but what would bring joy to the customer

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.000
In our strategy for opening stores, first thing we consider is "what is needed in the location or the market"

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.000
From a line of business that we wanted to do, we created 100 stores of 100 different lines of businesses that the users wanted to have

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.000
Each store had a different type of business, and we were able to achieve opening 100 stores

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.000
And, as an effort to understand from the perspective of the user

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.000
We implemented DD miles, where the customer that made the reservation would benefit from

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.000
For example, if the host reserved for 10 people, then they would also receive miles for 10 people

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.000
And, we also have a call center

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.000
We also have user support within our headquarters when reservations cannot be made directly to the store

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.000
Let us go to the second one

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.000
It's best to do one thing really, really well.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.000
It's best to do one thing really, really well.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.000
It is best to strengthen things that you are good at

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.000
What can we do?

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.000
To be able to make it better, every since we were a small company

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.000
We had in-house advertising and designers

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.000
And, in the restaurant industry back then, it was very unique to have them in-house

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.000
We recruited specialists of different genres and for financial affairs, business planning, store development, and we trained them

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.000
As a result, our design team built a great reputation

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.452
And, our advertising team also built a great reputation, and we continued to have great impact on the industry

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.000
Then, we were not a design company but

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.000
We received the gold award for the "20th All Japan DM Awards"

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.000
This is usually rewarded to a design company

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.000
But, a restaurant business received this award, which created much controversy

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.973
We also strengthened our service

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.726
About 10 years ago our company had the reputation of

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.000
the store being colorful but nothing more, and having terrible service, and bad food quality

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.000
To resolve this

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.000
There is S1 Grand Prix, it is the Service Grand Prix

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.000
We currently join the S1 Grand Prix

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.000
And, we were able to receive the first prize

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.000
This year, the finals is on March 15th

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.000
There are 2 finals from Tokyo

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.000
And 1 finals in Osaka, and all three are monopolized by our company

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.000
We are pretty despized because of this

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.000
If you do too well, especially that Japanese has a culture of rooting for the underdog

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.971
If you are doing to well, it is not looked upon on very well

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.308
Fast is better than slow

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:55.894
Fast is better than slow

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.358
Speed multiplied by success angle is what I think is growth

00:07:03.444 --> 00:07:06.697
We have used the business line development and M&amp;A strategy

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.576
It is quite difficult to create each one and separate businesses

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.538
We were creating these stores that all had separate concepts

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:16.000
It was very difficult

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.335
With M&amp;A, we also use this to buy time

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:22.796
We usually remodel our stores

00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:25.466
With M&amp;A, we also take the strategy of buying time

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:31.680
This is how much we've used the M&amp;A strategy, from small businesses to larger scaled businesses

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:37.978
In the restaurant industry, I believe there is the 30 billion Yen limit

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:41.732
The moment it goes close to 30 billion Yen, it stalls

00:07:42.483 --> 00:07:43.567
For example

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:46.987
If I mention the name I might get in trouble

00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:53.994
These companies growth has stalled the moment it reached 30 billion Yen

00:07:54.328 --> 00:07:58.415
The reason behind this may vary, such as the charisma of the owner had been lost

00:07:58.499 --> 00:08:00.334
Obsolescence of the brand

00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:04.922
They had been blinded too much by successful strategies and experiences, that they were not able to deliver anything new anymore

00:08:04.963 --> 00:08:08.050
They were not able to adapt to changes, and they lack innovation

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:10.928
There was an employee that said something like this

00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:13.000
There are 3 things you will need to innovate

00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:20.562
First thing is, the young ones, outsiders, and idiots, these are the 3 things you need

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:23.649
We can have young people by recruiting fresh graduates

00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:27.694
We can have outsiders by recruiting experienced people

00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:30.364
Then, for the idiot, we have you president, so we should be set

00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:32.157
I told him to hold his tongue

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:35.452
When these 3 come together, that is when innovation can happen for the first time

00:08:35.494 --> 00:08:36.620
And

00:08:36.828 --> 00:08:39.915
M&amp;A is an effective growth strategy

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:46.004
When we reached 30 billion Yen

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:48.799
We also fell in this hole

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:51.552
And, for about 5 years, we were struggling

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.306
Because of this, we used the strategy of speed times success angle

00:08:56.557 --> 00:09:01.353
Refine regenerating skills, secure talented personnel, excellent location strategy

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:05.983
Frequent business decision equals to acquiring decision-making skills, and has the potential of a good chemistry

00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:09.570
I think there is only growth to happen

00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:18.579
Democracy on the web works.

00:09:18.912 --> 00:09:21.123
Democracy on the web works.

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:25.043
In company growth, girl power is a must

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:30.632
At Diamond Dining, our ratio of female employees is as the following

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:34.595
Headquarters female managerial positions 42%

00:09:34.761 --> 00:09:37.222
Overall female employees 43%

00:09:37.306 --> 00:09:39.725
Fresh graduates female employees 55%

00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:41.310
We have a lot of female employees

00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:46.273
We also have GAGA WOMAN

00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:48.900
This is the female version of our internal newsletter

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:51.403
That is my secretary

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.280
She is on the cover

00:09:53.989 --> 00:09:59.161
Also, I am very strict to male employees

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:02.873
But, I never scold female employees

00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:05.083
Can you guess why?

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:08.503
It is simple

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:09.796
It's this

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:13.634
"I don't want to be hated by women." It is as simple as that

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:16.386
I want to have a harmonious time at work

00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:19.139
So, I try not to tell off female employees as much

00:10:20.557 --> 00:10:23.310
You don't need to be at your desk to need an answer

00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:28.065
You don't need to be at your desk to need an answer

00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:31.193
Look into 100 stores, this is very important

00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:36.281
If you want to make a Yakiniku restaurant, look into 100 existing Yakiniku restaurants, you will not fail

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:40.535
If you look into 100 stores, you can take the good parts, and not copy the bad parts

00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:43.163
If you do this, you will not fail

00:10:43.413 --> 00:10:45.290
Look into 100 stores, this is a good phrase

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.627
Creative starts from the eye

00:10:48.835 --> 00:10:51.963
If you do not look at a wide range of things, you will not be able to build anything

00:10:52.297 --> 00:10:55.842
The best way is to travel, and go to many different places

00:10:55.967 --> 00:10:58.762
But of course we don't have the time or the money for it

00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:03.141
In that case, when you go out to eat, you can look at different signages, go to different restaurants

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.561
Look into different logos, look at the menu of other companies

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.397
Or, you can watch a movie

00:11:08.397 --> 00:11:08.438
Read a book, scan through magazines
Or, you can watch a movie

00:11:08.438 --> 00:11:10.273
Read a book, scan through magazines

00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:12.651
Anyhow, it is important to expose your eyes to many things

00:11:12.818 --> 00:11:17.239
See it with your own eyes, see a lot, and it is important to shower yourself with visuals

00:11:17.322 --> 00:11:20.033
Restaurant names are also very important

00:11:20.158 --> 00:11:22.411
I haven't had time these days to do this but

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:28.709
If I have time, I would go to the book store, or the DVD rental store

00:11:28.834 --> 00:11:35.549
And look at the titles of rental movies, and I would try to remember the names in my head

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.758
Next is

00:11:38.468 --> 00:11:40.595
You can make money without doing evil

00:11:41.471 --> 00:11:44.391
You can make money without doing evil

00:11:45.767 --> 00:11:49.229
The restaurant industry has a very low profit ratio

00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:53.984
Healthy and safe ingredients must be used, and it has to be cheap

00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:55.944
Customers also expect a high quality of service

00:11:56.027 --> 00:11:58.780
There are also many complaints from the customer

00:11:58.864 --> 00:12:04.995
Your subordinates would complain, and your customer would get angry at you, and your superior would scold you

00:12:05.162 --> 00:12:06.872
It is a very hard industry to be in

00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:11.710
All types of work are hard, but if I were to be born again, I would not work in the restaurant industry

00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:14.254
This is something that I always say publicly

00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:16.423
I would work for Google

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:18.925
Next is

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.804
There's always more information out there

00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:26.475
There's always more information out there

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:29.686
Shower yourself with information

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.690
This is very true

00:12:33.774 --> 00:12:35.233
Input, input, input

00:12:35.442 --> 00:12:38.111
I said that creativity start from the eye

00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:41.448
If you do take in a lot of information, you will be left behind

00:12:41.573 --> 00:12:45.869
Because of the popularity of smartphones, I believe that work will reduce down to half

00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:51.208
This is the Gran Cyber Café

00:12:51.374 --> 00:12:52.417
It looks very cool

00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:54.836
This is what a manga café looks like these days

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:56.171
It looks very good

00:12:56.505 --> 00:13:00.842
If you do not work on gathering information, you will not be able to keep up

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:16.149
Gather information, and input, input, input

00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:19.694
I think collecting various information is the only way

00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:23.740
Because you have these drawers filled with information, when different things come your way

00:13:23.824 --> 00:13:28.620
You will be able to deal with them, experience is really something that can't be turned to money

00:13:28.703 --> 00:13:31.581
Really look into many things, the only way is to input in your head

00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:35.836
Of course, creative starts form the eye

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:37.963
But you must read books to gain knowledge

00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:42.676
It was on the news yesterday, or the day before

00:13:42.717 --> 00:13:46.012
But lately, people have stopped reading books

00:13:47.138 --> 00:13:49.808
More than half of the people do not read books anymore

00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:54.729
What do they spend their time on instead? They use their smartphones

00:13:55.605 --> 00:13:57.023
They don't read books

00:13:57.148 --> 00:14:01.027
There was also a time that I loved books

00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:04.927
But I haven't found the time to read as much anymore

00:14:05.657 --> 00:14:08.557
There is a person at the company that loves reading books

00:14:08.869 --> 00:14:10.787
His nickname is library

00:14:10.954 --> 00:14:14.624
I would let him read a particular book, and just listen to the essence of it from him

00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:16.835
Most of the time, this works

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.000
Don't you think this is a smart way to do it

00:14:20.463 --> 00:14:23.363
I would give him the book, and ask him to give me the points

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:26.845
He loves reading books, so he takes it with pleasure

00:14:26.887 --> 00:14:28.787
Then I would just ask him

00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:35.334
The need for information crosses all borders

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.630
The need for information crosses all borders

00:14:41.443 --> 00:14:43.069
About our overseas strategy

00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:46.114
Hawaii

00:14:46.489 --> 00:14:48.617
We have started to penetrate the Hawaiian market

00:14:48.658 --> 00:14:51.244
We want to be the number one restaurant business in Hawaii

00:14:51.494 --> 00:14:55.394
There are not many restaurants in Hawaii

00:14:55.582 --> 00:14:57.482
There are not many restaurant business there

00:14:57.959 --> 00:15:04.132
The language is different from Japan, the culture is different, so it's very difficult

00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:08.533
Licenses would not pass, and there also problems with the visa

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.620
It is very difficult

00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:17.667
The president of our restaurants in Hawaii

00:15:18.063 --> 00:15:21.963
He was chosen as the number one Japanese president in Hawaii 2 years in a row

00:15:22.943 --> 00:15:24.110
Hide Sakurai

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:28.740
He looks Japanese, he is born Japanese, but inside, he is completely American

00:15:29.282 --> 00:15:30.533
And

00:15:31.493 --> 00:15:35.393
I've also mentioned him earlier, but my batch mate and same age Kenichi Inamoto from Zetton

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.480
The plan is for both of them to be in charge of expanding from Hawaii

00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:40.651
to America mainland

00:15:43.964 --> 00:15:44.864
Next we have

00:15:45.882 --> 00:15:49.782
You can be serious without a suit

00:15:49.803 --> 00:15:51.703
You can be serious without a suit

00:15:54.224 --> 00:15:56.124
This boils down to our trust in employees

00:15:58.436 --> 00:16:00.021
At our company

00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:03.088
If you put it in a positive light, we implement a bold delegation of authority

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:06.903
If you put it in a less positive light, then we give all the responsibilities on the employees

00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:10.845
To create independence and proactivity among employees

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:17.308
We ask our employees to keep these 3 promises, to keep customers happy, not to leave out the concept, and to secure appropriate profit

00:16:17.539 --> 00:16:21.167
As long as they keep these rules, they can do almost anything that they want

00:16:21.209 --> 00:16:24.629
They can create the menu that they like, they can play the music that they like

00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:28.341
They can put the pricing that they like

00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:30.635
They can set the working hours at any time

00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:34.014
But, they will have to keep these 3 rules

00:16:34.222 --> 00:16:36.599
As long as they keep these 3, then they can do anything

00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:38.143
The employees have a lot of freedom

00:16:38.226 --> 00:16:39.126
And

00:16:40.145 --> 00:16:44.357
It may not seem like it, but I am also called the number one fashionista in the industry

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:48.718
So what, right?

00:16:49.904 --> 00:16:51.804
Feel free to laugh

00:16:52.323 --> 00:16:55.223
I was featured on a magazine called Forza style

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.494
Next

00:16:57.245 --> 00:17:00.145
Oh, it's a separate mook

00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:04.151
Next we have

00:17:06.004 --> 00:17:09.174
Great just isn't good enough

00:17:09.424 --> 00:17:11.324
Great just isn't good enough

00:17:12.343 --> 00:17:15.889
Not being satisfied with the current is the motivating power

00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:19.934
With humans, the moment that you feel satisfied, everything stops

00:17:20.018 --> 00:17:22.562
I think that you must keep running

00:17:22.562 --> 00:17:27.462
Always hold a high goal, and it is important to strive to be the leading company in the industry

00:17:27.817 --> 00:17:31.196
This is true, the moment you become complacent

00:17:31.196 --> 00:17:36.096
Everyone else will surpass you

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:40.059
You will only be waiting for the end

00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:42.415
You have to keep running

00:17:42.415 --> 00:17:46.315
Especially with restaurant businesses, even if you are running ahead, it doesn't mean that you will win

00:17:46.336 --> 00:17:49.236
With IT, if you are ahead, then you will win

00:17:49.589 --> 00:17:53.218
If you run way ahead of everyone, it is very hard to keep up

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.866
With the restaurant industry, it's like a game

00:17:57.347 --> 00:18:03.247
It doesn't matter if it's a store that makes 100 billion, or a small store that only makes 10,000 Yen a day

00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:05.355
It does not matter

00:18:05.396 --> 00:18:06.296
That's why it's hard

00:18:07.148 --> 00:18:08.048
It is very hard

00:18:08.233 --> 00:18:09.133
And

00:18:10.193 --> 00:18:13.093
I put importance in surprises more than anything

00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:16.616
I think surprises is what motivates me to move

00:18:16.866 --> 00:18:20.120
I love surprising customer and the audience

00:18:23.414 --> 00:18:26.960
I am from Kochi prefecture

00:18:27.127 --> 00:18:29.027
And there is a festival called the Yosakoi festival

00:18:29.712 --> 00:18:31.172
We have a team there

00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:34.008
Our company's female employees are in charge of managing this team

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.200
Let's take a look at the footage

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.120
We are Diamond Dining

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:48.000
We are declaring a rage!

00:19:00.493 --> 00:19:01.393
Yosakoi, Yosakoi

00:19:07.917 --> 00:19:09.817
Yosakoi

00:19:13.256 --> 00:19:17.385
We join every year, and we've joined for 3 times so far, and this year will be our 4th

00:19:17.385 --> 00:19:19.596
This year, we want to get the highest award

00:19:19.721 --> 00:19:21.621
Then

00:19:23.057 --> 00:19:26.957
We also host year-end parties for 150 restaurant business executives

00:19:27.353 --> 00:19:29.253
Restaurant owners are very spoiled

00:19:29.814 --> 00:19:32.150
So it's very hard to hold an event like this

00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:33.133
And

00:19:34.068 --> 00:19:36.968
We also host about 30 birthday parties a year

00:19:39.032 --> 00:19:39.932
And

00:19:44.037 --> 00:19:48.249
I'd like to remind again that I am a president of a listed company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:49.316
And

00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:53.361
Here is Hikari GENJI

00:19:56.424 --> 00:19:58.324
I've also done Spiderman

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:02.329
Beethoven

00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:06.017
I have never seen Beethoven, so I'm not very sure

00:20:06.392 --> 00:20:08.311
This is the Beethoven within my fantasy

00:20:11.147 --> 00:20:13.316
This is another Beethoven

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.330
Rassun Gorerai

00:20:47.475 --> 00:20:49.269
I've actually done a lot

00:20:49.435 --> 00:20:51.354
This is Star Wars at the year-end party

00:20:51.437 --> 00:20:55.337
We didn't have much budget, I am the one in the gold

00:20:56.484 --> 00:21:00.384
This C-3PO is terrible

00:21:01.614 --> 00:21:07.514
And, there's also Piko Taro, I thought I had to do it right away

00:21:07.704 --> 00:21:09.622
We looked for one all over Japan

00:21:09.706 --> 00:21:13.293
Then we found one from the Tokyu Hands in Shinsaibashi Osaka

00:21:13.334 --> 00:21:16.234
We reserved, and had it delivered from Osaka

00:21:17.005 --> 00:21:18.905
Then

00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:20.865
That is Piko Taro

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:24.304
At the menu grandprix

00:21:24.304 --> 00:21:29.851
SEKAI NO OSAWARI, all are employees except for myself

00:21:29.892 --> 00:21:33.792
The one in purple hair is myself, and the others are employees

00:21:34.355 --> 00:21:35.565
Then

00:21:35.857 --> 00:21:38.757
We dressed up as Kouji Kikawa and did a Complex

00:21:41.988 --> 00:21:45.616
I was invited to a friend's birthday party

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.600
They told me to do a band, and I said I can only do an air band

00:21:48.828 --> 00:21:51.728
So, we took part as an air band

00:21:51.914 --> 00:21:56.814
It was a proper band house, and I think it gave the look of an actual band

00:22:16.189 --> 00:22:17.089
It looks like this

00:22:19.442 --> 00:22:20.342
And

00:22:23.529 --> 00:22:25.429
Can you tell what this is?

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.640
Sunshine

00:22:27.617 --> 00:22:38.517
There is an extremely good-looking actor named Saito-san, and I copied his character in the show Gakinotsukai

00:22:39.003 --> 00:22:39.903
Then

00:22:40.963 --> 00:22:42.715
I do calligraphy as well

00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:47.220
When I tried it out, it turned out pretty well

00:22:47.512 --> 00:22:49.263
Please take a look

00:23:22.755 --> 00:23:26.655
That is Hatsudori, the first cockcrowing of the year, I wrote it in one take in the new years

00:23:26.968 --> 00:23:29.868
I think it turned out good

00:23:30.346 --> 00:23:33.546
Then

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.460
I would like to say this again, but I put importance in surprises more than anything

00:23:40.064 --> 00:23:41.964
Being great is not good enough

00:23:42.108 --> 00:23:45.008
Surprise is number one

00:23:46.863 --> 00:23:49.115
Finally

00:23:49.365 --> 00:23:53.265
I would like to share with everyone my favorite quote

00:23:55.621 --> 00:23:57.331
My favorite quote is

00:23:57.498 --> 00:24:01.627
Rockets are not made as an extension of an airplane

00:24:01.627 --> 00:24:04.527
It was made from the desire of the passion to go to the moon

00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:08.801
Rockets are not made as an extension of an airplane

00:24:08.926 --> 00:24:11.826
It was made from the desire of the passion to go to the moon

00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:12.746
I'd like to ask

00:24:13.306 --> 00:24:15.975
What is your moon?

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.000
I always think about this when I work

00:24:22.648 --> 00:24:25.548
I , Matsumura, will always feel like a Google employee in the inside

00:24:28.529 --> 00:24:30.429
Thank you for listening
