00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we are going to look into the strange behavior concerning the two solutions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that start at almost the same point.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is about deterministic chaos.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Implement the forward Euler method for the Lorenz system

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and do this computation for two initial conditions

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that are only slightly--every so slightly--different from each other.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Our program will eventually plot how the distance between these two trajectories evolves.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
