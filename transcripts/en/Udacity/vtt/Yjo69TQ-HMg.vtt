Step five in the object or in analysis process has to do with relationships.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.090
The main elements in the class model diagram are going to correspond classes and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.100
relationships. And we're going to depict the classes ash compartmentized,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.880
rectangles and relationships are going to be indicated by

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.640
lines connecting the rectangles. And there are going to be three different

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.250
kinds of relationships that we'll look at. One kind is generalization, and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.620
that's indicated by a line at, and at one end of the line will be a little

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.070
open triangle. The second kind is called aggregation.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.680
This is going to be used for situations like what we mentioned parts of, and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.050
in this case, the line ends with an open diamond, and then if we don't

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.760
have any adornment on the line at all, that's going to be a general association.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.870
So let's look at each of those three categories of relationships and

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.930
see if we can find examples of them in our, our example problem.
