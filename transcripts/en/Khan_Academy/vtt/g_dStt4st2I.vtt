00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:01.948
- [Voiceover] Let's do another example of

00:00:01.948 --> 00:00:04.931
using a virtual compass
and virtual straight edge

00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:08.228
to draw a tangent line to a circle.

00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:10.631
And now we're told to
construct a line going through

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:12.210
P tangent to the circle.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.507
And in this example, P
doesn't sit on this circle,

00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:17.388
P is outside of the circle.

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:19.466
So we wanna draw something like,

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.995
and actually let me get
my straight edge out.

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:28.165
So my straight edge, and I
have my controls up here,

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:29.651
this is on the Kahn Academy exercise

00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:31.369
Constructing a Line Tangent to a Circle,

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.391
so I have that up there.

00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:34.411
So let me add the straight edge.

00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:36.431
Once again, you could try to eyeball it.

00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:39.391
We're gonna go through P, going
to be tangent to the circle,

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:41.852
so hey yeah, maybe something like that.

00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:43.907
That looks pretty good,
but like we've said

00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:46.484
in other geometric constructions videos,

00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:48.353
that's just eyeballing it, we don't know

00:00:48.353 --> 00:00:50.652
how precise that actually is.

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:52.649
So what if we had a compass
and a straight edge,

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.669
how do we make something more precise?

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:55.864
And actually in the process of doing it,

00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:57.606
we'll make really fun patterns.

00:00:57.606 --> 00:00:59.405
So how do we do that?

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:02.064
Well, what I'm gonna do is,

00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:04.443
I'm gonna try to construct a circle

00:01:04.443 --> 00:01:08.565
that has the segment PC

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:11.397
as a diameter.

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:15.616
So let me draw that.

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.821
So I wanna construct a circle that has

00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:21.919
segment PC as a diameter.

00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:25.813
And in order to do that, I need to

00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:27.496
figure out where the
center of that circle is.

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:29.307
And you'll see in a second
why it's useful to have

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:31.687
this circle that has PC as a diameter.

00:01:31.687 --> 00:01:33.289
So where is the center?

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.554
It looks like it's roughly here,

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:35.936
but how do we actually construct it?

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:36.876
To do that, we're gonna have to figure out

00:01:36.876 --> 00:01:40.986
the midpoint of segment PC, or CP.

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:43.795
And to do that, what I'm gonna do is

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:45.792
construct two circles.

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:47.986
I'll just make 'em a little bit larger.

00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:50.067
So one centered at C.

00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:54.983
I'll make it reasonably
large, maybe that big.

00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:57.259
Then I'm gonna construct another circle

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.277
of the same radius

00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.285
as that large one that I just constructed,

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:03.737
so it's that same radius.

00:02:03.737 --> 00:02:06.174
But I'm now going to center it at P.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.059
Now why is this interesting?

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.381
Why is what I just did interesting?

00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:17.155
Well where these two
larger circles intersect

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:20.859
are going to be equidistant to P and C.

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.031
How do we know that?

00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:24.933
Well all the points on this
circle are equidistant to C,

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:27.871
all the points on this
circle are equidistant to P,

00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:30.111
and these circles have the same radius.

00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:31.899
And at this point right over here,

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:33.373
they are equidistant to both of them,

00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:35.416
because it sits on both circles.

00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.715
So this point is
equidistant to both of them,

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:39.932
and so is this point right over here.

00:02:39.932 --> 00:02:42.289
And so they both sit on the perpendicular

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.529
bisector of this segment.

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.969
Of the segment CP.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.675
So actually let me draw that.

00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:50.752
So if I draw a line that
looks something like this,

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:53.550
this right over here is
a perpendicular bisector

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.392
of line, of segment CP.

00:02:57.392 --> 00:02:59.714
Now what we really just care about is that

00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:01.850
it is bisecting it, 'cause we wanted

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.475
to find the midpoint.

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.611
And now that we have found
the midpoint of our segment,

00:03:05.611 --> 00:03:08.328
we're ready to construct
that circle I talked about.

00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:11.451
A circle centered at the midpoint,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.347
and it has CP as a diameter.

00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:20.526
So I got that far, but
why did I go through

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:22.523
all of this trouble to do that?

00:03:22.523 --> 00:03:24.987
Well now we're going to use the idea

00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:28.470
that if you have a triangle
embedded in a circle

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.210
where one side of the
triangle is a diameter,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.170
then you're going to
have a right triangle.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.830
Well what am I talking about?

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.047
Let me actually just draw the triangle.

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:40.369
So let me add a straight edge here.

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.482
So I'm gonna draw a triangle,

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:44.444
so it has one side as the diameter,

00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:46.127
so we're gonna embed it in this circle

00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:48.089
that I just constructed,
this circle centered

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.307
at this midpoint, this
circle right over here.

00:03:50.307 --> 00:03:52.431
CP is clearly our diameter.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.788
And I'm gonna embed it
in CP, but I'm gonna

00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:56.366
put it in this point right over here,

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:59.385
'cause this point sits on
the circle centered at C.

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:02.566
And I'm gonna draw another line.

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:07.000
So this other line, let me put
that there, and this there.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.306
So my claim is that this
is a right triangle.

00:04:10.306 --> 00:04:11.537
How do I make this claim,

00:04:11.537 --> 00:04:13.081
and I've proved it in other videos,

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:14.717
is it's embedded in a circle,

00:04:14.717 --> 00:04:16.587
it's embedded in this
circle right over here

00:04:16.587 --> 00:04:18.479
that's highlighted in yellow.

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.101
It has a diameter for one of its sides,

00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:24.086
and that side is actually its hypotenuse.

00:04:24.086 --> 00:04:26.477
So and we prove it in other videos.

00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:29.066
So this is a right triangle.

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:31.597
Well why is this useful for proving,

00:04:31.597 --> 00:04:34.476
or why is this useful for
constructing a tangent line

00:04:34.476 --> 00:04:36.484
to this circle over here?

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.760
To circle centered at C?

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.256
Well, this side right over
here that I have in orange,

00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:43.078
that I'm highlighting right now,

00:04:43.078 --> 00:04:44.785
that's the radius of C.

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:46.224
And if that forms the right angle

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:47.733
with this line right over here,

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:51.580
then this line right over
here must be tangent.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.811
And to really make it look tangent,

00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:54.808
I'll elongate it a little
bit just like that.

00:04:54.808 --> 00:04:55.725
And there you go.

00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:57.246
You feel good that this looks like

00:04:57.246 --> 00:04:59.521
it's truly intersecting at a right angle,

00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:01.146
and that this segment
that I'm highlighting

00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:03.921
in orange right now, is truly tangent.

00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:06.486
So once again, a lot more trouble

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:08.669
than just eyeballing it and trying to

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.550
draw it and actually,
a lot of you probably

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.546
could have eyeballed this
segment right over here.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:14.009
But if you're doing
something on a larger scale,

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.459
you wanna be more precise,
it's useful to be able

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:17.840
to do these constructions.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.127
And frankly, while you're
in the process here,

00:05:20.127 --> 00:05:21.961
while you're dealing with the compass and

00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:23.505
the ruler or the straight edge,

00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:26.106
you get a new appreciation
for what these tools can do,

00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:27.998
and you're also making some pretty

00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:30.378
fun patterns and designs.

00:05:30.378 --> 00:05:33.046
I almost feel like hanging
this one up on my wall.
