to connect with millennials,

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:09.609
especially for Machiavellian
mamaw Hillary Clinton.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.277
That's why she...

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.113
That's why she took to young
peoples' social network Snapchat

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.682
this week to post a video
of her with some lady pals,

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:20.720

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.372

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.609
