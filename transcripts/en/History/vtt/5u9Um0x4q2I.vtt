00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.270
FRANK: Steve?

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.200
Linda?
LINDA: Hi.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.370
FRANK: How you doing?
I'm Frank.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.470
Hey, I'm Mike.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.400
Nice to meet you.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.400
Hello.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.470
LINDA: Trying to
clean up a little bit.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.570
FRANK: Woo!

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.870
It looks like you guys
are packed in here.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.230
LINDA: Yeah we are.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.570
MIKE: So she was saying that
there was three generations--

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.070
Yeah.
My grandfather--

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.270
MIKE: --of stuff in the house.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.730
--and then my dad
who was the big--

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.930
FRANK: A big collector?

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.100
MIKE: He was the one that
was most responsible?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.400
If you could call
it a collection.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.430
MIKE: OK.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.300
The collecting in
our family is pretty

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.830
much contagious throughout.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.000
Everybody caught the bug.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.300
Great granddad, granddad,
mom and dad, me, my son.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.530
So, yeah, it just
goes on and on.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.700
That's some of the stuff that
we're kind of interested in.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.730
I mean--

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.100
Yeah, I think we'll
have most of that.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.330
So you guys-- we
heard that nobody's been

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.100
here like for 20 years.
- That's correct.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.530
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.470
MIKE: What made y'all all of
a sudden just start thinking,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.400
hey?

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.470
STEVE: Time to
start cleaning up.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.400
LINDA: My husband
said, Linda, we can't

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.700
leave a mess like we've had.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700
She's trying not to
leave a mess for me.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.070
MIKE: Oh, OK.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.670
So you collect too?
- I do.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.800
And you can come see
me in about 20 years

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.030
and look at my collection.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.070
MIKE: Yeah.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.170
STEVE: If you think
this is something,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.500
walk over here and look at this.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.370
FRANK: What we got?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.600
Wow.
Yeah.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.930
MIKE: Oh my gosh.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.370
LINDA: This is a lot of my
junk until you get back there,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.000
and that's my grandfather's.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.200
MIKE: Oh your grandfather's
stuff is in here too?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.500
OK.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.230
FRANK: I can see something
right now I'm interested in.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.270
LINDA: What's that?

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.070
FRANK: What about
these Maytag motors?

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.200
These would of went
in washing machines.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.270
STEVE: All right.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.000
FRANK: And these were
some of the first

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.700
gasoline-powered appliances.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.300
A lot like a hit and miss motor.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.470
You know, they used to run.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.370
They were the heart of the farm.
STEVE: Right.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.530
FRANK: I mean they
ran everything.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.100
Maytag Motors were made
for washing machines.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.670
Most the time I
step right over 'em.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.700
I don't care about 'em.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.330
But these are twin cylinders.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.770
They're opposed motors,
so not locked up.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.970
They're a little harder to find.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.500
STEVE: That's crazy that
things ran on gas back then.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.100
FRANK: Well this
was the very first--

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.900
very first thing that ran on gas
as far as appliances and stuff.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.170
STEVE: OK.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.430
FRANK: They don't command
a lot of money, you know.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.070
There's hit and miss
shows and stuff.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.330
They bring a little
bit more money.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.800
But on both of 'em, $125?

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.370
How about $150
for both of 'em?

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.830
That's two of 'em.
FRANK: Yeah, I know.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.600
I mean, they obviously
don't run, you know.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.970
True.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.830
But if you give me $150
we'll give you a better

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.900
deal on something else.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.130
We'll get along fine.
- We'll get along?

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.800
OK.
I want to get along fine.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.870
OK.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.570
I've got a lot of
stuff to look through.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.470
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.430
- A lot of stuff.
- Very good.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.570
STEVE: Well, dig in.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.070
These were toys that
you played with Linda?

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.570
Yes.
Sure did.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.400
Do you remember Jumbo,
blowing the bubbles?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.770
LINDA: Oh yeah.
I loved that.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.830
I got that about 1958, '59.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.970
FRANK: Yeah.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.170
I got a couple of these
and they are so cool.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.570
They're battery-operated.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.670
They have a little cup.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.700
You put a little bit of
dish-washing soap in it.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.730
It bends down, picks it up, and
then it blows air through it,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.970
which makes a bubble come out.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.030
Problem with battery-operated
toys, once they set,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.670
they don't work.
- Right.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.130
The box is a little--

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.270
it is what it is.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.300
LINDA: Yeah.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.270
What would you have
to have for this?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.630
Oh, $30.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.730
Right on the button.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.830
See, we're thinking
the same now.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.130
- OK.
- We're getting there.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.130
All right.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.200
STEVE: She's treating you right.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.800
We're talking the
same language now.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.000
FRANK: You got it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.070
Bubbles-- I used to love
to play with that thing.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.870
STEVE: I was kind of
surprised she sold that.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.330
But--

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.370
Surprise, surprise.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.370
Yeah, it's a good thing.
