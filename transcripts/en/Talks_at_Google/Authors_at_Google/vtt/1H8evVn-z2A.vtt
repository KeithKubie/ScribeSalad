ADAM LEONARD: Hello my name is
Adam Leonard from the People

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.160
Development within Google here.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.750
And I'm really excited about
introducing my friend, Daniel

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.090
Rechtschaffen
today for the talk.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.140
And in particular, as one of
the founders of gPause, which

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.400
is Google's global meditation
community of practitioners,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.640
one of the things that
inspires me the most

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.940
is the ripple effects that this
practice has through society,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.520
becoming more mindful.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.750
And Daniel talk today
about the ripple effects

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.124
within the educational
system and children.

00:00:42.124 --> 00:00:44.290
So let me give you a little
bit about his background

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.520
and then I'll turned
over to Daniel.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.200
So Daniel's a marriage
and family therapist

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.400
here in the Bay
Area and the author

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.470
of the book "The Way
of Mindful Education:

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.750
Cultivating Well-Being in
Teachers and Students."

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.440
And we have copies of the
book over here after the talk.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.540
And so Daniel leads mindful
and education trainings,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.440
both at conferences
around the world,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.920
in addition to several different
educational institutions.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.090
He also teaches mindfulness
to high school basketball

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.450
and baseball teams, which
I thought was interesting.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.629
So let me turn it
over to Daniel.

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:24.561
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.490
DANIEL RECHTSCHAFFEN:
Hello, everybody.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.740
I've been teaching mostly in
an elementary school recently,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.260
so you all look rather big
to me and a little serious.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.730
So I figured I'd
start off by bringing

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.050
in a little bit of
levity and playfulness.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.620
With little kids, you
need to play mindfulness.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.670
You need to-- instead
of paying attention,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.360
you need to be
playing attention.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.860
If I'm trying to go
in and teaching kids

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.660
how to focus and to
regulate their emotions,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.020
it's going to become
really boring, really fast.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.150
And it's going to feel
like that old game

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.160
where your parents say, let's
see who can be quiet longest.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.450
And kids know really quick,
that's no kind of game.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.670
And they'll, this doesn't
sound like a game.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.167
So let's do a little
bit of movement.

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:29.000
I always start with
some movement with kids,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
because I see some people have
some food so you might just,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.310
for a little moment,
put with the food down.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.030
We'll just do a few
little movements

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.640
to get us more present and
relaxed here in our bodies.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.260
And often when I teach, I tell
people, especially teachers--

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.440
I train a lot of teachers.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.830
And I say, we're going
to-- let's pretend

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.960
to be kids for a minute.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.950
And when you say that
to teachers and adults,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.770
they're even worse
than little kids.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.680
You'll get like a spit ball
immediately in the eye.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.360
So, be your adult self,
but let's do some movement.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.910
So let's start with a
few Spiderman breaths.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.000
So let's breathe in, and breathe
out and shoot out your webs.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.720
[EXHALES] [INHALES]
[EXHALES] [INHALES] [EXHALES]

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.140
And how about some
dolphin breaths.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:34.890
[INHALES] [EXHALES] [INHALES]
[EXHALES] [INHALES] [EXHALES]

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.437
And some crocodile breaths.
[INHALES] [EXHALES] [INHALES]

00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:51.193
[EXHALES] [INHALES] [EXHALES]
And a few butterfly breaths.

00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:59.870
[EXHALES] [EXHALES] [EXHALES]

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.636
And how about a couple, I've
been working a few hours

00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:04.010
and I'm really
stressed, breaths.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.470
So lift up your
shoulders, tighten them,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.440
breathe out and relax.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.980
Ah.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.586
Let's do a few of those.
[INHALES] [EXHALES] [INHALES]

00:04:15.586 --> 00:04:17.079
[EXHALES]

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.640
And then see if you can just
be as still as a statue.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.910
And notice as you breathe,
if any parts of your body

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.460
are moving.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.020
Even though you're
trying to be still,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.340
see where the movement
in your body is.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.250
Thank you for playing
attention with me.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.680
Very often, for
adults and for kids,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.990
it's really easy--
like if I came in here

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.830
and said, let's learn
some mindfulness

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.250
and practice for 30
minutes, a lot of you

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.940
would start to
equate mindfulness

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.770
with this profoundly
frustrating experience.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.900
And our brains would
actually link that up, right?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.810
Link up?

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.540
And that's probably
why when we like,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.250
oh, I should really
practice mindfulness

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.670
this morning, everything in
our bodies kind of yells,

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.620
don't do it.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.010
It's so annoying.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.010
It's because very often
when we try to do it,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.780
we do it outside of our range.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.330
And so for kids, the range might
be five seconds or 10 seconds.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.000
And so for me to do these fun
movements, then as you saw,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.330
I progressively got
a little bit smaller,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.240
until I did this very
fun, accessible, ah,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.350
see what happens when
you are breathing,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.270
feeling the movement.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.370
And immediately, kids
will come back and say,

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.650
I think I felt my heart beating.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.129
Or I can feel my hips going
in and out like a balloon

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.920
as I was breathing.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.060
You'll get these
fascinating inner awareness

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.500
that's being cultivated.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.699
And you don't have to be top
heavy with it, telling them OK,

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.240
now you're going to
have to be still.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.640
OK, Joey, stop moving.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.640
OK, Sally, you know.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.810
And you really just
invite them into this fun

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.620
inner exploration.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.330
So I wanted to begin and give a
little overview of mindfulness

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.120
in education and
how it's spreading.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.840
One of organizations
that I really

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.750
love that's doing
some amazing work

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.180
is an organization called
The Holistic Life Foundation

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.170
and they're in Baltimore.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.000
They're good buddies of mine.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.950
And just to show what they've
been doing in the Baltimore

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.370
schools, and they have
all of these things

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.420
in the different school
settings where they'll

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.960
have a mindfulness room.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.567
And the mindfulness
room will always

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:41.150
be having this kind
of soothing music.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.620
They even have these
like essential oil blends

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.250
that are putting out nice scents

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.700
The room is just
a space for them

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.890
to be able-- for the
students to be able to come.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.940
So, when they've had a fight,
when there's a conflict,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.080
teachers won't send the
kids to the principal.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.830
They'll send them to
the mindfulness room.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.740
And in the mindfulness room,
the kids aren't like punished.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.000
What have you done?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.850
They're invited just
to be present and talk

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.380
about what's going on.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.150
And so, during all of the
conflict and difficulty that's

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.580
been happening in Baltimore,
every day The Holistic Life

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.390
Foundation, Ali and Atman
Smith and Andy Gonzales,

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.790
they've been doing these
mindfulness days in the park.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.380
So while the city
was burning, they

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.840
were getting people
together to be

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.180
able to meditate on what those
really difficult emotions that

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.890
are rising in their
bodies are about

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.370
and having these
amazing conversations.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.290
They have trained-- they're
all from inner city Baltimore

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.900
and have trained all
of their facilitators

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.290
are these young kids who
come through their program.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.110
And now they've
given them jobs to go

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.340
into all of these
other Baltimore schools

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.070
to be able to be teaching
how to regulate emotion,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.370
how to be able to develop
executive functioning.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.560
How to be able to
cultivate empathy.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.230
There's all this
really amazing research

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.790
that's been around for a
while, but for some reason,

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.050
it hasn't been
disseminated as widely

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:13.410
as it should in terms of social
and cultural diversity work.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.130
There's an amazing study
called The Ace Study.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.530
I don't know if any of you
know about The Ace Study,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.340
where it's for the Adverse
Childhood Experiences test.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.292
And it talks about the different
traumas or major stresses

00:08:27.292 --> 00:08:28.750
that people have
had in their life.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.640
So if you've had adverse
experiences, whether that's

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.230
a real kind of capital
T trauma, like some type

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.169
of physical or sexual
abuse, or even just living

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.510
in an environment
that's very stressful,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.140
even that's often in
the schools around

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.700
here, where there's
this incredible push

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.050
and stress for kids to achieve.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.520
So if you're growing up
with all of these stressors,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.470
I'll just read a few of the
things that it predicts.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.980
So one of the first
amazing things

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.790
is, if you have a lot of
these very intense stressors,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.920
traumas, your life
expectancy is 20 years less,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.230
which is rather amazing.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.300
People with high ACE
scores are three times as

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.690
likely to experience
academic failure,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.120
six times as likely to have
behavioral problems, and five

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.830
times as likely to have
attendance problems.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.980
So we set up kids in a very
disturbing environment,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.140
and their brain architecture
that we're really

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.660
finding that the architecture
of the brain, even the genetics,

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.250
is changed by stress levels.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.540
Even more amazingly,
more recent research

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.220
is finding that the
levels of stress

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.960
can change the genetics which
gets passed on to their kids.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.570
So there's these high
levels of trauma and stress,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.750
whether that's-- I work a lot
in-- one day I'll be in like

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.610
a Berkeley, very
privileged school,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.910
and I'll see the intent
stressors that these kids are

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.959
under to achieve.

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:00.250
And then the next day, I'll
be in an inner city Oakland

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.450
school, with very different
types of stressors,

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:03.800
but all stressors.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.570
And this stress physically
affects the body

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.920
and really hijacks the mind
to be able to be present

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.740
and to think and to be creative.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.710
So all of the
testing that we throw

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:18.610
on our kids, all of this really
intense high stakes testing,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.630
actually dumbs the mind down.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.310
It puts people in even
more of a kind of fight

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.190
or flight or a freeze response.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.840
So, such a big part of
the mindfulness training,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.140
that I do, the emotional
intelligence training,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.940
is first, how do
we get kids to feel

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:42.200
comfortable and relaxed and
present in their bodies.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:48.050
So one of the big things I've
also been tracking recently,

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.710
is you probably also
the news around New York

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.190
and a lot of the other states
that opted out of tests.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.400
So 175,000 students
in New York opted out

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.730
of the standardized testing.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.730
In some places it was 70% of
the entire school district,

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.520
the kids said, we're
not taking these tests.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.280
So there's a big shift
happening in education.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.510
I recently had somebody
from Silicon Valley who's

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.730
trying to start a school,
and he came to me and said,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.040
I want to create this school.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.020
I consult with a lot
of different schools,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.660
bringing in mindfulness
and emotional intelligence

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.450
around the world.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.010
But what was particularly
amazing for me

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.380
about what this
gentleman was bringing

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.960
was that he was
saying, that they're

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.650
going to bring a lot of
what you all at Google

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.290
are developing
amazingly, they're

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.300
bringing all of the tech in
information, kind of Khan

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.310
Academy style information.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.150
So all the information
that's going to be delivered

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.650
is going to be from the great
scientists and professors

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.950
from the great institutions
around the world.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.540
And what that does is,
it completely frees up

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.450
the teachers.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.160
They're no longer
information purveyors.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.760
And what they are becoming
now in this school

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.760
that I'm consulting with,
what they are going to become

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.130
is emotional
intelligence, mindfulness,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.980
kind of helping the kids
find meaning, helping

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.900
them be creative, helping
them find their path in life.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.700
Helping them understand how to
access knowledge, helping them

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.250
understand to be their
best people, which

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.700
is an amazing shift.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.929
Because so many teachers
that I talk with,

00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:29.470
tell me that about
half of their time

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.340
anyway is basically
as a social worker,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.650
trying to get their kids
to stop moving around.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.830
They have so much ADHD.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.070
There's so much disregulation.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.340
I could explain the numbers
of the anxiety and depression

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.760
that's like going through
the roof with kids

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.230
as young as like kindergarten.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.940
Kids are getting diagnoses at
these incredibly young ages.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.660
So for the teachers
to actually be there

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.450
as these holistic
support systems,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.360
and then to be able to give
them all of this information

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.330
that's readily accessible.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.270
So what I want to do is to
walk through what mindfulness

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:09.070
and what's called social,
emotional learning, some fun

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.810
ways that it's offered, and
what it actually can do.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.490
So there's five
different realms that I

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.590
look at of different
types of literacy,

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.930
not just what Common
Core does, which

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.950
is just kind of
math and language,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.820
but five deeper
realms of literacy.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.790
Which are the literacy
of our bodies,

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:33.300
the literacy of our minds,
literacy of our hearts,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.450
literacy around
the social world,

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:40.050
and then literacy around
kind of our ecology,

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.730
our understanding of our
place in nature and the world.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.870
So we can start with the
literacy of our bodies.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.830
I just did a little bit
with you around just

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.000
those Spiderman breaths.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.870
That's us learning how
to be in touch, relaxed,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.010
connected to our bodies.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.680
Adam was telling
me before about how

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.680
he does some work with veterans
who are returning from war.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.650
He said he starts by doing
these great like rafting trips

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.420
and fun things with them,
getting them in their body

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.070
and teaching them about
mindfulness through getting

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.050
into the flow, getting
connected to what's alive

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.930
all around them.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.804
So there's all these
different access points.

00:14:17.804 --> 00:14:19.570
So I start with
kids, if their minds

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.050
are hijacked, which
so many of them

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:25.490
are, how do we help them drop
into their bodies to integrate?

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.550
So the first thing--
and I'll walk us

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.060
all through some exercises
to be experiential.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.960
If everybody just
puts up one hand.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.830
And why don't we look
at it for a moment,

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.280
just kind of explore this hand
that's always typing and doing

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.430
everything for you.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.200
But you probably
haven't actually

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.080
taken a look at all the
little lines and colors in it.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.570
And then you could
let your eyes close.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.670
And since your eyes
are closed, how

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.260
do you know that
your hand is there?

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.510
What are the physical sensations
that you can feel in there?

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.190
And maybe why don't you
feel the other hand,

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.939
see what's sensations
are in the other hand.

00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:11.730
Are they different?

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.810
Are they the same?

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.170
The fingers, the palm, see if
you can get really interested.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.910
And how about feeling both
hands at the same time?

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.420
OK.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.480
Thank you for
playing that with me.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.530
So, often with kids
what I'll do is

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.600
a really give them a language
for their physical experience.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.110
We'll go through
our bodies, maybe

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.490
we'll pick something
up and do, you

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.230
know, write with a
pencil in slow motion,

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.490
feeling the way the
hand moves, doing

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.330
different types of
slow motion movements,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.400
really learning the sensations.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.590
I'll go up on the blackboard
and have kids say,

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.790
what you feel in your body.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.800
And I'll show you as we go
through the mind, the heart,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.570
why we need to start with this
kind of physical literacy,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.940
understanding how the
body feels, how it moves,

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.780
what it means to be relaxed,
what it means to be stressed.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.560
Teaching kids where stress is
in the body and what it feels

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.460
like.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:14.470
So really giving them this
language of the physical body.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.830
Then I move on, once the kids
are relaxed, they're present,

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.870
I move on to some mind training.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.100
So teaching them how to,
what we talk a lot about,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.630
as building the
muscles of attention.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.090
And there's something about
this attention practice

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.680
that I'm sure all of
you-- and still in schools

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.300
I hear over and
over again, teachers

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.450
yelling at kids to pay attention
or not to be distracted.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.560
But we don't teach them
how to pay attention

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.936
or how not to get
distracted or how

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:46.690
to be calm, how to be
relaxed in their body.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.370
So there's really
precise, clear ways

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.890
to develop this
sense of attention.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.030
One of the ways that kids seem
to really love exploring it

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.420
is a game that I call
the distraction game.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.890
So I'll go into a classroom
and I'll teach kids

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.600
how to take their hands and
put them on their bellies

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.020
and just to feel their
breath moving in and out.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.730
And then what I'll do
is, I will walk around,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.400
and usually most
schools I'm in, there's

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.740
lots of like pencil
jars and things

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.109
you can make noises with.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:21.760
And I'll say, who thinks they
can be totally focused, even

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.308
if I try to distract them?

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:25.849
And kids really like this, and
so they'll put up their hands.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.450
And I'll go around
and I'll start

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.080
making noises and
opening the door

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.600
and jumping around
and being silly.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.040
And they're really trying
to keep their focus

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.470
on their breath.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.110
I call it the base camp breath.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.160
And have them really
stay right there.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.030
And the kids are so
interested in it,

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.530
and then a bunch of the other
kids will say, can I try that?

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.250
I'm like, OK, let's all do it.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.920
And then eventually, I'll
ask for some distractor's

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.980
assistants.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.880
And so usually
pretty much always,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.370
I'll choose the kids who are the
most distracting, the ones that

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.500
are always distracting
the rest of the class.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.990
And I'll let them get up and
kind of walk around the room,

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.000
making noise and rattling things
and trying to distract kids.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.560
And I'll explore in real
time, the dynamics that

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.330
are happening in the classroom.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.852
So, asking them,
what was it like?

00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:13.310
What does it feel
like in your body

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:17.486
when you so want to open your
eyes or you so want to giggle?

00:18:17.486 --> 00:18:19.360
Kids will try to go--
I'll be like, OK, Yeah,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.110
if you want you can
try to tell some jokes

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.280
and get kids to laugh.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.490
See what it's like to
try to stay regulated.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.870
So they are actually
practicing regulation.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.550
They're really working with
integrating their brains so

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.490
that they can keep this
kind of sense of integration

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.020
and calming their
amygdala down so

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.830
that they can have
more executive

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.060
functioning in their brains.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.450
And we can really talk
to them about this.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.060
If they're little kids, you
can talk to them what about,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.840
like the lizard brain,
which captures the top part

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.070
of your brain, the neocortex.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.650
And how we can let
the lizard relax

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.800
by doing these breaths
and then the mind

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.070
and can work in
a more sharp way.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:06.355
Once I do that, we can actually
teach kids and definitely

00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:08.230
high school students,
middle school students,

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.440
but even really young children
can start learning how,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.110
not just to be aware
of distraction,

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.710
of kind of externals, but
how they're distracted

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.350
by their own thoughts.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.490
How their own mental
constructions,

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.850
whether those are kind
of destructive thoughts

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.620
about themselves or
whether they're just

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.550
random thoughts about the
movie they want to go see.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.630
And then-- well, let's all
put our hands on our belly

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.090
for another second.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.850
And what we can do is, you
can let your eyes close.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.830
And what we can explore is
just anchoring our attention

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:46.710
in the breath.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.400
So you're feeling your breath
going in and out of your belly.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.160
And what you could
notice is, any time

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.340
a thought pops into
your head, our brains

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.930
are kind of like popcorn makers.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.670
But instead of making thoughts
or instead of making popcorn,

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.770
they make thoughts.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.430
Any time a thought goes
through your head, just

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.450
pop your hand up.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.440
And just kind of lift it up in
the air and then bring it back.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.690
And when you're bringing
your hand back to your belly,

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.650
you're bringing
your attention back

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.950
to the breath the physical
sensation of the belly,

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.520
like a balloon getting
bigger and smaller.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.439
And anytime the mind
pops with a thought--

00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:25.230
and if you're wondering,
if you're thinking

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.280
that's a thought itself.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.840
--you can always just
pop it in the air,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.260
collect yourself, and bring
the hand back to the belly.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.690
So let's try that for a minute.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.520
It's amazing to watch
and listen to what

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.460
students say about this.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.530
So you'll get like a
second grade class,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.930
so young children,
who really start

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.930
witnessing how their own
minds are hijacking them,

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.170
and how they're building
these muscles of attention,

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.460
learning how to stay--
like a kid the other day

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.646
said, like always when I'm
reading, I'll be reading

00:21:08.646 --> 00:21:10.770
and my eyes will go down
to the bottom of the page.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.353
And then I'll realize
that I've gotten

00:21:12.353 --> 00:21:15.490
to the bottom of the page,
but I wasn't actually taking

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.780
in the words.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.420
And I'm trying to build
my muscles of attention,

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.980
so that I can actually read
it and then finish it and then

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.310
play some baseball or
something like that.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.500
So they really
understand this capacity

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.740
to keep the attention focused.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.680
So once I've developed
these muscles of attention,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.350
awareness of our minds,
awareness of our bodies,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.170
then we move on to the emotions.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.430
And so, there's this
really profound way

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.870
that we bring the
body and the attention

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.530
together for basic
impulse control,

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.030
basic emotional regulation.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.390
So we talk to kids
all the time about,

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.000
don't steal the cookie
from the cookie jar.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.150
Don't hit your brother.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.030
Don't do these
things, don't react.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.500
We look at a place
like Baltimore,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.220
and say, don't do that.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.460
Don't destroy this
building in your own city.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.080
But when there's
so much emotion,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.070
when there's so much hurt, when
there's so much difficulty,

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.620
we haven't really taught kids
what to do with that emotion.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.790
And so it needs to spill over.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.030
So it doesn't really make
sense to punish them.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.500
Usually punishing in
the way we often punish,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.320
really just adds more
kind of fire to it.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.980
So what we do is, I
usually explain to kids,

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.130
like I imagine that
my arm is a branch.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.790
And it's going up, and up
here all of these leaves,

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.560
they're kind of
like my thoughts.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.640
And so anytime
there's a lot of wind

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.860
and the branch is
going like this,

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.952
it's kind of like
I'm ruminating.

00:22:51.952 --> 00:22:53.410
I'm thinking about
something a lot.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.510
I'm like churning about this
argument I had with my wife.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.230
Or I'm churning about this
thing that my boss said.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.180
And so any time there's that
hamster wheel of thinking,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.820
there's always a correlation.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.320
So if you follow the
branch down into your body

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.730
and check out in your throat,
in your chest, in your stomach,

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:17.140
somewhere in your body there's
always a physical correlation

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.520
of how you actually
physically feel

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.190
to that ruminating thought.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.237
And usually what we do
when we're ruminating,

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:26.820
when we're really
caught in something,

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.351
is usually we think
like, oh, man,

00:23:28.351 --> 00:23:29.600
I can't believe she said that.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.700
What should I say next time?

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.510
Maybe I'll do this.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.450
And that just pushes
the hamster wheel more.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.222
And you all know this, I'm sure.

00:23:35.222 --> 00:23:36.930
This is why we can't
fall asleep at night

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.481
sometimes is, the mind is just
working, working, working,

00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:39.980
working.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.770
And we think then maybe
I'll be able to fix it

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.940
by thinking our way
out of it, which

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.520
is-- if anybody's ever thought
their way out of something

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.647
like that, let me know.

00:23:48.647 --> 00:23:50.980
Because usually even if we
come up with a great thought,

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.920
then we have to--
oh, would that work?

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.000
How can I do that?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.460
So what we can do, really
the only place that there's

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.820
some type of soothing
and relaxation,

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.560
is if we drop down
into our bodies

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.990
and locate where the
physical experience is.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.340
So if the thought about
like this argument is there,

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.060
there's probably
some like agitation,

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.150
heat in the chest,
tightness in the belly,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.820
maybe the face is
a little tight.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.980
And so with kids, once
you've taught them

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.770
the physical capacity,
the physical literacy,

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.570
they'll be able
to find, oh, yeah,

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.854
there's this heat right here.

00:24:26.854 --> 00:24:28.270
There's this
agitation right here.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.380
There's this discomfort.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.770
And then I do a lot of what I
call the vacuum cleaner breath,

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.900
where they suck in all of
this uncomfortable energy

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.090
into their belly,
they relax it, really

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.970
becoming aware of the
physical experience,

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.860
and that is where-- what
mindfulness basically is,

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.220
is when we orient into, towards
the present moment, what's

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.650
happening right now.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.530
We open to what's
happening right now instead

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.940
of pushing away from
it into our brains,

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.610
trying to think, how can
we fix this or change this.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.430
So it's a very simple
orientation shift.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:06.510
And it's a little bit
opposite, counterintuitive,

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.830
that if you orient
into pain or orient

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.350
into agitation, when we
bring our kind of openness,

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:17.410
our heartfulness,
it actually relaxes.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.100
It soothes.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.234
That's most of the research in
the beginning of mindfulness.

00:25:21.234 --> 00:25:22.650
Mindfulness-based
stress reduction

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.290
was about chronic pain.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.060
And if you actually
bring your attention

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.750
into a chronic back
pain, it actually

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.730
relaxes instead of
tightening against it,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.230
which adds more pain.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.399
So with kids, I do these
very basic explanations.

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:40.940
Maybe I'll have them
picture somebody

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.147
that they're annoyed with.

00:25:42.147 --> 00:25:43.730
And they'll picture
them, and then you

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.560
can actually feel,
physically, what that's like.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.630
And then to actually feel it
and to breathe and to relax.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.171
And instead of-- very
often I'll hear in schools,

00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:55.920
even schools that don't
teach mindfulness,

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.654
they'll say take three deep
breaths when you're angry.

00:25:58.654 --> 00:26:00.320
But usually when kids
do that, they just

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.130
go, [QUICK BREATHS] and then
they just go right back to it,

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.090
right, instead of
really getting like, OK,

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:10.264
so when I actually
notice that I'm agitated,

00:26:10.264 --> 00:26:11.180
and they can catch it.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.760
Oh, there it is.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.890
OK, there's tightness.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.439
There's a little
bit of butterflies.

00:26:16.439 --> 00:26:18.230
OK, I'm present with
it, breathing with it,

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.050
I'm noticing it,
I'm relaxing it.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.550
And when we do that and we
reinforce it over and over

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.830
again, it's life changing.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:28.360
There's all of this research
around impulse control as one

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.180
of the major
predictors around who

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.360
will go to prison, how
well people are going

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.490
to do on tests, how successful
academically they'll be,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.290
just by their early
capacity to be able to be

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.710
present with their impulses.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.330
So with the emotional
work, both we're

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.140
learning to work with
the intense emotions

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.530
and then we're also learning
to cultivate the more

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:59.070
kind of beneficial, sweet
compassion, empathy, joy,

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.880
happiness, all of these
beautiful practices

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.720
that we can do around gratitude.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.990
Often I'll have people bring in
a kind of a picture of somebody

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:11.680
that for them, it is the
most compassionate person

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.680
in their minds or their
hearts, whether it's

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.930
one of their grandparents or
whether it's Mother Teresa.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.990
And to picture them
and then to really

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.300
bring in that energy to
start actually bringing

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.960
that compassion into the world.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.220
So students learn how to work
with the difficult emotion,

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.060
to cultivate the empathy.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.800
Then the fourth piece
that I like to do

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.520
is more of the
social, cultural work.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.340
And right now, one of
the things I'm really

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.520
fascinated about
with this is what's

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.940
happening in Baltimore, what's
happening around our country

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.790
and has been for a long
time around diversity,

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.230
around how we have so much
assumptions about racism,

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:58.950
and how we can actually teach
kids to open their minds up,

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:04.220
to develop empathy in a
very-- in a physical way.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.380
And when I say
physical, often it's

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.560
very easy to go in
and tell people,

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.210
you should be nice to each
other, you should do this.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.860
That doesn't really
help most of the time.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.540
It feels like another should.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.879
But when we can teach kids to
really feel in their bodies.

00:28:18.879 --> 00:28:20.420
One practice I've
been doing recently

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:26.400
is I'll put like an
object up on a table

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.750
and I'll have everybody just
look at this one object.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.110
And just kind of have a
mindfulness practice on it

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.370
for a minute or so.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.920
And just looking at it, and
just since we've already

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.880
been doing a lot of these
attention practices,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.180
have them just have this
relaxed mind, breathing.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.970
And just seeing,
as they're looking

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.330
at it, what assumptions
come up about this object.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.800
Noticing if they really
like it, if they dislike it,

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.190
if they have a judgment,
if they have a correlation.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.380
And amazingly, even if you like
just put a bottle or a book,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.310
afterwards, the whole
class is going to fill in.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.740
I really like- I got so
annoyed looking at that book.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.080
I loved that book.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.370
I have this assumption
because my brother like

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.560
hit me with a book one time.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.643
And you're going to get
all of the stuff in there.

00:29:10.643 --> 00:29:14.170
And teaching kids the ways
that we develop assumptions

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.040
and then helping them
understand how we all

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.480
have that towards each other,
how we put each other in boxes.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.500
And how mindfulness
can actually help

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:28.960
us see each other in this much
more clear and conscious way.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.990
So another one of
the main practices

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:35.370
that I do-- and I'm going
to wrap up in a few minutes

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.090
because I want to be
able to really open

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:40.820
some conversation
for all of you.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.140
One of the other practices
that I love to do

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.480
is around the present moment.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.810
And so teaching kids, I'll
ask a lot of questions

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.170
about what is the past.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.080
And they'll explain
what happened you know,

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.840
the dinosaurs and that they
tripped on the way to school

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.020
this morning and all these
things that happened.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.000
And then what's in
the future, there's

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.330
going to be-- we're
going to be on Mars,

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.494
or that my birthday is on
Sunday or whatever it is.

00:30:05.494 --> 00:30:06.910
And then asking
them what is right

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.430
now in the present moment?

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.530
And I'll teach kids to be able
to communicate with each other

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.190
from just what's happening
in the present moment, which

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.041
is a very fascinating
practice if anybody has ever

00:30:17.041 --> 00:30:18.040
really tried to do this.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.990
To have a conversation back
and forth where the rules are.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.640
The only thing you
can say is, my back is

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.370
hurting a little bit right now.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:29.450
The lights are a little
heavy in my eyes.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:33.390
I'm feeling my voice in
my larynx as I'm talking.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:36.740
So actually to be able to
really just speak present moment

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.190
and seeing what happens to
people when you take away

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.070
all story and learn how to
communicate in this very

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.780
empathic present moment way.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:49.440
So the practices are really
learning this landscape

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.920
of empathy of communication.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.710
And then the final stage
is more of this kind

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.850
of ecological awareness,
which obviously right now is

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:03.070
so important, understanding how
we are connected to everything.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.630
We do a lot of work bringing--
I love bringing kids out

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.730
into nature.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.460
And for me, there's no better
teacher than the natural world.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.880
If you want to learn
patience, you sit by a tree.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.770
You do something like that.

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:17.230
And so really starting to
learn and ask questions

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.030
to kids about their
environment, about how they're

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.390
connected to their environment.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.920
So I just wanted to
walk through these five

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.520
main realms of literacy.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:33.300
That in schools around the US,
Canada, all over the world,

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.900
whole school
districts are starting

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.170
to learn how to integrate
this level of kind

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.960
of critical thinking
and awareness

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:49.040
so that kids can really
master their own minds

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.580
and then can go out into
the world in this much more

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.090
empowered way.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.950
In this work that's
been happening

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.970
around a big transformation
in education,

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.690
there's a bit of a
revolutionary piece to it.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.106
Because there's a
lot of-- I don't

00:32:05.106 --> 00:32:10.420
know if you know how
the Texas School Board's

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.010
kind of curriculum committee is
the one for some reason, that

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.880
makes all the decisions
about curriculum, mostly

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.140
in the entire country.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.840
Usually the ones
that Texas chooses

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.490
is what most of
the schools follow.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:30.710
And a big part of Texas
Republican platform

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.500
came out a couple
years ago saying

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:40.910
that they were opposed to
critical thinking skills,

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.700
because they thought that it
was going to-- they thought

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.730
that it would undermine values.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:52.350
And so nothing against
Republicans or specific people,

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:58.280
but that basic concept of
critical thinking skills

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.300
and teaching kids how
to think for themselves

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.460
and to be creative, the way
that Google here kind of-- some

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:09.430
of the ways that this
organization is set up

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.950
for you to have
free thinking, we're

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.580
needing that in our
educational paradigm.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.200
And it isn't like
that right now.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.340
It's all very top down.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.350
You know, follow what we say.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.570
Memorization,
information memorization,

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.310
not much transformation,
not much change,

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.710
not much creativity,
not much openness.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.599
Literal, very clear
pushback about kids

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:34.640
doing these types of
mindfulness practices, which

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.780
are going to be a
liberation practice, kind

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.040
of a waking up practice
where they're going to learn,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:40.890
who am I?

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:41.620
What is my body?

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.450
What is my mind?

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:43.400
What is my heart?

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.630
What is the world around me?

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.980
How am I connected
to everything?

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.720
So there's a big
transformation that

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.950
needs to happen in
our world in order

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.810
for the ecological
system, the social system,

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.010
for things to be more healthy.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:02.860
And mindfulness, as a
practice is the exact antidote

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.770
that I'm looking to
as a way to help kids

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.070
wake up, to help to see better.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.620
So what I would love to do--
we have a bunch of time.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.210
But what I would love to do
is to open this up and just

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.650
have some questions
and some dialogue.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.840
We have about 20 minutes
because it's always

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.840
a little more interesting to
get some cross pollination.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.790
AUDIENCE: Is there any
way that technology

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:31.380
can help people
to be more mindful

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.730
and just create more
like compassionate people

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.047
or is it actually taking
people away from that?

00:34:39.047 --> 00:34:41.130
DANIEL RECHTSCHAFFEN: I
am so happy it, especially

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:42.420
here at Google.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.575
Do you have an idea?

00:34:44.575 --> 00:34:45.449
AUDIENCE: Not really.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:48.092
I mean, not exactly.

00:34:48.092 --> 00:34:50.050
DANIEL RECHTSCHAFFEN: So
there's a lot to this.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:54.070
So there are some apps that
are coming out that I actually

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.210
really appreciate.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.850
Mostly the apps that
I'm appreciating

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.570
are apps that are around
empathy and compassion

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:05.360
and mindfulness where
the kids are doing

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.070
are doing something
in the app and then

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.930
the app has little kind
of assignments for them.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:16.310
OK, now, go do two random acts
of kindness and then come back.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.880
And you get to this level.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.570
So for me, to learn to
develop emotionally,

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.380
you need to do it
interpersonally.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.090
You actually need to be in
contact with others and not

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:32.450
just somebody on the other
side of the computer.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.200
It needs to be--
there's something

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.500
about the actual resonant
fields of two bodies,

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.960
the mirror neurons that
are actually waking up when

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.450
you're across from somebody.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.850
So I think that there's
some amazing stuff

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:47.890
that technology can do.

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:52.010
And obviously just
with all of the work

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.850
that's happening where there's
these amazing interconnected

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.310
webs where we know
about an Apollo.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.050
All of a sudden, we know about
here, we know about Syria.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.690
And we're able to
hear so much more.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:02.820
We're able to
develop that empathy.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.600
But on a really basic--
I mean as a therapist,

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.560
I work with mostly
adults, but I work

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.790
with individuals around what it
really takes to heal and grow

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.130
and it takes a lot.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.120
So it's basically down to
like attachment theory, which

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.220
means our most core wounds are
around ways that we weren't

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.960
loved, ways we weren't met,
ways that we don't really

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.830
trust each other.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.610
And in order to
change that, it needs

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.490
to be in person, whether it's
a therapist or a community

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.680
or a loving relationship,
that's where these-- you know,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.510
your mind can be like,
oh yeah, I trust that.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.400
But the body is still like,
oh, I don't know about that.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.340
So what I would say
is that if technology

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.821
is working with in person,
relational support,

00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:57.240
it can be amazing.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:02.140
And at the same time, there's
some great attention trainings

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.080
that are online that
work really well.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.760
So if you're just looking
for basic attention training,

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:11.020
there's some great online tools
where you can follow something

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.210
or you can get biofeedback
to see how well the breath is

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.710
happening.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.430
So attention training, which
is a little different than just

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.225
mindfulness.

00:37:18.225 --> 00:37:19.600
Attention training
can be trained

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.230
in a lot of different ways.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:24.955
But it is often the metaphor
of like in the military, well

00:37:24.955 --> 00:37:26.830
before mindfulness, they
had something called

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.317
sniper breath,
which is focusing,

00:37:29.317 --> 00:37:30.900
regulating their
breath to this extent

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.690
so that they can
shoot really well.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.880
Which is not what I'd
consider mindfulness.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.100
Mindfulness is you need
to weave in this kind

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.920
of empathic presence.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.560
So we can train some attention,
but for this larger scale,

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.930
like opening the awareness to
the environment, to nature,

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.900
to each other, which
we're lacking so much.

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.000
There's a research study that
was just done out of UCLA where

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.940
they took kids-- one
classroom and brought them

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.630
into like a nature
retreat for a week.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.080
So no technology.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.637
Other school just stayed there.

00:38:05.637 --> 00:38:07.720
And then they brought them
back and they gave them

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.650
some emotional
intelligence tests.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.570
So basically showing
faces, and getting

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.320
them to see, oh, that's
a sad face, that's

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.950
a happy face, very basic kind
of showing how well can you

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.564
recognize others'
emotions, be empathic.

00:38:22.564 --> 00:38:24.480
And the kids who'd been
in nature for the week

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.957
scored way higher.

00:38:25.957 --> 00:38:27.415
But they hadn't
done anything, they

00:38:27.415 --> 00:38:29.260
hadn't taught them
anything about emotion.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.950
But just unplugging them
for a week, to let them

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:33.786
just kind drop in.

00:38:33.786 --> 00:38:35.410
I don't know why it
did it, but there's

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.180
something about getting
them into a little bit

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.300
more natural state.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.030
So I'm a major proponent
of using technology

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.060
to help kids unplug,
which I don't

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.730
know exactly how that works.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.507
But we need that balance.

00:38:53.507 --> 00:38:56.090
AUDIENCE: Towards the end, you
talked about the transformation

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.580
that you think needs to happen
within the education system.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.140
I'm just wondering,
for places where

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.309
you've seen that
start to happen,

00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:03.350
what does that look like?

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:05.040
Where within the
system does it start?

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.780
What are the sort of
conditions and characteristics

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.390
that might need to be in place?

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.431
DANIEL RECHTSCHAFFEN:
Thank you so much for that.

00:39:11.431 --> 00:39:13.510
So there's actually a
lot that's going on.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.090
So there's mindfulness
itself and then

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.350
there's also social
emotional learning.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.400
And there's a great
organization called

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.520
Castle, the Collaborative for
Academic, Social and Emotional

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.190
Learning, which is in eight
of the major school districts

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.820
and has been doing a few years
of really intensive studies

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.640
to find out how
really integrating

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.680
emotional intelligence into
the whole school systems, how

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.790
it works.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:41.150
It's in Oakland right now, has
been for the last few years.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:48.900
In these eight districts, the
academic scores went up 11%.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.970
And for anybody
in academics, like

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:54.870
for academic scores to go
up 11% from any intervention

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:56.500
is like staggering.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.050
But the staggering
piece about that

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.240
is, they weren't
teaching any academics.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.620
This was purely
emotional support.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.000
So getting the teachers, which
is always important to first.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.410
Train the teachers how to
regulate their emotions

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:10.800
to be present, to focus.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.100
Then training kids how to
be more aware of each other.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.250
So just this kind of relaxing
of nervous systems that

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.900
allows them to pay attention.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.830
What I've started-- I
started doing this work

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.665
at this organization
called Mindful Schools back

00:40:25.665 --> 00:40:28.890
eight or nine years
ago in Oakland.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:33.530
And what we first were doing was
just going into the classroom

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.710
and teaching kids,
which was amazing

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.500
because we started seeing like,
wow, this stuff really works.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.220
Kids really are able
to be more empathic.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.130
They're able to pay
attention better.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.680
But what would happen
is, I would teach

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.432
and then I thank the
class and I would get out.

00:40:48.432 --> 00:40:50.140
And I'd hear the
teacher yelling at them,

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.860
get back in your seats.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.190
Like oh, that doesn't
work very well.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.930
It needs to be a
systemic approach.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:00.270
So what I've done mostly in
the last four or five years

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:01.910
is training teachers.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:03.724
So I'll go to a
school and I'll do

00:41:03.724 --> 00:41:05.140
a lot of professional
development,

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:10.990
a lot of work with them about
burnout and stress for teachers

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.680
is huge.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.460
The dropout rate for teachers
is higher than it is for kids.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.840
Like most teachers leave
within three years.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.500
So really teaching
them how to regulate,

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.570
how to pay attention to the
kids, how to attune to them.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:27.677
So there's a lot of school
districts around the country

00:41:27.677 --> 00:41:28.510
that are doing this.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.150
The way that it usually
looks depends on the schools.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.040
But there's a lot of really
good emotional intelligence

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.990
curriculum.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.780
And the way that
mindfulness usually

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.060
works really beautifully,
is that mindfulness

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.600
dovetails with all this
emotional intelligence work.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.730
Because as I said
before, if we're

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.330
trying to teach kids empathy, we
bring in these basic practices,

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.250
which we'll have the
class start every day

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.500
with a little breathing.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.850
Start, or have in the middle
of the day, do a little bit

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.670
where they're aware
of something that's

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:00.430
triggering or frustrating them
and doing some breath with it.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.840
So kind of throughout the day,
integrating these practices

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.060
around emotional
regulation, around focus.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.530
And all different schools are
doing it really creatively.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.950
Some have their
own rooms or a kind

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.510
of a corner of the room that's
like what they call a peace

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:18.220
corner, where if the kids
are really stirred up,

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.030
they self-M refer
themselves there,

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:21.700
instead of the
teachers telling them.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.520
So they start learning
this inner resilience,

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:29.150
this inner capacity, so that
they don't need to be punished.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.980
But they can say, oh wow,
there's a lot going on in me.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.970
I need to go sit over here for
minute and regulate myself.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.010
So it looks a lot
of different ways.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.600
One of the major ways one
of the main things that I do

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.150
is, I have a book,
my book, and then

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.350
I have a book that
I'm about to publish,

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:47.270
which is really a curriculum.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.770
And so there's a
lot of schools that

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.550
are using mindfulness-based
curricula in training

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:52.740
their teachers.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.850
That's really the best
way is if you really

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:57.610
get the teachers trained
in their own practice.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.120
And then have some
kind of workbooks

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.330
that they can use
with the kids, rather

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.779
than me having to go
around the country teaching

00:43:04.779 --> 00:43:06.570
little lessons or
something, really getting

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.730
the-- One of my major
long term visions

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:13.510
would be how we could get this
type of foundational training

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.530
into every teacher in college.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:18.680
So how could every
teacher learn about how

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.470
to work with their stress
and the stress of their kids.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.240
AUDIENCE: You go up a
level with teachers.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.570
Is it ever necessary
go further up

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.950
and work with
administrators, et cetera.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:32.550
Do teachers then run into
issues with administrators

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.750
who are feeling the pressure
to get test scores up?

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:38.860
And also what kind
of resistance--

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.870
do you ever get resistance
from the adults in general

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:43.410
when you're trying
to teach this?

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:45.201
DANIEL RECHTSCHAFFEN:
So let's take the two

00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:46.190
really important ones.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:51.120
So first one is, sometimes
you get really lucky

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.150
and you have an
administrator who's already

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.400
into mindfulness or something.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.690
And of course, that's great.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.450
This needs to be systemic,
because the stress is

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:00.180
everywhere.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.210
It's important to look around.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.420
It's easy to point fingers
and think like, oh,

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.150
that person is the evil person
who's making this all-- but

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.570
everybody's under this stress.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:14.570
So actually I have a
group of 30 administrators

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:18.750
that I've been doing monthly
calls with for the last year,

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:20.700
talking with them about
how to integrate this

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:21.491
into their schools.

00:44:21.491 --> 00:44:25.380
So it's so important, if you
have an administrator shifting

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.560
the environment
for the teachers--

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.386
and this is why it's more
impact when I teach teachers.

00:44:31.386 --> 00:44:33.260
It's more impact when
I teach administrators.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:36.100
Because obviously if
they're able to create

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:40.380
a more empathic and
relaxed state, environment,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.040
that's huge.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.900
So yeah, it needs
to go in everywhere.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.310
I mean it needs to-- there's
one of our congressman, Ohio

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:55.470
Congressman Tim Ryan, actually
has a mindfulness sitting group

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.569
and that he does in
Congress. [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:58.569 --> 00:45:00.860
I talked to him because he
came to a conference I lead.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.782
He was like, we had
three people last time.

00:45:02.782 --> 00:45:04.240
That was the most
people we've had.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.310
But we're getting more.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:06.780
It's getting more.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.770
So we need to spread
this everywhere.

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:15.270
In terms of
resistance, mindfulness

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:18.600
is an introspective practice.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.800
So you can't force somebody
to be introspective.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.070
Because being introspective
is vulnerable.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.918
To look inside, if you lived
your life really fast and doing

00:45:26.918 --> 00:45:29.570
and doing and doing, when you
slow down, you're like, wow,

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:31.490
there's a lot going on in there.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:33.440
So you can't force
somebody to do that.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.040
It's, by its nature-- if
a kid's sitting there,

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.790
I have no idea what's
going on their mind.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:40.623
I have no idea what's
going on in your mind.

00:45:40.623 --> 00:45:42.670
You might have been checked
out this entire talk.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.150
I don't know what's
happening inside your brains.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:50.240
So all we can do is
invite you to the feast

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.350
of these practices.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.690
And so, I always
get some resistance

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.440
from some people who
don't really want it.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.970
And I never push.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:59.960
I never push kids.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:06.380
I never push parents or
teachers or administrators.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.320
One of the things that
does come up and often

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.450
is asked, is around the
history of mindfulness

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:16.480
and it's Buddhist aspects and
if there's resistance there.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:21.380
Because there actually has been
at least one that I know of,

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.860
school that got in
trouble with the courts

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.670
because they were
doing what they thought

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:27.480
was Buddhist practice.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.780
And there's a lot to that.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.690
For me, I mean I'm
not a Buddhist.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.820
A lot of these
practices were developed

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.690
in a Buddhist tradition.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.830
But for me.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.020
It's much wider than
a Buddhist tradition.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.520
This is about-- I mean I
haven't used a word yet,

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.970
I hope, that seems religious.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.320
We're talking about how
to be good human beings.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.460
And I'm happy to bring from
any tradition or anyplace,

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:56.340
some type of practice which
doesn't have any-- which

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:59.220
won't turn anybody into
a specific religion,

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.140
but that's going to help people.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.620
So people are afraid of that.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.560
Usually what I do is
I'll invite people

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.620
to the training or to
watch the kids doing it.

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:12.660
And pretty much always, they're
like, I could use this as well.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.450
There was just a
big court judgment

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:23.010
down in LA Unified Schools,
where there was a yoga program

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.130
and they were trying
to get it kicked out.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.450
And the judge ruled
against, and said, yes, this

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:33.370
seems like it comes
from a Hindu tradition.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:38.830
But it doesn't have
any spiritual words

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.280
or spiritual aims.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.350
It's just movement
and breathing.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:48.600
So I actually think that that's
probably, in years to come,

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.517
as mindfulness gets
huge, there might

00:47:52.517 --> 00:47:54.600
be some court cases that
are going to be coming up

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.650
on a larger scale.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.980
And for me, as I said
with the Texas Republican

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.020
platform, who said we don't
want to teach critical thinking

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.850
skills.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.910
There's both a
resistance to kind,

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:09.550
of is this religion,
which I think

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:10.780
is a really good question.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.670
We don't want to teach
religion in schools.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:17.125
But there's also a question
about what mindfulness truly

00:48:17.125 --> 00:48:20.060
is, which is a
self-inquiry practice.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.820
And we're teaching
kids to question.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.180
And a lot of people in
schools are afraid of that.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.900
For me personally, there's a
lot about the school system

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.360
that I question.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.910
And if people really
inquired deeply,

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.020
they would actually kind
of rip it up at the seams

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.600
and transform it.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.980
So a lot of people I
think, and for good reason,

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.280
are kind of afraid of a
deep inquiry practice, both

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.560
because they don't want to
look inside of themselves,

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.410
and they don't really want
to look at the system that's

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:52.255
out of balance.

00:48:52.255 --> 00:48:53.630
AUDIENCE: It's
really interesting

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.090
hearing about you are
working with young kids.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:58.430
I was wondering if we can
take a step even before that

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:01.310
and wonder what can, for
instance parents of very

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:04.410
young children, like toddlers,
preschoolers do to kind of work

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.960
with them and kind of
get them in to a mode

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.010
where they're receptive
to mindfulness as they're

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:13.000
preparing to go into schools
were mindfulness may or may not

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.100
be part of the curriculum.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.680
DANIEL RECHTSCHAFFEN: Yeah,
thank you for the question.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:22.980
So I just happened to grow up--
I grew up in a place called

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.750
the Omega Institute,
which is on the East

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.640
Coast is kind of like Esalen, if
you know Esalen down the coast.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:32.150
It's kind of like a new age
meditation retreat center.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:35.810
So I grew up with people
like gurus and shamans

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:38.360
and meditators all around.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:43.310
And my parents though,
even though I lived there,

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:46.310
I was never once told to
meditate or to do yoga

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.460
or to do any of that.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.750
I was just like a kid.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.770
I could just do it.

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:54.160
And I actually
really like-- even

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.420
though I'm teaching
kids mindfulness

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:59.670
and I see the benefit of it,
especially with younger kids

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:01.540
and with parents, what
I really recommend

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:07.180
is what my experience
was with my upbringing,

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:13.190
is that I had an incredibly
empathic and attuned parents.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:16.830
And if I became
a good person, it

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:21.370
was not because they told
me to focus and be nice.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:25.400
It was because they were
nice and focused on me.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.550
And that's the deepest--
that's the first thing

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:28.780
I say to teachers as well.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.894
When I train
teachers, I always--

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:33.560
like I worked at a school in San
Francisco this whole last year.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.330
The first four months I
only trained teachers.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:39.470
I told them, don't do anything
with your kids different.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.040
They all explained,
and this always

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.010
happens, that there was big
transformations with the kids.

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.080
And there's actually a
recent research study

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.250
that showed when elementary
school teachers are trained

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:51.820
in mindfulness,
their kids actually

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.790
act out less and have--
like the kids transform,

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:58.450
just because the
teachers are being nicer.

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:02.750
So for parents,
that's the practice,

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:07.060
is learning how to be present
with all of the stress

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.940
that having a young
child has, learning

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:13.100
how to work with
reactivity, and not--

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:16.330
basically the classic thing
of like all of the things

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:19.250
that your parents did but
you didn't want to do,

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.000
but you end up doing
anyways, because it's

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.250
so hard to be with those
emotions inside of ourselves.

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:24.750
Whew.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:29.070
OK, let's break this
cycle and learn how to--

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.450
I'm very much of the opinion
that the words that we end up

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:36.490
saying to our kids are the
words that become the our kids'

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.000
inner voices, right?

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.560
So how are we showing up?

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.440
So it's just a big call
for our own practice,

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.480
our own emotional intelligence,
our own mindfulness practice.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.110
With very young kids, once,
if you are really present,

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:53.640
there's some very fun games.

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.740
But they to be fun.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.980
Like, you have a kid lay
down and put a little Teddy

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:57.950
bear on their belly.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.449
And as they're
breathing in and out,

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.250
they feel it rising and falling.

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:05.350
Or M some fun kind of relaxation
games and little breathing

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:09.990
techniques and kind of
fun kind of yoga movement.

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:13.330
But yeah, I guess I'll end
the speech just by saying

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.050
that the practice is yours.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.540
That's where the
huge transformation

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.220
comes in, is when
we take ownership

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.770
of our own inner world and
then become that inner world.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.790
Thank you all so much
for all your time.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.340
[APPLAUSE]
