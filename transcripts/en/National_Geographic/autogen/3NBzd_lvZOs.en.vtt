guys I've got an ostrich this is the
first one I've seen in Juma this is

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560

just watch it they're coming through the
thickets you should see a gap there the

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.490
thickets you should see a gap there the
 

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:40.990

cool is this

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.090
 

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.160
now we are exhorted in an area that's a

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.170
now we are exhorted in an area that's a
 

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.040
now we are exhorted in an area that's a
lot more grassy and little more a little

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.050
lot more grassy and little more a little
 

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.000
lot more grassy and little more a little
less bushy so this is why they're

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.010
less bushy so this is why they're
 

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.060
less bushy so this is why they're
probably in this on this side and not so

00:08:59.060 --> 00:08:59.070
probably in this on this side and not so
 

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:05.980
probably in this on this side and not so
much with further down in the south Wow

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:05.990
 

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:11.590

right there we don't often get to see
 

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.280
right there we don't often get to see
that you see them in more of this

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:43.290
that you see them in more of this
 

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.320
that you see them in more of this
relaxed pose even that he's a little bit

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.330
relaxed pose even that he's a little bit
 

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:55.130
relaxed pose even that he's a little bit
stiffer the neck up held up up high

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140
 

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.990
Wow

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000
Wow
 

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.950
Wow
absolutely stunning now these are very

00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960
absolutely stunning now these are very
 

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.650
absolutely stunning now these are very
ancient birds and they are huge males to

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:04.660
ancient birds and they are huge males to
 

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.170
ancient birds and they are huge males to
about 100 kgs females to about 90 kgs

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.180
about 100 kgs females to about 90 kgs
 

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.940
about 100 kgs females to about 90 kgs
really really big guys now I'm saying

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:11.950
really really big guys now I'm saying
 

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.560
really really big guys now I'm saying
that these are both males because the

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:13.570
that these are both males because the
 

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.720
that these are both males because the
males are mostly black and they have bit

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:15.730
males are mostly black and they have bit
 

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.970
males are mostly black and they have bit
of white on the wings and of course a

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:17.980
of white on the wings and of course a
 

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.790
of white on the wings and of course a
white butt on the tail which is what

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:20.800
white butt on the tail which is what
 

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.290
white butt on the tail which is what
we're seeing there that's a bit dirty at

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:22.300
we're seeing there that's a bit dirty at
 

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:29.139
we're seeing there that's a bit dirty at
the moment

00:19:29.139 --> 00:19:29.149
 

00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:32.220
for the females it's a bit more brownie

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:32.230
for the females it's a bit more brownie
 

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:48.289
for the females it's a bit more brownie
but grayish

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299
 

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:53.550
very cool

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:53.560
 

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.310
Barbara you'd like to know how I think

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320
Barbara you'd like to know how I think
 

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.590
Barbara you'd like to know how I think
related the Penguins are to the

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.600
related the Penguins are to the
 

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.420
related the Penguins are to the
ostriches well of course they are both

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:00.430
ostriches well of course they are both
 

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.740
ostriches well of course they are both
birds so they do fetch is suppose into

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:04.750
birds so they do fetch is suppose into
 

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:11.100
birds so they do fetch is suppose into
the same group but they have ah how much

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.110
the same group but they have ah how much
 

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.650
the same group but they have ah how much
water do they need compared to penguins

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:13.660
water do they need compared to penguins
 

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.760
water do they need compared to penguins
well of course penguins need a whole lot

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:17.770
well of course penguins need a whole lot
 

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.780
well of course penguins need a whole lot
of water because they water dependent in

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:21.790
of water because they water dependent in
 

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.630
of water because they water dependent in
order to to eat and survive and breed

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640
order to to eat and survive and breed
 

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:31.050
order to to eat and survive and breed
whereas cancel penguin she says you mean

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:31.060
whereas cancel penguin she says you mean
 

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.810
whereas cancel penguin she says you mean
ostriches how much is the requirement of

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:33.820
ostriches how much is the requirement of
 

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.300
ostriches how much is the requirement of
ostriches I'm not quite sure but I would

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:36.310
ostriches I'm not quite sure but I would
 

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.460
ostriches I'm not quite sure but I would
think that they would need some water we

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:38.470
think that they would need some water we
 

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.250
think that they would need some water we
see birds always near the dams and

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.260
see birds always near the dams and
 

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.020
see birds always near the dams and
things like that looking for water so I

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.030
things like that looking for water so I
 

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.060
things like that looking for water so I
would assume that I would need Sun but I

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.070
would assume that I would need Sun but I
 

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.770
would assume that I would need Sun but I
would check up for you definitely

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:46.780
would check up for you definitely
 

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.170
would check up for you definitely
now I'm gonna reposition because they're

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:49.180
now I'm gonna reposition because they're
 

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.190
now I'm gonna reposition because they're
still around you and they're moving

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200
still around you and they're moving
 

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.560
still around you and they're moving
quite slowly and they're being very good

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:52.570
quite slowly and they're being very good
 

00:20:52.570 --> 00:21:02.360
quite slowly and they're being very good
to us so let's do this quickly

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:02.370
 

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:06.890
now they are quite used to the heat and

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900
now they are quite used to the heat and
 

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:15.320
now they are quite used to the heat and
you do see them in sort of arid areas so

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:15.330
you do see them in sort of arid areas so
 

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.000
you do see them in sort of arid areas so
they are not so much looking for shade

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.010
they are not so much looking for shade
 

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:25.570
they are not so much looking for shade
as much as I am are they there we go

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:25.580
 

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.840
here we've got a small gap how's that

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:29.850
here we've got a small gap how's that
 

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:45.530
here we've got a small gap how's that
Craig

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:45.540
 

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.820
very cool cleanly you'd like to know

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:49.830
very cool cleanly you'd like to know
 

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:53.190
very cool cleanly you'd like to know
what I would suppose that predators

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200
what I would suppose that predators
 

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.570
what I would suppose that predators
would do if they come across these

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:54.580
would do if they come across these
 

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.850
would do if they come across these
ostriches did I hear that correctly

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860
ostriches did I hear that correctly
 

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.230
ostriches did I hear that correctly
sorry I was just repositioning at the

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240
sorry I was just repositioning at the
 

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.950
sorry I was just repositioning at the
same time they see they've noticed us

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960
same time they see they've noticed us
 

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:07.910
same time they see they've noticed us
and they're quite still at the moment I

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:07.920
 

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:14.340
would suppose that they may try to hunt

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:14.350
would suppose that they may try to hunt
 

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.140
would suppose that they may try to hunt
these ostriches but on ostriches are

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:16.150
these ostriches but on ostriches are
 

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.630
these ostriches but on ostriches are
really really big and they also have

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640
really really big and they also have
 

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.590
really really big and they also have
quite dangerous claws on their feet so

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600
quite dangerous claws on their feet so
 

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.450
quite dangerous claws on their feet so
the extent where once read a story about

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:24.460
the extent where once read a story about
 

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.510
the extent where once read a story about
a guy who had an interaction with an

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520
a guy who had an interaction with an
 

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.290
a guy who had an interaction with an
ostrich and went foul unfortunately and

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:33.300
ostrich and went foul unfortunately and
 

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.390
ostrich and went foul unfortunately and
the ostrich had actually ripped through

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400
the ostrich had actually ripped through
 

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.030
the ostrich had actually ripped through
the front of his shirt and his leather

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:39.040
the front of his shirt and his leather
 

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.190
the front of his shirt and his leather
belt so that'll give you an idea of

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200
belt so that'll give you an idea of
 

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.330
belt so that'll give you an idea of
exactly how strong and sharp those claws

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:45.340
exactly how strong and sharp those claws
 

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:53.090
exactly how strong and sharp those claws
of the ostrich are

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100
 

00:22:53.100 --> 00:23:03.400
look at those no blinis

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:03.410
 

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.200
now lots of them can actually gather

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:05.210
now lots of them can actually gather
 

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.060
now lots of them can actually gather
together but what we're seeing here is

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.070
together but what we're seeing here is
 

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:16.370
together but what we're seeing here is
just a pair for the moment

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380
 

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.950
even though they do mostly eat

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960
even though they do mostly eat
 

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.340
even though they do mostly eat
vegetation they have been known to eat

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:22.350
vegetation they have been known to eat
 

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.640
vegetation they have been known to eat
termites every now and then especially

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:25.650
termites every now and then especially
 

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:36.810
termites every now and then especially
the juveniles

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:36.820
 

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.010
ah there they go walking away the pair

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.020
ah there they go walking away the pair
 

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.040
ah there they go walking away the pair
head held high absolutely stunning

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.050
head held high absolutely stunning
 

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.620
head held high absolutely stunning

live there'll be these ostriches and

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.270
live there'll be these ostriches and
 

00:23:55.270 --> 00:24:22.830
live there'll be these ostriches and
many many other animals so please do

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840
 

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.930
so cool guys don't you think so now look

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:27.940
so cool guys don't you think so now look
 

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.810
so cool guys don't you think so now look
how they hold their head just above the

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:30.820
how they hold their head just above the
 

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.490
how they hold their head just above the
ground I think on average they hold

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:32.500
ground I think on average they hold
 

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.250
ground I think on average they hold
their head about 30 centimeters above

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:35.260
their head about 30 centimeters above
 

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.220
their head about 30 centimeters above
the ground so it's really easy to just

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:37.230
the ground so it's really easy to just
 

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:43.380
the ground so it's really easy to just
snap that now if you look at actually

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:43.390
snap that now if you look at actually
 

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.410
snap that now if you look at actually
the way that it just moved you could see

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:46.420
the way that it just moved you could see
 

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.270
the way that it just moved you could see
that if it were running and being chased

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:48.280
that if it were running and being chased
 

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.390
that if it were running and being chased
by a predator like we were asked earlier

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400
by a predator like we were asked earlier
 

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.550
by a predator like we were asked earlier
it could easily change directions and

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:53.560
it could easily change directions and
 

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.990
it could easily change directions and
sort of move from side to side but I've

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000
sort of move from side to side but I've
 

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.430
sort of move from side to side but I've
said this before they can be quite

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440
said this before they can be quite
 

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.020
said this before they can be quite
intimidating and they look quite

indeed they managed to get hold of the

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:57.590
indeed they managed to get hold of the
 

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:02.590
indeed they managed to get hold of the
class I so nothing remains there the

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600
class I so nothing remains there the
 

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.169
class I so nothing remains there the
mother is not there the hyena in sight

00:30:05.169 --> 00:30:05.179
mother is not there the hyena in sight
 

00:30:05.179 --> 00:30:09.399
mother is not there the hyena in sight
and there's also not a carcass so as sad

00:30:09.399 --> 00:30:09.409
and there's also not a carcass so as sad
 

00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:10.450
and there's also not a carcass so as sad
as that may sound

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:10.460
as that may sound
 

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.480
as that may sound
indeed the situation the mother hair-dye

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:13.490
indeed the situation the mother hair-dye
 

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.659
indeed the situation the mother hair-dye
for as long as she absolutely kids but

00:30:16.659 --> 00:30:16.669
for as long as she absolutely kids but
 

00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:19.149
for as long as she absolutely kids but
indeed the situation for now is of

00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159
indeed the situation for now is of
 

00:30:19.159 --> 00:30:22.060
indeed the situation for now is of
course over so that makes me feel a

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:22.070
course over so that makes me feel a
 

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.060
course over so that makes me feel a
little bit better that the mother can

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.070
little bit better that the mother can
 

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.810
little bit better that the mother can
rest shall we say yes that makes me feel

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:28.820
rest shall we say yes that makes me feel
 

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.100
rest shall we say yes that makes me feel
a little bit better so that was my

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:30.110
a little bit better so that was my
 

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:34.590
a little bit better so that was my
update on the giraffe situation for now

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600
update on the giraffe situation for now
 

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.010
update on the giraffe situation for now
but other than that I'm just bumblin and

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.020
but other than that I'm just bumblin and
 

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.899
but other than that I'm just bumblin and
hopefully we will come across something

00:30:40.899 --> 00:30:40.909
hopefully we will come across something
 

00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:43.690
hopefully we will come across something
exciting and the rains due to stay off

Africa um we're just moved through quite

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620
Africa um we're just moved through quite
 

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.680
Africa um we're just moved through quite
a big drainage line and had a lot of

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:39.690
a big drainage line and had a lot of
 

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.650
a big drainage line and had a lot of
elephant tracks so we're gonna try and

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:42.660
elephant tracks so we're gonna try and
 

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.480
elephant tracks so we're gonna try and
get around and follow up and see if we

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:44.490
get around and follow up and see if we
 

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.450
get around and follow up and see if we
have any luck sometimes up on these

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460
have any luck sometimes up on these
 

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.280
have any luck sometimes up on these
crests you get some big trees with some

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:49.290
crests you get some big trees with some
 

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:54.820
crests you get some big trees with some
shade so we'll be moving up to that area

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:54.830
shade so we'll be moving up to that area
 

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:59.870
shade so we'll be moving up to that area
we also had a small antelope down in the

00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880
we also had a small antelope down in the
 

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.780
we also had a small antelope down in the
strange land called a bush buck but they

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:02.790
strange land called a bush buck but they
 

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:05.180
strange land called a bush buck but they
quite elusive we try to stop and see if

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:05.190
quite elusive we try to stop and see if
 

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.070
quite elusive we try to stop and see if
we could get it to stick around but they

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080
we could get it to stick around but they
 

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.140
we could get it to stick around but they
don't they not very used to camera but

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:12.150
don't they not very used to camera but
 

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.840
don't they not very used to camera but
camera shy so sadly we couldn't hold on

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:14.850
camera shy so sadly we couldn't hold on
 

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:23.410
camera shy so sadly we couldn't hold on
to it we back out into the heat yeah and

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:23.420
to it we back out into the heat yeah and
 

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.510
to it we back out into the heat yeah and
we should get some big shade on the top

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520
we should get some big shade on the top
 

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:33.769
we should get some big shade on the top
of these these ridges

00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779
 

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:45.640
very interesting out

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:45.650
 

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.070
they'll either the horses the hardest

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080
they'll either the horses the hardest
 

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.510
they'll either the horses the hardest
animal to catch on camera I would say in

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:52.520
animal to catch on camera I would say in
 

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:58.480
animal to catch on camera I would say in
this area probably Pangolin some of the

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:58.490
this area probably Pangolin some of the
 

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:03.870
this area probably Pangolin some of the
nocturnal stuff so I would say Pangolin

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880
nocturnal stuff so I would say Pangolin
 

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.740
nocturnal stuff so I would say Pangolin
porcupine to to a certain extent and the

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:08.750
porcupine to to a certain extent and the
 

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:14.070
porcupine to to a certain extent and the
Pangolin is that is a scaly anteater and

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080
Pangolin is that is a scaly anteater and
 

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.120
Pangolin is that is a scaly anteater and
they're not very nocturnal also quite

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:18.130
they're not very nocturnal also quite
 

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.970
they're not very nocturnal also quite
very difficult to find but once you find

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:21.980
very difficult to find but once you find
 

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.769
very difficult to find but once you find
them they're very slow-moving so they're

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:23.779
them they're very slow-moving so they're
 

00:33:23.779 --> 00:33:26.950
them they're very slow-moving so they're
not too difficult to follow and if they

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960
not too difficult to follow and if they
 

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.720
not too difficult to follow and if they
sense any danger they'll just roll up

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:28.730
sense any danger they'll just roll up
 

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.440
sense any danger they'll just roll up
into a ball I've seen a couple of them

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:32.450
into a ball I've seen a couple of them
 

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.830
into a ball I've seen a couple of them
and funny enough a few times I've found

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840
and funny enough a few times I've found
 

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.480
and funny enough a few times I've found
them from predators actually finding

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:40.490
them from predators actually finding
 

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.480
them from predators actually finding
them and playing with them so that's the

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:43.490
them and playing with them so that's the
 

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.490
them and playing with them so that's the
way if you follow predators they'll

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:45.500
way if you follow predators they'll
 

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.560
way if you follow predators they'll
sometimes come across them and roll and

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:47.570
sometimes come across them and roll and
 

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.389
sometimes come across them and roll and
they instinctively roll up and then

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399
they instinctively roll up and then
 

00:33:49.399 --> 00:33:51.190
they instinctively roll up and then
they'll they'll play with them and then

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200
they'll they'll play with them and then
 

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.960
they'll they'll play with them and then
you can go in and see what's going on

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:52.970
you can go in and see what's going on
 

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.380
you can go in and see what's going on
and that's how you often find Anglin so

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:56.390
and that's how you often find Anglin so
 

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.630
and that's how you often find Anglin so
it's like the Anglin probably one of the

00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640
it's like the Anglin probably one of the
 

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:03.490
it's like the Anglin probably one of the
more difficult things and then also

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:03.500
more difficult things and then also
 

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.230
more difficult things and then also
probably hard to get on form is

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240
probably hard to get on form is
 

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.889
probably hard to get on form is
sometimes different animals hunting and

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:11.899
sometimes different animals hunting and
 

00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:16.690
sometimes different animals hunting and
and killing because you often down at

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:16.700
and killing because you often down at
 

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.389
and killing because you often down at
night and you don't want to you don't

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399
night and you don't want to you don't
 

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:21.820
night and you don't want to you don't
want to affect the hunt so that would be

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:21.830
want to affect the hunt so that would be
 

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.359
want to affect the hunt so that would be
very difficult and less that's a diurnal

00:34:24.359 --> 00:34:24.369
very difficult and less that's a diurnal
 

00:34:24.369 --> 00:34:27.099
very difficult and less that's a diurnal
animal often cheetah

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:27.109
animal often cheetah
 

00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:29.230
animal often cheetah
well cheetah will normally always hunt

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240
well cheetah will normally always hunt
 

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.290
well cheetah will normally always hunt
in daylight hours or all full moon

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:32.300
in daylight hours or all full moon
 

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.940
in daylight hours or all full moon
they've been known to hunt in full moon

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:33.950
they've been known to hunt in full moon
 

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.520
they've been known to hunt in full moon
so they're a little bit easier to catch

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:35.530
so they're a little bit easier to catch
 

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:41.710
so they're a little bit easier to catch
on on camera of hunting leopard a pretty

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720
on on camera of hunting leopard a pretty
 

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.869
on on camera of hunting leopard a pretty
diverse they'll hunt day and night so

00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879
diverse they'll hunt day and night so
 

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:47.829
diverse they'll hunt day and night so
they've been good captures of leopard

00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839
they've been good captures of leopard
 

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:53.589
they've been good captures of leopard
hunting in the day so yeah but there's a

00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599
hunting in the day so yeah but there's a
 

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:55.240
hunting in the day so yeah but there's a
lot of stuff that's difficult to get on

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:55.250
lot of stuff that's difficult to get on
 

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.930
lot of stuff that's difficult to get on
a catch on form

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940
a catch on form
 

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.890
a catch on form
births obviously different animals

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:00.900
births obviously different animals
 

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.839
births obviously different animals
giving birth especially your smaller

00:35:02.839 --> 00:35:02.849
giving birth especially your smaller
 

00:35:02.849 --> 00:35:10.940
giving birth especially your smaller
stuff

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:10.950
 

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:14.030
see how hot that's getting these I'm

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040
see how hot that's getting these I'm
 

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.799
see how hot that's getting these I'm
just gonna point out something to you

00:35:15.799 --> 00:35:15.809
just gonna point out something to you
 

00:35:15.809 --> 00:35:19.750
just gonna point out something to you
save if you can just shine on onto these

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760
save if you can just shine on onto these
 

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.730
save if you can just shine on onto these
these yeah I'm just gonna show you

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:24.740
these yeah I'm just gonna show you
 

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.500
these yeah I'm just gonna show you
it's definitely moisture needed in this

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:27.510
it's definitely moisture needed in this
 

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.500
it's definitely moisture needed in this
part because you can see these what we

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:30.510
part because you can see these what we
 

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:34.069
part because you can see these what we
call round leaf ticks and when they

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079
call round leaf ticks and when they
 

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:37.579
call round leaf ticks and when they
small a very shrubby you can see how

00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:37.589
small a very shrubby you can see how
 

00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:40.220
small a very shrubby you can see how
they wilting with the heat and they'll

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:40.230
they wilting with the heat and they'll
 

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.160
they wilting with the heat and they'll
only really pick up when when we get

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.170
only really pick up when when we get
 

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:47.599
only really pick up when when we get
some more rain they in this area they

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:47.609
some more rain they in this area they
 

00:35:47.609 --> 00:35:50.210
some more rain they in this area they
seldom get to be big trees because

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220
seldom get to be big trees because
 

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:54.440
seldom get to be big trees because
elephants absolutely love them it's like

most fascinates me nonverbal
 

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:08.839
most fascinates me nonverbal
communication and this is why I love

00:37:08.839 --> 00:37:08.849
communication and this is why I love
 

00:37:08.849 --> 00:37:11.480

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:22.050
and no one in my family is deaf but we
 

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.440
and no one in my family is deaf but we
grew up signing for the Deaf British

this is how I used to speak to deaf

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:37.860
this is how I used to speak to deaf
 

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.110
this is how I used to speak to deaf
people when we were at home we would

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:39.120
people when we were at home we would
 

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.600
people when we were at home we would
greet each other completely silently so

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:41.610
greet each other completely silently so
 

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:49.060
greet each other completely silently so
it would of course be hello how are you

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:49.070
 

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:55.520
good afternoon my name is Lauren and

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:55.530
good afternoon my name is Lauren and
 

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.830
good afternoon my name is Lauren and
this is just fascinated me since I've

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:57.840
this is just fascinated me since I've
 

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.290
this is just fascinated me since I've
been a child hi people and animals can

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300
been a child hi people and animals can
 

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.110
been a child hi people and animals can
communicate completely non-verbally and

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:03.120
communicate completely non-verbally and
 

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.570
communicate completely non-verbally and
that's exactly what these elephants are

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:05.580
that's exactly what these elephants are
 

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.300
that's exactly what these elephants are
doing here so we do hear them make noise

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:08.310
doing here so we do hear them make noise
 

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.580
doing here so we do hear them make noise
'yes we do hear them make rumbles and

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:10.590
'yes we do hear them make rumbles and
 

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.220
'yes we do hear them make rumbles and
grumbles and even trumpets actually

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:13.230
grumbles and even trumpets actually
 

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.560
grumbles and even trumpets actually
elephants can be very variable and they

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:15.570
elephants can be very variable and they
 

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.960
elephants can be very variable and they
can of course be very noisy but they

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:17.970
can of course be very noisy but they
 

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.030
can of course be very noisy but they
also have a huge other range of

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040
also have a huge other range of
 

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.890
also have a huge other range of
communications is really hard to get

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900
communications is really hard to get
 

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.730
communications is really hard to get
gripple they can actually communicate

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:24.740
gripple they can actually communicate
 

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.710
gripple they can actually communicate
sophistical ii so what that means is the

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720
sophistical ii so what that means is the
 

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.980
sophistical ii so what that means is the
tip of an elephant's trunk actually has

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:30.990
tip of an elephant's trunk actually has
 

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:34.160
tip of an elephant's trunk actually has
layers of cells in it that are extremely

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:34.170
layers of cells in it that are extremely
 

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.740
layers of cells in it that are extremely
sensitive to vibrations so they're

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:36.750
sensitive to vibrations so they're
 

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.770
sensitive to vibrations so they're
actually able to detect movement of one

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780
actually able to detect movement of one
 

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.960
actually able to detect movement of one
another and their surroundings from

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:41.970
another and their surroundings from
 

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.390
another and their surroundings from
those really sensitive cells on the tips

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400
those really sensitive cells on the tips
 

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.490
those really sensitive cells on the tips
of their trunk and even on the bottom of

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500
of their trunk and even on the bottom of
 

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.220
of their trunk and even on the bottom of
their feet so this is another form of

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:49.230
their feet so this is another form of
 

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.230
their feet so this is another form of
communication that humans can't guess

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240
communication that humans can't guess
 

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.880
communication that humans can't guess
can just struggle to get their head

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:52.890
can just struggle to get their head
 

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.310
can just struggle to get their head
around I can definitely struggle to get

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320
around I can definitely struggle to get
 

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.350
around I can definitely struggle to get
my head around that cuz obviously this

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:57.360
my head around that cuz obviously this
 

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.440
my head around that cuz obviously this
is not a capability of humans and it is

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:00.450
is not a capability of humans and it is
 

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:03.740
is not a capability of humans and it is
just absolutely utterly fascinating I

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:03.750
just absolutely utterly fascinating I
 

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.710
just absolutely utterly fascinating I
mean not even that the frequencies that

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720
mean not even that the frequencies that
 

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.630
mean not even that the frequencies that
the elephants can use to communicate

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640
the elephants can use to communicate
 

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.550
the elephants can use to communicate
with one another of course some we can

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560
with one another of course some we can
 

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.950
with one another of course some we can
here we can hear very loudly noise of

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960
here we can hear very loudly noise of
 

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.780
here we can hear very loudly noise of
some sort there but of course they

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:17.790
some sort there but of course they
 

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.030
some sort there but of course they
actually use frequencies that are even

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040
actually use frequencies that are even
 

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.480
actually use frequencies that are even
so low for humans to hear they can be as

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:23.490
so low for humans to hear they can be as
 

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.710
so low for humans to hear they can be as
low as about 12 Hertz

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720
low as about 12 Hertz
 

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.080
low as about 12 Hertz
that is completely out of the human

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.090
that is completely out of the human
 

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.280
that is completely out of the human
range so this whole hair here could be

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:32.290
range so this whole hair here could be
 

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.180
range so this whole hair here could be
communicating to one another and

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:34.190
communicating to one another and
 

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:37.300

question and honestly I don't 100% know

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:34.910
question and honestly I don't 100% know
 

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.790
question and honestly I don't 100% know
the answer but I would believe they

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800
the answer but I would believe they
 

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.130
the answer but I would believe they
could be if they were born if there was

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.140
could be if they were born if there was
 

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.849
could be if they were born if there was
maybe a genetic problem since birth I

00:40:42.849 --> 00:40:42.859
maybe a genetic problem since birth I
 

00:40:42.859 --> 00:40:46.450
maybe a genetic problem since birth I
believe I guess an elephant could be or

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:46.460
believe I guess an elephant could be or
 

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.210
believe I guess an elephant could be or
maybe if it damaged its ear in some way

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:49.220
maybe if it damaged its ear in some way
 

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.120
maybe if it damaged its ear in some way
I guess indeed it could be but an animal

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.130
I guess indeed it could be but an animal
 

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.310
I guess indeed it could be but an animal
like this could survive and thrive

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:54.320
like this could survive and thrive
 

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.980
like this could survive and thrive
because they have so many other forms of

because they have so many other forms of
communication through these vibrations

00:40:59.650 --> 00:40:59.660
communication through these vibrations
 

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.230
communication through these vibrations
that are able to detect through touching

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240
that are able to detect through touching
 

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.210
that are able to detect through touching
through visual as long as they've got

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:04.220
through visual as long as they've got
 

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.160

their eyes they can see one another as
 

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:07.570
their eyes they can see one another as
long as they've got their trunks they

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:07.580
long as they've got their trunks they
 

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.120
long as they've got their trunks they
can touch one another so indeed even if

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:10.130
can touch one another so indeed even if
 

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:13.750
can touch one another so indeed even if
an elephant was dead I really don't

even think of because humans are so used

even think of because humans are so used

so I don't know of anything else

fundamental part that we've actually
seen quite a few elephants missing the

feed they can still use their trunk
because it's only the tip that isn't

because it's only the tip that isn't

because it's only the tip that isn't
missing so they can still use that in

also have body language that we can even

also have body language that we can even

read each other's body language and

read each other's body language and
there's just so many ways that these

there's just so many ways that these
 

00:43:17.239 --> 00:43:20.589
there's just so many ways that these
fantastic animals can communicate and I

00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599
fantastic animals can communicate and I
 

00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:23.469
fantastic animals can communicate and I
just think elephants in general are

00:43:23.469 --> 00:43:23.479
just think elephants in general are
 

00:43:23.479 --> 00:43:25.539
just think elephants in general are
incredible that way and I'm sure there

00:43:25.539 --> 00:43:25.549
incredible that way and I'm sure there
 

00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:27.549
incredible that way and I'm sure there
is more that we don't even know that we

00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559
is more that we don't even know that we

is more that we don't even know that we
haven't even learned about these

haven't even learned about these
 

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.449
haven't even learned about these
fantastic mammals but indeed they have

fantastic mammals but indeed they have
 

00:43:31.459 --> 00:43:34.599
fantastic mammals but indeed they have
such a variety of ways to communicate

00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:42.249
or the other one has lost a tip of its
trunk then indeed I really do not think

00:43:42.249 --> 00:43:42.259
trunk then indeed I really do not think
 

00:43:42.259 --> 00:43:43.670
trunk then indeed I really do not think
that would hinder the

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680
that would hinder the
 

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.140
that would hinder the
it's lifestyle at all what a lovely

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:48.150
it's lifestyle at all what a lovely
 

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.720
it's lifestyle at all what a lovely
sighting they've all just completely got

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:50.730
sighting they've all just completely got
 

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:55.819
sighting they've all just completely got
wet cooled down and they're feeding and

00:43:55.819 --> 00:43:55.829
wet cooled down and they're feeding and
 

00:43:55.829 --> 00:44:00.170
wet cooled down and they're feeding and
moving at the same time they're actually

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180
moving at the same time they're actually
 

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.880
moving at the same time they're actually
all around us we've got some to the

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:01.890
all around us we've got some to the
 

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:07.480
all around us we've got some to the
other side as well

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:07.490
 

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:10.160
Gary's asking do elephants communicate

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.170
Gary's asking do elephants communicate
 

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:11.870
Gary's asking do elephants communicate
with other animals that's quite a tricky

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880
with other animals that's quite a tricky
 

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.089
with other animals that's quite a tricky
question to answer I'm not sure it's

00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:14.099
question to answer I'm not sure it's
 

00:44:14.099 --> 00:44:16.280
question to answer I'm not sure it's
even possible to answer because it's not

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:16.290
even possible to answer because it's not
 

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.500
even possible to answer because it's not
possible really for interspecies

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:18.510
possible really for interspecies
 

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:26.680
possible really for interspecies
communication to work quite like that so

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:26.690
 

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:29.120
so yes it doesn't work quite like that

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:29.130
so yes it doesn't work quite like that
 

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.760
so yes it doesn't work quite like that
because of course if a lion was to

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:31.770
because of course if a lion was to
 

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.920
because of course if a lion was to
approach these elephants right now they

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:33.930
approach these elephants right now they
 

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.920
approach these elephants right now they
would indeed reacts and the elephant way

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:36.930
would indeed reacts and the elephant way
 

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.200
would indeed reacts and the elephant way
if that makes sense so they would most

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.210
if that makes sense so they would most
 

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.329
if that makes sense so they would most
likely herd together they would most

00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339
likely herd together they would most
 

00:44:41.339 --> 00:44:43.160
likely herd together they would most
likely make themselves so even bigger

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:43.170
likely make themselves so even bigger
 

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.530
likely make themselves so even bigger
than they already do they would trumpet

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540
than they already do they would trumpet
 

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.650
than they already do they would trumpet
they will charge their tails we go erect

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660
they will charge their tails we go erect
 

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.839
they will charge their tails we go erect
they would definitely show that they're

00:44:50.839 --> 00:44:50.849
they would definitely show that they're
 

00:44:50.849 --> 00:44:53.900
they would definitely show that they're
not happy the lion or lions are present

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:53.910
not happy the lion or lions are present
 

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.359
not happy the lion or lions are present
but in terms of communicating with the

00:44:56.359 --> 00:44:56.369
but in terms of communicating with the
 

00:44:56.369 --> 00:44:56.750
but in terms of communicating with the
lion

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760
lion
 

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.510
lion
I do not indeed think that is possible

00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520
I do not indeed think that is possible
 

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.390
I do not indeed think that is possible
but they will show their dislike for the

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400
but they will show their dislike for the
 

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.079
but they will show their dislike for the
Lions presence and there's many a lot of

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:06.089
Lions presence and there's many a lot of
 

00:45:06.089 --> 00:45:08.000
Lions presence and there's many a lot of
footage online where you see elephants

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.010
footage online where you see elephants
 

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.950
footage online where you see elephants
are really shown their dislike of other

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960
are really shown their dislike of other
 

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.680
are really shown their dislike of other
animals coming far too close to them so

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:12.690
animals coming far too close to them so
 

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:14.480
animals coming far too close to them so
indeed they would communicate it but in

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:14.490
indeed they would communicate it but in
 

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.730
indeed they would communicate it but in
their own elephant way which I am sure a

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740
their own elephant way which I am sure a
 

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.069
their own elephant way which I am sure a
lion would probably understand because

00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079
lion would probably understand because
 

00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:21.770
lion would probably understand because
it's very visual it's very loud and

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780
it's very visual it's very loud and
 

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.579
it's very visual it's very loud and
indeed these are very big mammals so I

00:45:25.579 --> 00:45:25.589
indeed these are very big mammals so I
 

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.770
indeed these are very big mammals so I
am more than sure that the lion or

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780
am more than sure that the lion or
 

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.020
am more than sure that the lion or
whichever other animal it would could be

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:30.030
whichever other animal it would could be
 

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:32.359
whichever other animal it would could be
would indeed get the point and most

00:45:32.359 --> 00:45:32.369
would indeed get the point and most
 

00:45:32.369 --> 00:45:36.200
would indeed get the point and most
likely elephants so very tricky question

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:36.210
likely elephants so very tricky question
 

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.880
likely elephants so very tricky question
Gary but I hope that made sense

ostriches yes that it really is
wonderful the way that animals

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:10.190
wonderful the way that animals
 

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.700
wonderful the way that animals
communicate and elephants especially

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:12.710
communicate and elephants especially
 

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.320
communicate and elephants especially
because they are absolutely beautiful

they communicate in all sorts of

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:17.540
they communicate in all sorts of
 

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.710
they communicate in all sorts of
different ways so even if they are deaf

hot coals very cool you can see those
bare legs they lose a lot of heat from

got a question of where I think the
females ostriches are and back again

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:42.230
 

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:44.720
Claudia you'd like to know where I think

into gym I said it just is zigzagging so
the females could be I suppose such a

the females could be I suppose such a
 

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.490
the females could be I suppose such a
vast area they could be anywhere really

and it's we deeper than I actually

00:54:44.029 --> 00:54:44.039
and it's we deeper than I actually
 

00:54:44.039 --> 00:54:48.349
and it's we deeper than I actually
thought it went so giraffe do tend to be

00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359
thought it went so giraffe do tend to be
 

00:54:48.359 --> 00:54:50.029
thought it went so giraffe do tend to be
more on the silent side especially

00:54:50.029 --> 00:54:50.039
more on the silent side especially
 

00:54:50.039 --> 00:54:52.700
more on the silent side especially
compared to elephants which we did just

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:52.710
compared to elephants which we did just
 

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:55.249
compared to elephants which we did just
speak about but indeed they were thought

00:54:55.249 --> 00:54:55.259
speak about but indeed they were thought
 

00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:58.069
speak about but indeed they were thought
to be so tight-lipped and silent for a

00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079
to be so tight-lipped and silent for a
 

00:54:58.079 --> 00:55:00.469
to be so tight-lipped and silent for a
long time and one of the theories was

00:55:00.469 --> 00:55:00.479
long time and one of the theories was
 

00:55:00.479 --> 00:55:02.150
long time and one of the theories was
that they do have a voice box they do

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160
that they do have a voice box they do
 

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.059
that they do have a voice box they do
have a Loring's but due to this very

00:55:05.059 --> 00:55:05.069
have a Loring's but due to this very
 

00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:07.700
have a Loring's but due to this very
long neck that they weren't able to get

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:07.710
long neck that they weren't able to get
 

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.420
long neck that they weren't able to get
a proper airflow and and make adequate

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:10.430
a proper airflow and and make adequate
 

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:12.650
a proper airflow and and make adequate
vocalizations now this myth has been

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660
vocalizations now this myth has been
 

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.469
vocalizations now this myth has been
completely debunked and in fact they do

00:55:15.469 --> 00:55:15.479
completely debunked and in fact they do
 

00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:17.690
completely debunked and in fact they do
especially when they're distressed they

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:17.700
especially when they're distressed they
 

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.880
especially when they're distressed they
will make a very deep bellow

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:19.890
will make a very deep bellow
 

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:22.940
will make a very deep bellow
which is a hard thing to listen to but

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:22.950
which is a hard thing to listen to but
 

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.339
which is a hard thing to listen to but
giraffes really can force out a big

00:55:25.339 --> 00:55:25.349
giraffes really can force out a big
 

00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:27.979
giraffes really can force out a big
bellow when being born but not only that

00:55:27.979 --> 00:55:27.989
bellow when being born but not only that
 

00:55:27.989 --> 00:55:31.059
bellow when being born but not only that
believe it or not they are actually

00:55:31.059 --> 00:55:31.069
believe it or not they are actually
 

00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:35.239
believe it or not they are actually
Hummers no I'm not a Hummer myself but

00:55:35.239 --> 00:55:35.249
Hummers no I'm not a Hummer myself but
 

00:55:35.249 --> 00:55:39.079
Hummers no I'm not a Hummer myself but
indeed giraffes are said to hum o night

00:55:39.079 --> 00:55:39.089
indeed giraffes are said to hum o night
 

00:55:39.089 --> 00:55:41.900
indeed giraffes are said to hum o night
long can you believe that I honestly had

long can you believe that I honestly had
 

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:45.469
long can you believe that I honestly had
no idea of that either and it's supposed

no idea of that either and it's supposed
 

00:55:45.479 --> 00:55:47.420
no idea of that either and it's supposed

I'm sure humans couldn't really possibly

experiments giraffes obviously have

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:08.580
experiments giraffes obviously have
 

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.820
experiments giraffes obviously have
excellent vision and they are the

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:10.830
excellent vision and they are the
 

00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:11.630
excellent vision and they are the
lighthouses

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640
lighthouses
 

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.610

indeed once it gets dark if you think

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:22.080
indeed once it gets dark if you think
 

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.250
indeed once it gets dark if you think
about it relying heavily on own vision

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:25.260
about it relying heavily on own vision
 

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:28.640
about it relying heavily on own vision
or visual clues becomes almost difficult

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:28.650

got some giraffes crossing the roads in

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:33.030
got some giraffes crossing the roads in
 

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.020
got some giraffes crossing the roads in
front of us here as well so if they can

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:36.030
front of us here as well so if they can
 

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:37.850
front of us here as well so if they can
sort of rely on their vision anymore

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:37.860
sort of rely on their vision anymore
 

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.470
sort of rely on their vision anymore
because it's dark then what are they

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480
because it's dark then what are they
 

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.420
because it's dark then what are they
gonna rely on to communicate and here

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:41.430
gonna rely on to communicate and here
 

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.610
gonna rely on to communicate and here
you go apparently they hum all

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:43.620
you go apparently they hum all
 

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.710
you go apparently they hum all
throughout the night to keep in contact

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720
throughout the night to keep in contact
 

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.380
throughout the night to keep in contact
and communicate with one another so it's

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:48.390
and communicate with one another so it's
 

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:50.840
and communicate with one another so it's
not wise enough to attract predators but

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:50.850
not wise enough to attract predators but
 

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:53.060
not wise enough to attract predators but
indeed the giraffes can communicate with

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:53.070
indeed the giraffes can communicate with
 

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:54.940
indeed the giraffes can communicate with
one another when the vision is

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:54.950
one another when the vision is
 

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.650
one another when the vision is
non-existent so isn't that incredible

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660
non-existent so isn't that incredible
 

00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:59.180
non-existent so isn't that incredible
and it's one of the ways that giraffes

00:56:59.180 --> 00:56:59.190
and it's one of the ways that giraffes
 

00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:01.910
and it's one of the ways that giraffes
actually are able to stay together in a

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920
actually are able to stay together in a
 

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.030
actually are able to stay together in a
sort of loose aggregation like they form

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:04.040
sort of loose aggregation like they form
 

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.530
sort of loose aggregation like they form
because they can hear each other

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540
because they can hear each other
 

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:10.220
because they can hear each other
it's just humans that cannot incredible

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:10.230
it's just humans that cannot incredible
 

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:12.410
it's just humans that cannot incredible
incredible stuff and of course I've spin

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420
incredible stuff and of course I've spin
 

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.830
incredible stuff and of course I've spin
ye well the last few days with giraffes

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:15.840
ye well the last few days with giraffes
 

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.900
ye well the last few days with giraffes
shall I say and it's been very intense

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:17.910
shall I say and it's been very intense
 

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:20.420
shall I say and it's been very intense
and of course I've just got a newfound

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:20.430
and of course I've just got a newfound
 

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:22.870
and of course I've just got a newfound
respect for these wonderful wonderful

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880
respect for these wonderful wonderful
 

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.820
respect for these wonderful wonderful
animals and indeed they're a lot noisier

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:25.830
animals and indeed they're a lot noisier
 

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:29.660
animals and indeed they're a lot noisier
than you think they are isn't that just

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:29.670
than you think they are isn't that just
 

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:33.140
than you think they are isn't that just
amazing so of course we are owner

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:33.150
amazing so of course we are owner
 

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:35.180
amazing so of course we are owner
emission to get to the Lions but we keep

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:35.190
emission to get to the Lions but we keep
 

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:38.060

and size I didn't catch the name but I

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:46.020
and size I didn't catch the name but I
 

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.080
and size I didn't catch the name but I
do know I am being asked how do we tell

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:48.090
do know I am being asked how do we tell
 

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.900
do know I am being asked how do we tell
the age of a giraffe okay let's see if

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:50.910
the age of a giraffe okay let's see if
 

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:52.550
the age of a giraffe okay let's see if
we can get a little bit closer to this

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:52.560
we can get a little bit closer to this
 

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.540
we can get a little bit closer to this
one at the back boom yay and indeed

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:55.550
one at the back boom yay and indeed

Bremen I think is the name you can see

00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500
Bremen I think is the name you can see
 

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.080
Bremen I think is the name you can see
straight away from the genitals this is

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:00.090
straight away from the genitals this is
 

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.970
straight away from the genitals this is
male so the males are much larger

00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:02.980
male so the males are much larger
 

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.180
male so the males are much larger
sighs than the females and indeed those

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:06.190
sighs than the females and indeed those
 

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:08.340
sighs than the females and indeed those
sort of patches that they have on their

sort of patches that they have on their
 

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:12.630
sort of patches that they have on their
skin indeed do get darker with age and

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640
skin indeed do get darker with age and
 

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.000
skin indeed do get darker with age and
their size increases with age and also

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.010
their size increases with age and also
 

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:16.830
their size increases with age and also
of the ossicones on the top of their

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:16.840
of the ossicones on the top of their
 

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.750
of the ossicones on the top of their
head they're not horns they are indeed

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760
head they're not horns they are indeed
 

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.359
head they're not horns they are indeed
ossicones become bolder and bolder and

00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:21.369
ossicones become bolder and bolder and
 

00:58:21.369 --> 00:58:24.000
ossicones become bolder and bolder and
bolder as the male's age so the best

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.010
bolder as the male's age so the best
 

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:25.710
bolder as the male's age so the best
thing to sort of look at is a

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720
thing to sort of look at is a
 

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.970
thing to sort of look at is a
combination of things

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:26.980
combination of things
 

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.030
combination of things
coloration size and of course the

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:30.040
coloration size and of course the
 

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.359
coloration size and of course the
ossicones but other than that it's very

00:58:32.359 --> 00:58:32.369
ossicones but other than that it's very
 

00:58:32.369 --> 00:58:35.250

difficult to eat a giraffe is very very

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:35.260
difficult to eat a giraffe is very very
 

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.380
difficult to eat a giraffe is very very
difficult and when you see a meal and

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:37.390
difficult and when you see a meal and
 

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.420

comes into play as well so it is a
 

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:13.320
comes into play as well so it is a
tricky one but those are the things you

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:13.330
tricky one but those are the things you
 

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:16.349

tricky I remember we were having a

01:00:30.599 --> 01:00:30.609
tricky I remember we were having a
 

01:00:30.609 --> 01:00:32.849
tricky I remember we were having a
discussion quite some time ago about the

01:00:32.849 --> 01:00:32.859
discussion quite some time ago about the
 

01:00:32.859 --> 01:00:35.219

possibility of tansy being pregnant and
 

01:00:35.229 --> 01:00:37.140
possibility of tansy being pregnant and
it is tricky because especially in the

do when they eat a lot of food a proper
food calorie and of course that could

01:00:44.279 --> 01:00:44.289
food calorie and of course that could
 

01:00:44.289 --> 01:00:46.109
food calorie and of course that could
easily be mistaken for being pregnant

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:15.970
we've just moved into this thick stuff
 

01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:22.490
we've just moved into this thick stuff
and we believe it's Tandy I haven't seen

01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:22.500
and we believe it's Tandy I haven't seen
 

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.230
and we believe it's Tandy I haven't seen
definite that I believe it's Tandy I'm

on the move yeah and it's surprising how

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:28.090
on the move yeah and it's surprising how
 

01:18:28.090 --> 01:18:31.650
on the move yeah and it's surprising how
she's moving in this heat so we're gonna

01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:31.660
she's moving in this heat so we're gonna
 

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.610
she's moving in this heat so we're gonna
try and skirt around maybe and get a

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:35.620
try and skirt around maybe and get a
 

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:41.070
try and skirt around maybe and get a
better visual so while we know much are

01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.080
better visual so while we know much are
 

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.680
better visual so while we know much are
there you can just see her through these

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:43.690
there you can just see her through these
 

01:18:43.690 --> 01:18:47.070
there you can just see her through these
branches I wonder if he's not seeing

01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:47.080
branches I wonder if he's not seeing
 

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:52.680
branches I wonder if he's not seeing
something yeah definitely looking and

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:52.690
something yeah definitely looking and
 

01:18:52.690 --> 01:19:02.060
something yeah definitely looking and
listening

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.480
we had a glimpse of her yesterday in a
very thick drainage line but lost away

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:44.490
very thick drainage line but lost away
 

01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:47.810

butterflies it's as if they knew they
 

01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:01.830
butterflies it's as if they knew they
were going live and then they decide or

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840
were going live and then they decide or
 

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.420
were going live and then they decide or

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:03.430
fly away so we're here by this little
 

01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:05.610
fly away so we're here by this little
mud wallow on the side of the road and

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:05.620
mud wallow on the side of the road and
 

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:10.340
mud wallow on the side of the road and
we have these butterflies flapping away

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:10.350
we have these butterflies flapping away
 

01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:13.440

you can see that now I'm not a hundred

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:13.450
you can see that now I'm not a hundred
 

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:16.800
you can see that now I'm not a hundred
percent showing an exact species but I

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:16.810
percent showing an exact species but I
 

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:20.540
percent showing an exact species but I
think that the family that they're in is

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:20.550
think that the family that they're in is
 

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:25.380
think that the family that they're in is
lai san a day I said that correctly I

01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:25.390
lai san a day I said that correctly I
 

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:29.090
lai san a day I said that correctly I
think so it's always tough with them

01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100
think so it's always tough with them
 

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.680
think so it's always tough with them
with insects because they seem to be so

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:31.690
with insects because they seem to be so
 

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:34.320
with insects because they seem to be so
many varieties of them now you can see

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:34.330
many varieties of them now you can see
 

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:35.850
many varieties of them now you can see
that these butterflies are moving their

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:35.860
that these butterflies are moving their
 

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:38.150
that these butterflies are moving their
wings up and down up and down and

01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:38.160
wings up and down up and down and
 

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.440
wings up and down up and down and
they'll often do this to catch the Sun

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:42.450
they'll often do this to catch the Sun
 

01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:45.750
they'll often do this to catch the Sun
this is at large surface area to absorb

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760
this is at large surface area to absorb
 

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.390
this is at large surface area to absorb
the sunlight in and they'll also do this

01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400
the sunlight in and they'll also do this
 

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.910
the sunlight in and they'll also do this
to kind of warm up their wings and you

01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:50.920
to kind of warm up their wings and you
 

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.930
to kind of warm up their wings and you
can see that the proboscis is out one of

01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:54.940
can see that the proboscis is out one of
 

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.820
can see that the proboscis is out one of
them I just saw it there you go you can

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:56.830
them I just saw it there you go you can
 

01:22:56.830 --> 01:23:00.260
them I just saw it there you go you can
see that the proboscis is out and it's

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:00.270
see that the proboscis is out and it's
 

01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:02.520
see that the proboscis is out and it's
searching in amongst those little cracks

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:02.530
searching in amongst those little cracks
 

01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:05.970
searching in amongst those little cracks
for bits of water a really beautiful

01:23:05.970 --> 01:23:05.980
for bits of water a really beautiful
 

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.939
for bits of water a really beautiful

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:15.170
 

01:23:15.170 --> 01:23:18.130
shame poor guy well wouldn't affect his

01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:18.140
shame poor guy well wouldn't affect his
 

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.209

flight too much

01:23:19.209 --> 01:23:19.219
flight too much
 

01:23:19.219 --> 01:23:25.540
flight too much
we hope now these wings I have a whole

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:25.550
we hope now these wings I have a whole
 

01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:28.439
we hope now these wings I have a whole
lot of scales on them and these scales

01:23:28.439 --> 01:23:28.449
lot of scales on them and these scales
 

01:23:28.449 --> 01:23:31.090
lot of scales on them and these scales
sort of come off as dust on your fingers

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:31.100
sort of come off as dust on your fingers
 

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.250
sort of come off as dust on your fingers
you would have seen when you maybe catch

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:33.260
you would have seen when you maybe catch
 

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.709
you would have seen when you maybe catch
a butterfly or a moth that this dust

01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:35.719
a butterfly or a moth that this dust
 

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:39.930
a butterfly or a moth that this dust
sort of comes off onto your fingers and

01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:39.940
sort of comes off onto your fingers and
 

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:43.000
sort of comes off onto your fingers and
those scales provides them with color

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:43.010
those scales provides them with color
 

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:45.430
those scales provides them with color
and reflection and it's also a really

01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440
and reflection and it's also a really
 

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.459
and reflection and it's also a really
neat trick because if they fly into a

01:23:48.459 --> 01:23:48.469
neat trick because if they fly into a
 

01:23:48.469 --> 01:23:52.209
neat trick because if they fly into a

or anything else that's sticky and
uncomfortable they can leave those

01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719
uncomfortable they can leave those
 

01:23:56.719 --> 01:24:02.020
uncomfortable they can leave those
scales behind and escape pretty much

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:02.030
scales behind and escape pretty much
 

01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:11.879
scales behind and escape pretty much
unscathed

01:24:11.879 --> 01:24:11.889

that point out but I suppose it's hard
 

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.410
that point out but I suppose it's hard
to tell when you don't have them up

01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280
this little wallow seems to be quite dry
 

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.629
this little wallow seems to be quite dry
but to them they obviously can pick up

01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639
but to them they obviously can pick up
 

01:25:03.639 --> 01:25:05.550

little miniscule bits of water that's

01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:05.560
little miniscule bits of water that's
 

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:11.670
little miniscule bits of water that's
still trapped in there

01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:11.680
 

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.620
remember that in pans like this that

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:13.630
remember that in pans like this that
 

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.380

have been dried up all the minerals are

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:16.390
have been dried up all the minerals are
 

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:18.900
have been dried up all the minerals are
still logged in there so it could be

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:18.910
still logged in there so it could be
 

01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:20.400
still logged in there so it could be
mineral rich and that's what they're

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:20.410
mineral rich and that's what they're
 

01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:27.680
mineral rich and that's what they're
trying to get out of it as well

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:27.690
 

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:29.390

whereas with moths at rest they'd both

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:38.370
whereas with moths at rest they'd both
 

01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:49.540

01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960
where I'm probably not gonna be able to
 

01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:25.300
where I'm probably not gonna be able to
see okay shall we move forward should we

01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:25.310
see okay shall we move forward should we
 

01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:26.950
see okay shall we move forward should we
try and move forward we've got lions on

01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960
try and move forward we've got lions on
 

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.270
try and move forward we've got lions on
either side don't this may not be

01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:28.280
either side don't this may not be
 

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.400
either side don't this may not be
possible unfortunately we've just not

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:33.410
possible unfortunately we've just not
 

01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:36.730

lion is about seven meters from the car

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:39.290
lion is about seven meters from the car
 

01:41:39.290 --> 01:41:43.600
lion is about seven meters from the car
right now I can't believe that she got

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:43.610
right now I can't believe that she got
 

01:41:43.610 --> 01:41:47.550
right now I can't believe that she got
up and she actually went after a warthog

01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560
 

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.490
she's just gone behind that bush now we

01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:51.500
she's just gone behind that bush now we
 

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.110
she's just gone behind that bush now we
just have to be very careful right now

01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:53.120
just have to be very careful right now
 

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.640
just have to be very careful right now
because there we go she's off right into

01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:57.650
because there we go she's off right into
 

01:41:57.650 --> 01:42:02.950
because there we go she's off right into
the distance there she went on our own

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960
the distance there she went on our own
 

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.920
the distance there she went on our own
little mission alone after that lone

cannot drive into the thick vegetation

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:14.210
cannot drive into the thick vegetation

they are anyway which is fire where she

01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520
they are anyway which is fire where she

they are anyway which is fire where she
has disappeared but my predicament was

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:19.010
has disappeared but my predicament was
 

01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:20.800
has disappeared but my predicament was
if we can just see there's a lioness

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:20.810
if we can just see there's a lioness
 

01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:23.800
if we can just see there's a lioness
here and I do not indeed want to drive

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:23.810
here and I do not indeed want to drive
 

01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:25.930
here and I do not indeed want to drive
and block that lion is his vision and we

01:42:25.930 --> 01:42:25.940
and block that lion is his vision and we
 

01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:28.510
and block that lion is his vision and we
have to right here so for me to drive

01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520
have to right here so for me to drive
 

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.870
have to right here so for me to drive
forward like that wouldn't

01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880
forward like that wouldn't
 

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.390
forward like that wouldn't
be irresponsible as far as I am

01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400
be irresponsible as far as I am
 

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:36.100

concerned so oh we've got a rainbow

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:36.110
concerned so oh we've got a rainbow
 

01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:41.030

nicely spotty Bungay I wonder if we can

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040
nicely spotty Bungay I wonder if we can
 

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.200
nicely spotty Bungay I wonder if we can
capture it for you can you just see the

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:45.210
capture it for you can you just see the
 

01:42:45.210 --> 01:42:48.460
capture it for you can you just see the
star of that rainbow there

01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:48.470
 

01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:51.080
it's really beautiful where we are in

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:51.090
it's really beautiful where we are in
 

01:42:51.090 --> 01:42:54.260
it's really beautiful where we are in
indeed it goes right over the lions I

01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:54.270
indeed it goes right over the lions I
 

01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:59.540
indeed it goes right over the lions I
wonder in the pot of gold is Wow

01:42:59.540 --> 01:42:59.550

incredible

01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000
incredible
 

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.430
incredible
okay so the other lions don't appear to

01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440
okay so the other lions don't appear to
 

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.260
okay so the other lions don't appear to
be moving it just seemed to be one

01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:06.270
be moving it just seemed to be one

lioness who did go off on her own little

01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:09.030
lioness who did go off on her own little
 

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:15.560
lioness who did go off on her own little
mission there now we've got other

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:15.570
mission there now we've got other
 

01:43:15.570 --> 01:43:18.470

vehicles appearing and about four lions

01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480
vehicles appearing and about four lions
 

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.470
vehicles appearing and about four lions
behind us so this situation is indeed

01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480
behind us so this situation is indeed
 

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:29.759
behind us so this situation is indeed
becoming more and more interesting

01:43:29.759 --> 01:43:29.769
 

01:43:29.769 --> 01:43:34.179
bhaktas asking I think about storms

01:43:34.179 --> 01:43:34.189
bhaktas asking I think about storms
 

01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:36.520
bhaktas asking I think about storms
effect and lions behavior I hope I've

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:36.530
effect and lions behavior I hope I've
 

01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:38.589
effect and lions behavior I hope I've
got that right for some reason I'm not

01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599
got that right for some reason I'm not
 

01:43:38.599 --> 01:43:41.649
got that right for some reason I'm not
able to understand you know 100% but I

01:43:41.649 --> 01:43:41.659
able to understand you know 100% but I
 

01:43:41.659 --> 01:43:44.259
able to understand you know 100% but I
hope that was the question and indeed

01:43:44.259 --> 01:43:44.269
hope that was the question and indeed
 

01:43:44.269 --> 01:43:47.350
hope that was the question and indeed
weather will affect the animals because

01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360
weather will affect the animals because
 

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:49.810
weather will affect the animals because
it can actually get predator as an

01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:49.820
it can actually get predator as an

I think advantage sorry I'm just

01:43:52.719 --> 01:43:52.729
I think advantage sorry I'm just
 

01:43:52.729 --> 01:43:53.919
I think advantage sorry I'm just
watching what's going on I'm trying to

01:43:53.919 --> 01:43:53.929
watching what's going on I'm trying to
 

01:43:53.929 --> 01:43:56.350
watching what's going on I'm trying to
multitask er there's a lot going on

01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360
multitask er there's a lot going on
 

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.569
multitask er there's a lot going on
behind me so indeed the Predators can

01:43:58.569 --> 01:43:58.579
behind me so indeed the Predators can
 

01:43:58.579 --> 01:44:01.509
behind me so indeed the Predators can
make use of the fact that it's windy oh

01:44:01.509 --> 01:44:01.519
make use of the fact that it's windy oh
 

01:44:01.519 --> 01:44:03.810
make use of the fact that it's windy oh
here she comes

01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:03.820
here she comes
 

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:07.000
here she comes
look at her coming back okay Shay she

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:07.010
look at her coming back okay Shay she
 

01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:08.859
look at her coming back okay Shay she
obviously wasn't successful something

01:44:08.859 --> 01:44:08.869
obviously wasn't successful something
 

01:44:08.869 --> 01:44:11.379
obviously wasn't successful something
piqued her interest but it obviously was

01:44:11.379 --> 01:44:11.389
piqued her interest but it obviously was
 

01:44:11.389 --> 01:44:13.390
piqued her interest but it obviously was
not a successful attempt she's making

01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:13.400
not a successful attempt she's making
 

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.370
not a successful attempt she's making
her way back towards us and the rest of

01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:15.380
her way back towards us and the rest of
 

01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.429
her way back towards us and the rest of
the prime so yes predators can actually

01:44:18.429 --> 01:44:18.439
the prime so yes predators can actually
 

01:44:18.439 --> 01:44:20.229
the prime so yes predators can actually
use it to their advantage because I've

01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239
use it to their advantage because I've
 

01:44:20.239 --> 01:44:21.189
use it to their advantage because I've
actually been talking about

01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199
actually been talking about
 

01:44:21.199 --> 01:44:23.319
actually been talking about
communication have an a so it goes back

01:44:23.319 --> 01:44:23.329
communication have an a so it goes back
 

01:44:23.329 --> 01:44:26.140
communication have an a so it goes back
to that when it's really really windy of

to that when it's really really windy of
 

01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:29.350
to that when it's really really windy of
course prey species especially antelopes

01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360
course prey species especially antelopes
 

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.390
course prey species especially antelopes
will not be able to rely on their

01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400
will not be able to rely on their
 

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.969
will not be able to rely on their

01:44:33.969 --> 01:44:33.979
hearing it will also be dark and most of
 

01:44:33.979 --> 01:44:37.109

the prey that Lions go after is indeed

01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119
the prey that Lions go after is indeed
 

01:44:37.119 --> 01:44:39.429
the prey that Lions go after is indeed
diurnal animals that rely heavily on

01:44:39.429 --> 01:44:39.439
diurnal animals that rely heavily on

visual communication jerseys when it
 

01:44:42.079 --> 01:44:44.620
visual communication jerseys when it
becomes dark of course they cannot see

01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:44.630
becomes dark of course they cannot see

these Lions have got the advantage of

01:44:46.959 --> 01:44:46.969
these Lions have got the advantage of
 

01:44:46.969 --> 01:44:50.169
these Lions have got the advantage of
having special eyes and special retina

01:44:50.169 --> 01:44:50.179
having special eyes and special retina

species would not have so if we were

01:44:56.169 --> 01:44:56.179
species would not have so if we were
 

01:44:56.179 --> 01:44:58.089
species would not have so if we were
talking about lions they would indeed

01:44:58.089 --> 01:44:58.099
talking about lions they would indeed
 

01:44:58.099 --> 01:45:00.189
talking about lions they would indeed
you'd use the way they're to their

01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199
you'd use the way they're to their
 

01:45:00.199 --> 01:45:02.890
you'd use the way they're to their
advantage because pre could potentially

01:45:02.890 --> 01:45:02.900
advantage because pre could potentially
 

01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:05.890
advantage because pre could potentially
not hear them not see them and not catch

01:45:05.890 --> 01:45:05.900
not hear them not see them and not catch

not hear them not see them and not catch
their saints what are you doin girl I am

their saints what are you doin girl I am

their saints what are you doin girl I am
not 100% sure what indeed this lioness

01:45:17.949 --> 01:45:17.959
not 100% sure what indeed this lioness
 

01:45:17.959 --> 01:45:20.080
not 100% sure what indeed this lioness
is up to but she's got bundles of energy

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:20.090
is up to but she's got bundles of energy
 

01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:21.939
is up to but she's got bundles of energy
there's another lioness coming out of

01:45:21.939 --> 01:45:21.949
there's another lioness coming out of
 

01:45:21.949 --> 01:45:25.659
there's another lioness coming out of
the be she's here as well and indeed the

01:45:25.659 --> 01:45:25.669
the be she's here as well and indeed the
 

01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:27.790
the be she's here as well and indeed the
rain is starting to fall not too heavy

01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800
rain is starting to fall not too heavy
 

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:29.830
rain is starting to fall not too heavy
yet I really hope it doesn't get that

01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840
yet I really hope it doesn't get that
 

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:32.229
yet I really hope it doesn't get that
heavy but it is indeed starting to fall

01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239
heavy but it is indeed starting to fall
 

01:45:32.239 --> 01:45:34.659
heavy but it is indeed starting to fall
on us so I do wonder if the Lions are

01:45:34.659 --> 01:45:34.669
on us so I do wonder if the Lions are
 

01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:37.060
on us so I do wonder if the Lions are
going to become more and more active so

01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:37.070
going to become more and more active so
 

01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:38.889
going to become more and more active so
yes storms will affect the animals but

01:45:38.889 --> 01:45:38.899
yes storms will affect the animals but
 

01:45:38.899 --> 01:45:42.160
yes storms will affect the animals but
not necessarily in negative we

point number one
 

01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:43.690
point number one
they fill some sort of ecological niche

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:43.700
they fill some sort of ecological niche
 

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:46.530
they fill some sort of ecological niche
that allows them or needs them to be

that allows them or needs them to be
 

01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:53.680
that allows them or needs them to be
hidden and solitary secondly they are

01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:53.690
hidden and solitary secondly they are
 

01:47:53.690 --> 01:47:56.470
hidden and solitary secondly they are
everywhere in fact I think the only

01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480
everywhere in fact I think the only
 

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:58.420
everywhere in fact I think the only
environment that they can't survive it

01:47:58.420 --> 01:47:58.430
environment that they can't survive it
 

01:47:58.430 --> 01:48:00.760
environment that they can't survive it
is true desert everywhere else they

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:00.770
is true desert everywhere else they
 

01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:05.200
is true desert everywhere else they
pretty much can survive in and also

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:05.210
pretty much can survive in and also
 

01:48:05.210 --> 01:48:07.140
pretty much can survive in and also
being solitary means that you can avoid

01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:07.150
being solitary means that you can avoid
 

01:48:07.150 --> 01:48:12.880
being solitary means that you can avoid
certain sort of suppose liabilities of

01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:15.470
living in a group such as members being
 

01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:20.140
living in a group such as members being
left behind having to look after sick or

01:48:23.049 --> 01:48:23.059
 

01:48:23.059 --> 01:48:27.950
you know injured members

01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:27.960
 

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:29.900
and then also when you're looking for

01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:29.910
and then also when you're looking for
 

01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:31.370
and then also when you're looking for
food you don't have to share it with

01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380
food you don't have to share it with
 

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:33.920
food you don't have to share it with
anybody now that all fits into the first

point of putting a certain leash so this

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:38.310
point of putting a certain leash so this
 

01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:43.130
point of putting a certain leash so this
they've evolved in a way that meant that

01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:43.140
they've evolved in a way that meant that
 

01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:46.910
they've evolved in a way that meant that
they're their choice or their ability to

01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920
they're their choice or their ability to
 

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.850
they're their choice or their ability to
be alone has benefited them whereas with

01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:49.860
be alone has benefited them whereas with
 

01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:52.730
be alone has benefited them whereas with
a lion the ability to be in a in a pride

01:48:52.730 --> 01:48:52.740
a lion the ability to be in a in a pride
 

01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:57.380
a lion the ability to be in a in a pride
or together has benefited them so it's

01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:57.390
or together has benefited them so it's
 

01:48:57.390 --> 01:49:02.380
or together has benefited them so it's
very much about what how they've evolved

01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:02.390
very much about what how they've evolved
 

01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:04.970
very much about what how they've evolved
but I think the most important thing is

01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980
but I think the most important thing is
 

01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:06.700
but I think the most important thing is
the fact that you wouldn't have to share

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:06.710
the fact that you wouldn't have to share
 

01:49:06.710 --> 01:49:11.720
the fact that you wouldn't have to share
your meals with any other members and

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:11.730
your meals with any other members and
 

01:49:11.730 --> 01:49:14.120
your meals with any other members and
not have to be concerned with them but

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:14.130
not have to be concerned with them but
 

01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:18.140
not have to be concerned with them but
that being said Lions that do hunting in

01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:18.150
that being said Lions that do hunting in
 

01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:23.510
that being said Lions that do hunting in
their in their numbers dogs as well wild

01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520
their in their numbers dogs as well wild
 

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.670
their in their numbers dogs as well wild
dogs they make a higher percentage of

01:49:25.670 --> 01:49:25.680
dogs they make a higher percentage of
 

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.350
dogs they make a higher percentage of
kills so they're more likely to actually

01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360
kills so they're more likely to actually
 

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.630
kills so they're more likely to actually
find food but differences they're going

01:49:29.630 --> 01:49:29.640
find food but differences they're going
 

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:33.500
find food but differences they're going
to have to share that food so that's

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:33.510
to have to share that food so that's
 

01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:35.060
to have to share that food so that's
quite a loaded question there's a lot of

01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:35.070
quite a loaded question there's a lot of
 

01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:39.730
quite a loaded question there's a lot of
things to think about why animals

01:49:39.730 --> 01:49:39.740
things to think about why animals
 

01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:45.020
things to think about why animals
develop in a certain way and it does

01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:45.030
develop in a certain way and it does
 

01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:58.620
develop in a certain way and it does
have a lot to do with their evolution

01:49:58.620 --> 01:49:58.630
 

01:49:58.630 --> 01:50:02.490

Joy's asking a question that I know I
 

02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:40.950
Joy's asking a question that I know I
should be able to answer but right now I

keep seeing more coming in and this is
 

02:02:48.730 --> 02:02:51.840
keep seeing more coming in and this is
what is confusing me so right now in

02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:51.850
what is confusing me so right now in
 

02:02:51.850 --> 02:02:57.690

the reflection of light so they get it

02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:57.300
the reflection of light so they get it
 

02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:59.660
the reflection of light so they get it
twice on their retina and it obviously

02:25:59.660 --> 02:25:59.670
twice on their retina and it obviously
 

02:25:59.670 --> 02:26:01.819
twice on their retina and it obviously
helps them sleep much better in the

02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:22.920
frustrating if only we could see exactly
 

02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:25.730
frustrating if only we could see exactly
what was going on in front of us but all

02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:25.740
what was going on in front of us but all
 

02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:27.860

these lions are after something I think

maybe go a little bit further forward

02:27:31.730 --> 02:27:31.740
maybe go a little bit further forward
 

02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:33.950
maybe go a little bit further forward
and indeed I think the Lions will come

02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:33.960
and indeed I think the Lions will come
 

02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:36.350
and indeed I think the Lions will come
back with something but let me just go a

02:27:36.350 --> 02:27:36.360
back with something but let me just go a
 

02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:38.719
back with something but let me just go a
little bit further forward although it

02:27:38.719 --> 02:27:38.729
little bit further forward although it
 

02:27:38.729 --> 02:27:42.921
little bit further forward although it
doesn't seek us any closer I'm afraid

02:27:42.921 --> 02:27:42.931
 

02:27:42.931 --> 02:27:44.841
but possibly we can get a better view

02:27:44.841 --> 02:27:44.851
but possibly we can get a better view
 

02:27:44.851 --> 02:27:47.211
but possibly we can get a better view
this way of what these liens are and

02:27:47.211 --> 02:27:47.221
this way of what these liens are and

02:27:58.690 --> 02:27:58.700
 

02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:01.510
but I think they chased the Warthog or

02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520
but I think they chased the Warthog or
 

02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:04.280
but I think they chased the Warthog or
at least one of them

02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:04.290
at least one of them
 

02:28:04.290 --> 02:28:07.040

on a mission of some sort we just have
 

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:53.410
on a mission of some sort we just have
no idea what that is so while we try and

02:29:53.410 --> 02:29:53.420
no idea what that is so while we try and
 

02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:55.120
no idea what that is so while we try and
figure all of this out let's send you

02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:55.130
figure all of this out let's send you
 

02:29:55.130 --> 02:30:10.901
figure all of this out let's send you
back down to Miss Tandy herself

02:30:10.901 --> 02:30:10.911
 

02:30:10.911 --> 02:30:14.201
we've stuck with her and followed her

02:30:14.201 --> 02:30:14.211
we've stuck with her and followed her
 

02:30:14.211 --> 02:30:18.311
we've stuck with her and followed her
back towards a drainage line and luckily

02:30:18.311 --> 02:30:18.321
back towards a drainage line and luckily
 

02:30:18.321 --> 02:30:24.091
back towards a drainage line and luckily
for us she took up into this marula tree

02:30:24.091 --> 02:30:24.101
for us she took up into this marula tree
 

02:30:24.101 --> 02:30:26.921
for us she took up into this marula tree
seems to be resting in this marula now

seems to be resting in this marula now
 

02:30:26.931 --> 02:30:31.331
seems to be resting in this marula now
and so it's gonna be worth sticking with

02:30:31.331 --> 02:30:31.341
and so it's gonna be worth sticking with
 

02:30:31.341 --> 02:30:34.271
and so it's gonna be worth sticking with
her she's definitely got up here to see

time that they had found a dinosaur egg
with an embryo still inside it and I

02:42:57.570 --> 02:42:57.580
with an embryo still inside it and I
 

02:42:57.580 --> 02:42:59.160
with an embryo still inside it and I
think that's really cool so on this day

02:42:59.160 --> 02:42:59.170
think that's really cool so on this day
 

02:42:59.170 --> 02:43:01.920
think that's really cool so on this day
it was published in science so that's a

02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:01.930
it was published in science so that's a
 

02:43:01.930 --> 02:43:08.300
it was published in science so that's a
journal on the 31st of March in 1989 and

02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:08.310
journal on the 31st of March in 1989 and
 

02:43:08.310 --> 02:43:12.780
journal on the 31st of March in 1989 and
that's sort of egg that a reptile would

02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:12.790
that's sort of egg that a reptile would
 

02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:17.970
that's sort of egg that a reptile would
produce well they called amniotes which

02:43:17.970 --> 02:43:17.980
produce well they called amniotes which
 

02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:20.070
produce well they called amniotes which
is basically basically most of us it's

02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080
is basically basically most of us it's
 

02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:23.580
is basically basically most of us it's
mammals reptiles and birds produced a

02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:23.590
mammals reptiles and birds produced a
 

02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:26.550
mammals reptiles and birds produced a
kind of egg with separate little bits

02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:26.560
kind of egg with separate little bits
 

02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:29.160
kind of egg with separate little bits
and it has different parts to it you

02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:29.170
and it has different parts to it you
 

02:43:29.170 --> 02:43:30.820
and it has different parts to it you
have the

02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:30.830
have the
 

02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:36.020
have the
amnion which is the actual liquid that

02:43:36.020 --> 02:43:36.030
amnion which is the actual liquid that
 

02:43:36.030 --> 02:43:38.030
amnion which is the actual liquid that
the fetus sits in and that's an

02:43:38.030 --> 02:43:38.040
the fetus sits in and that's an
 

02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:40.220
the fetus sits in and that's an
adaptation from being in the sea for a

02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:40.230
adaptation from being in the sea for a
 

02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:43.760
adaptation from being in the sea for a
long time or things having evolved from

02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:43.770
long time or things having evolved from
 

02:43:43.770 --> 02:43:45.980
long time or things having evolved from
creatures in the sea because it was so

02:43:45.980 --> 02:43:45.990
creatures in the sea because it was so
 

02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:47.570
creatures in the sea because it was so
important that that fetus wouldn't dry

02:43:47.570 --> 02:43:47.580
important that that fetus wouldn't dry
 

02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:50.570
important that that fetus wouldn't dry
out so then that adaptation became quite

02:43:50.570 --> 02:43:50.580
out so then that adaptation became quite
 

02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:53.780
out so then that adaptation became quite
important to have that body of water in

02:43:53.780 --> 02:43:53.790
important to have that body of water in
 

02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:57.290
important to have that body of water in
you now science the amnion and then you

02:43:57.290 --> 02:43:57.300
you now science the amnion and then you
 

02:43:57.300 --> 02:44:01.910
you now science the amnion and then you
also have the chorion which it's the

02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:01.920
also have the chorion which it's the
 

02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:04.360
also have the chorion which it's the
part of the egg where gas exchange

02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:04.370
part of the egg where gas exchange
 

02:44:04.370 --> 02:44:06.710
part of the egg where gas exchange
happens and that's a really cool part in

02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720
happens and that's a really cool part in
 

02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:10.430
happens and that's a really cool part in
a hyena because in a hyena that is very

02:44:10.430 --> 02:44:10.440
a hyena because in a hyena that is very
 

02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:13.070
a hyena because in a hyena that is very
similar to our own and that's part of

02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080
similar to our own and that's part of
 

02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:16.340
similar to our own and that's part of
the placenta that does gas exchanging in

02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:16.350
the placenta that does gas exchanging in
 

02:44:16.350 --> 02:44:18.980
the placenta that does gas exchanging in
the hyena it's very very similar to our

02:44:18.980 --> 02:44:18.990
the hyena it's very very similar to our
 

02:44:18.990 --> 02:44:20.710
the hyena it's very very similar to our
own and sometimes I wonder if that

02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:20.720
own and sometimes I wonder if that
 

02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:23.660
own and sometimes I wonder if that
there's sort of robustness when they're

02:44:23.660 --> 02:44:23.670
there's sort of robustness when they're
 

02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:28.040
there's sort of robustness when they're
born is a result of having that really

02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:28.050
born is a result of having that really
 

02:44:28.050 --> 02:44:30.710
born is a result of having that really
thin layer so lots of gas can be

02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720
thin layer so lots of gas can be
 

02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:34.010
thin layer so lots of gas can be
exchanged between the momma and the

02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:34.020
exchanged between the momma and the
 

02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:43.190
exchanged between the momma and the
fetus there's also the land toys said in

02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200
fetus there's also the land toys said in
 

02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:44.840
fetus there's also the land toys said in
a strange way I might have said it

02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:44.850
a strange way I might have said it
 

02:44:44.850 --> 02:44:46.730
a strange way I might have said it
incorrectly but in shorts in Atlantis

02:44:46.730 --> 02:44:46.740
incorrectly but in shorts in Atlantis
 

02:44:46.740 --> 02:44:49.780
incorrectly but in shorts in Atlantis
and that is the part of the egg where

02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:49.790
and that is the part of the egg where
 

02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:57.260
and that is the part of the egg where
waste gets taken away or stored and with

02:44:57.260 --> 02:44:57.270
waste gets taken away or stored and with
 

02:44:57.270 --> 02:44:58.760
waste gets taken away or stored and with
reptile that's usually stored in the

02:44:58.760 --> 02:44:58.770
reptile that's usually stored in the
 

02:44:58.770 --> 02:45:02.270
reptile that's usually stored in the
form of uric acid and that's because if

02:45:02.270 --> 02:45:02.280
form of uric acid and that's because if
 

02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:05.570
form of uric acid and that's because if
it's stored as urine like it is within

02:45:05.570 --> 02:45:05.580
it's stored as urine like it is within
 

02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:08.570
it's stored as urine like it is within
us then they're wasting water that they

02:45:08.570 --> 02:45:08.580
us then they're wasting water that they
 

02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:10.010
us then they're wasting water that they
could have used in other ways so they

02:45:10.010 --> 02:45:10.020
could have used in other ways so they
 

02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:12.220
could have used in other ways so they
actually store it as little crystals of

02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:12.230
actually store it as little crystals of
 

02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:16.340
actually store it as little crystals of
uric acid which I find really cool and

02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:16.350
uric acid which I find really cool and
 

02:45:16.350 --> 02:45:17.780
uric acid which I find really cool and
then of course you have the yolk sac and

02:45:17.780 --> 02:45:17.790
then of course you have the yolk sac and
 

02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:21.560
then of course you have the yolk sac and
the yolk sac is where the fetus is

02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:21.570
the yolk sac is where the fetus is
 

02:45:21.570 --> 02:45:23.990
the yolk sac is where the fetus is
getting all of its nutrients from so

02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.000
getting all of its nutrients from so
 

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.150
getting all of its nutrients from so
there you go dinosaur egg 150 million

02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160
there you go dinosaur egg 150 million
 

02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:27.740
there you go dinosaur egg 150 million
years ago and now you know all the parts

02:45:27.740 --> 02:45:27.750
years ago and now you know all the parts
 

02:45:27.750 --> 02:45:31.010
years ago and now you know all the parts
of the egg - I think it's quite cool

02:45:31.010 --> 02:45:31.020
of the egg - I think it's quite cool
 

02:45:31.020 --> 02:45:33.740
of the egg - I think it's quite cool
it's amazing how we find these things

02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:33.750
it's amazing how we find these things
 

02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:36.740
it's amazing how we find these things
and kind of puts you in your place it

02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:36.750
and kind of puts you in your place it
 

02:45:36.750 --> 02:45:39.830
and kind of puts you in your place it
makes you remember the fact that it's

02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:39.840
makes you remember the fact that it's
 

02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:40.930
makes you remember the fact that it's
not just us

02:45:40.930 --> 02:45:40.940
not just us
 

02:45:40.940 --> 02:45:44.170
not just us
on the planet and it hasn't been just us

02:45:44.170 --> 02:45:44.180
on the planet and it hasn't been just us
 

02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:46.020
on the planet and it hasn't been just us
that have been dominant on the planet

02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:46.030
that have been dominant on the planet
 

02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:48.341
that have been dominant on the planet
there's there was a time where we

02:45:48.341 --> 02:45:48.351
there's there was a time where we
 

02:45:48.351 --> 02:45:49.780
there's there was a time where we
weren't sharing everything was working

02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:49.790
weren't sharing everything was working
 

02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:52.780
weren't sharing everything was working
perfectly well it's always nice to

02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:52.790
perfectly well it's always nice to
 

02:45:52.790 --> 02:45:59.250
perfectly well it's always nice to
remember that

02:45:59.250 --> 02:45:59.260
 

02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:03.551
well it seems like for the little but

02:46:03.551 --> 02:46:03.561
well it seems like for the little but
 

02:46:03.561 --> 02:46:05.350
well it seems like for the little but
more off the show we have left I'm gonna

02:46:05.350 --> 02:46:05.360
more off the show we have left I'm gonna
 

02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:07.180
more off the show we have left I'm gonna
try the hyena den one more time because

02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:07.190
try the hyena den one more time because
 

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:10.570
try the hyena den one more time because
I did find the other vehicle has left so

02:46:10.570 --> 02:46:10.580
I did find the other vehicle has left so
 

02:46:10.580 --> 02:46:12.131
I did find the other vehicle has left so
now we can go back and join it hopefully

02:46:12.131 --> 02:46:12.141
now we can go back and join it hopefully
 

02:46:12.141 --> 02:46:14.110
now we can go back and join it hopefully
they won't be so sleepy so in the

02:46:14.110 --> 02:46:14.120
they won't be so sleepy so in the
 

02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:16.660
they won't be so sleepy so in the
meantime while I make my way there let

02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:16.670
meantime while I make my way there let
 

02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:19.270
meantime while I make my way there let
us send you over to Jimmy and see what

02:46:19.270 --> 02:46:19.280
us send you over to Jimmy and see what
 

02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:25.900
us send you over to Jimmy and see what
Tandy is up to well folks not much has

02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:25.910
Tandy is up to well folks not much has
 

02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:29.381
Tandy is up to well folks not much has
changed what has changed if we switched

02:46:29.381 --> 02:46:29.391
changed what has changed if we switched
 

02:46:29.391 --> 02:46:33.310
changed what has changed if we switched
from daylight to a very special camera

02:46:33.310 --> 02:46:33.320
from daylight to a very special camera
 

02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:36.700
from daylight to a very special camera
called an infrared camera and as you can

02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:36.710
called an infrared camera and as you can
 

02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:42.190
called an infrared camera and as you can
see it's got gray tones and it's a

02:46:42.190 --> 02:46:42.200
see it's got gray tones and it's a
 

02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:44.860
see it's got gray tones and it's a
little bit more grainy but it gives us

02:46:44.860 --> 02:46:44.870
little bit more grainy but it gives us
 

02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:47.761
little bit more grainy but it gives us
the advantage of viewing these animals

02:46:47.761 --> 02:46:47.771
the advantage of viewing these animals
 

02:46:47.771 --> 02:46:52.570
the advantage of viewing these animals
in darker conditions without affecting

02:46:52.570 --> 02:46:52.580
in darker conditions without affecting
 

02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:54.910
in darker conditions without affecting
them with bright lights on them so it's

02:46:54.910 --> 02:46:54.920
them with bright lights on them so it's
 

02:46:54.920 --> 02:47:01.180
them with bright lights on them so it's
a quite a artistic effect and it really

02:47:01.180 --> 02:47:01.190
a quite a artistic effect and it really
 

02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:03.790
a quite a artistic effect and it really
does give us an advantage of doing these

02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800
does give us an advantage of doing these
 

02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:05.500
does give us an advantage of doing these
nocturnal and while these animals that

02:47:05.500 --> 02:47:05.510
nocturnal and while these animals that
 

02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:11.020
nocturnal and while these animals that
are active at night and it's it's really

02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:11.030
are active at night and it's it's really
 

02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:14.440
are active at night and it's it's really
a special camera and helps in enormous

02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:14.450
a special camera and helps in enormous
 

02:47:14.450 --> 02:47:16.990
a special camera and helps in enormous
li in these conditions without it you

02:47:16.990 --> 02:47:17.000
li in these conditions without it you
 

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.980
li in these conditions without it you
wouldn't see it at all without shining

02:47:20.980 --> 02:47:20.990
wouldn't see it at all without shining
 

02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:24.131
wouldn't see it at all without shining
lights on here so it's fantastic

02:47:24.131 --> 02:47:24.141
lights on here so it's fantastic
 

02:47:24.141 --> 02:47:28.990
lights on here so it's fantastic
advantage for us and you can see the the

02:47:28.990 --> 02:47:29.000
advantage for us and you can see the the
 

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.690
advantage for us and you can see the the
tones now that Sabres pulled back you

02:47:31.690 --> 02:47:31.700
tones now that Sabres pulled back you
 

02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:35.850
tones now that Sabres pulled back you
can see how the sky's got this beautiful

02:47:35.850 --> 02:47:35.860
can see how the sky's got this beautiful
 

02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:41.350
can see how the sky's got this beautiful
pale blue gray effect and the the greys

02:47:41.350 --> 02:47:41.360
pale blue gray effect and the the greys
 

02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:44.051

female leopard in a rocky outcrop den
 

02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:44.511

entrance to her being a rocky outcrop

02:48:46.881 --> 02:48:46.891

the cub was just visual behind her to
the side of her and I would say that was

02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080
the side of her and I would say that was
 

02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:59.091

think she's gonna do too much we might

02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:10.130
think she's gonna do too much we might
 

02:50:10.130 --> 02:50:13.900
think she's gonna do too much we might
leave her shortly and let her slumber on

02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:13.910
leave her shortly and let her slumber on
 

02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:18.301
leave her shortly and let her slumber on
and see if we can follow up on her

02:50:18.301 --> 02:50:18.311
and see if we can follow up on her
 

02:50:18.311 --> 02:50:21.551
and see if we can follow up on her
tomorrow or if someone can follow up on

02:50:21.551 --> 02:50:21.561
tomorrow or if someone can follow up on
 

02:50:21.561 --> 02:50:24.400
tomorrow or if someone can follow up on
her tomorrow and see whether she's had

02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:24.410
her tomorrow and see whether she's had
 

02:50:24.410 --> 02:50:28.320
her tomorrow and see whether she's had
any success in the in the night and I

02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:28.330
any success in the in the night and I
 

02:50:28.330 --> 02:50:34.360
any success in the in the night and I
think she certainly was looking for

02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:34.370
think she certainly was looking for
 

02:50:34.370 --> 02:50:36.190
think she certainly was looking for
something earlier so I would imagine she

02:50:36.190 --> 02:50:36.200
something earlier so I would imagine she
 

02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:39.551
something earlier so I would imagine she
might hunt on into the night oh bit of a

02:50:39.551 --> 02:50:39.561
might hunt on into the night oh bit of a
 

02:50:39.561 --> 02:50:45.671
might hunt on into the night oh bit of a
movement this could be bit and if she

02:50:45.671 --> 02:50:45.681
movement this could be bit and if she
 

02:50:45.681 --> 02:50:47.650
movement this could be bit and if she

it coming down the tree there we got
 

02:50:51.431 --> 02:51:06.911
it coming down the tree there we got
have a bit of a stretch there maybe not

02:51:06.911 --> 02:51:06.921
 

02:51:06.921 --> 02:51:09.099
yeah

yeah
 

02:51:09.109 --> 02:51:11.530
yeah
down the hopefully down the right slip

02:51:11.530 --> 02:51:11.540
down the hopefully down the right slip
 

02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:15.040
down the hopefully down the right slip
of the tree not come on some of the side

02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:15.050
of the tree not come on some of the side
 

02:51:15.050 --> 02:51:28.650
of the tree not come on some of the side
go yeah

02:51:28.650 --> 02:51:28.660
 

02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:30.480
mocking she just marked against the

02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:30.490
mocking she just marked against the
 

02:51:30.490 --> 02:51:33.000
mocking she just marked against the
triode and if you saw that she had a

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:33.010
triode and if you saw that she had a
 

02:51:33.010 --> 02:51:34.680
triode and if you saw that she had a
tail that up and she actually marked

02:51:34.680 --> 02:51:34.690
tail that up and she actually marked
 

02:51:34.690 --> 02:51:37.761
tail that up and she actually marked
against that tree before she moved off

02:51:37.761 --> 02:51:37.771
against that tree before she moved off
 

02:51:37.771 --> 02:51:47.930
against that tree before she moved off
so she disappears into that tall grass
