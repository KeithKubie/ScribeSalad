using coal natural gas or petroleum but

using coal natural gas or petroleum but
 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.460

even that set aside it's still a problem

even that set aside it's still a problem
 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.250
even that set aside it's still a problem
of cost so there's really no alternative

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260
of cost so there's really no alternative
 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.750
of cost so there's really no alternative
in the near term but to subsidize these

in the near term but to subsidize these
 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.150
in the near term but to subsidize these
these newer fuels so that we can

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160
these newer fuels so that we can
 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.639
these newer fuels so that we can
eventually get the cost down with

eventually get the cost down with
 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.650
eventually get the cost down with
greater dissemination of them and have

concentrated solar power stations which

are already in a handful of locations
around the world but the significance of

around the world but the significance of
 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.510
around the world but the significance of
these plants is that they can be used

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520
these plants is that they can be used
 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.210
these plants is that they can be used
for baseload electricity and peaking as

when the Sun isn't there so these types

when the Sun isn't there so these types
 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.570

around the world actually has made many
more advances than solar has in terms of

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330
 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.860

certain regulatory jurisdictions for

example in the United States will argue
 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.530
example in the United States will argue
that their responsibilities as

that their responsibilities as

consumers for which they're responsible
for overseeing the rates and they will

for overseeing the rates and they will
 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.550
for overseeing the rates and they will
argue that while it may have social

argue that while it may have social

benefits that wind and solar very likely

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
benefits that wind and solar very likely
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.090
benefits that wind and solar very likely
may raise rates in the near term and so

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100
may raise rates in the near term and so
 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.950
may raise rates in the near term and so
you get some regulators that simply

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960
you get some regulators that simply
 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.620
you get some regulators that simply
aren't as vigorous and championing these

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630
aren't as vigorous and championing these
 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.230
aren't as vigorous and championing these

newer resources as they might be if they
didn't see their mandate is different

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010
didn't see their mandate is different
 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.640
didn't see their mandate is different
from a mandate to get as much renewable

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
from a mandate to get as much renewable
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.570
from a mandate to get as much renewable
into the system as possible
