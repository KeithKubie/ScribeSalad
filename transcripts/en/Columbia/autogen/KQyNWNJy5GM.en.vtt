kind of the first goal you're working on
but when I approach a food problem I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
but when I approach a food problem I
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280
but when I approach a food problem I
approach it almost in exactly the same

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
approach it almost in exactly the same
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410
approach it almost in exactly the same
way that I you know would have

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
way that I you know would have
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.750
way that I you know would have
approached an art and art problem and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
approached an art and art problem and
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.650
approached an art and art problem and
that is take you know first of all start

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
that is take you know first of all start
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.940

hardest thing to do with anything is to
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420
hardest thing to do with anything is to
start whether it's you know figuring out

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
start whether it's you know figuring out
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.920

what I was gonna build when I was doing

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
what I was gonna build when I was doing
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.950

sculpture performance or you know what

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
sculpture performance or you know what
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.029
sculpture performance or you know what
am I going to put on a plate well you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
am I going to put on a plate well you

know once you start right then the idea

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
know once you start right then the idea
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.160
know once you start right then the idea
is to always be critical about the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
is to always be critical about the
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630
is to always be critical about the
decisions you're making always be a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
decisions you're making always be a
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.520
decisions you're making always be a
hundred percent critical all of the time

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
hundred percent critical all of the time
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.470
hundred percent critical all of the time
and if you can do that and if you have

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
and if you can do that and if you have
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.289
and if you can do that and if you have
the focus to be able to you know

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
the focus to be able to you know
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.760
the focus to be able to you know
constantly strive to make yourself

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
constantly strive to make yourself
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380
constantly strive to make yourself
better remember the mistakes you've made

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
better remember the mistakes you've made
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600
better remember the mistakes you've made
in the past then you can start working

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
in the past then you can start working
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.660
in the past then you can start working
towards making a better product or

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670
towards making a better product or
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280
towards making a better product or
making something that satisfies you more

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
making something that satisfies you more
 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620
making something that satisfies you more
I think you know what's interesting

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
I think you know what's interesting
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.980
I think you know what's interesting
about cooking versus making sculpture is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
about cooking versus making sculpture is
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.440
about cooking versus making sculpture is
that to me it satisfies a lot of the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
that to me it satisfies a lot of the
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690
that to me it satisfies a lot of the
same a lot of the same energies the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
same a lot of the same energies the
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060
same a lot of the same energies the
energies the idea is to make something

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
energies the idea is to make something
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.819
energies the idea is to make something
new to make something better to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
new to make something better to
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.679
new to make something better to
constantly be working I think you know

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
constantly be working I think you know
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.770
constantly be working I think you know
that's that's kind of the commonality is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
that's that's kind of the commonality is
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.319
that's that's kind of the commonality is
is to constantly strive to learn to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
is to constantly strive to learn to
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.770
is to constantly strive to learn to
change and and to work constantly and if

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
change and and to work constantly and if
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.719
change and and to work constantly and if
you if you have that when you were doing

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
you if you have that when you were doing
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.460
you if you have that when you were doing
art then you're good because you're

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
art then you're good because you're
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.780
art then you're good because you're
constantly working and changing

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
constantly working and changing
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.730
constantly working and changing
hopefully getting better or making new

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
hopefully getting better or making new
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.020
hopefully getting better or making new
things that make you make you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
things that make you make you
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.300
things that make you make you
continually satisfied on a continuous

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
continually satisfied on a continuous
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.219
continually satisfied on a continuous
basis and the same thing happens when

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
basis and the same thing happens when
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.630
basis and the same thing happens when
you cook at least if you cook the way

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
you cook at least if you cook the way
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.100
you cook at least if you cook the way
that I cook which is to always

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
that I cook which is to always
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.740
that I cook which is to always
investigate new avenues new channels for

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
investigate new avenues new channels for
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.569
investigate new avenues new channels for
you know for for the dining experience

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579
you know for for the dining experience
 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.999
you know for for the dining experience
so that's kind of what motivates me for

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
so that's kind of what motivates me for
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.520
so that's kind of what motivates me for
me it's an it wasn't much of a change to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
me it's an it wasn't much of a change to
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.100
me it's an it wasn't much of a change to
go from sculpture to food

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
go from sculpture to food
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.590
go from sculpture to food
although it can seem kind of like a big

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
although it can seem kind of like a big
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.420
although it can seem kind of like a big
change from the outside

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430
 
 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.489
