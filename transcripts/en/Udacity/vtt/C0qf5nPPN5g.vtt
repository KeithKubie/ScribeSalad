00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.380
The first is hQuery where
the goal is simplicity,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.510
in part by working with a limited data
set that is well standardized because

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.850
of its key role in quality measurement
and other common clinical activities.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.730
As you can see here, hQuery provides
an attractive modern point-and-click

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.750
interface called the hQuery composer

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.040
to the query builder who might even be
a nontechnical health care provider.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.110
At the same time,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.189
the possible queries that can be
formulated are somewhat limited.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.230
HQuery uses a simple patient
information model as shown here

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.430
to facilitate query building
by nontechnical users.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.430
Queries are forwarded to an hQuery
gateway located at each source system

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.090
which receives them in a standard format
and forwards them to an adapter which

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.510
knows how to translate the query for
the source system, which might, for

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.490
example, provide a CCDA
document in response and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.830
can convert it into the standard
data model for transmission back.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.060
You should watch a video to learn more.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.000
The URL is in the instructor's notes.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.270
HQuery presents its results
in an attractive way

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770
that in this example includes
a frequency distribution,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.590
a distribution over time, and a
geographic distribution of the results.
