[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.660
MALE SPEAKER 1: Shanghai GDG
is a very interesting

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.760
developer community.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.480
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.700
has asked this question--

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.915
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:30.220
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.760
answer show.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.115
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions--

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.010
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.110
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.200
Welcome to YouTube
Developers Live.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.720
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.160
We'll talk about gaming.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.520
But first, let me introduce
our guests.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.900
My co-host in the studio
here is Jeremy Walker.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.050
JEREMY WALKER: Hello,
everyone.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How are
you doing, Jeremy?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.410
JEREMY WALKER: Pretty
good, pretty good.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Have
a good weekend?

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.930
JEREMY WALKER: I did.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.910
I got some sleep.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Have you
played a bunch of games?

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.990
JEREMY WALKER: I have.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.440
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
we'll talk about that.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.100
On my left, Cliff Samaniego.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.700
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Hello.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hi, Cliff.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.470
CLIFF SAMANIEGO:
How's it going?

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.480
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Going good.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.050
How is your gaming going?

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.860
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Gaming
is going well.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, cool.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.900
We have Kenji Arai.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.540
Kenji is a world-famous
mobile gamer.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.865
KENJI ARAI: What.

00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:14.465
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: He
beats every record.

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:16.980
KENJI ARAI: I try, but fail
miserably, usually.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.519
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And they'll
talk about YouTube gaming.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.200
They're both from our gaming
business development

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.930
organization.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.992
And on the Hangout, we
have Jeffrey Posnick.

00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.270
JEFFREY POSNICK:
Hey, everybody.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.164
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How's life
in New York, Jeff?

00:04:30.164 --> 00:04:31.470
JEFFREY POSNICK: It's
doing pretty well.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.090
You can see the lovely, lush
background over here.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.804
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Still
summertime in New York?

00:04:36.804 --> 00:04:39.060
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah, yes,
which is not always pleasant,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.020
but it's been pretty
good right now.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.840
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.390
So let's go to it.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.640
One word of warning--

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.540
since Cliff and Kenji work in
business development, they

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.680
refused to come without
the deck.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.490
So they need a presentation
in order to

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.150
structure their thoughts.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.910
And I think this is just a sign
of their professionalism.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.690
So what we'll do is it will
be more of a webinar slash

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.980
discussion-style presentation
today.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.430
And really, the reason why we
wanted to talk to you about

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.000
game integration is
because gaming is

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.500
really big on YouTube.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.510
But there's still challenges
from a technical standpoint

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.160
with respect to integration
between your game and our

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.630
YouTube APIs.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.740
And then also, not everyone
knows about all the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.700
opportunities that exist for
game developers when it comes

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.030
to really taking advantage
of our platform--

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.310
such as monetization,
additional

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.660
analytics, and so forth.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.370
So this is what Cliff and
Kenji will cover.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.740
And then we'll also show you a
bunch of cool gameplay videos,

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.310
because obviously, we can't
have a show without seeing

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.530
some YouTube videos.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.300
And later on, Jeff will
cover a couple of

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.750
important blog posts.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.580
I know all the people watching
today have read our blog posts

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.320
because they are read in
real time as we post

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.020
them, right, Jeremy?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.510
JEREMY WALKER: Exactly.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.920
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I know
Jeremy does that.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.200
But just in case, we're
going to have Jeff

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.840
cover that for you.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.010
So how does the agenda sound?

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.100
JEREMY WALKER: Sounds
pretty good to me.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sounds
all right?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.150
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Kick
it off, Jarek.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.860
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Let's get to it.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.260
So let me jump to the
presentation.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.250
And we are sharing it right
here in the Hangout.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.180
We'll make that deck available
for you later on.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.340
And let's just go
through this.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.070
So here is our agenda.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.000
We'll chat about the game
publishers that have

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.230
integrated with YouTube.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.840
I'll give you some examples.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.710
I'll talk about the benefits of
integration, like what you

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.720
actually get out of it.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.420
Cover some best practices,
both pre-launch and

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.650
post-launch.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.730
So Cliff and Kenji have been
working with game publishers

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.430
for quite a while.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.740
So they have amassed a body of
knowledge that we hope to

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.470
share with you today.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.550
And we'll chat about some of the
implementation mechanisms

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.700
for both console games and
mobile games, some best

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.280
practices in this area.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.460
And if you are watching this
live, we have a moderator link

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.930
in the YouTube video
description.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.200
So if you click on that
link, you can submit

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.320
questions to us.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.770
And Jeremy will go through
them one by one and

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.230
answer all of them.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.150
JEREMY WALKER: Yes,
definitely.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.454
We already have a couple, so
we're keeping an eye on that.

00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:17.630
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So,
Cliff, tell us more

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.920
about gaming and YouTube.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.180
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah, so
we've had a number of

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.220
different integrations,
primarily with a lot of game

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.060
publishers.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.730
Most of them are console,
but some of them are PC.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.670
In the last couple years,
we've had a number of

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.590
different game titles.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.920
Some of them include Call of
Duty, for example, both Black

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.080
Ops as well as Modern
Warfare 3.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.460
We've integrated with Team
Fortress 2 as well as Dirt 3,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:53.900
as well as NBA 2K12, Uncharted
3, as well as

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.670
PlayStation at Home.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.020
And all of them have been
very, very different API

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.800
integrations.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:06.430
But gaming is such a visceral
and video-centric thing that

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.650
in order to actually feel the
game, it's a great experience

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.310
for game publishers to integrate
with our APIs and

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.340
then upload them to YouTube.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.463
Kenji, did you have anything
to add to that?

00:08:20.463 --> 00:08:24.970
KENJI ARAI: No, I think users
want to share their

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.940
achievements, want to
share their fails.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.540
It definitely gets a lot
of views on YouTube.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.059
So giving the users the ability
to do so freely--

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.520
you're actually pretty surprised
what you find and

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.010
kind of the creativity
from the users.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.530
So giving them the tools really
does kind of allow them

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.660
to express themselves and a lot
of them play their games.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.750
And that's the way they
participate on YouTube.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.790
So we hope that more publishers
and developers

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.840
integrate with our APIs.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.180
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah,
we wanted to just

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.330
show you some examples.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.460
It's really hard to imagine.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.170
I think the best way to really
picture what we're doing, in

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.220
terms of the API integrations
with the consoles and PC

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.720
games, is to check them out in
terms of the game captures

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.780
that have been uploaded to
YouTube by a lot of users.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.470
So, here's a good example--

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.140
Team Fortress 2.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.720
They actually did a pretty
good integration.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.100
It's coming from a PC title.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.480
And then also, they managed
to do a really good award

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.590
competition.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.910
So they tried to capture some
of the best uploads coming

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.700
from the API, which really
encouraged engagement with a

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.500
lot of the users.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.100
So here's an example
of Team Fortress 2.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.750
And this is the one
that actually, I

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.590
believe, won the award.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.490
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Best overall.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:47.190
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Best overall.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.878
And this one's called
"El Muchacho."

00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:51.340

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That
was pretty cool.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.150
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: And here's
an example from Black Ops.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.740
Did you want to go to that?

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.700
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, so let's
talk a little bit about

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.180
Black Ops and then we'll
show the example.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.320
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: So Black Ops,
so far in terms of our API,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.830
has been the most successful.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:46.480
We integrated this in late
2010, early 2011.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.210
And Activision was really,
really happy with the

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.540
integration.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.950
Just within the span of four
months, we had 4 million

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.240
uploads and 70 million views
of those uploads, so very,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.540
very successful.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.500
I think a lot of users were very
encouraged by seeing a

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.120
lot of their highlights
uploaded to YouTube.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.300
So it really fed into more
people uploading and more

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.100
people watching those
particular videos.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.195
Activision was really, really
happy with the integration.

00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:22.320
They even spoke with us, both at
Google I/O as well as GDC.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.760
So here's an example of
one of the uploads

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.380
coming from Black Ops.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.304
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Did you
do this one, Cliff?

00:11:28.304 --> 00:11:30.088
Or is it user-generated

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:31.064
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: That's
user-generated.

00:11:31.064 --> 00:11:36.920
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.170
KENJI ARAI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.750
Normally, the missile
would hit me.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:53.732
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.732 --> 00:11:58.722
[EXPLOSION]

00:11:58.722 --> 00:11:59.240
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.810
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: So these are
just very, very interesting

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.620
moments that people have
within a game.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.620
And generally, if you don't
integrate with an API and

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.480
upload it to YouTube, it's just
something that you're

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.210
sharing with the people
within the room.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.950
However, when you're able to
upload it through our API and

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.250
up to YouTube, you're able
to share that video.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.390
Because it's captured, it's on
demand, and you can share your

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.650
infamy with others.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.585
KENJI ARAI: Yeah, and I think
publishers and developers can

00:12:27.585 --> 00:12:30.780
really take advantage of
everybody's social graph,

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.770
whether it's putting it on
Google+, Twitter, Facebook.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.820
Users want to share those
moments with their friends.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.490
If I captured me jumping over
a missile, I would certainly

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.240
be bragging about it
with my friends.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.110
Like I said, a missile would
likely hit me, but I would

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.220
probably share that moment
with my friends, too.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.350
But I think publishers and
developers want to be in this

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.870
sort of social environment, and
really taking advantage of

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.510
users kind of doing that leg
work for them and sharing it

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.870
with their close friends, with
the people that kind of follow

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.000
them through whatever their
social mechanisms are, I think

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.740
is really important.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.970
And I think video can be a
really big anchor point for

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.430
publishers to take advantage
of through their fans.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.400
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: And before
we kick off this next

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.530
gameplay of Dirt 3--

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.540
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, come on,
Cliff, I want to watch it now.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.120
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Before we watch
this, I mean, imagine

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.690
that you haven't even heard of
Dirt 3, or even knew about the

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.140
game Dirt 3 from Codemasters,
and then watching something

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.590
like this on YouTube.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.940
More often than not, it's going
to speak for itself in

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.740
terms of the graphics and
the gameplay and the

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.270
mechanics of the game.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.300
So this is a really good
marketing and promotional

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.570
tool, as Kenji said, for a lot
of the game publishers.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.160
So let's watch the--

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Can we
see it now, Cliff?

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:43.220
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Sure.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thank you.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.670
KENJI ARAI: Roll it,
roll it, roll it.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:54.035
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:54.035 --> 00:13:55.240
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: All right,
waiting for the

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.366
massive crash here.

00:13:56.366 --> 00:13:58.178
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is this
how you drive, Kenji?

00:13:58.178 --> 00:14:02.067
KENJI ARAI: This is the exact
opposite of how I drive.

00:14:02.067 --> 00:14:03.564
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: This is
how you want to drive.

00:14:03.564 --> 00:14:05.809
KENJI ARAI: This is not how
I want to drive with

00:14:05.809 --> 00:14:07.870
my kid in the car.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh,
now I get it.

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.200
KENJI ARAI: Yeah, I don't
think my daughter would

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.140
appreciate this roll.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.555
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:16.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Ouch.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.860
But you survived, right?

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.710
It was all good.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.730
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: So that's
a great example.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.000
If I never have heard of Dirt
3 and never played the game,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.470
this might be actually an
avenue for me to get

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.870
interested in the game
and playing the game

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.230
and buying the game.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.900
And I think that's a lot of
what we're trying to do in

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.740
terms of helping out game
publishers, is get front and

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.310
center of our huge gaming
audience within YouTube and

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.700
tapping into that audience.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.340
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.942
So what do they get out of it?

00:14:47.942 --> 00:14:50.330
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Kenji, you
want to cover promotion?

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.140
KENJI ARAI: I think we kind of
talked about it in this one,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.120
where I think you allow
the YouTube

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.410
audience, which is what--

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.790
I think, 800 million
plus strong now--

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:06.010
the opportunity to discover
new game titles.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:07.210
Google is the number
one search engine.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.530
YouTube is the number
two search engine.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.740
And so people are always
constantly looking for things.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.890
And depending on what type of
metadata you're really using

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.340
to capture those when you're
uploading gameplay footage

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.480
through the API, you can
maximize your discovery

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.280
through the metadata and
things like that.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.490
So you really just kind of
let your users make your

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.260
promotional outlets for you.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.140
And I think that's kind of
the powerful thing to do.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.910
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right,
that's all good.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.524
Now show me the money.

00:15:38.524 --> 00:15:41.480
KENJI ARAI: Show
you the money.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.000
Yeah, we do.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.920
We do have options for game
publishers and developers to

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.640
actually participate in
ad-supported content.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.940
So anything that does come
through your technology, your

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.500
API integration with us, we
actually allow you to claim

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.620
that content and
put ads on it.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.260
And you can create sort of an
incremental revenue stream.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.160
And when you start thinking
about the long tail of content

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.840
and millions and millions of
uploads and all those views

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.070
that kind of compile on top of
it, you start to do the math

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.510
in your head.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.060
Where maybe the resources that
you put into it get paid, paid

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.610
in full, all the way back, even
more so, with some of the

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.150
revenues that you can make.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:29.140
Not to mention the users that
you'll be able to discover and

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.010
potentially engage
with later on.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So say
I'm a game developer.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.300
I build a game.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.860
I want to monetize
that content.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:36.980
What do I do?

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.430
Do I call you, or do I post
online for help, or--

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.040
KENJI ARAI: I think right now
my cell phone number's going

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.080
to come up right here.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Do I need
to sign anything?

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.570
How does the process work?

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.260
Because this is one of the areas
that I think frequently

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.790
developers have a hard
time understanding.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.180
For content owners, we have
YouTube partnership program

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.080
where you go to
youtube.com/partner, sign up,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.820
and get vetted.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.480
So how does the app developer
approach this?

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.150
What's the actual process?

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.170
KENJI ARAI: I think, first
things first, we want to know

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:07.670
who you are.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.990
So I think, Jarek, you can
provide sort of an alias that

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.599
folks can email into to kind of
at least give us a little

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.640
bit of a pipeline of who
potentially are interested in

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.819
such a program like this.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.660
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You guys--
just to interrupt you--

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.895
if you're watching this and you
are a game developer, just

00:17:23.895 --> 00:17:27.190
ping our Google developers
page.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.860
And we'll hook you up
with these guys.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:29.990
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.010
And then keep in mind that if
you're interested in using the

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.550
APIs, you don't necessarily have
to be a partner, right?

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.270
You can use our APIs
regardless.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.640
But if you want to monetize
your content--

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.130
meaning monetize the UGC
uploads that are

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.740
coming from the API--

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.140
then you're going to have
to become a partner.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.560
And there's definitely
agreements that we need to

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.500
sign with you in order to start

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.650
monetizing those uploads.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So how does
it work from a license

00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.730
perspective?

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.270
Some publishers grant users
the license to basically

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.880
upload and monetize
themselves.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.460
Others don't.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.880
Is that something that an
application developer has to

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.510
think up front?

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.290
Or is this something that
the publisher does?

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:16.170
What is the process before they
even sign up with the

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.160
partnership program?

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.210
Are there any gotchas--

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.860
things to consider upfront?

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.240
KENJI ARAI: I think ultimately
what you want to make sure is

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.260
who owns the rights
to the content.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.390
There are definitely game titles
out there where the

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.020
developer has sort of given the
rights to the users to do

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.010
whatever they want with.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.050
Now, obviously, there's
some pros and cons

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.060
that come with that.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.380
But for the most part, what
Cliff and I see is--

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.480
I think there is pretty normal
language within most terms of

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.540
service, terms of use, where the
rights still go with the

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.980
publishers or the developers.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.860
And so unless the publisher or
developer then grants users

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.000
rights, it can be a little bit
of a sticky situation for

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.390
users to monetize
it on their own.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.880
Although there are definitely
a lot of users who monetize

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.920
gameplay footage on YouTube,
thanks to various different

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.910
partnerships that some of our
content creators have with the

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:10.960
publishers and developers.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.940
So I think ultimately, when you
think about your content,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.440
it's not just about the gameplay
and the game footage

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.670
that you guys create within
the game, just in terms of

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:23.560
playing the game.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.360
I think what you want to think
about is when people create

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.900
content, show their gameplay,
who kind of owns it-- and then

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.140
what benefits are you kind of
granting your users, taking

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.120
for yourselves, I guess,
is a thing

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.090
that you want to consider.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.130
And I think-- to add to
what Cliff said--

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.540
it's not just about
monetizing.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:47.000
It is about sort of being able
to gain analytics from all

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.030
that gameplay that gets put
onto YouTube as well.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.770
So that--

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:51.620
yes, showing the money.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.120
It's certainly something that
you may be interested in-- but

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.900
I think really getting closer
to your users is something

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.580
that's even a bigger priority
for a lot of people

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.510
that we work with.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.680
The money is sort of a
secondary, third priority, but

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.650
it's kind of a nice-to-have.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.300
But ultimately, really getting
close to the users and finding

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.170
out like-- there's that one
person who all of a sudden has

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.330
half a million views, a million
views for something

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.130
that they did.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.980
Maybe the game developer, game
publisher, wants to reach out

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:24.530
to that person and form a more
formal relationship with that

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.170
person, so--

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.600
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah, I would
say that analytics are also a

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.660
hugely important piece of the
puzzle for a lot of the game

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.360
publishers.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.170
Monetization is great.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.560
Everybody wants to make
a little bit of money.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.340
However, there's a lot of users
and a lot of videos that

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.960
are on YouTube that you don't
really have insight to.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.240
But if you're uploading and
claiming those videos from the

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.810
API, now you have a lot of
insight in terms of who's

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.000
playing your game, how they're
playing your game, what

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.630
moments they feel are the best
moments within the game.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.670
KENJI ARAI: Absolutely.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.900
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: So it's a
really good feature set for a

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.840
lot of game publishers to
tap into that audience.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.780
KENJI ARAI: Great.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: As a YouTube
partner, are there any

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.050
additional analytics that can be
obtained if you are in the

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.500
partnership program?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.940
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Are
there additional--

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Reports, or
how does it compare with a

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.730
long-tail developer
that just uses

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.230
standard terms of service?

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.320
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: They will
probably receive the same

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.360
analytics that a regular user
who has a channel has.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.370
You're basically going
to get demographics.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.110
You're going to get
video view counts.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.870
You're going to learn where
a lot of those viewers are

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.640
coming from in terms
of geography.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.610
You're going to learn what are
the most popular videos and

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:57.380
see how many view counts
those have had.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.060
KENJI ARAI: I think the one
thing that is different,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.050
though, is when you're actually
making a claim on a

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.190
piece of content, we can
actually give you that

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.080
additional information.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.020
But if you are simply using our
APIs kind of outside of a

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.390
partnership--

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.690
because there isn't a lot of
claiming that's going on,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:19.080
where you're basically tagging
a video saying you own that

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:24.970
IP, it kind of goes off into the
YouTube corpus and kind of

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.550
exists on the platform.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.740
But you won't actually be able
to see the granular data

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.305
that's actually on the screen
right now, on the analytics,

00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:36.152
very business-y slide that
Jarek has put up.

00:22:36.152 --> 00:22:37.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Which
I stole from Cliff.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.300
KENJI ARAI: I see these have the
up-and-to-the-right, the

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.190
graph-- although there is
a dip in the green line.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.570
But I'll try not to worry
about that one.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, so
I think the important

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.570
distinction is that if you are a
partner and a content owner,

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.510
then you can actually have
analytics that span multiple

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:58.490
accounts into which the content
is being uploaded.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.025
Versus if you use the developer
key and you

00:23:02.025 --> 00:23:04.400
associate these uploads
with a developer key.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.290
Yes, you still can get analytics
as far as kind of

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.790
number of uploads, but there's
not as much information about

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.920
the views and demographics.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.310
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah, OK.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.830
I see what you were
getting at.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.200
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Users account.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.420
That was a tricky question.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.090
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: You threw
a curveball at me, Jarek.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.004
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'm just
making sure that you don't

00:23:18.004 --> 00:23:19.830
only play games for
a living, man.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.140
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: You're
supposed to throw up

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.210
volleyballs--

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:23.630
KENJI ARAI: That's why you
invited me to this--

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.850
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: So I
can spike them down.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.410
KENJI ARAI: In the system--

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.670
it's in the screenshot right
here-- this is also the system

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.390
that would give you sort of
access to the top video.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.400
You could filter out by all
the tens of thousands,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.185
hundreds of thousands,
4 million videos.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.670
You can sort it by who's
getting the most views.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.770
And then potentially reaching
out to that user directly on

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.390
YouTube and seeing what they're
all about and seeing

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.310
if they might be able to help
you guys out even further.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.530
Like I said, you guys can
potentially create a more

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.970
formal relationship with
your user community.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.290
But sometimes, it's just hard to
find out who they actually

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.630
are without doing searches
and things of a

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:02.660
manual nature on YouTube.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.950
So this actually really
helps automate that.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, speaking
of community, I think

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.730
this site has a nice example of
what Valve did with their

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.330
user-generated Apple capability,
where they would

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:18.190
grant additional items to
players that reached certain

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.320
milestones on YouTube really
to entice them to upload.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.470
So there's a lot of creative
work being done by kind of

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.510
gamifying the YouTube experience
for the players.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.200
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah, I mean
there's just a lot of ways in

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.500
which game publishers can reach
out to the community

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.680
once you have a lot of
content on YouTube.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.060
The slide was mentioning a
number of different things

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.850
that you could do, such
as curating playlists.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:48.910
Curating playlists-- so you
can have best shots, for

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:53.140
example, if it's Call of
Duty, or best crashes,

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.090
if it was Dirt 3.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.160
So there's a number of different
things that you can

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.660
do with the API and use the
data API to curate and

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.860
automate those playlists.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.980
And then, as Jarek was saying,
you could also reach out to

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.180
your audience by having
participation

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.125
with different contests.

00:25:14.125 --> 00:25:15.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
So Cliff, you--

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.340
sorry to interrupt you, but--

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.830
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You know, you
guys have been doing this

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:18.980
for a while.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.240
So I wanted to make sure
that we cover the

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.400
kind of best practices.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.360
What do you worry about
before you launch?

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.690
What do you do after
you launch?

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.950
Because it's not kind
of one-shot effort.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.970
So should we go through
some of these steps?

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:32.660
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah,
let's dive in.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Your
collective wisdom from the

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.120
past couple of years.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.170
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yep.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.310
So with pre-launch, there's a
number of things that you

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.100
should obviously start
thinking about.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.910
One of them is what is the goal
of having and integrating

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.580
the API into your game.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.850
And Kenji went through some
of these-- it might be

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.310
monetization, for example.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.070
It might be diving
into analytics of

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.410
a lot of your users.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.640
And it might be just developing
engagement with

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.170
your community.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.430
So you need to think about what
your goals are, because

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.680
then we can tailor the APIs
according to those goals.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.740
Another thing to think about--

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.400
and we run into this all the
time with a lot of game

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.090
publishers--

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:20.010
is that you need a technical
lead once you decide that

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.850
you're going to start diving
into the API and integrating

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:24.760
with YouTube.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.110
And the reason being is there's
a lot to do in terms

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.530
of integrating with YouTube.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.420
And so you need a spokesperson
who's going to sort of be the

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.790
quarterback to handle all of the
different steps and think

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.330
about how to integrate
with YouTube.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.810
In terms of other things--

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.610
let me see here.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.110
Another thing is you should
always have an established

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.990
YouTube channel.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:54.160
I think we've run into it--
some game publishers who

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.980
didn't have a YouTube channel.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.930
And it's important to have a
YouTube channel so we know

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:04.670
where we can direct some
of the playbacks.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.340
Or if you're curating playlists,
we can put it in,

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.630
drop it into the channel.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: You were going
to say something, Kenji?

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.620
KENJI ARAI: Yeah.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.230
I was probably coughing, too.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.230
Yeah, I think you want
to establish

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.550
your presence on YouTube.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.290
I think having a channel and
having a place where we can

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.530
put videos is one thing.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.320
But I think it's also
about establishing

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.340
who you are on YouTube.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.510
Because you are going to
be talking to people.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.120
You're going to be interacting
with other users

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.760
and stuff like that.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.170
And so they're going to want
to see what you're up to,

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.950
whether it's your trailers,
sort of

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.550
behind-the-scenes stuff.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.650
Let your videos kind of allow
your users and your fans to

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:41.770
get to know who you are.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.110
And then when you interact
with them, it feels more

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:44.820
authentic, like you're

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.790
actually part of the community.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:49.960
So I don't think we can stress
it enough to just sort of

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.990
establish your identity
and then participate.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.390
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.580
And if you need help in terms of
developing your channel or

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.100
launching your channel,
you can always go to

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.970
youtube.com/playbook.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.720
And you can download
our playbook.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.200
And it is pretty dense in terms
of all the different

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.610
tips and tricks to help
develop your channel.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.112
KENJI ARAI: Yeah, Jarek.

00:28:09.112 --> 00:28:11.840
If you think this deck is dense,
you go ahead and check

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.640
out our playbook.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I have
checked it out.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.800
It's actually very interesting
for content creators.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.640
I think it's pretty awesome.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.370
JEREMY WALKER: And with
the pre-launch--

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:17.710
KENJI ARAI: Which slide
did you make it to?

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.320
JEREMY WALKER: --you still
want them to--

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:19.585
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Two.

00:28:19.585 --> 00:28:20.355
JEREMY WALKER: --reach
out to you guys--

00:28:20.355 --> 00:28:20.770
KENJI ARAI: There's like 100.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.680
JEREMY WALKER: --kind
of talk through?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.360
Have you had many people that
have not reached out to you

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.680
and been successful?

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.350
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Usually what
happens is-- it really depends

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.100
on if they're already a YouTube
partner or not.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.190
If they're a YouTube partner,
we're more or less talking to

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.860
a lot of our game publishers
on a daily basis.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.940
And then they show their
interest in terms of working

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.770
with us with the API
and integrating.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.000
If they're not a partner, more
often than not, it's coming

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.760
through Jarek.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.030
And Jarek's the one who's sort
of passing on a lead to us.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.080
And we'll be able to talk
about the partnership.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.390
And then Jarek and his team is
going to handle sort of the

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:00.660
technical side of the API.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.595
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah, and
we'll definitely help

00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:04.460
you out with that.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.500
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, so
we launched the game.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.130
Now what?

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.470
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: In terms of
post-launch, there's a number

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.910
of things that you
should look into.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.930
First of all, what we're running
into with a lot of our

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:23.310
API integrations is that they've
done all the technical

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.860
work in terms of integrating
with YouTube.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.670
However, they haven't really
gone the step of educating

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.200
their users on how to upload
from the game.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.440
And I think this is
really important.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.140
It could be as easy as creating
a video, where you're

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.660
walking the user through the
different steps to upload

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.535
through your game, and then
posting it onto your channel

00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:47.780
on YouTube.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.730
But some of these game capture
feature sets are really buried

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.500
within the game.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.560
So it's really important to put
it front and center and

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.320
then show people how to actually
upload and the

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.290
different steps to upload
to YouTube.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:04.600
Another thing that we

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.030
recommend is curating playlists.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:11.110
So there is a data API in which
you're going to be able

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.360
to take a number of different
metadata and

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.580
sort by that metadata.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.160
And so one of things that you
can do is just sort by, for

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.340
example, the most viewed or the
most commented and then

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.860
create a playlist
out of those.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.160
So that's just one example.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.160
But curating playlists
is really important.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.290
What you want to do is you want
to bubble up the really

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.230
good content.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.160
And you want to really empower
your users and have them talk

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.870
about your game.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.220
So definitely bubble up the ones
that users already find

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.490
interesting.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.490
Another thing is analyze
your data.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.020
We talked a little bit
about one of the

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.030
features of the APIs.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.720
And one of the benefits
is the analytics.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.050
But analyze your data.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.330
And try to figure out,
where are your

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.350
demographics coming from?

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.540
Who are your viewers?

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.960
Who are your uploaders?

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.660
You could also try
to figure out--

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.210
if there's a lull in the
uploads, maybe you want to

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:19.260
push in terms of marketing the
game and market the game at

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.920
that sweet spot.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.250
But there's a number of things
that you can figure out with

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.715
just looking at your
analytics.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.990
Let me see here.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.280
What else?

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.410
Anything you want to
add to that, Kenji?

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:35.180
KENJI ARAI: I was looking at
your five bullet points here.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.790
I think we already talked
about creating contests.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.580
I think it's just about--

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.615
after the launch happens, it's
really just diving in with

00:31:39.615 --> 00:31:41.690
your community.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.510
Educating your users
how to upload--

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.100
what Cliff was referring
to was--

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.140
I think when we first launched
the integration with Black

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.470
Ops, it was kind of a feature
that was buried a little bit

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.560
within Theater Mode.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.600
And luckily we had folks--

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.230
I don't know if you're actually

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.010
going to show the video--

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.126
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:58.126 --> 00:31:58.300
I'm going to go through that.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.890
KENJI ARAI: But we had partners
that were out there

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.120
that kind of educated the
community for us, so we were

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.920
lucky to have them.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.160
And Jarek will show you
a video of that.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.030
But it's about engaging
with your community.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:12.560
And so don't just let these
users just upload stuff

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.330
mindlessly.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.110
Give them goals and things to
hit, because they're gamers.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.740
They want goals.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.700
They want to hit those levels.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.330
And they want to impress you.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:23.100
So when you give them something
to aim for, likely

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.235
they'll hit it and probably
surprise you with

00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:27.090
a little bit more.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:27.670
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Yeah.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.310
And I would just add that-- and
Kenji pretty much spoke to

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.600
this, but--

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.740
YouTube is a two-way dialogue.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.350
Your users can upload
through the API.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.770
But if you, through your
channel, communicate with them

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:46.515
and say, hey, we'd like to see
more uploads of this type of

00:32:46.515 --> 00:32:47.970
kill within Call of Duty--

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.090
KENJI ARAI: More headshots.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:52.470
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: --or this
particular move within

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:56.660
Uncharted 3, you're going
to get that response.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.430
Another thing that you can do
is watch the videos that are

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.970
being uploaded to YouTube
through the API.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.080
Comment on those videos.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.730
Or you can highlight the videos
that you really like

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.130
and put them into your
channel and feature

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.470
it within your channel.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.940
These are things that are going
to have that two-way

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.830
dialogue with your users.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:23.130
So let's dive in a little bit
and walk through a couple of

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.770
implementation examples.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.640
And if you have some additional
questions about

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.730
this section, we actually have
more in-depth presentations

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.520
available online.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.910
And we'll post the links to
these after this session.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:39.360
But we mentioned one integration
that we did

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.720
earlier with Call of Duty
Black Ops and now

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.120
Modern Warfare 3.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.090
So at Google I/O 2011, we
actually co-presented with

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:49.860
Activision.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.980
And we described how
the system was

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.380
built in more detail.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.270
And here's kind of an overview
of how the system worked.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:01.410
So this is a console
game integration.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.510
It worked for both PlayStation
and the Xbox.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.200
What Activision did is they
actually had a middleware

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.770
team, which was actually
responsible for delivering

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:12.840
their videos to YouTube.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.260
So the video was rendered
locally on the console and

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.320
then uploaded to their
middleware, which is a team

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.380
called DemonWare.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.540
And then from DemonWare, it was
actually pushed using the

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.570
API to YouTube.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:30.070
One thing that they did do is
they actually had a way for

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.949
users to link their gaming
account with their YouTube

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.880
account through, now, OAuth.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.620
And that allows the
uploads to go into

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.860
individuals' user accounts.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.850
And this is something that I
think we can't stress enough.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.159
Frequently, we have partners who
come and insist on trying

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:53.120
to push everything into a
single YouTube channel.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.820
But there are issues
with that.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.150
First of all, you will somewhat
deprive the users of

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.920
the sense of ownership of their
own content, so they

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.870
won't be able to delete the
video easily if they want to.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.900
And they will have less of
an incentive to share it.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.290
So this is where OAuth comes
into the picture.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.740
You can still have a fair amount
of control over what

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.830
the content looks like--

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.350
associated metadata
and so forth.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.000
But then the video actually ends
up in the user's account.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.650
And this is the case
with Activision.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.430
They did have an option for
users that didn't have

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.000
accounts to actually upload
into a common channel.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.640
But what they found is over
time, most users were actually

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.670
incentivized to create these
accounts and link and upload

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.650
into their own channel.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.070
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: And I think a
lot of the concern with game

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:42.080
publishers is if they, for
example, allow users to upload

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.220
into their individual channel,
that there's a sense of loss

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.920
of control over those videos.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.110
And one thing that we always
have to remind a lot of the

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.960
game publishers is that you can
always grab those videos

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.470
and put it into a playlist and
put it into your own channel.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.500
So you can take sort of the
cream of the crop videos and

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.290
put them into your channel, but
allow the user to have the

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:05.500
power and control.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, I think
there's always a fine

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.940
balance between what the
publisher wants and what the

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.060
YouTube community wants
and expects.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.140
So this is a great example where
if it's user-generated

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.090
content, our recommendation is
to let users upload it into

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.680
their own accounts.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.730
Through a playlist, you can
still curate that content.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:28.820
You can track it, if you're
actually our YouTube partner.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.700
You can actually obtain the
analytics information.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.300
So all the good things that come
out of the integrations

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.520
are possible.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.940
So let's look at the Black Ops
uploads user experiences.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.700
As Kenji mentioned, the initial
version of the game

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.100
had it a little buried.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:44.670
I'm just going to
play this video.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.100
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:49.340
-The only things that you need
are an Xbox 360 or PS3, the

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.820
game itself, an internet
connection,

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.350
and a YouTube account.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:55.560
The greatest thing about this
method is that you can do this

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.290
all without using a capture card
or any cables or wires.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.900
And most importantly, this
process is all free.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.230
I'm going to go step by step.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.780
And if you still any questions
or comments after I finish,

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.160
you can post them below.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.080
And I will do my best
to help you.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.950
The first step is to go to
callofduty.com and register an

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.090
account there.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.330
Once you do that, go to
callofduty.com/theater and

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.000
link your gamertag, which will
require you using your

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.810
Windows Live ID.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.540
Now go back to
callofduty.com/theater.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.400
And on that page, click to link
your YouTube account.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.130
And then click to allow access
to your account.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:36.670
If you don't allow access, this
process will not work.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.630
Now switch over to your Xbox
or PS3, and go into

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.300
Multiplayer, then
into Theater.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:46.450
Select the gameplay
that you want.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.300
And while you are watching that
game, record a clip that

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:54.680
is 30 seconds or less.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:04.010
[GUNFIRE]

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.600
-Spy plane standing by.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.960
-Name the clip, save it, and
upload it to your fileshare.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.030
Now get out of viewing
the full game.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.730
And then take your clip from
your fileshare and click

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:26.980
Select for Playback.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.990
Now you'll notice
that the Render

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.450
Clip option is available.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.020
So click on that.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.940
And then the clip will be
opened, and it will run

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.790
through once.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.550
After, you will see a loading
screen for the clip, which

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.860
means that it is being
uploaded and

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.110
rendered to the internet.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.255
After a few hours, your clip
should be uploaded to your

00:38:48.255 --> 00:38:50.360
YouTube account and to
your fileshare on

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.660
callofduty.com/theater.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.700
This part does take some time,
so don't expect the clip to be

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.150
there as soon as your rendered
clip is complete.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.405
So in other words, try
to be patient.

00:39:02.405 --> 00:39:02.840
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Are
you patient, Cliff?

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.340
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Be patient.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.150
That is key.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.880
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So
this was the user

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.640
experience, as you see.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.870
Even though it was not super
straightforward, there were

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.470
lots of gamers that actually
found a way

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.300
to go through this.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.010
And consequently, we got a lot
of this type of content.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.680
And I think the nice part
about the experience is

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.825
there's no need for a capture
card and you can just upload

00:39:27.825 --> 00:39:29.390
it directly from your game.

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.850
And then the other piece that
wasn't really emphasized too

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:35.370
much is the fact that Call of
Duty has a theater mode where

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:40.050
you can actually edit that
content somehow.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:41.510
KENJI ARAI: It certainly was
really helpful for us to have

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:42.560
guys like [? Anoj ?]

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.040
from our friends at Machinima
to help sort

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.040
of educate the community.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.700
And so, like we kind of talked
about earlier, if you do

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.690
decide to go down this route of
integrating an API upload

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.570
feature into your game,
definitely have

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:57.530
that content prepared.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.130
Because I think users are going
to want to know how to

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.130
do it and where it goes.

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.720
Instead of having your community
team bombarded with

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.880
questions, let a video kind
of speak for it and

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.810
speak for you guys.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And again, if
you would like to know more

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.115
about this particular
integration, we'll share a

00:40:15.115 --> 00:40:20.130
post on our developers page
with the link to the video

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:24.280
from the session and the
presentation slides.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.950
Now let's talk a little
bit about mobile.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:29.470
So this is something we
did at Google I/O '12.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:34.790
We talked about integration
into your mobile titles.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:38.560
So let me show you one of the
options that is getting

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.990
traction lately.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.750
In fact, a couple of weeks ago,
we had guys from Kamcord

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.755
here that are pursuing this
option quite successfully.

00:40:46.755 --> 00:40:51.370
At I/O, we presented jointly
with Dude Perfect.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.930
If you're a basketball fan,
then you know who

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:54.700
Dude Perfect is.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.870
If not, then I highly encourage
you to google Dude

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.780
Perfect channel and check out
some of their videos.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.390
But the process for
mobile games looks

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:06.420
something like this.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:11.000
In the case of Dude Perfect,
actually, the game is written

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.020
on top of Unity engine.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:19.640
And the AV frames from the games
are actually encoded in

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.070
their integration
using FFmpeg.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:27.670
Video frames are encoded using
VP8, so this is a part of the

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.250
WebM suite.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.750
Audio frames are encoded
using Vorbis.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:36.850
Next, the actual corresponding
file is

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.120
wrapped in the WebM container.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.810
So again, this is technology
that is actually available

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.050
from Google.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:46.750
So if you look for
webmproject.org, you will see

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:47.460
all the source.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.020
And you're welcome to use it.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.880
Once that is done, then this is
where the YouTube API comes

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.410
into the picture.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.150
So you actually have the
audio/video file encoded

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.990
wrapped into a WebM container.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.890
And you can use our
RESTful APIs to

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:02.580
push it over to YouTube.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.940
So it's really as
simple as this.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.960
Now, this all happens on the
mobile device, so obviously

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.680
there are some challenges as far
as the processing power of

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.150
the device and how much time the
user is willing to spend

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.240
waiting on it.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.730
Now, on some platforms, the
encoding process can actually

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:18.750
be hardware accelerated.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:23.780
So this is an area where we see
rapid progress and a lot

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.820
of innovation.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.230
I think Kenji--

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.630
as I mentioned, he's a
world-famous mobile gamer.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.890
I think he's really looking
forward to getting some of

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.090
these clips on YouTube.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:33.910
KENJI ARAI: Sure.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.310
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So one
interesting example that I

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:38.740
always like to bring
up because I have

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.900
kids is Talking Tom.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.180
And if any of you guys or gals
in the audience have kids, you

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.480
probably have this application
on your phone already.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.530
This is a virtual
pet application.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.620
You can talk to the cat,
interact with the cat.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.960
But one cool feature
of that application

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.380
is the YouTube upload.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.470
And they actually co-presented
with us at GDC

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:57.920
earlier in the year.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.010
This is what their integration
looks like.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.050
Again, thanks for allowing us
to share this information,

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:07.380
both at GDC and Google I/O. The
company that builds the

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.900
Talking Tom is called Outfit7.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.390
You can download it on your
Android or iOS device.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.030
So in their case, they actually
implemented the local

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.090
video rendering and encoding.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.850
It's reasonably low resolution,
low frame rate, so

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.470
10 frames per second.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.390
Encoded using the
MOV container--

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:28.950
MPEG4 and AAC audio.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:31.020
One thing that they've done
a really good job of is

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.470
including a lot of metadata
with these uploads.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.270
So if you actually look closely,
you will see that

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:40.580
every upload includes a link
to the actual game.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.590
So in this case, Outfit7
actually now has a franchise,

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.890
so there's many characters.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.430
So this was an upload that I
did from the Talking Ben

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:51.160
application.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.350
And he's a really cool,
laid-back dog.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:57.386
I was told he's modeled after
the Great Lebowski, but I'm

00:43:57.386 --> 00:44:00.710
not sure if that's
true or not.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.350
And what you'll see
here is there's a

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.910
download link in the metadata.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:05.275
So please take advantage
of that.

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:06.890
This is free advertising
for your game.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.945
You can just include it as a
part of your metadata during

00:44:09.945 --> 00:44:10.630
the upload.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.510
And then when users view the
video on YouTube, they will be

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:14.810
able to click on that link.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.480
And you can take them
wherever you want.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.730
And typically, you can take them
to Google Play so they

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.300
can actually download
the application.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:26.260
Then, tags that are helpful
with video discovery.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.530
This slide shows the
creator's view.

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:32.750
Jeff is actually going to talk
a little bit more about some

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.180
of the changes in the tagging
area, but that's another thing

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.370
that helps this.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:40.380
Cliff mentioned a lot of the
video is driven by discovery,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.260
so we show related videos
and so forth.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.340
So people can actually spend
more time on YouTube.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.390
So if you actually do a good job
of the metadata, chances

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.750
are that the videos will
get more views.

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:55.140
So let's look at an example--

00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:00.170
gameplay video or virtual
pet video.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:04.210
And I'll give Kenji credit
for finding this one.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.760
I think he's a big fan.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.160

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.930
KENJI ARAI: 5.7 million views.

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:38.220
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Almost
6 million views.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:38.690
That's incredible.

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:40.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So that's
just amazing.

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:42.860
So this is what you get if you
actually do a good job

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:43.680
integrating.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.870
So finally, let's go through a
quick list of best practices.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.140
I will make this deck available
for you so you can

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.350
look at it offline, but a couple
of things to remember.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:56.680
So first of all, make sure that
you have a developer key

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:01.450
and a full version
two of the API.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:04.270
You can go to code.google.com/
apis/youtube/dashboard.

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:06.190
And you can get it there.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:08.980
Use it with your uploads.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.290
You can use direct uploads
or resumable uploads.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:12.890
Again, this depends on
your architecture.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.750
For mobile games, we recommend
resumable uploads.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.190
So that if you lose
connectivity, you have

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:22.080
actually quite a bit of time to
reestablish the upload and

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.050
just upload whatever it
is that was missed.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:27.900
Next, use developer tags.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.390
So this is a feature that is
frequently overlooked by

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.660
developers.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.080
What it allows you to
do is really encode

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:36.910
application-specific metadata in
the video and then use our

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:39.110
search index to actually
find it.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.940
For example, if you're curating
playlists on your

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.870
portal, you can use these stacks
to actually figure out

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.820
which level the gameplay is
about or what weapons are

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.670
being used, and so forth.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.640
So this is entirely up to you
of what you encode in that

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.300
information.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.130
And it allows you to actually
offload some of the database

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.210
searches onto our
search index.

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.460
And as Kenji mentioned, we are
reasonably good at that.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.590
KENJI ARAI: Reasonably.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And then,
consider quotas.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:11.360
Last week, we had a more
in-depth version of our quota

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.850
best practices talk.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.950
The starting point for that
is this blog post.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:19.680
That's something that we always
make sure that partners

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.310
think about in their uploads
implementation.

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:26.230
If you have a service-side
system and there's a bunch of

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:29.220
uploads happening in parallel,
make sure that you follow the

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.000
quota best practices.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.210
Now, for partners, we have a
content management system--

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:37.610
and this is something that
Kenji and Cliff were

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:38.230
explaining--

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.040
that allows you to actually
manage this content once it

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.180
gets uploaded.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.640
The first step there is
actually, before you even

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.290
launch, make sure that you set
up a content management system

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.370
policy for that content and
associate that with a

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:51.050
developer key.

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:53.570
Because this is something that
allows you to actually

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:57.030
automatically claim the content
as soon as YouTube

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.650
receives it.

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:00.440
As a part of the upload, we'll
actually apply the policy that

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.560
you have designed
to that content.

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.490
So this is something you want
to do ahead of time.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:06.530
Get everything set up.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.380
And when you launch your game,
when the uploads start coming

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:11.615
from your users, you will
actually be able to track

00:48:11.615 --> 00:48:16.100
them, analyze them, and then
hopefully monetize them if

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.760
that is important to you.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.102
It doesn't seem important
to Kenji.

00:48:19.102 --> 00:48:20.110
KENJI ARAI: Why not?

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.560
Everything's important to me.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.140
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Let me
just explain policies.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.250
Policies are basically rules
that you're going to set once

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:30.470
you're a partner for your
videos or your uploads.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.370
And the policies can take
three different rules.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:37.075
The first is to monetize it,
so monetize all uploads or

00:48:37.075 --> 00:48:39.640
monetize a upload.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.330
The second is to track it.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:46.280
So you're getting the user data
on those videos and not

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.220
monetizing it.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.950
And the third is blocking.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:50.590
Probably you're not going
to use block.

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:54.200
Obviously, if you're opening
up the API to record your

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.290
uploads and upload them through
the API, you're

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:59.610
probably not going to
use that policy.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thanks
for clarifying that.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.630
And finally, encoding
specifications--

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:07.880
so I mentioned WebM,
VP8, Vorbis.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.440
If you use other containers,
other codecs, we have a

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.490
detailed list of specifications
that we

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:14.400
recommend--

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.150
resolutions, bit rates, and so
forth, all the good stuff.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.500
It's here in the link.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.390
I'll share this deck.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:23.080
So if you are actually working
on the capture process,

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.020
encoding process, then
consider that.

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.260
So this concludes our session.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.760
Before we transition to Q&amp;A, I
was hoping that Jeff could

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.540
cover some of the recent
developments in the YouTube

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.260
blog world.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.314
Jeff, are you on the
line with us?

00:49:40.314 --> 00:49:41.240
JEFFREY POSNICK: Absolutely.

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Still there?

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:43.040
All right.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:43.640
Over to you.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.600
JEFFREY POSNICK: All right.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.173
Cool.

00:49:45.173 --> 00:49:49.050
And thanks, Cliff and Kenji, for
joining us and providing

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.900
all that useful information.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:54.420
And yeah, so we have two recent
blog posts, both of

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.460
which have come out since our
last Google Developers Live.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.500
And I wanted to cover
them fairly quickly.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.482
As always, you should refer to
the official blog to read them

00:50:04.482 --> 00:50:05.060
yourselves.

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.382
It's apiblog.youtube.com,
where you can

00:50:09.382 --> 00:50:10.860
find all our posts.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:15.850
So the first one has to do with
playlist identifiers that

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:19.160
are returned and read
by the API.

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:23.900
So for those who have
ever seen a YouTube

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.810
playlist web page--

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:29.560
some sort of page that you go to
on the YouTube website and

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.680
you're viewing a playlist--

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.600
and you've taken a look
at what the URL is.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.390
You might have noticed that
the identifier for that

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.440
playlist, when shown in
the URL bar, has the

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.490
prefix pl on it.

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:44.530
And that's been kind of
universal on the website for

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:47.180
about a year or so.

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:51.300
We have not supported that
prefix for playlist

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.810
identifiers in the
data API, though.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:57.550
So a lot of times we'll have
people who had copied a

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.740
playlist identifier
from a web page.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:03.860
They've tried to pass it in to
the API when making a call to

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.930
retrieve the contents of the
playlist or something along

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:06.600
those lines.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.200
And they've gotten back an error
indicating, hey, this

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.730
playlist doesn't exist.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:15.460
So basically, what we've done is
added support for playlists

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:19.600
that have that pl prefix
on them and will

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.410
both read those values.

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.070
So when you're constructing a
URL that has to do with a

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:29.160
playlist, you could include
those prefixed playlist IDs.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:33.080
Or if you're passing in metadata
and you're updating

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.360
playlists or something
like that, you could

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.970
pass in those pl values.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:41.670
But what we're also doing is
returning those playlists with

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.180
the prefixes by default.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:47.460
So if you get back a list of all
the playlists in a given

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:50.730
account or if you do a search
for playlists that match a

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:53.980
certain search term, the
identifiers that you get back

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.610
from the API will now include
that pl prefix in

00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.700
the playlist IDs.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:04.095
So we are still going to support
old-style un-prefixed

00:52:04.095 --> 00:52:07.930
playlist IDs, certainly for
the time being, in read

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:12.140
requests or update requests, so
you could continue to pass

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.770
in those un-prefixed
identifiers.

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:21.320
But we do hope that folks, first
of all, are not reading

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.810
too much into what
the identifiers

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:24.340
returned by the API is.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.080
I hope there's not folks out
there who wrote codes

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.410
thinking, OK, playlist
identifiers are always going

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:32.180
to be X number of
characters long.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.910
And now your code breaks because
it's two characters

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:36.560
longer than it used to be.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.830
So please don't make
those assumptions.

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:41.930
And one thing-- and particularly
keep in mind if

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:45.090
you have a playlist ID that was
stored somewhere in the

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:48.090
database or something, and then
you're comparing it with

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:51.370
a response that you get back
from the data API now.

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:54.830
If your playlist ID did not
include the pl prefix, and you

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:56.660
expected it to be equal to
something you get back from

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.210
the API right now, you
might be surprised.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:02.050
So just keep that in the back of
your head if you happen to

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:06.160
have code that makes those
sorts of assumptions.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.200
So that's one of the changes.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.550
The other change is related to a
recent blog post that we had

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:14.960
on our YouTube creator blog.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.590
And I think folks probably have
also realized this if

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:22.050
they've gone to a YouTube
watch page recently.

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:26.280
And that's basically the fact
that we're not exposing the

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.430
keywords or video tags--

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.570
there's two different
terms that basically

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:31.950
mean the same thing--

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:35.430
for a given video publicly
anymore.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:40.860
So if I happen to be a user
who's watching some random

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:45.260
video uploaded on Google
Developers accounts, I won't

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:49.140
see the specific keywords
that have been

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.370
used to tag that video.

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:52.610
It's not going to
affect anything

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.350
related to Search, though.

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:59.360
So I could continue to search
for YouTube API.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:02.680
And videos that have been tagged
by the uploader with

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.440
the tag YouTube API will show
up in the search results.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.120
So this is just about what
we're exposing to random

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.640
people who are viewing
the video.

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.990
So that went live on the website
a couple weeks ago.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:18.950
And what's going to go live
fairly soon in the API--

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:20.640
it's going to go live on the
station server a little bit

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.380
later today, and I think in
production next week--

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.140
is the fact that we're going
to be pretty much doing the

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.700
same thing for API responses.

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:33.010
So if you get a video entry back
from the API now and you

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:37.060
are not authenticated as the
owner of the video, you're

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:41.380
going to see a blank media
keywords element in response.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.470
If you are authenticated as
the owner of the video,

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.350
though, you'll continue to
get your keywords back.

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:50.220
And you can continue to add
keywords to new videos that

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:50.930
you upload.

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:54.140
And you can update existing
videos to include whatever

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.940
keywords you'd like.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.810
So that doesn't change from the
perspective of the owner

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:01.200
of the video or the uploader
of the video.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.440
So what really is changing is
the public information to

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.040
non-authenticated users
that we're returning.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.250
So just please keep in mind
that if you do have an

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:14.160
application that lets people
update the metadata of an

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.080
existing video and you
are signed in as the

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.210
owner of that video.

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.840
When you're reading that video
entry-- like maybe you have an

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.150
app that lets you fetch all
your existing videos and

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:25.380
change some of the metadata--

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.510
be sure that when you do the
fetching, the initial Gets of

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:29.620
those videos--

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.570
that you're properly
authenticated as the owner.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.940
And that way, you'll get back
the media key words.

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.640
And you could display
it to the user.

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.530
And the user could
make updates.

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:42.540
And you won't end up returning
no media keywords because you

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:45.050
make an unauthenticated request
and accidentally

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.800
wiping out all the existing
keywords for the user.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.060
So that's the one probably
most important

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.530
thing to keep in mind.

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:52.510
It's a bit of an edge case.

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:56.910
But if you happen to be in that
camp, watch out for that.

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:57.174
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:55:57.174 --> 00:56:00.850
And both of them are described
on our blog post in more

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.810
detail, right?

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:04.220
JEFFREY POSNICK: Absolutely.

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:09.220
Jeremy, any questions
on the moderator?

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.110
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah,
we have a couple.

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:10.680
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We have
a few minutes left.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.960
JEREMY WALKER: I think we
have like three minutes.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.290
I'll run through these
pretty quickly.

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:14.850
Quick plug--

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:16.910
don't forget, we are hiring.

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:20.180
So go to
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.615
We have some openings.

00:56:21.615 --> 00:56:22.660
We'd love to hear from you.

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:25.250
So if you are interested,
check that out.

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:28.480
We have about three questions.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.850
One is about using Chrome
with Flash and

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:34.280
recording with a webcam.

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:37.440
Basically, they say it's
a little bit laggy.

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:41.675
So our response to that is let
us know the bug ID and.

00:56:41.675 --> 00:56:44.790
We can bug the right people.

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:48.280
So just kind of follow up
with that if you could.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:51.800
But if we don't have that,
we can't do a whole lot.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.920
So that would be great.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.530
AutoPlay--

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:55.620
we hear this a lot.

00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.770
This is on iOS-- is basically,
I'm using

00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:00.220
Embed with the iFrame.

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.340
And AutoPlay doesn't
work on iOS.

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.740
That's just something that's
part of Apple.

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.170
They don't let you
autoplay videos.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:10.590
iOS just doesn't do that.

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:13.300
Jeff, I don't know if you want
to add anything to that.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.560
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah, this
definitely comes up quite a

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.840
bit in the Google group.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:23.020
And I have recently put together
a post in the Google

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.490
group that kind of spells out
exactly what's going on and

00:57:26.490 --> 00:57:30.350
points to Apple's official
documentation.

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:32.650
I'm doing my best to convince
people that this really is not

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:35.290
something that YouTube is doing
deliberately, but this

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:38.640
is a policy that Apple
has in place for

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.970
fairly sensible reasons.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:43.940
And there are ways of working
around it, if you happen to be

00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:48.410
using a packaged, official
iOS application that's

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:50.220
using a UI web view.

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.540
And in that case, you can change
the defaults to allow

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:55.960
playbacks by default.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.480
But if you are just opening a
web page by default, you can't

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.372
do that or you just can't
do that at all.

00:58:03.372 --> 00:58:05.770
So check the Google group.

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:08.580
And maybe I'll post a link to
my response to the Google

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:12.935
group in our Google+ account,
just to highlight it to folks

00:58:12.935 --> 00:58:15.830
who might be watching at home
who want to read that.

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:16.610
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:20.600
And then to follow up on that,
there was one last question

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.870
around the iFrame API, saying
it doesn't work

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.470
in Chrome and Safari.

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:28.610
And I think it's just that
the video doesn't play.

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:32.820
So Jeff has already posted a
link to follow up on that.

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:35.560
And I think it's just kind
of the rehash of

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:36.660
what we just discussed.

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.070
So those are all
the questions.

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.420
We still have a minute left.

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:43.760
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Can we do
a coast-to-coast wave?

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.128
Jeremy, start it off.

00:58:45.128 --> 00:58:45.546
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah.

00:58:45.546 --> 00:58:46.800
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Ready?

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.790
Whoa.

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:50.180
Jeff.

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:51.770
Back to the West Coast.

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:53.080
Jeremy, start again.

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.010
Whoa.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:57.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So this
is why those guys--

00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:57.480
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.658
Oh, they have fun
all the time.

00:58:58.658 --> 00:59:01.290
That's why they never work.

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:02.360
CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Thanks,
everyone.

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.530
JEREMY WALKER: Thanks
for joining us.

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:04.200
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Thank you guys.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.080
See you next week--

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.360
Wednesday, the usual slot.

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.610
JEREMY WALKER: Bye, everybody.

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:34.570
