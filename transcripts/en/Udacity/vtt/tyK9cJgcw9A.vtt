00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, my inclination was I think we can do better.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I listed 3 places where we could make a change,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but it seems like we're really only changing 1 thing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I mean, after all, it's really only one hand that we're dealing with.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I think we can do better by isolating that change,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and in general, that's what I want to try to do.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I want to be able to say that the amount of change

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
should be proportional to the amount of change in the conceptualization,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and here there's only 1 change in the conceptualization

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of what it means to be a straight with a low ace.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We should be able to confine that change to 1 place in our program

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
rather than 3 places.
