00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:03.527
- [Instructor] After a rain
storm, Lily measures the depth

00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:06.302
of several puddles in her backyard.

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:09.088
She records her results in a table.

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:11.987
So here are three different
puddles and she measures

00:00:11.987 --> 00:00:14.162
the depth in inches.

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:18.547
We're asked how much deeper
was the puddle under the swing

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:21.220
than the puddle on the sidewalk.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.604
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:25.604 --> 00:00:29.278
So they say how much deeper
was the puddle under the swing,

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:31.955
so that's this one right over
here it's one and 1/4 inches

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:33.954
deep it's under the swing.

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:38.121
How much deeper was that than
the puddle on the sidewalk?

00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:41.828
Do that in a different color,
the puddle on the sidewalk.

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:44.887
And we see here the puddle
on the sidewalk is 2/4 inches

00:00:44.887 --> 00:00:47.476
deep, so what we could
do is subtract the 2/4

00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:49.717
from the one and 1/4.

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:53.884
So we could write one and
1/4 minus 2/4 could write it

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:57.912
like that, and we could try
to subtract the fraction part

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:01.452
2/4 from the fraction part
of this mixed number up here

00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:04.598
from 1/4 but we immediately
have a problem 'cause 2/4

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:08.804
is a larger fraction than 1/4,
so how do we deal with that?

00:01:08.804 --> 00:01:12.809
Well the key is to realize
that one can be rewritten

00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:16.976
as a fraction, one and 1/4
is the same thing as one plus

00:01:18.597 --> 00:01:23.172
1/4 which is the same thing
as another way to write one

00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:27.339
in terms of fourths is 4/4
so this is 4/4 plus 1/4

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:34.213
which is going to be equal to 5/4.

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:38.006
So now you can do this as
5/4, this number is the same

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:42.173
thing as 5/4 minus 2/4, let
me rewrite it, minus 2/4,

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.942
minus two over four.

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.246
And that's pretty
straightforward if I have five of

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:52.485
something and I subtract
two of it, I'm going to have

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:56.550
three of that something in this
case I'm talking about 3/4.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.265
So this is going to be 3/4 so
how much deeper was the puddle

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:02.805
under the swing than the
puddle on the sidewalk?

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:05.382
Well 3/4 of an inch.

00:02:05.382 --> 00:02:07.625
And just another way that you
could have visualized this

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:11.861
is look I'm going to subtract
2/4 from one and 1/4.

00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:15.881
At first we could've thought
of one and 1/4 as a whole like

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:19.875
this and then it's all let me
shade it, the whole and that's

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:24.136
one and then I would have a
fourth of a whole so let me

00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:28.520
divide this into four sections,
so this is one and 1/4.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.479
And at first we say well how
do we take away 2/4 from just

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:35.591
that I only have 1/4 right over
here and our key realization

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:39.600
is well look, I actually
this whole right over here

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.767
is actually 4/4 I can think of
it as 4/4, so I can think of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.187
it like this and now I have
5/4, one, two, three, four, five

00:02:51.222 --> 00:02:54.328
fourths and now I can take
away two of the fourths,

00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:58.803
so I can take away one of the
fourths and two of the fourths

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.649
and what am I left with?

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:04.840
Well then I am going to
be left with these 3/4

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.257
right over there.
