00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.520
If people meet me at parties they normally
ask me what I do,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.090
and I say I'm a researcher.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.090
I'm a scientist.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.750
And if I said I was a physicist people would
sort of slowly back away...

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.170
Hi, my name is Suzie and I design particle
accelerators.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.679
A particle accelerator is a machine designed
to take either atoms, with the electrons stripped

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.679
off,

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.009
what we call ions, or the particles inside
the atoms themselves,

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.550
so electrons or protons, and give them energy,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.919
increase their speed.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.400
The main way is using electric fields to accelerate
and magnetic fields to bend and control the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.870
particles.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.260
So the earth has a magnetic field and coming
from the sun is charged particles

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.329
The only reason those charged particles don't
irradiate us is because the Earth's magnetic

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.100
field uses exactly the same principle and
bends them away from us

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.649
and actually protects us, almost like a magnetic
shield around the Earth.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.090
So that same principle, in physics that's
called the Lorentz force.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.290
A charged particle in a magnetic field gets
bent, so we're using exactly the same principle,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.920
but to bend particles around in an accelerator.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.450
And if you take an electric field, an electric
potential,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.780
and you sit a charged particle within that,
it will feel the electrical force which will

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.909
move it from one side to the other:

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.970
like charges repel and opposite charges attract.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.630
We literally just use that basic principle
to give a particle a small kick or push,

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.671
and if you do that enough times over and over

00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:39.009
it gains more and more energy.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.979
I think there is a creative process that people
go through when they design accelerators.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.170
Often the design of an accelerator starts
with one person and their concept.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.090
Most particle accelerators really do have
a recipe.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.729
So there's 5 ingredients: the particles, where
you get those from, how you make them.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.049
There's giving it energy, there's some sort
of acceleration mechanism,

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.430
there's control, so that's usually the magnet
system, how you control and organise the beam

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.110
of particles,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.070
there's collision, which not all accelerators
are colliders as in beam-on-beam colliders,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.000
but we usually use the beam for something.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.850
So we usually collide it with a fixed target,
or even into a person's body, or just onto

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.940
some kind of sample or screen.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.120
And then there's detection.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.791
There's no point doing all of that

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:32.420
unless you can actually measure what's going
on with the beam at the end of the day.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.770
There are lots of different types of particle
accelerators,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.340
but we can classify them into three main categories.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.890
The first one is a linear accelerator.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.390
As the name suggests, it's a straight line.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.090
Most commonly they're used for radiotherapy
in hospitals to accelerate electrons,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.230
and using those generate x-rays, and then
the x-rays are used for cancer treatment.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.190
The other two types of accelerators are circular.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.330
Probably the most common one, in terms of
numbers, is called a cyclotron.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.330
It's a compact, relatively old-style accelerator
in which the particles start in the centre

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
and as they gain energy they spiral outwards.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.240
To reach higher energies, we use a machine
called a synchrotron.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.260
A synchrotron has to keep both the electric
and magnetic fields perfectly synchronised

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.630
with the particles as they increase in energy.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.870
That's where it gets its name from.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.920
We have two big synchrotrons on site at the
Rutherford Appleton lab.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.200
One is the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source, and
the other is the Diamond Light Source.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.100
The Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest
accelerator, is also a synchrotron.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.880
I spent 3 months working at CERN as an undergraduate
student.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.120
The first time I went out there this thing
was so big, and so complex.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.930
I was an ant in an ant hill.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.450
I just thought, 'this thing is never gonna
work'.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.960
And yet, they switched the Large Hadron Collider
on and it worked as smoothly as I've ever

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.450
seen any accelerator start up.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.640
It's an incredible machine and an incredible
team of people.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.920
usually they're such long term projects that
in some accelerator control rooms,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.300
if you go in there there's a series of corks
or empty bottles

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.480
that have written on them 'first beam' or
'first user cycle'.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.790
When you reach a major milestone, the bottle
of champagne is quite a ubiquitous thing in

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.820
my field.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.660
We don't drink much champagne, but we do like
to rack a bottle when 20 years later you get

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.449
the beam on.
