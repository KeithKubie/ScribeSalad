00:00:00.635 --> 00:00:04.420
Knowledge-based AI is a collection of three things.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.350
Knowledge representations, problem solving techniques and architectures.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.980
We have already look at one knowledge representation, semantic networks.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.230
We have not so far looked at problem solving methods or architectures.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.360
Today, I'd like to start by talking about the problem solving method.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.880
Let us illustrate the problem solving method of generate and test with the same

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.470
examples that we have discussed earlier. When we were discussing this example in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.250
the case of semantic networks, we simply came up with various states and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.080
pruned some of them without saying about how an AI agent would know what states

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.750
to prune. So imagine that we have a generator that takes the initial state and

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.760
from that initial or current state, generates all the possible successive

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.030
states. For now, imagine it's not a very smart generator, it's a dumb generator.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.490
So it generates all the possible states. So the generator test method not only

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.980
has a generator but also has a tester. The tester looks at all the possible

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.340
states the generator has generated and removes some of them. For now, let's also

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.949
assume that the tester is is dumb as well. And so the tester is removes only

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:21.391
those states that are are clearly illegal based on the specific of the problem.

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:26.842
Namely, that one cannot have more prisoners than guards on either back.

00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:29.680
So the first and the third states are removed by the tester.
