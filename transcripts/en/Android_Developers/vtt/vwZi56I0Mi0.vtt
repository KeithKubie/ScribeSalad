00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.950
JULIE ARANDA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.030
Welcome, and thank you for
coming to our talk today.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.550
We are members of
the Android UX team.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.530
And we're excited
today to talk to you

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.710
about the new
notifications features in O

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.560
from a UX perspective.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.660
So I'm Julie, I'm a researcher
on the Android team.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.360
And today, I'll first tell
you about the research

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.710
that inspired the new
notifications features in O.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.280
So in November of
2015, our team went

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.300
on what we call a UX-pedition
to learn more about how people

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.580
experience notifications.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.020
So our team of researchers,
designers, engineers, PMs--

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.810
we all spent a week in
New York and New Jersey

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.110
speaking to and observing users.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.080
We approached the topic
as attention management

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.690
to include interruptions
from devices,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.810
other people around us,
ourselves, and everything

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.130
in your environment.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.050
We didn't want to
limit our scope

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.010
to just on-screen
smartphone notifications.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.200
We used multiple
methods in the research.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.480
We started by
interviewing people.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.940
But then, we also
observed people.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.630
Because notifications are so
contextual and in the moment,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.330
we wanted to observe people
receive notifications

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.090
to see what they would do, and
how they would react to them.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.690
We also had group discussions
amongst friends, who

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.520
did design exercises together.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.760
And lastly, we synthesized
the data together as a team.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.930
And we held a workshop
later and came up

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.810
with ideas that turned
into the features in O.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.040
So what did we learn?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.410
The most striking
observation we made

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.110
is that there was this
addiction to phones.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.610
People were bound
to their phones

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.350
all day, because
they were afraid they

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.260
might miss something important.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.680
Phone notifications were
a major source of stress.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.860
People were very hyper
vigilant to any kind of signal

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.630
they could be getting
from their phones,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.150
afraid to miss
something important.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.660
And most notifications were
actually not important to them,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.530
only a few were necessary.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.380
We heard lots of things like
this from our participants.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.140
Denise said, "If I don't have
my phone for two seconds,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.160
I freak out.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.740
What if I miss something?"

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.330
And she was a busy lawyer, and
I observed her in her house

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.030
the whole day, constantly going
like this, "Where's my phone?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.840
Where's my phone?"

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.164
And she'd leave the
room and come back,

00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:33.080
looking for her phone.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.230
Just really anxious all
day, just in case her phone

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.440
wasn't with her.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.360
And then there's Alice,
who is a professor.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.120
She said, "I wish I could have
something like an Amber Alert

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.570
for my parents, ex-husband,
and son's school,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.300
so that those would
override everything else."

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.750
She gets lots of notifications
from different sources,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.610
but the only ones she
cares about are these.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.250
And she wishes these would
always override the others.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.920
We observe different coping
strategies from users

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.960
to block out all of this noise.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.400
The first one is to
physically put the phone away.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.820
So people would force themselves
to put their phone in a purse,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.520
put it in another room.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.970
Someone even put it in
a box in another room--

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.270
just anything to prevent
yourself from checking it.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.480
The other strategy was to not
let the device make noise.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.500
So let it just vibrate, or don't
even let it vibrate at all.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.680
Another strategy was to not
let sources contact you.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.550
That means to block all
notifications from an app.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.500
And the last one
is to do nothing

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.700
but be constantly annoyed
every day, and all day.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.910
Steven, he mentioned
a particular

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.390
"Social networking app sent
me way too many notifications,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.040
so I deleted the app."

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.630
So he got fed up
and deleted the app.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.850
And actually, every
day he uses the service

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.520
in a mobile browser,
multiple times a day,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.310
purely just so he wouldn't
receive notifications.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.500
In fact, the pattern
that we're hearing now

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.830
is when people get so annoyed
with notifications, whenever

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.110
they download a new app,
by default they'll just

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.290
block it all, block all
notifications without even

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.610
giving it a try.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.680
This is obviously something
we all don't want.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.820
So we need to really be careful
about this cumulative effect

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.690
of all of our apps'
notifications.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.960
People often want only some
notifications from an app,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.490
but not all of them.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.270
So even if they want just
one type of notification,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.400
they still receive a
bunch of unwanted ones.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.350
And many people don't
adjust their settings,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.330
even if they know they can.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.310
So even if they know
there's a way to do it,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.560
they might not
know how to do it.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.690
Or it might feel like
a hassle, so they just

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.630
live with the problem.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.340
Angie said, "Notifications
are like junk mail.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.730
You can take the time to set
up filters, or just hit delete.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.875
I just deal with them."

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:56.910
She just deals
with it every day.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.450
Stella said, "If you
allow push notifications,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.095
I know there's a way to go
into settings and adjust it,

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:04.470
but I don't know
how to do that."

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.920
So what else did we learn?

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.260
There were only two
types of notifications

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.200
that people needed to know.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.010
The first one-- above all,
notifications from other people

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.520
are our most important.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.440
So these include SMS, messaging
apps, emails from people,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.970
phone calls, et cetera.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.390
Anything that came from a
person on the other end, these

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.170
were most valued.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.680
Flora said, "Notifications
from other people

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.770
are most important.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.290
I always respond."

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.680
Those are the only ones
that she pays attention to.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.230
And then, there are
more important people.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.590
So notifications from the
inner circle matter even more.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.420
So these are people
like your spouse,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.380
significant other, parents,
kids, closest friends.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.170
They can reach us at any
time, and we keep channels

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.990
open and reserved for them.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.960
Andrew said, "Work emails
and texts from my wife

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.550
are the only things that matter.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.700
Basically, things I need to tend
to so I don't get in trouble."

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.310
So those are the two
types that he cares about,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.480
above everything else.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.910
The other kind of notification
that's important to people

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.850
are reminders for things
that they need to do.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.516
So we observed
people having things

00:06:19.516 --> 00:06:21.390
they needed to remember
throughout their day,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.610
like picking up
your dry cleaning,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.240
calling a credit card company
to follow up with an issue,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.280
cleaning a chinchilla cage--

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.110
if that applies to you--

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.431
setting up a kid's play date,
making new keys for the car.

00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:35.430
Things like that, right?

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.380
We all have things
like this in our lives,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.650
and people need to
remember these things.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.410
David said, "Sometimes I get
a notification for something

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.990
that I actually want to do,
but just not at that moment.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.510
And then I forget
about it later,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.630
because I don't see it again."

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.710
And Shelly says, "I know I have
to pick up my dry-cleaning.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.260
But telling me right now
is not going to help me,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.660
it's like nagging.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.780
Tell me when I'm near
the dry cleaner!"

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.270
So when a notification
isn't addressed right away,

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.400
it's very easy to forget it.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.870
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.360
We realize that we need to
make it easier for people

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.635
to remember these tasks.

00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:16.710
So while this research,
as I mentioned,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.140
was conducted only in
New York and New Jersey,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.140
we've observed similar
patterns in many other studies,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.050
across many
locations, since then.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.660
Whatever topic we're
studying-- from productivity,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.640
to wearables, to driving--

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.040
we keep hearing
over and over again

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.740
from people about the
stress and the burden of all

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.929
the notifications they're
being bombarded with.

00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:40.720
So here are some other
locations that we've

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.150
done where we've heard similar
patterns across the US,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.700
in many cities, and
internationally.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.960
So based on this research, our
team felt it's important for us

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.930
to respect our users'
attention, and to allow

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.370
them to have more control.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.620
So this inspired some major
changes in O this year.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.150
Now, here's Rachel
to give you more

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.590
details about the features.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.351
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.780
RACHEL GARB: Hi,
I'm Rachel Garb,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.890
and I'm an interaction designer
and manager for the Android UX

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:17.640
team.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.840
The first new feature I want
to talk about is channels.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.660
Show of hands from smartphone
users in the room--

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.760
who here has ever
wished that they

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.160
could get some of the
notifications from an app,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.130
but not all of them?

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.700
That's almost all of you--

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.710
yep.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.500
So knowing that, we
definitely wanted

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.720
to add support in
the Android system

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.710
so that users could have more
granular control over an app's

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.900
notifications.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.690
In O, we're
introducing channels,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.190
and here's how it works.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.280
You define a channel for
each notification type

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.000
that you want to send,
and then your users

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.540
are able to make decisions about
notifications at the channel

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.130
level.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.730
Let's look at an example.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.670
Suppose that we are
all the designers

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.300
of an app for Crane Air, a
fuss-free corporate airline

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.340
that caters to the
frequent flyer.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.130
And here's all our
existing notifications.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.280
We've got a pretty sweet program
for our frequent flyers--

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.890
or as we like to call
them, executives.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.950
We have a set of notifications
for our customers

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.320
about the points they've
earned, and their status

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.120
in the program.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.580
Now, all of these
notifications you see here

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.740
have to do with the
executive program.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.290
So let's make a channel and
call it Executive Program.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.650
Now, we occasionally also
offer discounts and deals

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.340
to incentivize our customers
to book more flights.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.010
So let's group these
notifications together

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:54.220
in a channel and call
it Discounts and Deals.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.610
Now, when we categorize
notifications into channels,

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.320
we want to look
for similar subject

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.610
matter and similar
importance to users.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.900
Here, we have a number
of notifications

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.780
that could be sent in the
hours and minutes leading up

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.750
to the flight, so
they're pretty important.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.530
Let's create a channel for
them called Flight Updates.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.230
And now, with this
example in mind,

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:22.270
let's shift over to how
users experience channels.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.880
The UI design for
channels is optimized

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.830
for the number
one most important

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.090
use case, which is, "I don't
want this type of notification

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.180
from this app."

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.720
Now, without channels, any
support for this use case

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.240
has to come from within
the app, with settings

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.670
to block notifications by type.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.300
Now, how does a user find
out if an app provides this?

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.510
They have to open the app
and look at the settings.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:54.700
And it's not like all apps are
going to do it the same way.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.730
But a lot of the time,
there won't be any way

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.610
to block notifications by type.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.260
And at that point,
the user has to decide

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.790
what they're going to do.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.670
They can ban the app from
sending any notifications

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.600
at all, they could uninstall
the app, or just live with it.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.720
And none of these are ideal.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.340
But with channels,
it's a different story.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.980
One that's straightforward
and consistent.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.190
Let's check out the UI.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.670
Now, we at Crane Air know
that a segment of our users

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.600
love to celebrate when they earn
points or reach a new status.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.140
So whenever they land, we notify
them about how many points

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.660
they earned on the
flight, and how close they

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.630
are to the next status level.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:41.650
But, maybe not all users want
to be notified like this.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.960
Some might not want
any notifications,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.510
except the ones that are
essential to functioning

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.040
in their daily lives.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.710
And they know that they
can get this information

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.190
in their monthly statement,
they're fine waiting for it.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.190
So to stop this type
of notification,

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.340
all a user has to do
is touch and hold it,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.340
which lets them see the channel.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.870
And then, they turn off
this switch and tap Done.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.110
No more executive program
notifications from Crane Air,

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.150
but they'll still keep
getting the others,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.090
like those handy flight updates.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.600
Now, our aim with channels is
to make it possible for users

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.730
to get most, if not all, of
their notification control

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:32.740
needs met in line, or one
step away in Settings.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:34.750
Now, in Settings,
users can decide

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.340
to block all
notifications from an app.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.760
And new for O, an app can
show a dot on its icon

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.770
when it has notifications
waiting for a user.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.510
But if the user doesn't ever
want to see a dot for that app,

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.230
they can prevent the
app from showing it.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.690
Users can see all of
the channels at a glance

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.630
and decide which ones they want.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.570
They can view and edit
settings for a given channel--

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.280
more on that to come.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.610
And if the app wants to provide
other settings beyond what's

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.810
here, the app can have
a link for the users

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.810
back to a screen in the app.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.960
This approach, bringing
more notification controls

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.870
into the system, makes
the user experience

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.530
more convenient and consistent.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.420
So that is an
overview of channels.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.910
And next, I'd like to talk
about the new behavior

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.480
model for notifications
in O. And I'll

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.450
start with the research
that informed it.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.230
Some people are putting up with
unwanted notification behavior,

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.810
because they're reluctant
to use settings-- you

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.850
heard about this from Julie.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.100
So the opportunity
here was to make

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.370
it easier for users to
understand and control

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.930
notification behavior.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.260
Now, let's compare the
current behavior model

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.280
with the new one for O.
In the current model,

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.670
the app developer uses a field
called Priority, and sets

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.610
a priority level for
each notification.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.390
That level maps to a set of
behaviors, and some of them

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.670
are customizable by the app.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.290
For example, if you choose
priority level high as the app

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.280
developer, you can have your
notification make sound or not.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.380
You can have it vibrate or not,
you can have it peek or not.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.740
It's a lot for a user to follow.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.910
In the new model,
priority is deprecated.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.390
And instead, the app developer
sets an importance level

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.430
for each of their
channels, rather than

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.590
for individual notifications.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.110
And there's fewer
customizations that the app

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.330
can make on that behavior.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.480
Here, you see the inner
workings of priority levels.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.090
I won't read this out to
you, but let's compare it

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.500
with importance levels.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.390
As you can see, we've gone
down from five to four levels

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.580
and reduced what
can be customized.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.050
We are intentionally trading
flexibility for simplicity

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.140
so that users have a better
shot at understanding

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.750
what the heck is going on.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.510
We're letting go of
allowing each notification

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.620
to behave differently so
that we can guarantee users

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.810
that all notifications
from the same channel

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.390
behave the same way.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.960
In the current model, a user
can control an app's behavior

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.200
but has no insight whatsoever
into the app's intentions

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.870
as they're making decisions.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.600
But in the new model, the
user gets a clear picture

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.340
of app behavior as
they make decisions.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.850
So it's the difference
between, I can make sure

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.970
that this app won't be
able to do X, versus,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.030
I can see this channel
does X, but I'm

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.190
going to have a do Y instead.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.930
I'll show you what I
mean by comparing the UI.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.340
In the current UI, if Show
Silently here is turned on,

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.810
then it's predictable.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.240
But otherwise, the
user has no clue

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.930
how notifications from
the app will behave.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.940
In the new UI, the
user just needs

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.680
to look at the
Importance setting to see

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.090
how the channel will behave.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:07.370
And if they don't like it, they
can choose a different setting.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.820
In this new model, Android
creates a setting screen

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.850
for every channel
from every app.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.000
This is the place where
users go to see and control

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.460
its behavior.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.870
The main settings are to
block the channel and change

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.080
importance.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.150
If the importance
level is high enough,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.090
the user has sound and
vibration options, too.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.950
And there's more
advanced options.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.370
Now, you can also optionally
provide a brief description

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.170
of what the channel does,
if it's not obvious,

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.810
so that users can make
more informed decisions.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.350
If your app already offers
channel-like behavior,

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.350
please leverage Android
Solution so that users

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.240
don't run into the
situation where

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.860
there's a discrepancy between
an app and system settings.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.510
You can link to the
system settings screen,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.860
either at the channel
or the app level.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.930
And if you want to
offer channel controls

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.849
beyond what the system offers--

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:11.240
for example, letting users
specify notification and email

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.880
preferences in the same
place in your app--

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.720
you can have a link back
to your app settings.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.940
And that's an overview of
the new importance model.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.710
Next, I'll turn
it over to Justin

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.557
to talk about other
new things for O.

00:17:24.557 --> 00:17:27.619
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.200
JUSTIN BARBER: Thanks, Rachel.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.160
I'm Justin Barber, and I'm a
visual designer on Android.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.990
And I have to start with an
apology, because many of you

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.820
probably showed up for
this session hoping

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.672
for a Justin Bieber concert.

00:17:43.672 --> 00:17:45.130
And it's not
happening, but I still

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.910
have some pretty interesting
stuff to talk about.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.210
So visual hierarchy
is the focus of O.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.070
And if you remember
last year in N,

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.070
we completely redesigned
notification templates

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.820
to become more flexible,
modern, much cleaner.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.830
And the new features in
O that I'll be covering

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.420
were really built
on the foundation

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.360
that we set in N. And also
on Julie's amazing research.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.090
So that's where I'll start,
with the research insights that

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.830
really led to our approach in O.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.490
So the first insight
was that people

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.080
are overloaded
with notifications,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.180
and it's hard to find
the important ones.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.329
I'm pretty sure we've
all been here before.

00:18:23.329 --> 00:18:24.870
And in Julie's
research, we uncovered

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.810
that users were
building associations

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.760
to determine what was
important for them.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.520
So if the phone made a
certain vibration tone,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.590
or they saw a certain
color of light blinking,

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.505
or they'd see a color
in their notification--

00:18:36.505 --> 00:18:38.880
they were making associations
to determine whether or not

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.390
this was important enough
for them to spend time on.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.600
But that can be frustrating,
misleading, and above all,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.150
time consuming.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.180
So our goal for O was
to present notifications

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.850
in a way that helps users
sift through the noise.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.680
Not just to build
more associations,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.967
but to build a
consistency and a trust.

00:18:57.967 --> 00:19:00.300
You should know where the
important stuff's going to be,

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.620
before you have to
go looking for it.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.460
The second most
important insight

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.410
that led to our
approach was that people

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.780
are the VIP notifications.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.130
In absolutely all scenarios,
who is more important than what

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.390
or when.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.270
So the opportunity
here is pretty simple,

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:20.537
make people notifications
VIPs of the drawer.

00:19:20.537 --> 00:19:22.620
People matter the most and
notifications is really

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.036
a communications
hub, so we really

00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:27.970
want to emphasize
that in this space.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.770
So as I mentioned
before, N focused

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.230
on individual
notification templates.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.030
And in O, we've zoomed
out to kind of see

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.220
the bigger picture and
how they all fit together

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.330
in one experience,
specifically by improving

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.960
the hierarchy of notifications
that appear in the drawer.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.510
We did this by designating
four different types

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.370
of notifications and
four different buckets

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.650
for them, represented
by these yellow blocks.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.990
Before I get into the detail
of each different bucket,

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.190
I'll give you the
high level overview.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.895
So the first bucket
is for major ongoing.

00:19:57.895 --> 00:20:00.100
This is things
like a phone call.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.020
The next is people to people,
like a message from a friend.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.880
The third is general
notifications,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.580
the best of which
are timely reminders.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.340
And the fourth are
By The Way, or BTW.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.710
These are the four buckets
and notification types,

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.080
and how they're organized
within the drawer.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.230
And the purpose of
this is to ensure

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.520
that notifications most critical
to read first are shown first.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.930
It also creates consistency.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.900
When you pull down the drawer to
find that specific notification

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.490
you're looking
for, you'll already

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.160
know which area to be looking at
because you'll become familiar

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.310
with these sections.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.380
So we're enabling users
to build associations

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.706
through this ordering.

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:41.830
And lastly, we're going to
be ranking notifications

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:43.150
within each section.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.344
This means if you have
two message notifications,

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:47.260
they're not going to be
separated by something

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.340
else in the middle.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.960
They'll always appear
together, so it

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.400
will be a lot easier to scan
the notification drawer.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.480
So now you have a big
picture, let's drill down

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.630
into the details of each bucket,
starting with the first one.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.920
Major ongoing notifications
are really for time

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.460
sensitive content users
should actively be aware of.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.180
This is like a phone call,
driving directions, timer,

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.512
music.

00:21:13.512 --> 00:21:15.720
And as the developers send
this type of notification,

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.810
you need to be
running a foreground

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.580
service with importance
higher than MIN,

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.260
or using a MediaStyle
with MediaSession

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.910
for music notification.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.880
And this type of
content is for content

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.510
that's using device resources
that directly impacts real life

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.500
context.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.440
And the things that match that
is a really, really short list.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.150
The type of
notification will rarely

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.080
be appearing in
the user's drawer,

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.810
because the context
that requires

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.600
it is a very rare situation.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.300
So in N, this is kind of what
these types of notification

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.110
looks like, right?

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.300
They're not very visually
distinguished, they

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.674
don't necessarily always appear
at the top of the drawer,

00:21:49.674 --> 00:21:51.800
they can be lost amidst
the other notifications.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.950
And if you wanted
the proper prominence

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.460
to really gain that
association for the user,

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.000
you had to go with
customization,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.600
which led to inconsistency with
the rest of the notifications.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.054
So in O, what we're
doing is we're

00:22:07.054 --> 00:22:09.470
pulling that color from the
app and filling the background

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.455
with it, and guaranteeing a
top spot in the notification

00:22:12.455 --> 00:22:13.790
drawer.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.280
So these will always
appear at the very top.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.470
But again, because
they're so prominent,

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.780
misusing this type of
notification for something

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.360
it's not meant for will
be very obvious to users.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.570
And with the channels that
Rachel just described,

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.270
it'll be really easy for them to
block this type of notification

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.519
if it doesn't align with
what it's really meant to be.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.010
Falling into this
category is also music.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.532
So in N, you can see that
the media template is

00:22:40.532 --> 00:22:41.990
the most different
template that we

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.970
have compared to all
the others, but it still

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:44.990
feels really generic.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.489
And it doesn't
really look different

00:22:46.489 --> 00:22:47.900
from other notifications.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.840
So in O, we've integrated
the album artwork

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.570
into the notification, and drawn
out the most prominent colors

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.850
for the background
and as an accent.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.640
The result is a beautiful,
lively notification

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.290
that really
celebrates the artwork

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.870
and the artists behind the
music that we really love.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.162
And I found myself pulling
down the notification drawer

00:23:05.162 --> 00:23:06.953
as I listen to music,
just to see what kind

00:23:06.953 --> 00:23:08.360
of colors that song generates.

00:23:10.926 --> 00:23:12.050
Now, for the next section--

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:12.770
people to people.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.560
This is really for
content from a person,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.930
like a message or a missed call.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.590
And as Julie mentioned, people
are the VIP notifications.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.170
So we're going to put them
right at the top of the drawer

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.900
in the number one position,
since major ongoing's going

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.590
to be pretty rare.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.370
To get this type
of notification,

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.370
you should be using
MessagingStyle

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:38.700
with direct reply or
attaching a contact to it.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.650
So as it stands today,
a message notification

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.215
is really not that valuable
until you interact with it.

00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:45.840
There's, like, one
line of the message,

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.745
so you don't know if it's worth
actually expanding and reading.

00:23:48.745 --> 00:23:50.620
And then, you still have
to make the decision

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.930
if you should reply to it.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.620
And you may not be able
to reply to it directly

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.869
within the drawer, you have
to jump out of the drawer.

00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:59.280
So it's really just
not that valuable.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.460
So in O, we've made one
really subtle change

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.130
that has actually made a really
big impact on the messaging

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.000
experience.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.379
And that is that we're
exposing more lines of content

00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:10.170
in the collapsed state
of the notification.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.840
So now, you can read up to
three lines of the message

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.020
without having to spend the
time expanding the notification

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.300
and deciding what you
want to do with it.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.600
And we're continuing to invest
heavily in this area of focus.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.520
And we're looking forward to
making even more improvements,

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.560
especially around direct
reply, coming soon.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.194
This next bucket is for
general notifications.

00:24:32.194 --> 00:24:34.360
And the best of which-- as
we documented in material

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.760
guidelines, and Julie's
research backs up--

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.410
is really meant for well-timed
and informative task reminders.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.090
And in O, there's no
behavior or visual change

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.820
in the representation
of these notifications.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.910
But it does play into
the next bucket of BTW.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.770
And today, there are
a lot of notifications

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.500
being sent into this
general bucket that really

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:58.470
should be sent in O as a BTW.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.000
BTWs, By The Way
notifications, are

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.600
meant for contextual or
informative, but non-urgent,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.230
content.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.188
We heard a lot of stories
from Julie's research

00:25:06.188 --> 00:25:08.010
about how people
felt so overwhelmed.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.130
If content in the
drawer isn't urgent,

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.320
it should be sent as a BTW.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.510
Things like weather
updates or traffic,

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.086
or suggestions and promotions.

00:25:18.086 --> 00:25:19.710
So earlier in this
presentation, Rachel

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.890
used Crane Air as an example
of how to organize your apps'

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.810
notifications into channels.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.360
I remember there are
three different channels--

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.030
Executive Program,
Flight Updates,

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.200
and Discounts and Deals.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.570
And that last category
of Discounts and Deals

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.400
is an excellent
example of what should

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.552
be sent as a BTW notification.

00:25:39.552 --> 00:25:41.010
And it's pretty
simple to send one,

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.301
you just need to set the
importance of the notification

00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:45.500
to MIN.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.770
So in N, the visual
representation

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.810
of these notifications
is pretty equal with all

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.100
the other notifications.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.933
The only difference was
a slightly different

00:25:53.933 --> 00:25:54.830
colored background.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.190
It's a pretty heavyweight
presentation for content that's

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.360
actually very lightweight.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.540
That's bothersome to users,
it takes up a lot of space.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.150
So what we've done in O
is we've taken the app

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.790
name and the first line
of the notification,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.450
and simplified that
down into a single line.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.160
So the new
presentation is really

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.020
meant to feel
lightweight so that users

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.670
don't feel bothered by them.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.340
They don't need to manage them,
because they're out of the way.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.840
And it's OK if they
can glance at it

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.270
and don't want to take
action on it right now.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.430
You can also set your
notification to automatically

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.670
expire so that users also don't
have that burden of having

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.280
to manage them, as well.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.480
The advantage of
this is that instead

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.640
of risking annoying
your users by sending

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.380
a notification in
that general bucket,

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.256
you can send it
as a BTW instead.

00:26:39.256 --> 00:26:40.880
This way, you don't
have to hurt users'

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.440
trust by risking something.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.770
You can just put it
in the BTW section.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.190
Also, the full
functionality still remains.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.090
So if the user taps
on this BTW, it

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.030
expands the full notification,
you get all the color.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.100
And if the notification
has actions with it,

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.820
those will appear as well.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.080
So when you put it
all together, it

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.610
comes together really nicely.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.480
You can actually tell a
very intentional order

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.800
within the drawer.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.740
And when we compare
that with N, that's

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.580
when you can really see
the differences come out.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.470
If you squint your
eyes and look at N,

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.630
which is on the left in
the black phone frame,

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.210
you can't really tell which
notification is which,

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:21.900
at a glance.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.180
But if you look at
O, it's really clear.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.522
You can see the major
ongoing at the top,

00:27:26.522 --> 00:27:27.980
you can see the
BTWs at the bottom.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.170
You can even kind of tell that
it's a message notification,

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:34.270
because it's taller
than the rest.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.490
You can also see in
N how when there's

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.340
an overflow of notifications,
those notifications

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.040
got stacked behind the
ones that were visible.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.500
This doesn't match up super
well with the spatial model

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.710
of the full width notifications.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:48.730
So in O, we've improved
that spatial model

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.000
and made it feel
much more unified.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.680
A really beautiful animation,
and the point of this,

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.590
is to correlate the
notifications of icons

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.840
of how they appear
in the status bar,

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.210
with the notifications that
they are in the drawer.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:04.770
And again--

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.800
Yeah, you can clap.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.254
Pretty cool, right?

00:28:08.254 --> 00:28:11.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.770
This is something we're
really, really proud of.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.800
And again, it wouldn't
have been possible

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.530
without those template changes
that we made in N, right?

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.590
So we're taking steps to
unify the whole experience.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.990
You can also see how instead
of stacking at the bottom,

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.510
overflow notifications
fit into a shelf.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.540
And we have a really
beautiful experience going on.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.040
I'll just let it
play one more time.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.535
Oof.

00:28:35.535 --> 00:28:37.152
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.910
All right, so this
is the last feature

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.100
I'll be covering pretty briefly.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.210
And that's snoozing.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:47.126
And this feature came
directly out of user research.

00:28:47.126 --> 00:28:49.120
So the insight was that
people need to remember

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.760
the things they need to do.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.090
And today, you only
have two options

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.780
if you can't deal with a
notification right now.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:58.000
You can either dismiss
the notification

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.490
and count on your memory--

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.950
which if you're me, never
works, ask my wife--

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.300
or, you can leave the
notification in the shade.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.100
But it can get lost amidst a ton
of other notifications, right?

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.850
It's either, or.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.910
So our opportunity was
to give users more ways

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.470
to do this in the drawer.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.850
So let's say you're
in a meeting,

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.880
and you get a text from a
friend asking you about dinner.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.520
Now, you're in the meeting,
so you can't reply right away.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.470
But you know as soon as
you leave the meeting,

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.170
your mind's already going
to be on to the next task,

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.420
and you're not going
to remember to reply.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.080
So instead of letting
the notification linger

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.250
in the drawer or just
dismissing it altogether,

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.050
you can snooze it.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.520
And this is how.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.110
You can do a
partial swipe, which

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.560
reveals two different icons.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.280
You'll notice it's an
additional icon to the gear

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.940
that we introduced in N. And
this is the button for snooze.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.970
So if you tap this
icon, the notification

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.576
will automatically be snoozed.

00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:56.450
And you'll get a
confirmation of this snooze,

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.796
with an option to undo
it if you need to.

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:00.170
So snoozing the
notification will

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.804
set it to come back
at that set duration,

00:30:02.804 --> 00:30:04.970
with the exact same
interruptive qualities that it's

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.960
sent with as before.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.797
So if it made a vibration tone
when it came in the first time,

00:30:10.797 --> 00:30:13.130
and you snooze it, it will
vibrate again the second time

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.110
when it comes back.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.500
So if you want a different
time than one hour,

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.790
you can just tap that arrow.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.380
And you'll get a few
different options

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.150
to change that duration.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.240
And the option that
you select then

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.020
will then be set as
the default duration

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.480
the next time you
snooze a notification.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.156
Pretty simple.

00:30:32.156 --> 00:30:34.780
That's what we have to show you
for the new notifications in O.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.404
And if you're interested
in finding out

00:30:36.404 --> 00:30:38.680
even more, especially from
a more detailed engineering

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.510
perspective, there's
an earlier talk--

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.130
What's New in
Notifications, Launcher

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:47.145
Icons, and Shortcuts-- that
we'd encourage you to check out.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:49.020
We're really excited
about these improvements

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.160
and believe that
these features are not

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.784
only beneficial to
users, but will also

00:30:51.784 --> 00:30:53.550
increase the quality
of engagement

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.239
through apps Thanks so much.

00:30:55.239 --> 00:30:57.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:02.004
