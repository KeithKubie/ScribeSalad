00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.480
&gt;&gt; David S. Mao: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.880
My name is David Mao and I
have the honor of serving

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.940 position:56%
as the deputy librarian of
Congress and it is my great pleasure

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.510
to welcome all of you to the 16th--
2016 16th National Book Festival

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.670
and of course to the
History and Biography Stage,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.180
which is generously
sponsored by Wells Fargo.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.450
We, at the Library of
Congress, are extremely thrilled

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.930
to be presenting the National
Book Festival for the 16th time.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.410
This terrific event would not
be possible without the friends

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.950
that we have, supporting
us, generously supporting

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.900
like Wells Fargo and we are
very appreciative of that.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.450
But more important, we would not
be here but for readers like all

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.240 position:56%
of you, who support the authors, are
interested in them and really come

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.240
out in Droves and so
we're extremely excited.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.820
Thank you very much
for being here today.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.510
OK, thank you.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.030
[ Applause ]

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.090
This year's festival is
inspired by journeys and the idea

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.130
that a book is a voyage unto
itself, taking us to places

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.400
that we might not be
able to see in person,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.100
but we can visit by
reading about it.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.570
And it gives us the opportunity
to better understand our world

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.530
and in particular why
we are here today,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.970
celebrating histories
and biographies.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.270
So reading, to us, is
an ideal form of travel

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.720
and it's really the best
way for us to develop

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.690
and encourage and grow our minds.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.270
In addition to the author
presentations that we have here

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.330
on this stage for you today,
we have lots of other events.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.390 position:56%
I hope you will take the
opportunity to visit the lower level

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.110
of the convention center, where
we have lots of family activities.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.480
We have booths for our
sponsors, AARP, Wells Fargo.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.640 position:56%
We also have the Library of Congress
Pavilion, where I encourage you

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.020
to visit us and learn more
about your national library,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.790 position:56%
learn all about the wonderful things
that we are doing at the Library

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.950
of Congress to make our treasures
available to you, whether you come

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.430
and visit us in person
or visit us online.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.770
So, we have a great lineup.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.260
I don't want to take
up too much time.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.910
And so, I hope you will
welcome our first presenter,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.250
who will kick things off
for us, Mr. Carlos Lozada,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.550
who is the associate editor

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.160
and nonfiction book critic
for The Washington Post.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.030
I invite him to come up and
introduce our first speaker.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.510
Thank you very much
and enjoy your day.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:50.760
[ Applause ]

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.060
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Good afternoon.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.010
Welcome to the 2016
National Book Festival.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.350
As David mentioned, my
name is Carlos Lozada.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.920
I review nonfiction for
The Washington Post,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.130
which is a charter
sponsor of the festival.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.940
Thanks again to the
Library of Congress,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.200
which has hosted the
festival since--

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.090
for 16 years, as well as festival
Cochairman David Rubenstein

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.120
and the many sponsors that
make the event possible.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.960
I've never met Sarah Vowell
personally until right now,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.490
but maybe, like a lot of you, I
feel like I've known her forever.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.430 position:56%
Whether through her work on "This
American Life", her delightful books

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.180
and to the side alleys of
American history and in the role

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.270
that most excites my moody
six-year-old daughter as the voice

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.550
and soul of Violet
from "The Incredibles",

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.120
Sarah can basically do anything and
make it seem effortless and funny

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.550
and profound all at once.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.940
And if you've not read her
obituaries of John Ritter

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.370
and Tom Landry, you
really-- you're missing out.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.070
But we're here to talk
about her books.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.110
She's written the history
of Hawaii, of the Puritans,

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.150
of presidential assassination
sites, and most recently,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.040
a book on revolutionary BFF,
the Marquis de Lafayette

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.810
in her 2015 book, "Lafayette
in the Somewhat United States".

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.190
There will be time for
questions after Sarah speaks,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.210
and Seaspan is covering the
history and biography sessions,

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.350
so be on your best behavior.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.670
Sarah will be signing books
at 1:30, so please get one.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.510
It is my huge fanboy pleasure
to introduce Sarah Vowell.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:40.580
[ Applause ]

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.750
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Hello, hello
book lovers, people of Seaspan.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.880
I realized recently that I
travel around the country so much

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.650
and I only, I only meet
people who read books.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.000
And I don't know if you've watched
the news, like the last year or so,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.050
but I would like to say
that I'm cool with that.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.090
[ Laughter ]

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.050
But I-- Thank you.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.080
[ Applause ]

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.850
That I like my little
vision of America

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.980
that I get from meeting all of you.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.070
So, I'm feeling very
contemplative today.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.520
If you're watching
this on television,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.200
we are here in Washington,
DC, and for me,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.570
I arrived in this city precisely
half my life ago, 23 years ago.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.770
I'll wait for a second
for you to do the math.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.010 position:56%
I know that's not your strong suit--

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.310
[ Laughter ]

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.400
-- or mine.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.210
You have other nice qualities.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.440
So, 23 years ago, I arrived in
this city on a train from Montana.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.430
My parents drove me up to Shelby,
Montana, where I caught the Amtrak.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.740
I took it across North Dakota,
that took a while, changed trains

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.430
in Chicago, saw the buildings of
Louis Sullivan, thought I want

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.100
to live here someday,
I ended up doing that,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.030
went across Pennsylvania,
I remember the conductor,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.070
we were passing the
Susquehanna River and he said,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.730
"Get a load of this
scenic wonderland."

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:26.230
And I arrived here in DC for
my Smithsonian internship

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.130
and I think it was the next day
Yasser Arafat shook Rabin's hand

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.430
on the White House lawn.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.050
It was a hopeful time in America.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.470
The Library of Congress is
sponsoring this event, you know.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.580
When I was on the internet in
the Smithsonian, the first works

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.130
that I worked on that
had the ISBN number,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.850
the Library of Congress catalog
number were finding aids to things

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:59.590
like art in Philadelphia on the
archives of American art or--

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.460
yeah, that was the main one,
Italian-American art history.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.430
So, I was saying earlier
that for me, as an author,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.270
every time I get one of my books,

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.250
when it comes in the mail the first
time, the first thing I do is look

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.200
at that catalog number because,
as we all know, life is short

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.510
and the Library of
Congress is forever.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.570
[ Applause ]

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.010
So, take that, Great Britain.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.310
[ Laughter ]

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.060 position:56%
But anyway, being here, you know,
thinking about when I was, you know,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.140
a young pup leaving home to come
here, I realized that is the story

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.980
that I've been writing
years through seven books.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.350
It's always the story of
the misfit leaving home

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.810
and that is the story
of our country.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.520
I think earlier this year in
this city, T Bone Burnett said,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.360
"This is the story of the United
States, a kid walks away from home

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.750
with a song and nothing else
and conquers the world."

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.440
So, for me, that is always
the story I'm writing,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.120
whether it's Theodore
Roosevelt leaving New York City

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.930
to mourn his wife and mother
and head out to North Dakota

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.650
to be cowman and, you know, as--
one of his biographers said,

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.730
"He was the only president who
ever read 'Anna Karenina' while

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.390
on a three-day search
for cattle thieves."

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.760
[ Laughter ]

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.550
Or our friend, Abraham Lincoln,
who when he left Springfield

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.850
to come here as president and
took the train of Philadelphia

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.050
to Independence Hall and
he, you know, he said that,

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.050
"The political sentiments
I entertain have been drawn

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.420
from the sentiments which were
given to the world from this hall."

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.490
And he said that the goal
of his presidency was

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.660
to save the country invented
there and he added ominously,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:59.170
"I would rather be assassinated
on this spot that surrender it."

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.420
Obviously, the person who did
assassinate him is another misfit

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.510
who left home, from
Baltimore, you know.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.300
[ Laughter ]

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.500
And then I've written about, you
know, New England missionaries

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:21.350 position:56%
who come to Hawaii like many churchy
folk of the early 19th century

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.410
who saw the new maps from
expeditions like that

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:30.500
of Captain Cook's and resolved to
spread the gospel to all the places

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.470
where Cook's sailors
had spread the clap.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.920
[ Laughter ]

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.280
Or to their forebears,
the New England Puritans,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.140
such as the Massachusetts Bay
colonists who, unlike those hippies

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.230
from Plymouth, were trying to
convince the English government

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.780
that they were not separating from
English and that they were going

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.650
to America where they would
remain as English as beheadings

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:03.230
and clouded cream, and even wrote a
letter to Charles I in 1630 called

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.840
"A humble request" in which
they said they just wanted

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.310
to remind the king that we shall be

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.770
in our poor cottages
in the wilderness.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:20.640
Whereas, in private, John Winthrop,
their leader, would tell them,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.940
"We're the opposite, we shall
be as a city upon a hill."

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.010
So, misfits leaving home, my latest
misfit leaving home is a French

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:37.140
teenager, Marquis de Lafayette
and this book tells the story

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.090 position:56%
of him leaving home and his pregnant
teenage wife to come to America

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.240
to throw in with George
Washington's continental army.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.600 position:56%
And so, I'll read for a bit and then
I'll take questions and I wanted

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.790
to read this section of when he
comes of his voyage to America

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.930
and his early time and then
I'll read a little tangent

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:05.030
about a heroic bookseller to pander
to the subject of the proceedings.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.040
[ Laughter ]

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.170
So, it's 1777, Lafayette
has absconded to America,

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.360
he's bought his own ship to come
here, the king of France is trying

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.620
to keep him at home, his wife's
family is trying to keep him

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.390
at home, because as I
mentioned, she is pregnant.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.810
And once he makes it onto
the ship he has purchased

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.190
across the Atlantic, he
starts sending his wife--

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:35.570
he starts writing his wife,
Adrienne, these letters to try

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:42.260
to explain why he has abandoned
her and their forthcoming child.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.700
I believe I say in that book
that while history might be full

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:51.510
of great fathers, recorded
history is not where to find them.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.100
[ Laughter ]

00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.070 position:56%
At sea, Lafayette unveiled the
grandeur of his mission to his wife,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.000
Adrienne, and attempted
to include her in it.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.970
He wrote, "I hope that
as a favor to me,

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.890
you will become a good American."

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.760
She is a teenage French
aristocrat from one

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.910
of the most illustrious families
in France, she lives in a mansion

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.230
in Paris when she isn't living
at their mansion in Versailles.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.280
So, asking her to become a good
American is sort of baffling.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.150
Also, he really wasn't in a
position to ask her any favors.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.910
Nevertheless, he proclaimed
to his wife the welfare

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:38.020
of America is intimately bound up
with the happiness of humanity.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:43.680
She is going to become a deserving
and sure refuge of virtue,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.460
of honesty, of tolerance, of
equality and of a tranquil liberty.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.260
Now to establish such a
forthright dreamland of decency,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.380 position:56%
who wouldn't sign up to shoot at a
few thousand Englishmen just as long

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.970
as Mr. Bean wasn't one of them?

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.750
Alas, from my end of history,
from our end of history,

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.700
there's a big file
cabinet blocking the view

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.750
of the sweet-natured
republic Lafayette foretold,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:18.420 position:56%
and it is where the government keeps
the folders full of Indian treaties,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.590
the Chinese Exclusion Act

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.630
and NSA-monitored electronic
messages pertinent

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.270
to National Security, which
is apparently all of them,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.490
including the one in which I
asked my mom for advice on how

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.460
to get a red Sharpie stain
out of couch upholstery.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.380
Lafayette confided in his
wife, "In coming as a friend

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.850
to offer my services to
this intriguing republic,

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.240
I bring to it only my
frankness and my good will,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.120
no ambition, no self-interest.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.120
In working for my glory, I
work for their happiness."

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.280
Disregarding the inherent
contradictions

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.840
of proclaiming his lack of
ambition and self-interest

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.910
in the same sentence, he revealed

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.550
that attaining glory was
one of his two stated goals.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.210
He was an only child.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.400
[ Laughter ]

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.790
The phrase "coming as a
friend" glows on the page

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:18.680
because it turned out
to be the truth.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.880
It's appropriate to ding
Lafayette for the casual cruelty

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.090
with which he abandoned his
family, rolled the eyes a bit

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:30.410
at his retro quest for fame or
envy his outlandish optimism.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.430
But none of that negates
the fact that he turned

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.480
out to be the best
friend America ever had.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.590
And I'm not only referring to his
youthful daring due on battlefields

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.630
up and down the eastern seaboard,
I'm also referring to any number

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.570
of his dull, grownup
kindnesses later on,

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.350 position:56%
such as assisting Thomas Jefferson,
the United States Minister to France

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.920
in the 1780s in opening up
French markets to American goods.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.770
Lafayette's lobbying procured
Nantucket whalers the contract the

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.610
whale oil that lit the
streetlights of Paris.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.790
Because of Lafayette,
the City of Lights glowed

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.140
by New England's boiled blubber
and to say thanks for getting--

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.080
and to say thanks for
getting them the gig,

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.690
all Nantucket rallied its milk cows

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.510
to send him a giant
wheel of cheese--

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:25.040
[ Laughter ]

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.510
-- as gratitude.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.450
[ Laughter ]

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.510
That's so American, "Let's
send cheese to France, OK."

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.170
[ Laughter ]

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.320
So finally after his two-month
voyage on his ship, the Victory,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:50.090
which he called, you know, floating
on this dreary plane, they-- he--

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:55.700
they came ashore in Charleston
around midnight on June 13th, 1777,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.730
waking up the household that
made your Benjamin Huger

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.120
of the South Carolina militia.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.860
And that's where they stayed
and Lafayette wrote later,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.000
"I retired to rest that
night, rejoicing that I had

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.390
at last attained the
haven of my dreams."

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.320
He went on to gush, "The
next morning was beautiful.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.240
Everything around me was new to me.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.640
The room, the bed draped in
delicate mosquito curtains,

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.890
the black servants who came to
me quietly to ask my commands,

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.840
the strange new beauty of the
landscape outside my windows,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.000
the luxuriant vegetation,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.270
all combined to produce
a magical effect."

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.940
In other words, it was a buggy
swamp, chock-full of slaves,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.550
but Lafayette was in love.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.250 position:56%
So, he and his men, they basically--
they started out in carriages

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.680
and then in the back of horses,
and by the end, they're basically

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.950
like walking to Philadelphia,
where he's going

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.770
to what became Independence
Hall and, you know,

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.120
to announce, "Here I am."

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:10.790
And, you know, he expected
a warm welcome.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:19.610 position:56%
The moment, Lafayette recalled, was
peculiarly unfavorable to strangers.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.420
I don't relate to that at all.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.730
The Americans were displeased
with the pretensions and disgusted

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.300
with the conduct of many Frenchmen.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.890
Consequently, he wrote, "The
Congress finally adapted the plan

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.510
of not listening to any stranger."

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.960
So when Lafayette and his
friends called at the state house,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.040
then the moniker of Independence
Hall Congressman James Level

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.170
of Massachusetts shooed
them away, snarling,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.500
"It seems that French
officers have a great fancy

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.910
to enter our service
without being invited."

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.490
But most of them, including
Lafayette, had been invited

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.550
by American agents in France, hence
the strongest of irks in Frenchmen

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.740
who had been washing
ashore for months,

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.320
expecting to be welcomed
with rank and riches.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.310
So, also, I should
mention at this moment,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.800
Europe is uncharacteristically
at peace,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.100
and so all of these European
officers, especially Frenchmen,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.850
come over in Droves, wanting a job.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:25.200
And Washington, who was always
in need of men, wasn't excited

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.050
about these particular men

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:32.120
because he said they have no
attachment nor ties to the country

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.230
and he bemoaned their ignorance
of our language and he pointed

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.690
out that American officers
would be disgusted

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.740
if foreigners were
put over their heads.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.340
And so that's exactly what happened
right before Lafayette arrived,

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.080
this other French guy, his
name was Philippe du Coudray

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.740
and he was a French veteran of
the seven years war and he showed

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:57.730
up in Philadelphia a month before
Lafayette did, saying, "Here I am.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:01.420
I'm, you know, a big wig
at," I'm paraphrasing,

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.030
"a big wig at the 16th court

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:10.260
and I'm the greatest renowned
authority on artillery in France."

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.290
And what he was, was
a wine merchant's son

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:20.610
who had maybe seen a few cannons
and-- but he shows up and he says,

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:23.500
"I deserve to be your
artillery chief."

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.710 position:56%
And so, it turns out that replacing
the continental army's beloved chief

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:32.830
artillery officer, Henry Knox,
was not as easy and arbitrary

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.120
as bewitched casting a [inaudible]

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.790
because Henry Knox
was the revolution.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.910
Born in Boston in 1759,
the Irish immigrants,

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.100
Knox dropped out of school to
support his mother and siblings

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.510
after his father's death,
apprenticing at a bookbinder

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:57.410
and he eventually opened his own
bookstore, the London Bookstore.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:03.840
And after the Coercive Acts
of 1774, this was really hard

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.300
on pretty much all of the colonists
but especially its merchants

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.450 position:56%
and especially Knox as a bookseller.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.890
They had closed the port
and he couldn't get any

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.320
of the books he was selling
from England and, you know,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.810
the colonists were boycotting
stuff from England anyway.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:27.710
So those acts, the intolerable
acts, they were supposed to serve

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.880
as a warning to all the
other colonies and meant

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.940
to slap Massachusetts
into submission,

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:38.080
but what happened was it further
radicalized an already radical

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.260
Massachusetts and rallied
the other colonies to come

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.570
to its material and political aid.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:51.090 position:56%
So Henry Knox, meanwhile, he had
wooed the royal governor's daughter,

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:57.620
Lucy Flucker, great name, and
he had joined a local militia,

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.330
the Boston grenadiers
and then shots were fired

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.390
in Lexington and Concord in 1775.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.920
So Knox leaves his, you know,
failing bookstore in the hands

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.510
of his brother, throws
in with the militias.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.980 position:56%
And then when Washington is
appointed the new commander-in-chief

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.980
of the continental army and
he shows up and he, you know,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.320
he's telling the soldiers,

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.220
"We should have no more sectional
rivalries, we're all one country,"

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.080
when privately, you know,
he's writing to his crony back

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.840
in Virginia, "These
people are stupid,

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.940
especially the Massachusetts men.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.160
You know, it's still
a work in progress."

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.830
But then-- And at that time, you
know, Boston was under siege.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.920
The British had occupied
the peninsula of Boston

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.320
and their navy controlled
the harbor,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.070
and they were just
resupplying the cities

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.430
with provisions shipped
down from Canada.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.680
These are-- This is me-- These are
the maps I'm drawing in my mind.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.950
I just assume you can see them.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:07.420
So the patriots-- but the patriots
had them surrounded but they--

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.800
to break this stalemate,
they needed weapons.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.430
And then they got the good
news that Ethan Allen Clark

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.710 position:56%
and Benedict Arnold and their people
had captured Fort Ticonderoga,

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.950
where there were all these
artillery, cannons and mortars

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.550
and howitzers, you
know, 300 miles away.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.130
And Henry Knox, the
bookseller, you know,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.770
he's like 26 I think at this point.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.600
He goes up to Washington and says,

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:40.990
"How about I go get all them
weapons and-- 300 miles away?"

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.720
And Washington's like, "Yeah, sure.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.440
Go ahead, bookstore owner."

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.950
And--

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.160
[ Laughter ]

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.110
And he did it.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:57.880
He and his brother, Henry Knox and
his brother set off for New York

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.710
in November, I think it was.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:05.140 position:56%
And then by January, they had
returned with 43 cannons, 14 mortars

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.420
and two howitzers dragged
across frozen rivers

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.950
and over the snowy Berkshire
Mountains by oxen on custom sleds.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:16.360
Now this is the derivation
of that old Yankee proverb

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.570
that if you can sell a
book, you can move 60 tons

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.420
of weaponry 300 miles in winter.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:28.880
And then, you know, Washington,
like has all these artillery moved

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.020 position:56%
up on the hill of Dorchester
Heights and then the British wake up

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.280
and see all these cannons
pointing down at them

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.760
and they promptly hightail
it to Canada.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:45.240
And that's how Henry Knox became
the chief artillery officer

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.470
of the continental army.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.060
He got the actual cannons.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.020
He actually got the artillery
and then he had trained

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.310
and recruited all the
other artillery officers.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:04.060
So, everybody liked him and thought
he was doing a pretty good job.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.380
And so when this French
guy shows up and says,

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:11.140
"I'm your new artillery
chief," there is a big flip

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.720
out amongst the men in--
officers of the continental army

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.050
and so that's sort of the, you
know, that's the environment

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.510
that Lafayette walked into.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.560
Luckily, the French guy
had the decency to--

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.070
he and his horse were
crossing the Delaware River

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.300
and he drowned, the horse lived.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.300
So, everything was fine and
then it's a win-win, you know.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:45.560
So that's what Lafayette
walked into.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.940
The thing is, the reason
that the colonists,

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.070
especially their leadership,
the Congress and Washington

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.420
and his highest ranking officers
are in this weird position

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.550 position:56%
with the French and all of these
French noblemen, Lafayette included,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:02.630
is all they want to do, you
know, because they're basically--

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.360
they just want what any
self-respecting terrorist wants,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.310
they want to become a
state-sponsored terrorist

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:13.500
and they're just waiting for the
king of France to give them money

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.740
and guns and support in
his army and his navy

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.310
and that's how they won
the war, eventually.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:25.390
So they take Lafayette on because
Ben Franklin sends this letter,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.560
you know, like this--
again, I'm paraphrasing,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.890
"This kid is a really
big deal, be nice to him,

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.270
I haven't finished shaking
down the French government."

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:41.560
And so they make Lafayette a major
general, that's what he was called.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:47.460
He's basically a glorified
intern until he proves himself.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.250
And then, you know, so he gets--
finally, he gets his commission

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.180
and then a few days later,
he meets George Washington

00:25:53.180 --> 00:26:00.570 position:56%
and [noise] you know, Washington
was, you know, 6 foot 4 inches tall,

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:05.930
and he historically makes a
big impression on Lafayette,

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.730
Lafayette was so star-struck
when he meets Washington.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.290
He wrote, "It was impossible
to mistake

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:17.320
for a moment his majestic
figure and deportment,

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.540
nor was he less distinguished by
the noble affability of his manner,

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.990
which is a sweet memory but it does
get on my nerves how easy it is

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.510
for tall people to make
a good first impression."

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.600
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.640
Unfortunately, because
of a scheduling mishap,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.250 position:56%
we can't be at Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's
presentation next door.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.070
I'm just going to go
out on a limb and say,

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:46.510
"Everybody loves Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar."

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.970
[ Laughter ]

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.920
I do love Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.700
So anyway, he joins that.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.750
And Washington, he slowly,
you know, grows on Washington

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.530
because he's just so gung-ho.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:06.950
Washington, all-- the whole war,
all his men are deserting in Droves

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.410 position:56%
and here's this kid, this French kid
who's just the whole war is like,

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.860
"Put me in, coach."

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.230
And--

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.290
[ Laughter ]

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.840
And when Washington,
you know, says, "OK,

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.120
you can join my military family,"
which was lingo of the day

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.960
to basically Washington is
saying, "OK, you can become one

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:31.450 position:56%
of my minions," you know, like the
way Alexander Hamilton was described

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.920
as a member of Washington's
military family.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.470
But remember, Lafayette is an--

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:44.250 position:56%
he was an orphan and when Washington
said family, he meant minion

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:48.830
but what Lafayette heard was son.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:52.510
Then, you know, high jinks ensue.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.660
[ Laughter ]

00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:00.530
So I guess I will take some
questions if you have them.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:04.460
There are these microphones
set up here.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.510
Yeah, let's get cracking.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:12.510
[ Laughter ]

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hi.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.750
I was wondering when I read the
book, if you'd seen the show

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.480
"Hamilton" and what you thought
about the portrayal of Lafayette.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: If
you didn't hear that,

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.510
the question was about Hamilton.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:29.100
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.470 position:56%
Have I seen Hamilton and what do I
think of the portrayal of Lafayette.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:39.360
I've seen Hamilton, I obviously
love Hamilton, even though there's

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.590
so much Hamilton and Hamilton.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:45.710
Obviously, the-- you know
who would love the Lafayette

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:52.380
in Hamilton is Lafayette, who
was just a publicity whore and,

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.110
you know, the fact that
he is, you know, so--

00:28:55.110 --> 00:29:01.100 position:56%
comes often so charming and
chivalrous and is such a good dancer

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.250
with such wonderful hair.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.790
Lafayette was already
going bald at 19.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:13.380
You know, there-- the last time
I saw it, there was an empty seat

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.620
in front of me and for some reason,
I just kept picturing Lafayette

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:22.890 position:56%
in it and he-- you know, he was just
have been swooning the whole time.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.740
It is interesting though like
one thing about that show,

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.390
especially because of
the casting and the--

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.600
this wasn't in one of your
question but I have been thinking

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.400
about it later-- lately
because people have some qualms

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.700
about the founding fathers,

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.980
especially the ones
who owned other people.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:47.580
And there are some people
lately who want to disregard all

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.180
of their accomplishments
and I can understand that.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.530
Well, one way you get past
that is make Washington black,

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.510
which I'm definitely
doing next time.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.230
[ Laughter ]

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.780
It's such a good idea.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.460
We should have done that.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.040
That should have been
our original casting,

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.300
Washington should have been black.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.600
Yes.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.610
In today's, I guess the
mass recording that goes on,

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.930
everybody's lives is so
archived, how do you think

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:24.050
that will affect our look at
today's events as a historian,

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.350
how do you think that will change?

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Everybody's
lives today are so archived?

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right, just with
like television, social media,

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:37.860
everything is out there and like
very intimate thoughts are posted

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.280
for everyone to see, how do you
think that would affect your job

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.850
as a historian looking
back, or would it change?

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:48.710
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: I mean, I
guess the NSA is archiving a lot

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.000
of stuff, right?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.940 position:56%
I mean, my bread and butter in a lot
of these books is letters, you know,

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:02.370
letters on paper that you have to
put on white gloves to look at.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.390
I think if things are being
saved, then that's good.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:07.840
And I mean, one thing about--

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.600 position:56%
that will I think be of use to
future historians is that for better

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.360
or worse, people nowadays
are pretty forthcoming

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.830
about everything, you know?

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.240
Like sometimes it's
really hard to figure

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.740
out like what Washington
was thinking.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.400
I mean, his wife burned up almost
all of their letters upon his death

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.430
and they're a little cagy
and tactful and they leave

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.020
out private things
because those are private.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:43.160
I guess one advantage of
this world we live in,

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:51.400
how people are documenting every
omelet and aspect of their day,

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.270 position:56%
I'm guessing I'm not on social
media but I hear the jokes about it.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:00.900
I guess that would be helpful,
especially if you're some kind

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.560
of a social historian,
where your job was to figure

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.250
out what people ate, all
you'd have to go is like look

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:11.690
at all these food blogs and Twitter
and everything and you could see,

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:16.810
you know, like, "Oh, people eat a
lot of goat cheese," I don't know.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right, right.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.410
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: But
I mean, there is--

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:24.000
But I think because communication
is so constant, there's maybe less

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.970
of that grandeur, you
know, like if I'm--

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.220
like George Washington
was painfully aware

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.260
that everything he was
doing was basically--

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.290
especially as president that he
was inventing the presidency.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:39.570
And so he wrote these letters
with such care to, you know,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.870
he was writing to the person

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.150
but he's also writing
to us, to posterity.

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.510
And you know, I don't really do

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.550 position:56%
that when I'm just emailing my
friend Sherm [assumed spelling], so.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.540
I think like with the letters,
because they were more formal,

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.380
but also he got the best
of these people, you know?

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.910
And maybe we're not
always at our best

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.310
in our electronic communication,
I'm not.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.610
Yes?

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:03.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Hi, Sarah.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:08.760
I'm with the American Friends
of Lafayette, where 400 strong--

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.090
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Oh,
you people, yeah.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:12.120
[ Laughter ]

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Thank you for
bringing our hero to the forefront.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.690
I appreciate you very much.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.400
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Oh, that's
all, that's why I did it.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I know, I know.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.540
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: I would
have done it for free.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: We bought your book.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.150
So, he's sometimes-- Lafayette
is criticized for being--

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:34.080
doing things for the
glory of it, not for the--

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.110
why the reason, the purest reasons.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.410
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Mm-hmm.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But back in the 18th
century, was that such a bad thing,

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:41.210
doing it just for the glory?

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Just for the glory?

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.810
No, I don't think so.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:47.980
I mean, if we're going to condemn
all historical figures who,

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.220
you know, may-- who
accomplished their accomplishments

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:57.230
because what they wanted
was glory, that wipes out--

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:59.310
everyone, maybe Mother Teresa

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:01.960
but she got a lot oppressed
too, you know?

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.870 position:56%
I mean, if you're doing good things,

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.950
I don't really care what
your motives are that much.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.520
I mean, there is something
about Lafayette,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.410
he's such a boy, you
know what I mean?

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:16.740
He's 19. And I mean,
it is kind of bad form

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.550
to abandon your pregnant
teenage wife.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:20.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: There's that.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.400
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: So I can't
overlook those things.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.690
But I mean, his glory,
that was part--

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:27.210
this like his quest
for glory was part

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.000
of what fueled his accomplishments
and one of the reasons he was

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.130
so valuable to Washington and the
American cause was that he was

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:39.130
so gung-ho, he was so
brave, he, you know,

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.810
didn't care about his
own personal safety.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.110
When he was wounded at the Battle
of Brandywine, he was supposed

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:49.820
to be recuperating but he, you
know, gets up, wraps his bum leg

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.280
in a blanket and rides
back to the front.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.440
And I mean, he's kind of reminds
you of like what Lincoln said

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.610 position:56%
about Grant, and like for Washington

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.620
like he needed him,
he fought, you know?

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:08.060
So, all of that glory whoring, it
had a very, very practical outcome,

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.110
you know, it wasn't just
that he wanted the glory

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:12.410
and he certainly loved it.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:17.630
And when he came back as an old man
in 1824, I mean, he just loved--

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.510
it was just a love fest for
over a year of people talking

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.050
about how much they loved
him and so happy he was back.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:29.520
So yeah, he wanted glory
but he-- you know, he--

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.660
as they say in Hamilton,
immigrants, they get things done.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.730
Like he got things done, you know?

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.060
His glory was based on achievement.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.060
It was based on spilled
blood and sweat and,

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.730
you know, the old college try.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:50.630
It wasn't like getting
glory for, I don't know,

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.430
what do people get glory for now?

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.630
It has to do with Twitter, I think,

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.990
not that that isn't
an accomplishment.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.660
But, you know what I mean.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yes, I do.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.260
Thank you very much.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.560
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Yeah.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.860
Hi.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Hey there.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.810
OK, so you've written a lot about
historical folk heroes and also

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.330
about our American rogues
and it seems like you tend

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.310
to enjoy the lives
of the rogues more.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.610
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: The
life of the what?

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:18.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: The rogue.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.210
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: The rogue?

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yes, you know?

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.810
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Oh, the rogue.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: The ones
going out on their own--

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.410
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Mm-hmm.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: -- history's
bad boys--

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.010
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Mm-hmm.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: -- or girls.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.610
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Right.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I was just
wondering if you had a favorite.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:33.210
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Oh,
if I have a favorite

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.510
of anyone I've written about?

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.480 position:56%
I mean, rogues, yeah, I mean, that's
what I was saying at the beginning.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.140
I do write about the misfits.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Mm-hmm.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.350
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: I have a
soft spot for a lot of them,

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.790
even the unlikable ones,

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.980
maybe especially the
unlikable ones, you know?

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:55.490
I was-- I subscribed to the digital
Washington Post and I'm sure if all

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:59.290
of you do, you woke up to an email
from them as you do every morning

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:03.350
and it said, the headline
was "Is she likable?"

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:06.200
I'm not sure who they
were talking about.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.390
[ Laughter ]

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.180
But I mean, in my opinion,
likable can be kind of overrated.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.340
I mean, one of my favorite people
to write about was Roger Williams,

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:21.260
who was a Puritan theologian,
likable already, right?

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:27.630
And he comes to Boston, to
the Massachusetts Bay colony

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.780
and they offer him the job of
being the minister in Boston,

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.020
which as Puritan jobs go,
that's the one you want.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.580 position:56%
And he turned them down because he--

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.930
basically, he found them
not Puritanical enough.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.800
And he-- they kicked him out
of Massachusetts basically

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.160
because they just wanted him
to calm down about religion.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.410
The Puritans wanted him to
calm down about religion.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:57.940
And he's just this annoying person
who was constantly haranguing them

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:03.880
and so they boot him out and
he-- another misfit leaving home,

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.160
he goes to Rhode Island and
founds Rhode Island and for a lot

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.830
of non-hippie-dippie reasons,
basically establishes freedom

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.220
of religion in Rhode Island.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:20.310
Not because he thinks
everyone's beliefs are valid

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:23.080
but because he feels like
pretty much everyone except

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:28.310
for his wife is going to hell
for what they believe and maybe

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:31.260
that should be punishment enough.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:37.380
And so, everyone-- so Rhode Island
becomes this bastion of misfits,

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:43.240
Jews, Baptists, Quakers, you
know, so like Roger Williams,

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.680
he thought the Quakers had
the right to live there.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:50.810
He spent-- One time, he spent three
days debating them to the extent

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:54.250
that I think they wanted
to kill themselves.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.470
But meanwhile, you know, back
in-- back home in Massachusetts,

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.450
Quakers are actually being
hanged on Boston Common.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:05.720
So, he's a very weird,
unlikable, annoying person

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.130
but I found him sometimes
hard to like

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:11.140
but very easy to love, you know?

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:15.670
So, people can do great things

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.010
and maybe you don't want
to have lunch with them.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.360
[ Laughter ]

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Thank you.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.980
&gt;&gt; SarahVowell: Yes.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.280
Yeah?

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I love reading
the books for the history

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.420
and then I love also the
side johns you take to places

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.810
like Bruce Springsteen's
boyhood home and what you learn

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:34.940
and then the correspondence
and all that you delve into.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.160 position:56%
And I was wondering if when you were
like writing people like Lafayette

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.260
and Winthrop, do you think of a--

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.450
do you know what their
theme song would be?

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.100
Like are you-- do you get
that in your mind when you--

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.830
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: The-- What
their theme song would be?

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah, or if you
could give them a theme song?

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.290
Or not together--

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.020
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: I mean, I don't
know about that but generally,

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.260
the books have theme songs for me.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:02.520
Like this one, for some
reason, I always wanted to put

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:08.070
on Pete Seeger's version of
"Oh Shenandoah", you know?

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:13.390
For some reason, it's like I
just-- it like adheres to the--

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.080
like that passage I read,

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.090
what Lafayette thinks
America is going to be like.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.480
There's something in the
way he sings that song

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.470
like that's the country that
they were trying to build

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:24.270
and that's the one I
would like to live in.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:31.760
When I was writing about the
Puritans, I had three songs

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.930
that I would always put on because
they were, you know, leaving home

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.150
and they had these ideals.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:42.610
And one of them was
the-- what was it?

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:46.090
Oh, the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir's version of "Bound

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:53.330
for the Promised Land" the other
was Chuck Berry's "Promised Land"

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:56.680
and Springsteen's "Promised
Land" because it was all about--

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.420 position:56%
it was not what they were doing, it
was al about promise and the future,

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:05.870
and it had this kind
of biblical overtones.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.980
Yeah. Yes?

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Oh, hello.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.870
I love the dirt of history,
especially George Washington.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.170
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: The dirt?

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.470
Is that what you said?

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:16.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah,
the dirt of history.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.070
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Mm-hmm.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: And George Washington,

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.670
the hero of Fort Necessity,
woohoo, go George.

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:22.730
But he was overall
a marginal general.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.760
His men hated him, except
for his officer corps.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.910
So what influence did
Lafayette have on him?

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:31.360
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: What influence
did Lafayette have on Washington?

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Without Lafayette,

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:34.960
the Battle of York Town
is a whole other story.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.270
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: I mean, I think
one-- I mean, for one thing,

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.860 position:56%
Lafayette just bucked up Washington.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:48.780
For most of the war, Washington was
about to get fired and sometimes

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.160
for cause, you know, but
Lafayette was always on his side.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.620
And whenever, you know, these
conspiracies arose to get rid

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.290
of Washington, Lafayette
was the one saying like,

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:02.520
"These people are idiots, you're
one for the ages," so there's that.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.040
I think it was just like
keeping Washington going.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.400
And like Washington keeping going
was kind of the key to that war,

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.680 position:56%
like just his endurance, just
putting up with it, sticking it out.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.790
And so I think there
is that influence.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:18.380
Also, Lafayette was a
pretty fervent abolitionist.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:23.440
And well-- And so, he could have
influenced Washington's decision

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.260
to have some of his
own slaves, Washington,

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.750
to have some his own
slaves freed upon his death.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.360
There's thought about that.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.040
But I would say, mostly,
it was moral support.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.540
So, I don't know if you have
a friend like that who--

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.780
whatever, when you're down,
they're the one who bucks you up.

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.370
I think that's who
Lafayette was for Washington.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:49.370
I only have time for one question

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.240
because someone else
is coming in here next.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.190
You two, which one do you
think has the better question?

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.360
[ Laughter ]

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.820
He says you have the
better question,

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.550
that makes me want
to hear his question.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.390
But you can ask me
your question after.

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:12.040
I just have to later physically
remove myself from this podium, OK.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: You talked

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.470
about Lafayette's coming
back to America in 1824.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:19.270
Can you tell a little bit about
the reason why almost every city

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.900
in America at that time named
something after Lafayette?

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:26.420
What impact did he have on
America that caused that?

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.630
&gt;&gt; Sarah Vowell: Yes and yeah, in
fact, great question to end on.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.140
I made the right choice.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.440
Thank you.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.800
Yes, when Lafayette came
back in 1824 and '25,

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.390
that 13-month victory lap around
the country where he went to all

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:48.840
of the states, that is the origin
for how all these states and--

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.730
not states but cities and counties
and warships and horses and babies

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:57.300
and streets and parks got
named after Lafayette.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.410
And I think speaking in Washington,
DC, it's worth remembering

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:04.930
that the most meaningful
of any of these,

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:09.320
no offense to Lafayette Ronald
Hubbard, is Lafayette Park

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.630
across from the White House
because this is kind of our capital

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.730
of protests and this is where we,

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.220
the people go to yell
at our presidents.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.510
And I mean, I was kidding about
Lafayette being an only child

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:25.260
but one of the most
only-child things he says was--

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.660
we'll forget the context because we
don't have time but Lafayette said,

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.870
"I did not hesitate
to be disagreeable

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:37.180
to preserve my independence."

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:41.310
And so, I think Lafayette
Park or Lafayette Square,

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.170
as it's also called,
embodies that spirit.

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.810
And even though beat
ourselves up in this country

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:52.770 position:56%
for how much bickering there is, how
we can't get along, I think it's--

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:56.610
that is annoying and time-consuming

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:59.570
but it is also the
source of our greatness.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:04.350 position:56%
And the fact that we have this place
across the street from our head

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:08.980
of government's house, where people
as George H.W. Bush said would

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:13.440
like beat those damn drums while
I was trying to have dinner,

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.810
I think this is something
that we, as a people, and you

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.440
and your city should
be enormously proud of.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.240
And I think the fact that
it's named after Lafayette,

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:30.190
I think that would probably be,
to him, is the greatest honor.

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.810
That-- And I think it is too.

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.610
Good night.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.410
