00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:15.690
[Music]

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.720
no it must be an anomaly tight again I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.210
already have 20 times it's not an

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.660
anomaly this sample must contain a new

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.849
element a radioactive element it would

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.820
have to be hundreds no thousands of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.489
times stronger than uranium we must

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.050
isolate it well then I suppose we're

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.050
going to need our own laboratory happy

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.270
do you remember the cooties paper on

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.920
darÃ­o activity working tirelessly side

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.350
by side without heat in the lab or

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.570
funding for the research it's romantic

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.910
wealth the Curie's spent four years on

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.860
that paper I've got three hours until

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.030
the patent office opens you should get

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.370
some rest you can't think probably

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.120
without sleep don't need sleep I need

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.120
more coffee

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.700
what does it do you remember our thought

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.369
experiments on gas theory at university

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.050
those weeks we spent holed up in my room

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.270
I don't never quite a lot of

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.119
experimentation yes not all of it to the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.840
earth science what if going about it all

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.149
wrong

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.610
what if instead of studying gases we

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:41.399
studied a cup of coffee you really must

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:44.460
sweep up yacouba's van't hoff's no buy

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.580
the paper from 1901 particles in a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.670
solution behaved like a gas when sugar

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.860
dissolves in coffee water surrounds

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.720
glucose and turns it from the sugar

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.659
crystal correct the more sugar I add the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.520
thicker the coffee becomes if we can

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.770
calculate the osmotic pressure perhaps

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.890
we can deduce the precise number no one

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.400
to prove the existence of Marge's too

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.400
ambitious no it's pretty

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.129
you
