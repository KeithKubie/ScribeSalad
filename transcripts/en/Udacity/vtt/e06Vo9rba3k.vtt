00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.800
Hi. I'm John Regehr and I like to make software fail. This

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.800
June I'll be teaching CS258 which is a course on applied software testing.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.780
What that means is, the focus of the course is going to be

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.880
on trying to make real software fail as opposed to learning software engineering

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.110
theory. The reason I wanted to create this course is because computer

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.865
science educators like me, often haven't done a very good job in teaching

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.790
tCS students to become really strong testers. And I'd like to help try

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.770
to fix that. One of the things that you'll do in this class

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.110
is participate in some tournaments that we have setup, where you are

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.860
going to to try to break software that other students and they are going

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.270
to break the software that you wrote. And I think this will be

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.840
really fun. I spent the last 12 years as a computer science researcher,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.180
mainly working on ways to improve the quality of software, including reporting

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.190
about 450 bugs to people who develop C compilers. This class is for

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.430
you if you're interested in increasing the quality of software that you write

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.760
and then increasing the quality of

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.790
software that other people write. You're ready

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.340
for this class if you have a reasonable, working knowledge of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.530
algorithms and data structures, and if you're an intermediate level Python

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.510
programmer who can put together the basic control flow constructs and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.210
data types in order to solve small problems. See you in class.
