00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.500
Let's start again with a point.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.730
Let's call that point point
A. And what I'm curious about

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.530
is all of the points on
my screen right over here,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.860
that are exactly 2
centimeters away from A.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.092
So 2 centimeters on my
screen is about that far.

00:00:16.092 --> 00:00:17.550
So clearly if I
start at A and I go

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.410
2 centimeters in that direction,
this point right over there,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.840
is 2 centimeters from A. If
I call that point, point B,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.600
then I could say line
segment AB is 2 centimeters.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.926
The length is 2 centimeters.

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:33.280
Remember this would refer
to the actual line segment.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.332
I could say this looks nice,
but if I talk about its length,

00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:37.790
I would get rid of
that line on top

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.580
and I would just say
AB is equal to 2.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.540
If I wanted to put units I
could say 2 centimenters.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.445
But I'm not curious just about
B, I want to think about all

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.800
of the points, the set
of all of the points

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.330
that are exactly 2
centimeters away from A.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.810
So I could go 2 centimeters
in the other direction,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.190
maybe get to point
C right over here.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.170
So AC is also going to be
equal to 2 centimeters,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.970
but I could go 2 centimeters
in any direction.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.910
And so if I find the
set of all of the points

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.150
that are exactly 2
centimeters away from A,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.970
I will get a very familiar
looking shape, like this,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.930
and I'm trying to
draw it freehand.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.424
So I would get a shape
that looks like this.

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:17.590
Actually, let me draw it in.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.173
I don't want to make you think
that it's only the points where

00:01:20.173 --> 00:01:22.750
there's white, it's all of
these points right over here.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.250
I don't want to draw a dashed
line over there, which maybe I

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.570
should just, let me
clear out all of these

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.610
and I'll just draw
it as a solid line.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.660
So this could look
something like that.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.380
My best attempt.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.500
And this set of all
of the points that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.425
are exactly 2
centimeters away from A,

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:47.239
this is a circle, as I'm sure
you are already familiar with.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.030
But that is the formal
definition-- the set

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.590
of all points that
are a fixed distance,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.610
or that have a fixed
distance, from A

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.410
that are a given
distance from A.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.350
If I said the set of all points
that are 3 centimeters from A,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.530
it might look
something like this.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.150
It might look
something like that.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.575
That would give
us another circle.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.992
I think you get
the general idea.

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:09.450
Now what I want to
do in this video

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.180
is introduce ourselves into
some of the concepts and words

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.540
that we use when
dealing with circles.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.975
So let me get rid of
that 3-centimeter circle.

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:22.790
So first of all, let's
think about this distance.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.200
This distance, or one
of these line segments

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.420
that join A, which we would
call the center of the circle.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.231
So we'll call A the
center of the circle,

00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:33.730
and it makes sense
just from the way

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.250
we use the word center
in everyday life.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.510
What I want to do is think
about what line segment AB is.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.740
AB connects the center and it
connects a point on the circle

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.320
itself.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.528
Remember, the circle itself
is all of the points that

00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:50.140
are equal distance
from the center.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.510
So AB, any line
segment, I should say,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.150
that connects the center
to a point on the circle,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.280
we would call a radius.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.880
And so the length of the
radius, AB over here,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.340
is equal to 2 centimeters.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.830
And you're probably already
familiar with the word radius,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.663
but I'm just being a
little bit more formal.

00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:11.460
And what's interesting
about geometry,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.190
at least when you start learning
it at the high school level,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.220
is it's probably the
first class where you're

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.780
introduced into a slightly more
formal mathematics, where we're

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.720
a little bit more careful
about giving our definitions

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.330
and then building
on those definitions

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.850
to come up with
interesting results

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.530
and proving to ourselves
that we definitely

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.712
know what we think we know.

00:03:28.712 --> 00:03:30.670
And so that's why we're
being a little bit more

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.410
careful with our
language over here.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.690
So AB is our radius,
line segment AB, and so

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.840
is line segment-- let me
draw another point on here,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.770
let's say this is X-- so line
segment AX is also a radius.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.560
Now you can also have other
forms of lines and line

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.010
segments that interact
in interesting ways

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.750
with the circle.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.680
So you could have a line
that just intersects

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.110
that circle at
exactly one point.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.530
So let's call that point right
over there, let's call that D.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.570
And let's say you have a
line, and the only point

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.760
on the circle-- the only point
in the set of all of the points

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.260
that are equal distant from A,
the only point on that circle

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.290
that is also on that
line is point D.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.190
And we could call that line l.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.390
So sometimes you'll
see lines specified

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.350
by some of the points on them.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.540
So for example, if I had another
point right over here called E,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.190
we could call this line
line DE, or we could just

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.840
put a little script
letter here with an l

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.370
and say this is line l.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.010
But this line that only
has one point in common

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.590
with our circle, we call
this a tangent line.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.700
So line l is a tangent.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.080
It is tangent to the circle.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.170
So let me write it
this way, line l

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.546
is tangent-- you normally
wouldn't write it

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:02.920
in caps like this,
I'm just doing

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.840
that for emphasis-- is tangent
to-- instead of writing

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.250
the circle centered
at A, you'll sometimes

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.049
see this notation-- to
the circle centered at A.

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:15.590
So this tells us that this is
the circle we're talking about.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.060
Because who knows, maybe we
had another circle over here

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.180
that is centered at
M, another circle.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.380
So we have to specify it's
not tangent to that one,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.560
it's tangent to this one.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.570
So this circle with
a dot in the middle

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.040
tells we're talking
about a circle,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.010
and this is a circle
centered at point

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.800
A. I want to be very clear,
point A is not on the circle,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.590
point A is the
center of the circle.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.660
The points on the circle
are the points equal distant

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.800
from point A. Now, l is
tangent, because it only

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.600
intersects the
circle in one point.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.620
You could just as
easily imagine a line

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.350
that intersects the
circle at two points.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.250
So we could call, maybe
this is F and this is G,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.050
you could call that line FG.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.120
So we could write it
like this, line FG.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.610
And this line that
intersects it at two points,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.890
we call this a
secant of circle A.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.160
It is a secant line to this
circle right over here,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.770
because it intersects
it in two points.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.770
Now, if FG was just
a segment, if it

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.690
didn't keep on going forever,
like lines like to do,

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.850
if we only spoke about
this line segment--

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.320
let me do this in a new
color-- if we only spoke

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.140
about this line segment
between F and G,

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.170
and not thinking about going on
forever, then all of a sudden

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.430
we have a line segment,
which we would specify there.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.730
And we would call this
a chord of the circle,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.480
a chord of circle A. It starts
at a point on the circle,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.970
a point that is exactly in
this case 2 centimeters away,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.950
and then it finishes at
a point on the circle.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.150
So it connects two
points on the circle.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.547
Now, you could have
chords like this,

00:07:00.547 --> 00:07:02.630
and you can also have a
chord, as you can imagine,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.930
a chord that actually
goes through the center

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.280
of the circle.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.980
So let's call this
point, point H,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.210
and you have a straight line
connecting F to H through A.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.500
So that's about as straight
as I could draw it.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.290
So if you have a
chord like that,

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.244
that contains the actual
center of the circle,

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:25.160
of course it goes from
one point of the circle

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.580
to another point of
the circle, and it goes

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.180
through the center
of the circle,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:39.050
we call that a diameter of A.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.990
And you've probably seen
this in tons of problems

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.460
before, when we were not talking
about geometry as formally,

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.520
but the diameter is made
up of exactly two radiuses.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.670
We already know that a radius
connects a point to the center.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.920
So you have one
radius right over here

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.580
that connects F and
A, that's one radius,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.400
and then you have
another radius connecting

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.620
A and H, the center to
a point on the circle.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.810
So the diameter is made
up of these two radiuses,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.500
or radii I should
call it, I think

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.570
that's the plural for radius.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.000
And so the length
of a diameter is

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.700
going to be twice the
length of a radius.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.530
So we could say the length of
the diameter, so the length

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.580
of FH-- and once again I don't
put the line on top of it

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.300
when I'm just talking
about the length--

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.410
is going to be equal to
FA, the length of segment

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:34.370
FA, plus the length
of segment AH.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.309
Now there's one
last thing I want

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.309
to talk about when we're
dealing with circles,

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.360
and that's the idea of an arc.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.760
So we also have the parts
of the circle itself.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.600
So let me draw another
circle over here.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.506
Let's center this circle
right over here at B.

00:08:49.506 --> 00:08:52.080
And I'm going to find
all of the points that

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.470
are a given distance from
B. So it has some radius,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.150
I'm not going to specify
it right over here,

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.490
and let me pick some random
points on the circle.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:10.130
So let's call this J, let's
call that K, let's call this S,

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.297
let's call this T, let's
call this U right over here.

00:09:14.297 --> 00:09:16.880
And I know it doesn't look that
centered, let me try to center

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.830
B a little bit better.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.520
Let me erase that.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.110
And if I put B a
little bit closer

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.260
to the center of the circle, so
that's my best shot, so let's

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.220
put B right over there.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.130
Now, one interesting
thing is, what do you

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.340
call the length of the circle
that goes between two points?

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.140
So what would you call-- let
me get a good color here--

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.607
what would you call this?

00:09:38.607 --> 00:09:40.440
Well, you could imagine
in everyday language

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.990
we would call something
that looks like that an arc,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.140
and we would also call
that an arc in geometry.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.350
To specify this
arc we would call

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.456
this JK, the two
endpoints of the arc,

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:51.830
the two points on
the circle that

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.371
are the endpoints
of the arc, and you

00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:55.130
use a little notation like that.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.030
So you put a little curve on
top instead of a straight line.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.620
Now you could also have
another arc that connects JK,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.010
this is the minor arc.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.250
It is the shortest way along
the circle to connect J and K,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.670
but you could also go
the other way around.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.390
You could also have
this thing that

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.570
goes all the way
around the circle.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.660
And we would call
that the major arc.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.870
And normally when you
specify a major arc, just

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.030
to show that you're going
the long way around,

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.420
it's not the shortest way
to get between J and K,

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.840
you'll often specify
another point

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.923
that you're going through.

00:10:25.923 --> 00:10:30.350
So for example, this major arc
we could specify we start at J,

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.530
we went through-- we could
have said U, T, or S,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.890
but I'll put T right over
there-- we went through T

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.170
and then we went
all the way to K.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.012
And so this specifies
the major arc

00:10:40.012 --> 00:10:42.470
and this thing could have been
the same thing as if I wrote

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:48.050
JUK, these are specifying
the same thing, or JSK.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.150
So there's multiple ways
to specify this major arc

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.990
right over here.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.790
But the one thing
I make clear is,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.590
is that the minor arc is
the shortest distance,

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.750
so this is the minor arc, and
the longer distance around

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.000
is the major arc.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.020
And I'll leave you there and
maybe the next few videos we'll

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.590
start playing with some of this
notation a little bit more.
