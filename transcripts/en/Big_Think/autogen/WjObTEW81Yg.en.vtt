00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.179
I think the first thing to say about the

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:06.189
I think the first thing to say about the
 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.099
I think the first thing to say about the
story of Adam and Eve is it's one of

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:08.109
story of Adam and Eve is it's one of
 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.470
story of Adam and Eve is it's one of
innumerable origin stories it happens to

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480
innumerable origin stories it happens to
 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.999
innumerable origin stories it happens to
be the most celebrated the most famous

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:12.009
be the most celebrated the most famous
 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.570
be the most celebrated the most famous
and powerful origin story in our culture

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580
and powerful origin story in our culture
 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.730
and powerful origin story in our culture
central to Judaism Islam and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740
central to Judaism Islam and
 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.089
central to Judaism Islam and
Christianity but it's only one of many

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099
Christianity but it's only one of many
 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.859
Christianity but it's only one of many
many origin stories it seems to be

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869
many origin stories it seems to be
 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.650
many origin stories it seems to be
something that our species does as far

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660
something that our species does as far
 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.080
something that our species does as far
as we know other species don't do it I

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090
as we know other species don't do it I
 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.679
as we know other species don't do it I
don't think that chimpanzees asked

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
don't think that chimpanzees asked
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.490
don't think that chimpanzees asked
questions about the origin of

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500
questions about the origin of
 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.960
questions about the origin of
chimpanzees or bottlenose dolphins and

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970
chimpanzees or bottlenose dolphins and
 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.390
chimpanzees or bottlenose dolphins and
sperm whales but we do ask where did we

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400
sperm whales but we do ask where did we
 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.280
sperm whales but we do ask where did we
come from what were the first ones of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290
come from what were the first ones of
 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.030
come from what were the first ones of
our species and this is a it appears to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040
our species and this is a it appears to
 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.940
our species and this is a it appears to
be a universal phenomenon in culture to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950
be a universal phenomenon in culture to
 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.780
be a universal phenomenon in culture to
ask about origins and so this is a

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790
ask about origins and so this is a
 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.600
ask about origins and so this is a
crucially significant version of the the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610
crucially significant version of the the
 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.990
crucially significant version of the the
kind of story that is generated and we

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000
kind of story that is generated and we
 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.020
kind of story that is generated and we
might ask why why do we want to know why

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030
might ask why why do we want to know why
 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.550
might ask why why do we want to know why
don't other creatures want to know well

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560
don't other creatures want to know well
 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.349
don't other creatures want to know well
I think there are a number of different

I think there are a number of different
 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.910
I think there are a number of different
explanations one is our insatiable

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920
explanations one is our insatiable
 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.249
explanations one is our insatiable
curiosity including something like

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259
curiosity including something like
 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.529
curiosity including something like
scientific curiosity another is our

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539
scientific curiosity another is our
 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.679
scientific curiosity another is our
uneasiness perhaps about ourselves in

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689
uneasiness perhaps about ourselves in
 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.020
uneasiness perhaps about ourselves in
the course of our existence why do we

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030
the course of our existence why do we
 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.560
the course of our existence why do we
why is it so hard why do we have to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570
why is it so hard why do we have to
 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.410
why is it so hard why do we have to
labor why do we draw in the fields when

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
labor why do we draw in the fields when
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.289
labor why do we draw in the fields when
and we have to have to clear them out in

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299
and we have to have to clear them out in
 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.090
and we have to have to clear them out in
order to get food from the ground why

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100
order to get food from the ground why
 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.410
order to get food from the ground why
can't we just get everything we need

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420
can't we just get everything we need
 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.450
can't we just get everything we need
naturally why why do women scream in

naturally why why do women scream in
 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.289
naturally why why do women scream in
pain when they give birth to offspring a

they're prohibited from eating and it
happens that the one tree that they're

happens that the one tree that they're
 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.250
happens that the one tree that they're
favorited from eating is the tree of the

knowledge of good and evil and it was

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790
knowledge of good and evil and it was
 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.150
knowledge of good and evil and it was
noticed a very long time ago that is to

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160
noticed a very long time ago that is to
 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.930

say several thousand years ago that it's
 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.360

a problem to be prohibited from eating

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
a problem to be prohibited from eating
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.270

of the tree that will enable you to

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280
of the tree that will enable you to
 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.890
of the tree that will enable you to
distinguish between good and evil since

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900
distinguish between good and evil since
 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.449
distinguish between good and evil since
distinguishing good and evil is

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459
distinguishing good and evil is
 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.010
distinguishing good and evil is

the prohibition in the first place so

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550
the prohibition in the first place so
 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.600
the prohibition in the first place so
that problem bothered people right away

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610
that problem bothered people right away
 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.910
that problem bothered people right away
or at least maybe not right away but at

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920
or at least maybe not right away but at
 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.130
or at least maybe not right away but at
least 2,000 years ago and then we have

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140
least 2,000 years ago and then we have
 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.350
least 2,000 years ago and then we have
various other problems that they are

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360
various other problems that they are
 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.509

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.930
explain unfortunately what that means
and since there had been as far as we

and since there had been as far as we
know no death in the world up to that

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410
know no death in the world up to that
 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.530
know no death in the world up to that
point it must have been rather

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540

keep going on this is a problem that
 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.240
