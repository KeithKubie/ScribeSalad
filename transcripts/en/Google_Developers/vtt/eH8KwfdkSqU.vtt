00:00:01.464 --> 00:00:03.280
SHALINI AGARWAL: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome to Actions in the inbox
powered by schemas.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.045
I'm Shalini Agarwal.

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:09.530
This is Claudio Cherubino.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.050
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Hi.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.890
SHALINI AGARWAL: And we are
really excited to be here

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.290
today to tell you about a cool
new feature that we are

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.880
launching in Gmail.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.000
So let's start with
a show of hands.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.710
How many of you send emails
to your users

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.970
asking them to do something?

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.320
All right.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.740
How many of you care if your
users actually do what you ask

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.620
them to do?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.260
Perfect.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.900
OK, so then you know that
today we have a problem.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.910
Email is not efficient.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.880
It's like a scavenger hunt
trying to do anything.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.230
For every email that you send
your users, they have to read

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.296
the email, figure out what they
need to do, open a bunch

00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:02.180
of tabs, decide to take action,
and then do it.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.480
It's a lot of steps,
and each email

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.020
takes too long to process.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.230
That's even if the user decides
to open the email in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.910
the first place.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.180
So let's go ahead and see this
in efficiency in action.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.990
How many steps do you think it
takes to rate and review a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.020
restaurant?

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.310
First, you get the email.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.940
Second, you click on it, you
read it, and you decide that

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.860
you're going to click
on a link.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100
Third, you click on the link.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.320
You open the tab and you
wait for it to load.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680
Fourth, if you remember your
login information,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.070
you enter it here.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.220
And fifth, you do what you
wanted to do in the first

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.980
place, which is rate and review
the restaurant, and

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.200
click Submit.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.370
And then sixth, you
close the tab.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.530
And if you remember, you go back
to your inbox to process

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.190
the next email.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.670
It's a very cumbersome process,
and users get lost

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.920
along the way.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.660
This inefficiency is only
made worse by the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.210
sheer volume of email.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.330
As a product manager at Google,
I get a lot of email.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.800
In fact, I counted.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.030
And in the last week alone,
I received 2,124 emails.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.040
During this session alone,
over 100 million

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.060
emails will be sent.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.550
Your users are out there doing
this scavenger hunt right now.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.700
Between email inefficiency and
email volume, it's no wonder

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.330
that a lot of emails go
unanswered or unopened.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.440
You are probably tracking
your own stats and see

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.360
some of that today.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.120
But today, we are introducing
a solution.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.260
We're adding actions to the
inbox, making email smarter.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.990
Now, your users can get the gist
of what you're trying to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.690
tell them and take action
without ever leaving the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.710
inbox, without even
opening email.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.890
So remember the six-step process
that we talked about?

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.010
Let's see what that looks like
with actions in the inbox.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.040
With actions in the inbox, we're
taking that six-step

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.500
process and turning it
into just two steps.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.800
We'll take a look at
it with a demo.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:41.000
Last night, I ordered food
from India Clay Oven via

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.750
Seamless web.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.480
Today, Seamless has sent me an
email asking me to rate my

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.370
experience.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.640
Seamless have added actions
to their email.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.010
So I see the email, Seamless,
asking me how

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.160
was India Clay Oven?

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.140
And I get this handy button
on the right-hand

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.780
side that says Review.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.920
I click on it, and I get this
beautiful overlay that gives

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.390
me the key information
I need--

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.890
India Clay Oven via Seamless,
a beautiful picture from the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.860
restaurant, and a quick
rating widget.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.010
So I can go ahead and
click it five

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.310
stars and enter a comment.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.690
Spicetastic.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.610
Will definitely be back.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.079
Definitely order again.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.880
And I hit Post Review.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.640
On the back end, Gmail has now
sent this rating to Seamless,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.930
and I'm done.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.893
That's it.

00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:34.865
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:35.851
SHALINI AGARWAL: Two steps.

00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.101
Now, that's efficient.

00:04:42.528 --> 00:04:44.450
Let's go back.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.230
So we've enabled actions
in the inbox through

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.580
the power of schemas.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.050
You guys already know
about schemas.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.810
They're an important part
of the web today.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.910
You add markup to your websites
to improve your

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.780
search results.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.420
Now, you can add markup to your
emails to enable these

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.780
actions directly from
the inbox and

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.050
deliver them to Gmail.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.340
You can deliver a slice
of your app to

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.340
Gmail starting today.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.345
A product with hundreds
of millions of users.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.970
Over the coming weeks, we'll be
rolling out four different

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.150
kinds of actions.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.490
We've already talked about rate
and review, and now we'll

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.980
talk about the one-click action,
the RSVP action, and

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.230
the goto action.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.205
And, of course, we'll
do it through demos.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.880
So as you can see here, I've
gotten an email from Google

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.240
Offers about an offer from
American Apparel.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.200
Because they've added schema
to their emails, I get this

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.570
one-click button that
says Get Offer.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.620
Because I shop at American
Apparel all the time, I'll go

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.080
ahead and click the offer.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.830
One click, without
ever leaving the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.920
inbox, I saved the offer.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.830
Now, let's go over to
offers.google.com, reload the

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.460
tab, and there it is.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.690
I didn't even have to open an
email and I've been able to

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.850
save my offer.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:20.030
Now, one-click buttons are my
favorite action because they

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.900
enable the widest variety
of use cases.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.260
So let's look at a second demo
of the one-click action.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.250
I use a service called Esna to
manage my communications.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.100
And they've sent me this email
telling me that I have missed

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.010
a call from Claudio.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.570
And because now seems like a
good enough time as any to

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.710
call him back, I'll click
this one-click

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.520
button that says Dial.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.090
Now, on the back end, what's
happening is that Gmail has

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.545
notified Esna that I want
to initiate the call.

00:06:56.545 --> 00:06:57.370
[PHONE RINGING]

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.960
SHALINI AGARWAL: And they've
initiated the call between

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.810
Claudio and myself.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.740
As you can see, my
phone is ringing.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.180
I'll Go ahead and pick it up.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.510
I don't know if Claudio's
going to pick it up.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.380
We'll find out.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.200
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Probably not.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.470
SHALINI AGARWAL: So he'll be
receiving a call any minute

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.453
now that I've picked it up.

00:07:10.453 --> 00:07:11.380
[PHONE RINGING]

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.896
SHALINI AGARWAL: And
there we go.

00:07:13.896 --> 00:07:14.290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Woo.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.388
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:15.388 --> 00:07:17.820
SHALINI AGARWAL: All right.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.030
One click directly
from the inbox.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.380
The third type of action
is the RSVP action.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.100
As you can see here, Clarence
has invited me to a taco

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.790
night, which is my favorite
type of event.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.810
Because Calendar has added
actions to the inbox with some

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.320
markup, I get this RSVP button
right here, similar to rate

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.140
and review.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.410
When I click on it, I get the
overlay showing me the most

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.280
important information.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.870
The fact that it's a taco night

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.976
hosted by Google Calendar.

00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:52.690
It's on Tuesday at 7:00 PM.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.160
It's at Tortilla Heights, and
one person's already going.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.410
I don't miss a taco night.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.640
So, of course, I'm
going to say yes.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.230
And there it is.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.990
I'm done.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.780
Let's go over to Google Calendar
and make sure that my

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.390
response was recorded.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.370
Here it is, Taco Night.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.650
I click on it and there it is.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.900
Yes, I'm going.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.220
The fourth and final type of
action is the goto action.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.210
The goto action is reserved for
the most complex type of

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.700
actions, which really
cannot be handled

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.790
from within the inbox.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.580
So flight check-in, as you can
see here, the last email from

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.230
Oceanic Airlines, I get a button
on the right-hand side.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.590
They've used the goto action.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.460
When I click on this button,
it'll take me to a deep link

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.420
on their website to check-in,
where I can select my seat.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.680
I can tell them how many
bags I'm bringing.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.900
And whatever security
questions I

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.820
might have to answer.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.790
And that's it.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.840
Those are the four
types of actions.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.880
However, sometimes no
action is required.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.900
Sometimes your users just need
key information from you.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:10.750
So for these situations,
we've added

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.820
structured interactive cards.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.950
The first one that we're
adding is for flight.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.520
So when users get flight
confirmation email, check-in

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.970
reminders, or updates, they get
this beautiful card at the

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.970
top of their email that gives
them the airport details, the

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:33.030
flight details, their connection
times, as well as a

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.990
real-time layer on top of that
telling them if their flight

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:41.670
is on-time, delayed, or--
hopefully not-- canceled.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.470
Flight is only the first
card we're adding.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.070
Over time, we'll add
more cards, such

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.450
as events and hotels.

00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:54.920
So by adding schema to your
emails, you can enable these

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.630
actions and cards in Gmail.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.000
However, you can also enable
experiences for your users

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.430
across Google.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.120
When your users use Google Now
or Google Search, they will

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.660
get the information that you
send them at the most useful

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.060
time and place.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.210
I'll leave you with
one last thought.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.000
This is a developer platform,
and the power of it really

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.190
comes in how you decide
to use it.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.810
We'll be rolling out these
features over the next few

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.620
weeks and be adding
more over time.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.110
Now, I'll hand it over
to Claudio to tell

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.360
you how it all works.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.470
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Thanks, Shalini.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.856
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:45.856 --> 00:10:47.030
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Well, thank you.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.350
I haven't done anything yet.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.430
So I'm very happy to be here.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.160
I work in the developer
relations team from Google.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.090
And one of the questions that
I always get when talking to

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:09.500
developers like you is, how do
I get my app into Gmail?

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.740
It's a common request.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.950
I understand why you want to be
in Gmail, why you want your

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.120
app in Gmail.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.480
And today, we're finally
introducing a way

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.190
for you to do that.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.920
And what we're introducing
is super simple.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.290
So not only we're giving you
this opportunity, but we're

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.750
giving an opportunity in the
easiest possible way.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.520
All it takes is some markup
that you have

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.670
to add to your emails.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.030
So you have your emails.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.040
You probably already send
emails to your users.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.465
So you have an HTML email
with your content,

00:11:43.465 --> 00:11:45.080
your regular content.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.980
You don't have to touch it.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.100
You don't have to do anything
with the content you're

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.470
already sending.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.110
All you have to do is add in
some markup, some extra markup

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.360
to the same emails, and
then clients will

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.070
render that for you.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.860
So you add some markup at the
top of your email, at the

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.190
bottom of your email, in the
middle, somewhere in your

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:12.590
HTML, and clients, like Gmail,
will render it for you.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.290
I say clients like Gmail, and
I will go back to this,

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.940
because this is going to
be an open platform.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.030
And Gmail is starting
to launch this

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.840
in the coming weeks.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.440
But we expect other clients
to implement

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.290
this technology, too.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.860
So what happens when you add
your schema is that we render

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.960
it as the corresponding button
or drop down or piece of UI or

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.680
card, whatever corresponds
to your markup.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:46.870
And one important thing to note
there is that the UI is

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.800
consistent.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:54.480
So Gmail will always render an
event reservation, RSVP drop

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.480
down with the same
UI, regardless

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.090
of who's the sender.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:05.250
So your user will not be
confused by messy UI or a

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.900
piece of interface that do not
really belong to Gmail.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.310
The client controls the
experience, and that's really

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.850
important for the user, is not
to be confused, to use this

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.680
technology.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.560
So you add the markup.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.270
It's going to be a few lines.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.700
I'm going to show that.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.010
And we will render it.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.430
And the one thing that I just
mentioned is that this is

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.190
based on an open platform.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.670
We're building on top of
schema.org, which is a broader

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:39.910
initiative, open initiative for
a vocabulary of entities

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.720
that we're building on top of.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.110
So the types we're defining, the
types you will use in your

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.440
markup are the same types that
you're already using if you

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.230
know about schema.org.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.530
Well, let's show an example.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.200
This is how it looks like.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.400
And I actually have two
different formats, because we

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.770
support two different formats
for this markup.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:09.890
The one on your left is the
standard schema.org migrator.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.810
If you know about schema.org
and semantic web, you've

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.950
probably seen this.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.150
You probably implemented this.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.320
You probably added this
to your HTML.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.750
It's pretty easy
to understand.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.320
It's an XML-based language.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.590
Actually, what you do here is
that you add some properties

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.120
to your HTML.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.410
And these properties attributes
will tell us what

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.920
the item is.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.980
And in this example,
we have an event.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.850
And then what properties
the event has--

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.700
the start time, the end time,
location, and so on.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.440
The same thing can
be also expressed

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.550
with a different format.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.010
There is also now the
open standard.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.660
It's called JSON [? lt. ?]

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.470
It is not XML-based.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.540
It's obviously JSON-based.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.550
And we found that this other
format, this alternative

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.370
format is easier to
read for humans.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.790
There are libraries to write
both, so you as a developer

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.460
can, probably, easily
write both.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.730
But for a human, the one on the
right is easier to write.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.520
So as you can see, those 10
lines, and the ones on the

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.400
right are just easier to read,
tell us that this email is

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.380
about an event.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.800
And that event starts at this
date, ends at that date, and

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.850
there's also location.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:27.940
And we will render it as an
event should be rendered.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.330
So we have the markup, different
markup for the four

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.200
different types of actions, and

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.750
structure data like flights.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.400
I will show you an example
of each of them.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.350
And I would say that
all of them are

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.870
shorter than 10 lines.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.490
Well, no more than 20 lines.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.850
So we have four different
types of action.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.500
And we'll see them one by one.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.960
But all of them follow
the same structure.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.290
So you will see that there are
common sections every time I

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.160
introduce a new type.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.480
And the sections are,
essentially, three sections in

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.670
each markup.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.380
So we usually have a section at
the top that is about the

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.410
entity you're defining.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.720
And that is, for instance, in
the example we just saw, to

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.730
describe what the event is
or what the flight is.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.710
So the entity you're
talking about.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.180
And that has properties that you
can see from schema.org,

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.350
from the vocabulary
we're using.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:34.800
And after the item definition,
we have our first addition to

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.180
the schema, which is actions.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.390
Actions have different types
and have different names.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.410
So if you want to implement the
RSVP action or our review

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.520
action, those have
different types.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.310
And you have to specify
that there.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.000
But then, in the third
part, you describe

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.430
what the handler is.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:57.370
The handler is used to tell us
what to do with the action.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.510
So you've seen Gmail sending
requests to you when the user

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.090
performs an action.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.599
Those requests will be sent to
a URL, to an end point, to a

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.670
servlet, to somewhere
you tell us.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.060
And that is where
you define it.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.849
Let's go on with the
real example.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.069
The first type of action--

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.220
I'm going to show you
the markup for--

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.430
is one-click action.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.849
This is what Shalini called
her favorite.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.030
Because this is super-flexible.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:34.110
Gmail renders these one-click
actions as buttons.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.230
When the user clicks on the
button, Gmail will send a

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.720
request to your endpoint.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.470
So how this works in the
microdata, in the markup you

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:49.015
see, in this example I'm
showing an email

00:17:49.015 --> 00:17:50.600
that is about a movie.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.830
And one action we can perform
with one click

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.490
is Add to Your Queue.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.780
So at the top, you
will see some

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.070
information about the movie--

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.650
movie title, and maybe the cast,
maybe genre, all the

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.170
other properties
we want to add.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.440
And then we have the action.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.540
The action in this case
is called Save action.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.530
There will be a list of all the
supported actions in the

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.370
docs that we're launching
right now.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.280
So at the end of this talk, I
will give you a link to the

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.410
documentation we're launching.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.750
But this action is called
Save action.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.890
You can customize what the
button will look like.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.670
So you can customize the
label for the button.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.510
And we're going to call
it Add to Queue.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.650
And then you define the
action handler.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.480
In this case, what you need to
do is just say, when the user

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.310
clicks on a button, I want a
post request sent to my URL.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.990
So you send us this markup.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.820
You set up a servlet that
can handle this request.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.740
When Gmail sends your request
in the background, you will

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.250
have to handle the request--

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.760
in this case, add the
movie to the queue--

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.440
and respond with a standard
HTTP response code.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.640
So if the action is performed
correctly, you respond with a

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.720
200 and Gmail will show it
as successfully executed.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.310
If there is an error--
for instance,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.410
the request is invalid--

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.550
you respond with a 400.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.190
Standard HTTP response code.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.030
You know about that.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.630
So this is the common
structure--

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.360
entity, action, action
handler.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.815
And you will see the same
structure in the second type

00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:21.260
of action we are
defining here.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.190
This is RSVP action.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.920
The main difference here is
that Gmail knows that RSVP

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.970
actions deserve a special UI,
which is not a button.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.130
But it's, instead, a drop down
with some information about

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.290
the entity, which is an event.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.980
And then, buttons for
you to reply.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.800
You, as a developer, can choose,
if you want, yes,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.970
maybe, no, all of them,
just yes and no.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:52.350
You can customize the look
of this small drop down.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.830
And once that is rendered, the
result is always the same.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:58.950
Gmail renders it.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.880
The user clicks on one of the
actions, one of the buttons.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.470
Gmail collects the input from
the user, sends that as a post

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.770
request to your endpoint with
the parameters you want.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.320
You process it and
respond with the

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.860
appropriate response code.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.550
So on your side, we'll still
have to implement some

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.140
servlet, some back end
that can handle this.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.200
And then, Gmail will talk
to this directly.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.590
Now that you know two of them,
this is going to be super easy

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:28.950
to understand-- rate
and review.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.550
You saw that in the
first demo.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.810
We showed Seamless, which is
one of our partners, using

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.260
this technology to review
restaurants from the inbox.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.710
What you can customize
here is the scale.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.540
And in our case, there was
one to five stars.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.750
And you can also tell us if
you want an optional text

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.110
feedback or if you want a
required text feedback.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.540
It's up to you.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.050
Some companies need that, some
websites need both a text

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.340
comment and a rating.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.360
Some others do not.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.820
Of course, the easier it is
for your users, the more

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.110
responses you will get.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.020
So that's basically it.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.970
You configure it, and
then-- same thing.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.580
You get a request from Gmail.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.070
You respond to it,
and that's it.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.640
And we render the response.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:19.640
The only action type that is
slightly different is the goto

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.000
link, goto action.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.400
This is rendered as a
button with a link.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.340
We talked about check-in.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.370
Check-in is not an action
that can be performed

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:32.760
easily in the inbox.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.750
You have to select seats,
buy upgrades,

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.950
select food, meal, whatever.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.640
You have to do many steps.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.960
And that doesn't really apply
to inside your inbox.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.770
So we can take you directly
to the page

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.080
where you can do that.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.880
Another example--

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.090
and we have it here--

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:49.600
is a request for you to
sign some documents.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.340
The documents are not
sent in the email.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.430
You can click on the link and
be brought to the page where

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.540
you can sign the documents.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:03.880
So we strongly recommend you
to use and implement the

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.850
in-app actions, like RSVP,
review, or one-click action.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.910
Because with those, users do not
have to leave the inbox.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.940
For all other cases, you can use
a goto action if that is

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.360
the best user experience
for your user.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.910
Of course, we plan to
add more actions.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.870
And we want to listen from you
about what you think might be

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:27.870
useful to add.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.940
So we'll talk about it later,
but we want to know what you

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.270
plan to do with this.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.210
So we show all the four
types of actions.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.480
The other thing we're launching
is structured data

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.070
for specific items.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.850
And we talked about flights.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:50.810
A flight is easy to understand
piece of structured data.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.700
A flight has some specific
properties.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.460
So we know about those
properties.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.950
We know that a flight
has a departure

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.890
airport, an arrival airport.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.040
If you markup those properties
in the emails you send, then

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.100
we can show that as a
card in Gmail and in

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.920
Search and in Now.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.590
We can also add buttons
to that, like

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.390
check-in if you want.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:16.210
But another important thing here
is that Gmail will use

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.060
the markup you send us
to show the card.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:23.590
But also, Gmail will update the
information for a flight

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.310
once we know that is a flight
with live data.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.580
So you send us information about
a flight that leaves

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.690
tomorrow at 8:00.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.260
If tomorrow we realize that the
flight is delayed, Gmail

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.060
will know that.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.030
And when you open the card,
you will see the live

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.330
information.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:42.300
It will say that the flight
is delayed tonight.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.980
And same thing, we'll do the
other properties, like Google

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.600
[INAUDIBLE] will do.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.170
So we have these four types
of actions in flights.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.945
And you might have recognized
some names in the slides that

00:23:56.945 --> 00:23:57.920
I showed you.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.480
That's because today, we're
launching with many partners.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.110
We've been working with partners
in the past few weeks

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.240
and months.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:12.140
And today, we're very happy to
have many, many partners ready

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.110
to support this technology.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.980
You probably know and use
some of these products.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.520
Some of these names are here
at Google I/O, and would be

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.760
very happy to talk about their
integration and their

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.120
experience with this.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.820
They are upstairs in the third
floor in the Chrome &amp; Apps

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.250
sandbox area.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:39.490
And after this talk, Shalini
and I, the rest of the team

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:43.670
and the partners that are here,
we'll all be upstairs

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.310
for you to talk about this.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.530
So if you want to know more
about this, please join us

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.960
right after this in the Chrome
&amp; Apps sandbox area.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.420
So, OK, you know about
what you can do.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.780
You've seen what other
people have done.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.670
You might wonder, how
do I join this?

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.150
How do I do this myself?

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.680
Well, first of all, there is
the documentation we're

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.580
launching right now.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.380
It's probably live already.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.942
And that documentation is
at developers.googl

00:25:12.942 --> 00:25:18.170
e.com/gmail/schemas.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.890
So you can go there and find
all documentation about all

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.870
the types we support,
all the actions.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:23.535
There are examples.

00:25:23.535 --> 00:25:27.910
There are tutorials, anything
you need to get started now.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:28.880
And I want to stress this.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.290
You can start now.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.360
Because when you go home
tonight, you can test these

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.370
yourself by sending emails
with markup to yourself.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.510
This is a very, very easy
way for you to test it.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:47.890
So we care about user
experience.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.320
So we need to make sure that
what lands into production,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:56.690
what lands into everyone's
inbox is safe.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.710
But if you want to test it
yourself, you can just send

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.080
emails to yourself.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.300
And those will be processed
and rendered.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:08.360
So you have an immediate,
easy way to test it now.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.450
Once you test everything and
you have a compelling use

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:18.550
case, and you want to launch
this to production, please go

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.850
back to developers.googl
e.com/gmail/schemas.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.980
There is a page where
you can sign up.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.170
At that page, you will find a
forum where you can tell us

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.110
about your use case.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:35.270
And you can tell us about how
that work and what the

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.880
advantage the user have.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.370
Because what we want here is
not just to add buttons

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:41.090
everywhere.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.870
Because that doesn't really
help the users.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:48.130
What we want here is to add
exciting use cases, exciting

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.240
features, better ways
for your users to do

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.980
stuff inside Gmail.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.130
So please get back to us.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:00.450
And we promise to review your
application and get back to

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.590
you as soon as possible.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.590
We promise to be very quick.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.635
So everything is at
developers.googl

00:27:04.635 --> 00:27:09.670
e.com/gmail/schemas.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.960
And with that, I think
that's it.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.960
We showed you everything we
wanted you to know about this

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.430
for this launch.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.290
I just want to remind you that
we're going to be upstairs

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.130
after this talk, the whole team
is going to be there.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.550
But we still got 10 minutes
for questions.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.560
So Shalini and I
would be really

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.870
happy to get your questions.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.244
Thank you.

00:27:33.244 --> 00:27:38.164
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:38.164 --> 00:27:39.860
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Do
we need microphones?

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.420
Can you step to the
microphone?

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.230
I think it's going
to be recorded.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.890
It's actually Livestreamed.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.140
Hey, mom.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.970
AUDIENCE: So we have a service
that sends out event

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.160
recommendations to people, but
we've tried really hard to

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.630
make sure we don't overwhelm
people's inbox by bunching

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.220
those all together so
you get five or six

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.670
recommendations in one email.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.340
Can we have more than one action
associated with an

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.900
email, or do we need to send
a single email for a single

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.720
entity that can have an
action against it?

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.410
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So right
now, what we're going to

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.690
launch is a single action,
but that can be related

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.780
to a group of things.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.760
So the action, the single
call to action is

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.770
unique, one per email.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:28.120
But the entity can be actually
a group of entities, or

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.260
multiple things.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:33.200
Of course, the action then has
to either refer to one of them

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.270
or to all of them as a group.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.410
AUDIENCE: You showed some
interesting examples of cards

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.410
that sound like they're mapping
to specific actions,

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.136
like rating or RSVPing.

00:28:45.136 --> 00:28:49.000
What is the capacity for more
free-form customization to

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.580
build sort of our own more
customized type of forms that

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.460
may be presented
in that format?

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.760
SHALINI AGARWAL: So over
time, we'll be adding

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.655
more types of actions.

00:28:58.655 --> 00:29:02.260
But right now, there's not--

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.550
the customization lies within
the box that you saw in terms

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.530
of for RSVP, can you say
yes, or no, or maybe?

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:10.360
Or what are the options?

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.060
And the reason for that is that
we want to make sure that

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.120
we provide a consistent
user experience.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.910
Because if we allowed the UI to
be completely customized,

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.170
every email would
look different.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.590
Every box would look
different.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.050
And it would, again, be
difficult for users to figure

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.620
out what to do and
get things done.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.610
But we definitely want to hear
about your use cases because

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:28.465
we do want to add more
types of actions.

00:29:28.465 --> 00:29:30.840
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I think the
bottom line there is that we

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.990
want to add more actions, and
we want to talk to you about

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.840
them, what you actually need.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.050
But we need to find a fine
line between adding a new

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:44.672
auction and allowing everyone
to do anything.

00:29:44.672 --> 00:29:45.995
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:29:45.995 --> 00:29:47.500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.310
If outlook.com or Yahoo
Mail wanted to add

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.750
schemas, could they?

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.880
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You mean,
add to their emails?

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.180
So you could actually do the
same kind of things.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.300
So if I write one email with
schemas, then it would work in

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.340
Outlook and in Yahoo Mail?

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.310
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So as I said,
this technology is open.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:10.300
And we actually would like
them to support this.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.010
AUDIENCE: So it is open?

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.150
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Yeah, it is open.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.580
It's based on schema.org.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.680
And we are in talk with
some other companies.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.980
So some other big names know
about this already.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.070
And then, of course,
it's up to them to

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.040
implement it or not.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.850
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.200
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: But
yeah, it's open.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.160
That's a short answer.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.430
What other applications, other
than Gmail, will these actions

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:39.220
become available in within the
Google product offerings?

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.120
For instance, Voice--

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.970
will it tie-in with
Google Voice.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.140
Obviously, Google Now has access
to that information.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.980
Are there other places we should
look for to be able to

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.360
[? provide ?]

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.610
cards?

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:56.070
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So right now,
this schema is supported

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.560
by Gmail, Search, and Now.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:06.060
And not all of them support
the same entities

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.380
and the same actions.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.380
So the first step for us would
be to have all of them support

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.990
the same entities and
same actions.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.430
Of course, if that makes
sense for each client.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:21.960
Another Google property that
uses schema is Google+.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.330
So we're also standardizing
the entities we support

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.210
together with the
Google+ team.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:34.690
And we realize that schema helps
the web, helps other

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:35.250
properties.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:40.140
So we're adding schema support
to properties that you know.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.440
That makes sense.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.710
So far, we have identified
these four.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.730
So Gmail, Search, Now, and +.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.260
But if it makes sense for other
properties to support

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.830
schema, we'll be really
happy to do it.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.220
And everyone at Google
will be.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.010
AUDIENCE: I guess my
for-instance would be the

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:02.110
ability for not only Gmail to
be able to show a card, but

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.590
for other applications within
Google to be able to take the

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.850
same action.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.800
I understand the schemas
generally could

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.230
be parsed by anything.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.110
But from an action execution
standpoint, you're saying

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:19.420
that's still underway
or not necessary?

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.010
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah,
it's underway.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.390
We're definitely thinking about
adding actions to other

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:23.990
properties.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:29.890
One, let's say, implementation
detail, is that we have--

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.970
we share the parsing technology

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.020
at Google, of course.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.545
So it's easier for other
properties to use.

00:32:36.545 --> 00:32:37.395
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:32:37.395 --> 00:32:39.720
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Thank you.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.401
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:41.401 --> 00:32:46.120
In your example, say, where
you reviewed a restaurant.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.720
And at the end of it, you're
done, but the email's still in

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.510
your inbox.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.620
Is that going to be archived
automatically at some point.?

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.620
SHALINI AGARWAL: So right now
what happens is that once you

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.370
complete the action, the email
is marked as read.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.050
We do not auto archive the
email at the moment.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.070
If we see that as a strong
user request,

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.625
we'll think about it.

00:33:07.625 --> 00:33:09.900
But right now as we roll this
out, we want to be sure that

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.410
users understand what's
happening.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.804
So that's not going to
happen right now.

00:33:15.804 --> 00:33:16.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.640
I saw screenshots of the
list view and I saw

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.210
card in a body view.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.940
But do the other buttons
appear in the

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.620
body view as well?

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.700
So for example, like
do the review?

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.090
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You mean
when the email is open?

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:30.130
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.420
SHALINI AGARWAL: So all in-app
actions will appear in the

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.280
body view as well.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.100
So the one-click action
will appear.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.270
And rate and review has the
nice card, just like the

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.030
flights does.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.650
RSVP has a nice card, just
like the flights does.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:42.990
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.260
Thanks.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.050
Sorry, one other question.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:48.530
The goto action button, building
on the previous

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.460
question, does it show
completed, even if you have to

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.850
go to an external website
to complete the action?

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.020
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: The goto
action doesn't really have a

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.010
completed state.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.690
So it doesn't really change.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:01.940
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.520
Great.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.210
Thank you.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.800
For the developers that are
building on top of Gmail, like

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.780
third-party clients, how can we
make sure that these emails

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.960
are actually useful
to the user?

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.460
And do you have any help for
the developers to implement

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.690
the same type of actions
depending on the schemas?

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.240
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Well, one
thing is that the vocabulary,

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.000
the schema is public.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.350
So in the documentation,
we explicitly say

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.030
which types we support.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.780
And all the additions we added,
like all the new things

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.530
we added to the schema, are
being added to schema.org so

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.239
the public vocabulary, Or at
least are being considered by

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:49.489
schema.org.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.969
On a third-party side to support
this only takes--

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:00.230
well, what it takes is
constructing the markup and

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.960
supporting those
specific types.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.436
Then, the rendering--

00:35:03.436 --> 00:35:05.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do you have any
specific guidelines for

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:10.480
how it should be rendered and
how it should behave?

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.710
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I would
say not really.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.490
Because what we want is that
the user interface is

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.740
consistent within the client.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.735
So for Gmail, of course,
we know how

00:35:18.735 --> 00:35:19.460
that should look like.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.610
But another client, like the
same drop down we use for

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.660
Gmail might not be
the best UI.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:30.020
So we will not ask you to
implement any specific UI.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.340
And the only recommendation,
which is like a standard

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.550
recommendation, is to make sure
that that provides the

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.020
best user experience
and matches the

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.680
consistent user interface.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.560
AUDIENCE: If we have
like any--

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.220
is there a developer support
group that we can talk from

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.980
the client side, not from
the sender side?

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.670
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You
mean as a user

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.560
that gets these actions?

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.490
Well, for the third-party
developers who are building

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.860
email clients on top of Gmail.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.470
How can we get help from you?

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.820
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So we
have a page in the docs

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.690
that also says that.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:10.620
But as we're doing with many
other products at Google, we

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.680
decided to support developers
where they already are, which

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.650
is Stack Overflow.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.700
So we are there.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.030
And another thing that I always
advise is-- that is my

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.400
Google+ handle.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.790
Reach out to me directly.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.780
I'll be really happy
to talk to you--

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.870
all developers.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.640
And I'll point you to the
correct resource.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.060
AUDIENCE: This is a
quick question.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.920
I was just wondering if you guys
are looking at bringing

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.520
this to the mobile interfaces.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.060
So these actions on iOS
and the Android apps?

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:45.350
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.450
So we are working on mobile
as well, but it'll

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:48.953
take time to get out.

00:36:48.953 --> 00:36:49.700
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.720
SHALINI AGARWAL: I agree that
it's very useful on mobile.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.410
AUDIENCE: How do you manage the
authentication because all

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.490
the action comes in the
email that can be

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:04.690
forwarded or anything.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:09.160
How do you identify that the
email you sent is-- the action

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.030
is completed by the
person that you

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.620
intended to do the action?

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.950
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So we require
emails to be signed

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.090
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.410
To be signed so that we know who
the sender is and we can

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.430
guarantee that the sender is who
the sender pretends to be

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:26.630
or says he is.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:31.290
And at launch, what we're doing
right now is that we

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.300
have a white list.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.710
So you, as a developer, in order
for your markup to be

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.510
showed to all users, will have
to be added to the white list.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.730
So we will have you to
talk to us, tell us

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.380
about your use case.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.650
Show us what you'll do.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.990
We'll add you to
the white list.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.570
Then we know who you are.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.020
You sign your emails and that
proves that you are who you

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:52.863
say you are.

00:37:52.863 --> 00:37:53.226
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:53.226 --> 00:37:55.070
Just one other question.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:38:00.032
Are you considering more complex
actions, like a kind

00:38:00.032 --> 00:38:03.300
of rating, but for e-commerce?

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.550
When you write that you bought
something, but in the action

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:12.270
maybe you are confirming that
you bought that item and that

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.340
causes a charge to be billed
to the seller.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.800
And sometimes you can write
positive only if

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.160
you bought the item.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.980
Some logic inside the action,
are you considering

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.870
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:28.410
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Not at
this moment I would say.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.320
But yeah, that's another
use case we would

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.380
like to talk about.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.410
Let's talk about it later
if you're still around.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.810
Thank you.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.570
AUDIENCE: Sort of related to the
last two questions about

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:45.120
lack of mobile and another
need for degradation.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.980
If the recipient is not in a
supported mode or the sender's

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.510
not authenticated, is the
degradation just that the

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.570
actions don't show?

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.185
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah.

00:38:54.185 --> 00:38:56.630
So essentially we're
just being ignored.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.255
AUDIENCE: And then another
question is, does that affect

00:38:59.255 --> 00:39:02.410
the SMTP envelope
contents at all?

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:04.940
For like enterprise use, none
of this is going to be

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.600
archived as part of the
email itself, right?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.410
Or yes?

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.020
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Doesn't
affect anything?

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.760
It's part of the HTML body.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.410
So it's extra markup
in the HTML body.

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:22.750
Unless there's some other part
where that is stripped, or

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.490
prevented, or blocked,
or anything.

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.700
We don't do anything
to prevent that.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.220
It shouldn't affect it.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.380
SHALINI AGARWAL: It should get
delivered like any other

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.880
message at that point.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.760
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.040
AUDIENCE: Recently, you added
a feature in Gmail where you

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.440
can add to Calendar.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.690
Does that use you schemas?

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:45.210
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So there
are two things there.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:48.375
The Add to Calendar or the
integration with Calendar that

00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:50.340
you saw today and you will
see in the next days

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.780
are based on schema.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:56.680
That part also uses some
intelligence data.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.440
I mean, I think what you're
talking about is the feature

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.320
where Gmail, in the sense you're
talking about a date or

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.640
an event, right?

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.430
So that is actually based on
some other machine learning

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:11.590
things where we try to
understand that that email is

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.485
about an event invitation--

00:40:12.485 --> 00:40:12.780
AUDIENCE: Got you.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.460
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
If we get that.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.300
Because that is not really
in the email.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.410
That can be triggered by me
sending an email to you with

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:24.430
no markup and saying, hey, can
we go have a beer tomorrow?

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:25.160
AUDIENCE: That's
what I thought.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.200
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So yeah,
Gmail will understand that

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.080
with machine learning
technology.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.015
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Thank you.

00:40:31.015 --> 00:40:31.490
SHALINI AGARWAL: Great.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:32.915
I think we have another
question.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.940
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.380
There's Gmail Gadgets.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.230
I was wondering if you were
thinking of, in the future of

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.770
implementing a way
to launch a Gmail

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:49.690
Gadget from these actions?

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.880
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: I
don't think we have

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.120
any plans to do that.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:53.780
SHALINI AGARWAL: You're talking
about the gadgets on

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.080
the right-hand side of Gmail?

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.040
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Sidebar
gadgets or contextual gadgets?

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.950
AUDIENCE: No, the
Gmail Gadget.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:59.760
There's both.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.200
There's the full pain view
that you can get and then

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.560
there's also sidebar gadgets.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.700
I was wondering if there
was a way to interact?

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.590
SHALINI AGARWAL: Right now
there's no plans to do that.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.700
But tell us about what you'd
like to do and we can always--

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.255
AUDIENCE: Widgets, sorry.

00:41:10.255 --> 00:41:12.070
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, OK.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.260
Yeah, no plans.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.300
If there is a specific use case
you have in mind, let us

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.870
know, please.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.280
Thank you.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.660
SHALINI AGARWAL: All right,
I think we're out of time.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.630
So thank you very much.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:28.273
[APPLAUSE]
