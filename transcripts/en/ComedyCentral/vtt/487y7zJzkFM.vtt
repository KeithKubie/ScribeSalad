00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:08.008
- When I was little, I
had to get a real woman,

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.543 align:start size:84% position:16%
a real girl, and we
would go to the woods,

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.080
and I would try and
take her top off.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.515
For real.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.618
(slow dubstep music)

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.878
(cheering)

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.312 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So here's the
story with the show.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.048
Really simple, just a
bunch of funny people

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.849 align:start size:84% position:16%
who are all telling
true stories.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.317
I'm really excited
to have this guy,

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
he's one of the
funniest men in America,

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.456 align:start size:88% position:13%
Mr. Tom Papa, everybody,
let him hear it.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.427
- I have a lot of
women in my life.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.228
I've always had a lot
of women in my life.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.999 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was raised with girls,
my mom was a girl,

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.068
my grandmother was a girl,

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.969
I married a girl,

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.305
and now I've made my own girls.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.474 align:start size:84% position:16%
I have my own girls,
that I've made.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.975
Yeah, I made them.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.579
And people always ask me things,

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.750
like do you think they'll
end up working in a huh?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.518
And yeah, maybe.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:28.521
(audience laughing)

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.459
I mean they're little now.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
All I can go by is
their gymnastic moves,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.628
and they got that covered.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:36.496
They're good with that.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.498
(audience laughing)

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.366
Then it's just gonna
come down to desire.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.535
How badly do they want it?

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.039
They can make their
dreams come true.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.041 align:start position:0%
People always ask me, like,
are you worried about them now?

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.509 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like, are you
worried about kids?

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.044
I can't believe,
like with phones,

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.046 align:start size:94% position:6%
are you worried that these
kids have these phones?

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.216
I mean, I would hate raising
children now with these phones.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.451
Aren't you terrified of
what they're going to do

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.320
with these phones?

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.554
No.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.455 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm not worried
about them at all.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.289
They're gonna handle it.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.757
They'll be fine.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:05.959 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm not worried about what
it's gonna do to them.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.461 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm worried about
what it's doing to me.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.298 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's making me into a
nosy, boarish douchebag.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.269
I am spying on my own creatures.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.672
I made these people,
and I'm spying on them.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:20.940
It's so douchey.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.709
It's such an awful way to live.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.277
I don't care what they do.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:28.148 align:start size:97% position:3%
Why am I invading and
spying on what, you know...

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:28.982
Back off.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.653
You care that your son
is on boobs.com, really?

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.121
Really?

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.925
You're little guy's in there,
boobs, big boobs, dot cah.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.494
(audience laughing)

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:42.996
Is that really bad?

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:47.100 align:start size:97% position:3%
When I was little, I had to
get a real woman, a real girl,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.801
and we would go to the woods,

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.205
and I would try and
take her top off.

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.540
For real.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.208
(audience laughing)

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.076
Because there was
no dot anything.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.212
And we would just
do it until finally

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:00.647
she would take her top off,

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.382
and she was happy
and I was happy,

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.250 align:start size:84% position:16%
and our parents
didn't know about it.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.485
(audience laughing)

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.753
They weren't spying
through our shit.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.521
They weren't going
through my texts.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.123
They weren't doing any of that.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.090
So who cares?

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.325
Just back off.

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:13.660
Let them do what
they're gonna do.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.029
This is the way I've
always wanted to do it.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.931
You have tools, it's a tool.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:18.965
They have a tool.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.567
This is their tool to get laid.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.235 align:start size:81% position:19%
Everyone has a
tool in their era.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.670
This is their tool.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.839 align:start size:97% position:3%
You wanna get laid, you
gotta learn to use this tool.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:27.807
(audience laughing)

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:28.942
I needed a car.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.277
I needed a goddamn car.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.813
I needed to get in a
car and drive around

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:36.015
and look for women.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.383
That was my tool.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.918
And I knew that at a young age,

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:43.056
and I bought a car two years
before I was able to drive.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.324
(audience laughing)

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.825
I busted my ass.

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:48.962
I went out and bused tables
in a shitty little restaurant

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.464
called The Orchards
in a Hilton Hotel.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:54.033
I would just put
on a green bowtie

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.202
and I would walk at four
o'clock in the morning

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:59.072
down to the school, wait
for my friend to pick me up

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.640
because he had a car already,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I would just sit
there and shiver,

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.509
and he would come
and pick me up,

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.711
and he was the king.

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.012
He was the king.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:08.081 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I bided my
time, because I knew

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.616
you're not gonna be
the king for long.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.584
I might be in a
green bowtie now,

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.220
but I will be king
in two goddamn years.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.488
(audience laughing)

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.522
And I just kept working.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:17.523
I didn't get respect.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:18.758
I got my ass kicked.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.026
I was just sitting
there with a bowtie.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.761
People would just be
like, get over here.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.229
More water, boy.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.731
More rolls, boy.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.066
And I would just lick them
and put them in the basket.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:29.569
(audience laughing)

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.337
I was like yeah, I may
have a green bowtie,

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.239
but I'm a badass underneath it.

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.742
(audience laughing)

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.244
And I saved up, and I got $1600.

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.712
$1600.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:43.283 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I called my uncle, Uncle
Al, he ran a junk yard,

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.952
and we called him Uncle
Al, all the kids' pal,

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.987
because he always had weed.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.055
Always had a lot of weed.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.156
(audience laughing)

00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.524
Yeah, still does, still does.

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.459
And he's still our pal.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.528
And I said Uncle
Al, I got $1600.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.230
He said I got a car for you.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.331
I got a car for you.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.566
A used 1982 Toyota Corolla.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.203 align:start size:88% position:13%
I said that sounds
great, what color is it?

00:05:04.203 --> 00:05:05.805
He said baby shit orange.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.674
(audience laughing)

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.509
Sold, I'll take it.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.377
And I put it in my garage,

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:12.845 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I couldn't drive
it for two years.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.782
I'd just pet it, I would
pet it, and talk to it,

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.884
and just wait for the day
when I was able to go out

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.452
and find girls.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:21.621
And when I turned 17,
it was time to hunt.

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:22.889
It was like a hunting dog.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.257
I would just give it a scent.

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.492
I found a scrunchie in the park,

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.094
smell it boy, smell it.

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.462
(barking like a dog)

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.597
And we'd cruise around.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.066
And it worked, we got girls.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:34.934
We got girls in
baby shit orange.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:37.236 align:start size:84% position:16%
That was how powerful
having a car was.

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:39.572
And that's when I met Heidi,
I met this beautiful girl.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:41.741 align:start size:94% position:6%
She became my girlfriend,
she was gorgeous.

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:43.910
She was six feet tall.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.944
Six feet tall.

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:45.778
No, no.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:50.049
It wasn't the big scary
goonish six feet tall.

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:50.883
(audience laughing)

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:53.353
It wasn't like "hey Tom.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.989
I don't think I can fit
in baby shit orange."

00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:00.993 align:start size:97% position:3%
No, this was like long legs,
athletic, gorgeous girl,

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.729
and we would just, that was it,

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.831
we just got in baby shit
orange, we went everywhere.

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.566
To the beach, to the mountains,

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
just having sex
everywhere we went.

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:10.770
We were like sexual athletes.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.873 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just in between those
giant long legs,

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.742
and my parents didn't
know shit about it,

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.677
because they couldn't
go through my texts,

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:19.612
because it didn't exist.

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.247
It didn't exist.

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:22.715
I learned everything from her.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:25.184 align:start size:84% position:16%
I learned how to
please a woman orally

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:28.121
from because you're 17, stamina.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.322
They don't make a drug

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:31.224 align:start size:84% position:16%
that could make me
that strong right now.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.559
They don't, it does not exist.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:36.229 align:start size:94% position:6%
If you're 17, you are
like, you're like a lion,

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.730
you're just so...

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.165
But you're not good.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.366
You're not good.

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.300
(audience laughing)

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.201
It's not gonna last long.

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.870
It's gonna be blah!

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.405
And just, it's gonna be over.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.640
And that's where you learn to
please a woman another way.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.576
And if you have a man in your
life that pleases you orally,

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.078
it's not because
he cares about you.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.646 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's because he
doesn't last very long.

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:56.315
(audience laughing)

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:57.784
He needs different skills.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.252
And we never caught.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.520
We never got caught, we just,

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.121
getting laid for years.

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:05.658
I would literally drive
my car home for curfew,

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.627 align:start size:84% position:16%
go to bed, say
goodnight to everyone,

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.762
wait for them to sleep,
and around midnight,

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.832 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'd open my window, I'd
go out on the garage roof,

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.667
I would hang on the gutter,

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:17.370 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'd hang my little
legs down until I felt

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.639
the banister below me,

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.174
then I'd get on that.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.509
All those moves took like a
half hour, each one of them.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.344
I was just, do I hear anything?

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:26.546
Do I hear anything?

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:28.014
And then drop.

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:29.749 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then I'd push baby shit
orange into the street,

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:31.984
and we would just
cruise down, no,

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:34.654
and then pop it into gear, wing.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.057 align:start size:88% position:13%
Go up to Heidi's house,
park in her bushes,

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:39.826
and she lived like way down here

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.227 align:start size:81% position:19%
and her parents
were way up there,

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:42.595 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I would just
climb in her window,

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:45.498
and we'd have sex
every single night.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:48.267 align:start size:97% position:3%
And baby shit orange just
stood there, waiting for me.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:49.902 align:start size:84% position:16%
And would go back,
and I'd climb back in,

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:53.139 align:start size:97% position:3%
and every night, I never got
caught, never got caught.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.475
Until one night, one night,

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.410
in the middle of
these long legs,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.113
I'm doing what I was taught
to do in an oral manner,

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.415
(audience laughing)

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:04.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the door opened,
the door opened,

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:08.855
and the light just shone on
my 17 year old white ass.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.191
It was her father.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.759
It was her father.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.461
And this is what he says.

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.797
"Tom, it's time to go home now."

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:20.833
(audience laughing)

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.969
That was it, and
closed the door.

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.904
And closed the, I
was freaked out.

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:26.706
I'm like what do I do?

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:29.008
Do I just put my clothes on
and go out the front door?

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.910
He knows I'm here.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.312 align:start size:81% position:19%
Do I have to climb
out the window?

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:34.480
I think I'm...

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.082 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'll go out the
window, he's probably,

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:37.550
he acted so cool.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.420 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm like he probably has
an ax in the hallway.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.923
Let me just go out the window.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:45.725
So I went out the window,
and I loved this girl,

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.394
she was my girlfriend, so I
had to come back the next day

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.696 align:start size:84% position:16%
and confront the
father and apologize,

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.665
because I loved her, I
wanted to be with her.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.701 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I actually got in
my car, it was a Sunday,

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.804
and I drove up to her
house to apologize

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.407
to the father this girl.

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:04.310 align:start size:84% position:16%
I had such stronger
character at 17

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.848
than I have right now.

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:12.919 align:start size:97% position:3%
If that happened right now,
I'd never see this girl again.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:16.222
I would just get in baby shit
orange and just go, leave,

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.723
to another state.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.125
But I was like no,
I'm gonna do it,

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.427
I'm gonna sit down, I'm
just gonna apologize.

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:23.062 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I remember he
was watching tennis.

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:24.130
He was watching tennis.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.398
He didn't even look up.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.067
I was like, man, I'm
really really sorry.

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.969
I didn't mean to be in,

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:31.938
I know it was late.

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:33.773
I shouldn't have been in here.

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:35.007
Voice all cracking.

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:36.909 align:start size:84% position:16%
I didn't say exactly
what I was doing,

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:38.511
because I didn't
know what he saw.

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.212
I don't wanna be like, I
really shouldn't have been

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:42.415
going down on her, but
I don't last that long.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.418
(audience laughing)

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:48.254 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I just went with
the, it's late,

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.789
I'm so sorry, it
was really late.

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:50.723
And this is what he says.

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.725
He goes, whoa, you kids,

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:54.927
and kept watching tennis.

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.462
(audience laughing)

00:09:56.462 --> 00:10:00.266 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was like, this is
the greatest man alive.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:03.202
Forget Gandhi, this
guy is at peace.

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:04.670
This guy is centered,

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.306
this guy is just one
with the universe.

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:09.075
I'm like, I'm gonna be this guy.

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:12.211
When I get older, this is the
father that I'm going to be.

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.781
I'm gonna be so
chill and so zen,

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.683 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm gonna be exactly
like this guy,

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.051
because he didn't kill me.

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.454
And I'm gonna be this guy.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.288
And I...

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.559
Fast forward, I've
made my own people.

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.860
I've made my own people.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.129
I have a daughter, and
my wife just tells me...

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:30.963
- [Audience Member] Woo!

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:32.164
- Thank you.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:33.399
And my wife tells me,

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.767
just sitting there
chopping vegetables,

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:36.135
just lets it be known,

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.837 align:start size:84% position:16%
just kind of out of
the side of her mouth,

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:39.705
just like it's nothing,

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:42.141
you know there's a boy
texting your daughter.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:42.975
- [Audience Member] Woo.

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:43.809
- Woo.

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:47.179
That would've been
the zen response.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:48.014
Woo.

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.583
But I didn't.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:54.253
I just yelled out, get
me her fucking phone.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:57.056
(audience laughing)

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:59.492
(applauding)

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:03.496
No zen, no nothing.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:08.034 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't even use, I don't
curse a lot in my life ever,

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:11.404
and now in front of my
little daughter and cats

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.205
and everybody else,

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.441
I just blurt out,
in my own kitchen,

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:17.510
get me her fucking phone.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.012
And this is how awful,

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:22.381
this is why I feel
so nosy and shitty.

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:25.384
I get her phone, and I'm like
all right, I'm gonna bleah,

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:26.986 align:start size:84% position:16%
let's see what this
is about, where is it?

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:30.489
I know her code, I
can use this, blah.

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:31.624
Oh here he is.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.826
Here he is, the little shitbird.

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:37.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
Let's see what he's
doing with our daughter.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.833
First text is like, what are
you gonna be for Halloween?

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.535
I'm thinking of Batman, hahaha.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.837 align:start size:84% position:16%
She's like oh, I might
be Snow White, LOL,

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:46.706
rainbow rainbow unicorn.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.709
(audience laughing)

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.844
What's you're favorite candy?

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:52.778
Kit Kat bars.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:53.612
Me too.

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:54.647
Pizza pizza.

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:55.481
Nyah.

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:59.051 align:start size:94% position:6%
Little thing dancing, I
can't wait for the parade,

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.687 align:start size:94% position:6%

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.189
smiley face, nyah.

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:06.892
(audience laughing)

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:09.028
What a piece of shit I am.

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:10.796
(audience laughing)

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.264
Total piece of shit.

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.700
(applauding)

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:20.005
So I'm off.

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:23.542 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm not gonna go through
her phone anymore.

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:27.313
I will take a drill and
bolt her window shut,

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:30.850
(audience laughing)

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.384 align:start size:81% position:19%
but I'm gonna stay
off her phone.

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:33.319
Thank you guys so much.

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:35.988
(dubstep music)
