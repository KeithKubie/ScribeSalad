and I'm coming to you from the
Firebase Dev Summit in Berlin.

00:00:06.744 --> 00:00:08.910
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.580

Test Lab virtual devices.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.950
Firebase Test Lab for Android
allows you to test your apps

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.230
and ensure their compatibility
with multiple device

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.280
configurations across OS
versions, screen orientations,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.489

goodbye to the Eclipse Android

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.060
Developer Tools.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.560
We have formally ended their
support and development,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.680

never been a better time

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.780
to switch to Android
Studio and experience

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.620
