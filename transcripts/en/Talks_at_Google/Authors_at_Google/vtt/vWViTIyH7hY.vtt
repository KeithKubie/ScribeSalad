[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.126
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
Everyone please welcome Luvvie.

00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:11.118
LUVVIE AJAYI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:11.118 --> 00:00:12.910
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
So good to see you.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.348
Like, this is so, so great
that you see how much attention

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:17.140
you're [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.182
LUVVIE AJAYI: Oh, my God.

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:19.890
I was, like, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.182
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: Yes,
that's so hopefully, like,

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:25.402
after the conversation,
and hopefully, you

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:26.860
get the chance of
reading the book.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.710
It's truly amazing.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.030
You will follow this
woman even further.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.390
You were telling me this is
the fourth or fifth office

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.220
you have--

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.560
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.280
This is, like, my fourth
or fifth Google Office.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.655
So now I'm, like,
I need to have,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:39.909
like, a Google bucket list.

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:41.076
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: Yes!

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:41.640
LUVVIE AJAYI: And go
all over the world

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.840
and see how many Google
locations I can go to.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.946
So I can eat all the snacks,
because that's what I do.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.828
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:51.370
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: So actually--

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.530
no, before we start
the conversation,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.250
there is a sentence
that really caught me.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.200
And that's more
from your TED Talk.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.680
And it's a bit in connection
with what we just listened,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.760
which is in a world that
wants us to whisper,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.920
you choose to yell.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.250
And you're not
saying that everyone

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.460
should be yelling,
necessarily, but definitely

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.318
we all have a big
role to play there.

00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:21.110
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.527
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: And that's

00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:25.030
very inspiring how you
intentionally said that's it.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.670
I'm going to be speaking
loud about this.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.645
What trigger?

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:29.770
LUVVIE AJAYI: What trigger?

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.830
Because I've just never been the
person to be quiet when I feel

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.150
cheated.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.930
Ever since I was little, I
was the kid who even though--

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.330
whenever I got in trouble, I
got in trouble for my mouth.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.872
I wasn't the kid that would get
in trouble for climbing trees

00:01:42.872 --> 00:01:45.280
and, like, just
being disruptive.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.540
I was being disruptive
with my mouth.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.870
So if I felt like
somebody did or said

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.200
something that either took
advantage of me or cheated me,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.170
I always had to say something
even if it got me in trouble.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.280
So being Nigerian, we are very--

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.842
we revert to our elders.

00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:04.300
So we are supposed to kind of
take the backseat to somebody

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.830
who's older than us.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.620
I never believed in that mantra.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.988
So it always got me in trouble.

00:02:09.988 --> 00:02:11.530
So for example, if
somebody is older,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.090
let's say, comes
up to you and says,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.640
like, you should
give me your seat.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.700
In Nigerian custom, you
would give up your seat.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.670
Me, I'd be, like,
I was here first.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.600
No!

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.030
So it's just this
thing where I've always

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.880
been compelled to
speak up whenever I

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.130
felt like something wasn't OK.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.200
And it kind of followed
me through adulthood.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.400
Now I'm always like, why don't
we point it out, or point out

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400
something that's not OK?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.730
Why are we constantly
quiet and allowing things

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.530
to happen that we don't like?

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.595
I am a huge fan of boundaries.

00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:46.720
I think everybody needs to
operate with boundaries,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.658
because it'll make life
easier for everybody,

00:02:48.658 --> 00:02:50.200
as opposed to being
silently mad when

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.575
somebody crosses your boundaries
and you don't tell them.

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:54.123
So it's all part
of the same thing.

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:55.790
So I've always kind
of been this person.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.940
And when we talk
about injustice,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.728
I'm just, like, you know,
how do we find ourselves

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:03.145
in the place where we find
ourselves, where we look around

00:03:03.145 --> 00:03:05.080
and we're, like,
things are not OK?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.150
I always say it's because
well-meaning people are

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.020
being quiet.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.970
We spend so much of
our lives just deep

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.580
sighing anytime things
are inconveniencing us,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.080
as opposed to saying,
you know what?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.060
I don't like that thing
that you just did.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.680
I prefer you don't do it.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.440
In that moment, it is
really uncomfortable, right?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.110
Because you're, like,
I'm going to offend them.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.330
But you just told
somebody something

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.630
that can allow them to
adjust their behavior.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.120
Instead, we just
assume people know.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.380
So I use the example of,
OK, who here gets tagged in,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.250
like, random Facebook posts that
have nothing to do with you?

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.070
Who here actually likes it?

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.480
None of us, right?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.042
So instead you're just, like,
oh, I hate when they do that.

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:48.000
And they keep it going.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.500
And then it happens again, and
then you get irritated again.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.390
What I do is, I literally will
message the person, no matter

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.360
if they are my friend, if
they're my uncle, my cousin.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.450
I'd be, like, hey.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.520
So listen, tagging
me to Facebook posts,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.270
I don't like it.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.520
Because then it
overruns my timeline.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.780
I appreciate you.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.140
I saw it.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.660
But try not to do that.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.440
And they'll be, like,
oh, you know what?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.940
OK.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.300
You're right.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.920
I won't do it again.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.870
They'll do it to
everybody else still.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.080
But I won't be in there no more.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.459
And I'm, like well,
I've said my piece.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:17.959
So yeah.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.000
I just think-- it just
makes life easier.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.530
Because then everyone gets
to adjust their behavior

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.930
and then not annoy
each other so much.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.460
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: Absolutely.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.260
So actually, what
you're just seeing here

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.810
is actually what you feel
when you're reading the book.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.860
Because you're constantly in our
face with, like, very strong--

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.810
I mean, you're judging us.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.800
LUVVIE AJAYI: And me.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.250
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: That's clear.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.900
And you're judging
yourself through that.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.000
But it's always with a
very strong sense of humor.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.638
But you don't-- you're not
afraid of being very much--

00:04:45.638 --> 00:04:46.430
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.850
I'm very straightforward.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.090
When people say-- so I've
never necessarily thought

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.990
I was funny.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.990
So when I read my own
writing, I rarely laugh.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.000
Because I actually
mean what I just wrote.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.822
I said it with a straight face.

00:04:57.822 --> 00:04:59.030
So other people are laughing.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.834
I'm, like, I actually meant it.

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:03.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.290
But I think humor is
really pointing out

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.680
the absurdities of the world.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.880
I think comedy is actually
in just talking about what

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.230
is happening around you.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.770
So my writing is funny to
people because it's just me

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.260
pointing out what's
ridiculous that we're seeing.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.690
And I write like I speak.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.390
So people who know
me in real life

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.700
will say I hear your voice
when I'm reading your book.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.290
And I think that's the
ultimate compliment.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.650
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: Totally.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.120
LUVVIE AJAYI: Because
it means that no matter

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.537
what platform
you're seeing me on,

00:05:30.537 --> 00:05:34.352
whether it is a TED Talk,
or my podcast, or my book,

00:05:34.352 --> 00:05:36.560
or in person, it's always
going to be the same person

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.470
that you get.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.830
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: Yeah.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.872
I mean, it's interesting.

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:40.880
Because I have a toddler.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.880
I think she's a monster,
even if he's very nice.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.838
LUVVIE AJAYI: Toddlers
are absolutely monsters,

00:05:44.838 --> 00:05:45.900
absolutely.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.310
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: I mean, doesn't

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.930
mean that you don't love
her, and that's she's funny.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.110
But--

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.700
LUVVIE AJAYI: They are monsters.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.700
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
There's a monster part of her.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.350
LUVVIE AJAYI: Absolutely.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.850
Toddlers-- see here's the thing.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.330
My theory is that toddlers
are supposed to be monsters,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.220
because they're so cute.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.518
You cannot have a
well-behaved cute child.

00:06:00.518 --> 00:06:01.310
It's just too much.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.020
That's too good.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.340
I feel like it's like
an inverse relationship.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.980
The cuter they are, the less
they know how to behave.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.364
It is just life's balance.

00:06:10.364 --> 00:06:12.590
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: That's great.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.490
So very interesting-- so you
published the book in 2016.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.240
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.700
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: You
have said that at that time

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.840
it was, like, your
voice at your best.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.940
LUVVIE AJAYI: Um--

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.940
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
Would you say that, still--

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.110
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.080
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
--after a few years?

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.610
LUVVIE AJAYI: I would say so.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.527
I'm still very proud of
the book that I wrote.

00:06:29.527 --> 00:06:31.700
I wrote my book 2015.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.540
So May 2015 till October
2015, so five months--

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.300
and for almost four
years now, my book

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.980
is still as timely
as it was then.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.260
And I set out to write
a book that was timely.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.843
I wanted my book to be the book
where if somebody picked it up

00:06:44.843 --> 00:06:47.480
in five, six years, it's
still relevant to their lives,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.070
and it's still
relevant to the world.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.260
And that is the
book that I wrote

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.927
and that's the book
I'm really proud of.

00:06:51.927 --> 00:06:54.110
And what I'm seeing
lately is that there's

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.008
this resurgence of my book.

00:06:56.008 --> 00:06:57.800
I don't know if people
are rediscovering it

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.173
because of my TED Talk.

00:06:59.173 --> 00:07:00.840
But every day I get
tagged on Instagram.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.340
And people would be, like, I'm
at my desk reading this book.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.240
And I might get in
trouble, but I'm just

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.210
going to read here and
sit here and laugh.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.890
So it's actually, yeah, it
is my voice at its best.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.913
It is kind of my
manifesto, if anything.

00:07:13.913 --> 00:07:15.455
So if you ever want
to know who I am,

00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:18.260
read that book and it will
tell you exactly who I am.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.760
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: But
it's very interesting, actually.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.850
Because I'm Spanish.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.820
Something that has happened
over the last couple of years

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.060
is the 8th of March has become
something very different

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.050
and actually has united
women across political views

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.852
or perspectives.

00:07:34.852 --> 00:07:36.060
And it has become a movement.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.140
We also had the Me Too movement.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.930
So that there's
something in particular

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.050
that people is less afraid
of calling out things

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.632
that they're not
comfortable with.

00:07:43.632 --> 00:07:44.340
LUVVIE AJAYI: Um.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.570
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
Do you see that?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.040
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.440
And I think it comes with
us kind of peer pressuring

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.630
each other to do that.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.588
So we peer pressure each
other to go to parties

00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:54.080
and do random
things, and, like--

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.080
we do that all the time.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.455
So I'm always,
like, why can't we

00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:59.900
peer pressure ourselves and
each other to do better things?

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.700
So my whole thing is
my writing and the work

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.120
that I've been doing
for a long time is

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.400
I'm hoping that with me
being who I am, like, really

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.208
real in the way I talk and how
I show up in a room as myself

00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:16.750
no matter what room I'm in, I'm
hoping that it shows somebody

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.635
else that you can do the same.

00:08:18.635 --> 00:08:20.260
And I'm hoping that
with me speaking up

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.090
as this black girl who was born
in Nigeria, went to the US,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.388
I know what it's like
to be marginalized.

00:08:28.388 --> 00:08:29.680
And I still choose to speak up.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.971
Even in spite of the
consequences that may come.

00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:34.179
I'm hoping it really does
encourage somebody and give

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:38.630
them the words, the language,
and the courage to speak up.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.200
I actually just got a
LinkedIn message last night

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.490
from somebody who said they are
taking a case at their office

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.475
to HR, because they
watched my TED Talk.

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:49.600
And it gave them the courage
to say, you know what?

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.430
I'm going to stand
up for myself.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.890
And for me, those messages
are the best ones,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.160
because it tells me
that I'm actively

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.980
making people step outside
their comfort zone--

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.800
strictly because I do that
for myself all the time.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.150
So yeah, I do think it's
a moment for us to kind

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.120
of squad up in that way.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.260
Speak up more.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.150
And then back each
other up when we do it.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.490
So I'm hoping more of
us have the courage

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.810
to start speaking up more.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.280
Because I don't want
it to be extraordinary.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.598
I don't want the
person who is telling

00:09:21.598 --> 00:09:23.140
the truth in the
meeting all the time

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.930
and challenging people on the
bad campaigns and you know,

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.200
and saying, you know,
yeah, that person has said

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.820
this thing that was offensive.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.820
I'm hoping that person who's
always stepping up on an island

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.310
by themselves, I'm hoping they
have partners next time they

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.580
step up.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.880
I mean, so it's
no longer, here I

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.700
am about to challenge this thing
again because nobody else is

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.758
going to say anything.

00:09:43.758 --> 00:09:45.550
I'm hoping that person
walks in the meeting

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.350
and says I'm going
to challenge this.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.600
And I'm going to have backup,
because somebody else is

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.430
going to actually
speak up and say

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.920
I believe what they just said.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.712
So that's the goal.

00:09:53.712 --> 00:09:55.420
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
So actually, it's

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.200
very nice to see the room.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.318
It's very diverse.

00:09:58.318 --> 00:09:59.110
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.590
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: And actually,

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.548
something that we're
trying to encourage people

00:10:01.548 --> 00:10:04.230
more and more is, like, we
need allies in other fronts,

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.235
other perspective.

00:10:05.235 --> 00:10:07.360
LUVVIE AJAYI: So I want to
challenge people to even

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.510
be beyond allies.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.760
Allies are passive.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.270
So allies are the people who
are, like, yeah, I understand,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.010
and I see that that
thing is not OK.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.050
That's an ally.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.560
Cool, that's cute.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.827
I think we're past the point
where allyship is useful.

00:10:24.827 --> 00:10:26.660
Because a lot of people
will be, like, well,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.650
I'm an ally because
I do think everyone

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.810
should have equal rights.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.283
But then, OK, you think it.

00:10:33.283 --> 00:10:34.700
What are you going
to do about it?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.880
So that's where the
accomplice comes in.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.073
We need more accomplices.

00:10:38.073 --> 00:10:39.490
And those are
people who are going

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.000
to be active about their
beliefs and their thoughts.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.760
So you're the person
who is, like, yes,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.350
I saw that person be
disrespected in the meeting.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.300
The allies saw it.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.790
The accomplice walks up
to the person and says,

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.200
are you going to
make any action?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.180
Do you need my backup?

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.140
That's the accomplice.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.220
We need more accomplices.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.740
Everyone is so comfortable
because you're, like, I'm

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.760
an ally.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.810
And they're, like, yes.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.220
Yay, me.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.520
But if you are an ally and
you haven't done anything,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.270
what are you an ally of?

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.850
You know, how have you made a
difference in a tangible way.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.030
So it's a concept that I
learned from the protesters

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.210
of Ferguson, allies
versus accomplices.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.550
Their whole thing
is we have to be

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.428
more accomplices and less ally.

00:11:26.428 --> 00:11:27.970
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: That's great.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.990
Really appreciate.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.020
So another metaphor that
you use that I think

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.940
helps very much, you talk
about the domino effect,

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.450
that people don't have to be
at the front of the rights

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.190
movement.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.125
But it can be a little act
that can cause that effect.

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:46.750
Can you can you talk
to us a little bit

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.190
about that perspective?

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.940
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.880
It's just the idea
of a domino, when

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.880
you hit one and all of
sudden the rest of them fall.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.800
Life kind of operates
the same way.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.870
There usually has to
be one person that

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:04.150
makes a move, really, one
catalyst who will then allow

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.220
everybody else to follow them.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.040
But here's the thing is
we're always afraid to one,

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.030
be the catalyst.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.080
Because it is scary.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.730
Because it probably means you're
putting yourself out there.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.380
It probably means you're
stepping outside your comfort

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:14.905
zone.

00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:18.220
It probably means you're going
to do something scary, right?

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.100
And we're always waiting
for that one other person

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.190
to do it first, as opposed to
taking it upon ourselves to be

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.400
that person.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.910
So if everybody's waiting
for the one person,

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.642
who's going to be
that one person?

00:12:29.642 --> 00:12:31.600
So I'm always, like,
well, somebody in the room

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.430
has to choose and
make the decision,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.730
because it is a decision,
to be the first one, to be

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.800
the domino who will then allow
everybody else to follow them.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.500
For the MeToo movement,
it was to Tarana Burke.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.900
She started the MeToo
organization 12 years ago.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.530
So when it became a hashtag
and everyone was, like, MeToo,

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.970
she was, like, oh.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.500
She was a catalyst.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.238
So if we don't have catalysts,
then how do movements happen?

00:12:57.238 --> 00:12:58.780
Because then we
think about movements

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.750
in terms of these grand
gestures, the Civil Rights

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.250
movement, and all
these big things.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.910
So it feels too big for
us as regular people.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.210
We're just, like, I
can't be that person.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.400
And I always say,
take the pressure off.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.480
It's not necessarily
about starting a movement.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.510
It's about doing one thing.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.660
And that one thing could
end up spreading wildly,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.268
but it might not.

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:22.810
But at least, just
do that one thing.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:23.620
Start somewhere.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.700
So it's, like, a tweet.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.533
You tweet something,
one person might see it

00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:28.300
or zero people might see it.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.250
Or 30,000 people might see it.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.510
100,000 people might see it.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.260
You never know.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.380
By just doing the thing
that you're compelled to do

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.080
and not letting the
fear of consequence

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.810
always stop you--
because I always

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.425
let people know that
I know in a room

00:13:43.425 --> 00:13:45.050
where I'm sitting in
front of the room,

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.860
I am in a position of
power and privilege,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.790
even if I sit in a
room as a black girl.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.830
And in those moments,
my job is to disrupt

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.870
what's happening
because I have the mic.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.500
Right?

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.290
So we usually
think of ourselves,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.090
sometimes we think of ourselves
as what we are marginalized in.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.090
We think of ourselves
as less powerful

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.280
than we are, just
because we're, like, I'm

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.010
a woman in an industry
that is full of men.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.730
Well, are you the VP
of the department?

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.850
You are powerful then.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.183
You are way more powerful
than certain men in that room.

00:14:18.183 --> 00:14:21.780
Use that power in a way that's
going to push something forward

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.765
and yeah, make the room
that you're in better.

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:27.390
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: That's awesome.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.640
So you say black girl.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.390
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yes.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.350
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
That's actually a theme

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.260
that we talk a lot about it.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.080
I was talking with Jacqueline
that runs the black [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.180
organization here in Dublin.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.880
And she tells me that
more and more you see

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.360
how these themes interconnect.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.648
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:14:45.648 --> 00:14:48.190
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: It's,
like, when is the glass ceiling

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.523
and when is the [? iron ?] cast?

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.580
How do you choose?

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.090
Do you choose something to
battle as a woman, or something

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.093
to battle as a black
person, or actually,

00:15:01.093 --> 00:15:02.510
because we're
seeing more and more

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.750
that actually
everything is much more

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.880
complex and interconnected.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.250
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.740
Everything is definitely
more complex, interconnected.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.830
As a black woman,
I'm seen as black

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.500
first before a
woman often, right?

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.520
So when we talk about diversity,
when we talk about power, when

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.670
we talk about access,
the black usually

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.250
will come first, because people
see that in a different way

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.410
as they see white women.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:25.910
Right?

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.040
So a white woman is
seen as woman first,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.660
not white first, woman.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.850
So that means our
issues are different,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.220
and they're multilayered.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.070
And the things that we hit
against are also different.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.240
So as a black woman, not only
am I dealing with the womanhood

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.600
and having to make sure I am
not too assertive in a room

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.360
so people don't think I'm
bossy, which I don't care about,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.230
then I have to deal
with the black.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.370
Which if you are too
confident, or if you speak up

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.160
without emojis in
your tones, people

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.805
think you're too aggressive,
which I also don't care about.

00:16:05.805 --> 00:16:07.680
But I have the privilege
to not care about it

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.350
because I work for myself.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.960
And I move in spaces
where I don't have bosses.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.780
And I understand that people
who are in the offices

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.850
are constantly having
to deal with this.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.510
Be clear that the black
woman who is your co-worker

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.470
is constantly checking her email
over and over again before she

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.680
presses send because she's
afraid that somebody's

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.880
going to go to HR and
say she's too short

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.820
because she didn't put an
extra please or a compliment

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.710
sandwich.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.130
You know the
compliment sandwich.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.020
You want to ask
somebody for a report,

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.538
and you need it by 5:00 PM.

00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:41.580
So you have to be, like,
oh, my God, hey, girl, I

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.860
love your hair.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.410
You're looking bomb today.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:47.940
Can I get this report by 5:00?

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.440
Your shoes are fire.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.400
Thank you.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.383
You've got to send this
email with all these niceties

00:16:54.383 --> 00:16:56.050
and then you put your
ask in the middle,

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.592
so people don't
feel-- because if you

00:16:57.592 --> 00:17:00.140
send an email that's, like,
hey, I need this report by 5:00.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.440
Thanks.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.200
Oh, my God.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.950
Why is she so sharp
to me in email?

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.480
You're, like, I was on
the go sending this email.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.980
I just sent what I needed.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.170
You added tone to it--

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.339
tone that wasn't there.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.609
And people have to constantly
do this in corporate.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.250
And because you have
to do your actual job

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.740
and then massage people's
egos as your second job,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.369
that is exhausting.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:29.060
And oftentimes, when I talk to
people of color in corporate,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.030
this is a huge
issue, huge issue,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.370
where they're, like, I
can't show up as myself.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.040
Because every single
day, I have to play

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.080
the role of nonthreatening
black person to my co-worker who

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.650
sees me and automatically sees
tone in what I just sent them

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.300
when there was no tone.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.930
So it's one thing
that I always--

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.700
I need people to get out
their feelings in business.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.590
If your co-worker sends
you a one sentence

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.580
email that's, like, hey, I
need this thing at 5:00 PM.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.260
Where's the tone?

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.950
Where did you find that tone?

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.200
And this happens all the time.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.090
People go to HR.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.882
I know people who work
in HR who are, like,

00:18:05.882 --> 00:18:08.240
yeah, no, the reports I get
are absolutely ridiculous.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.972
Adults are really sensitive.

00:18:09.972 --> 00:18:11.180
They'll be, like, oh, my God.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.732
She was just really short to me.

00:18:12.732 --> 00:18:13.940
Why was she short me with me?

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.500
Well, she sends
these emails, right,

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.994
where she just asks for stuff?

00:18:16.994 --> 00:18:18.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.260
And you're like, what
was she supposed to do?

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.270
Write you a tome and a
poem and then [INAUDIBLE]??

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.597
So I need adults to
get out their feelings.

00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:29.180
I need people to do
business properly.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.460
And I need people understand
that there's unconscious

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.770
bias that they carry.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.350
Right?

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.570
The girl who walks in the office
who is not a morning person,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.090
who's, like, I can't talk
to nobody before 11 o'clock.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.920
I'm that person.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.040
I can't deal with people
before 11 o'clock.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.340
So I know I wouldn't
do well in corporate.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.757
You all would just
think I'm rude.

00:18:47.757 --> 00:18:49.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.600
I would be written up
by HR a couple of times.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.060
So they'd be, like, she
doesn't talk before noon.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.660
Guys, I don't drink
coffee, either.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.193
So listen.

00:18:57.193 --> 00:18:58.610
I need to get my
energy naturally.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.900
So give me some hours.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.735
But I need people to understand
that unconscious bias is

00:19:02.735 --> 00:19:06.380
a huge part of our lives.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.530
How we walk in a room and the
things that we automatically

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.220
expect of people and how we
project things on people--

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.320
we're constantly projecting
our own issues on other folks.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.530
So we're, like, well, this
person was mean to me,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.450
or this person was short to me.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.570
I had somebody who told
me because I told her

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:28.020
that the work that she
did, I didn't love it,

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.330
I was demeaning her.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.490
Demean by saying,
hey, like, I actually

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.980
think you should fix that,
because there's this error.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.250
This person sees
that as demeaning.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.210
Now think about that.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.870
It's two things.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.990
There's always two
stories, right?

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.400
There's always one person
who's, like, well, I'm not sure

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.483
what I did that was wrong.

00:19:47.483 --> 00:19:49.683
There's always one person
who's deeply offended.

00:19:49.683 --> 00:19:51.100
And there's actually
what probably

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.760
happened in the middle.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.480
Yes, maybe I could
have been nicer.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.110
But I doubt the word
demean and attack.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.030
That's another
thing that happens

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.140
in corporate and in offices
and just in general.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.640
Black women get accused
of bullying co-workers.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.520
People use the word attack
and bully against us

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.980
very often, as opposed to being,
like, we had an interaction

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.600
that didn't feel friendly.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.670
Or it maybe felt short.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.570
People would actually
be, like, I felt bullied.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.490
And I'm, like, whoa.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.990
How did we get there?

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.530
It's subconscious bias.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.150
And we walk with it every day.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.097
We carry these chips
on our shoulders.

00:20:30.097 --> 00:20:32.430
And we sometimes think we are
allies to the point we're,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.630
like, oh, we're so good.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.630
But a lot of well-meaning people
do racist and prejudiced things

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.100
to co-workers, to
friends, friends, right?

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.310
So people they approach
every single day.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.060
And then when they're
challenged about it,

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.070
they instantly feel
attacked and bullied.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.570
Right?

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.290
Because when you are not used
to being checked all your life,

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.080
any type of challenge will
come across as an attack.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.330
And it's something that
people deal with all the time.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:03.080
And I always wonder if
people are aware that this

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.350
happens right under their nose.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.090
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: So I
mean what you say is, like,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.028
it's--

00:21:13.028 --> 00:21:14.570
I wanted to bring
out to be something

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.210
like we are in Google.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.340
I was sharing with Luvvie,
like, I'm a bit more

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.465
than a year in the company.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.270
And something that I thought
we were in a better place--

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.600
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.225
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: --it's actually

00:21:28.225 --> 00:21:31.152
like how we are creating that
same sense of opportunity

00:21:31.152 --> 00:21:32.610
for every single
one, independently

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.070
of what's your background,
what's your race.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:40.370
And actually, even we think we
have created that environment,

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.823
we have a lot of issues.

00:21:41.823 --> 00:21:43.490
And those issues are
not only in the US.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.370
They are also here
in Dublin, which

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.433
is a pretty significant
multicultural--

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:49.850
LUVVIE AJAYI: It's
a global thing.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.050
It's a universal thing.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:56.180
I think people always think that
they're better than they are.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.150
We really do.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.310
And that is real.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.190
Because you will find that out
when you challenge somebody.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.970
That is really when you find
out if somebody is an ally, when

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:09.010
you challenge them.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.090
Because you feel like
an ally when you always

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.290
get along with this person.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.620
But when a moment of conflict,
you instantly switch,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.180
that person is not an ally.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.130
When people are challenged,
they show who they really are.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.080
And I find that, as
a woman, as somebody

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.930
who's challenged men
in certain spaces,

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.120
and the response I've
gotten has been fascinating.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.760
So I'll tell you the story that
I told shortly in my TED Talk

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.330
about being asked to speak
at a conference in Amsterdam,

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.842
Europe--

00:22:38.842 --> 00:22:39.800
I can't remember where.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.520
I think it was Amsterdam.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.098
Yeah.

00:22:41.098 --> 00:22:42.140
It was a tech conference.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.820
And they came to me,
sent me an email.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.682
Said we'd love for
you to come, speak.

00:22:45.682 --> 00:22:46.640
And I was, like, great.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.100
So I sent it to my manager.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.100
My manager passes
it back to them,

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.830
gives them my fee,
talks about what's

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.440
required to have me in a room.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.720
And they replied back and
said, well, we don't really

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.380
pay speakers.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:01.232
So we would give
Luvvie exposure.

00:23:01.232 --> 00:23:02.690
And I was, like,
well, I'm exposed,

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.900
because you came to me.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.580
So clearly--

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.000
--I'm already very exposed.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.030
So I'm good on that.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.030
Thank you.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.770
So I was, like,
this is interesting.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.430
So I went-- I'm part of this
thing called The List, which

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:22.670
is a list of 250 dope women in
business and media and tech.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.930
And we talk.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.370
We tell each other stuff.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.340
We talk numbers, which is the
stuff that nobody ever does,

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:28.940
right?

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.030
We talk about resources.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.030
So I would go on The List,
and I was, like, hey,

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.697
I was asked to speak
at this conference.

00:23:33.697 --> 00:23:35.420
They say they
don't pay speakers.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.918
Is that true?

00:23:36.918 --> 00:23:37.960
Is that a blanket policy?

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.793
South by Southwest
doesn't pay any speakers.

00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.752
TED doesn't pay any
speakers, across the board,

00:23:41.752 --> 00:23:42.720
no matter who you are--

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.480
so yeah, fair.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.180
So in 15 minutes.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.430
I've got about 10 answers
of people being, like, oh, I

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.347
spoke there last year.

00:23:50.347 --> 00:23:52.450
They definitely
paid my way there.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.760
Oh, I spoke there and
they bought my books.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.370
Oh, my guy spoke there
and they paid his way

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.770
and bought his books
and paid his travel.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.235
So I end up collecting
all this information.

00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:04.610
And I realized
that the hierarchy

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:09.380
was white men were paid to
speak at this conference.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.330
White women their
travel got paid for,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.170
so they at least had that.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.170
And then black women were
asked to pay their way

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.340
to speak there.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.025
That was a clear pattern.

00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:20.900
So I was, like, oh, I
got to talk about this,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.983
because this is a problem.

00:24:21.983 --> 00:24:24.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.250
So I told my agent.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.208
So I was, like, I'm just
giving you a heads up.

00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:28.820
And I told my
manager, who is here.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:29.945
And I was, like, all right.

00:24:29.945 --> 00:24:31.487
I want to talk about
this on a larger

00:24:31.487 --> 00:24:34.025
scale, because I don't think
what's happening here is fair.

00:24:34.025 --> 00:24:35.400
And I'm not going
to talk about--

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.900
I'm not even going to say the
name of the conference, right?

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.980
I'm going to give them
the pleasure of that.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.080
My manager's-- well, my
manager, she knows me.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.372
She knows I ain't got no chill.

00:24:43.372 --> 00:24:47.180
My agents-- my agents
were, like, oh, my gosh.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.660
If you do this, this is risky.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.620
Because what if other
conferences see this and are,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.913
like, hey, she's a troublemaker.

00:24:53.913 --> 00:24:54.830
We shouldn't hire her.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.910
I was, like, I am
a troublemaker.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.060
But you all should hire me.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.530
But I was, like,
I have to do this,

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:05.007
because in the position of power
that I'm in as a speaker who's

00:25:05.007 --> 00:25:06.590
been at it for over
eight years, who's

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.650
been on some grand stages,
who gets 50 speaking

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.462
engagements every year,
I can put some speaking

00:25:12.462 --> 00:25:13.670
engagements on the line here.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.410
I can put some
money on the line.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.950
And because if I can't do that,
who am I expecting to do it?

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.970
Is it the person who
just started last week?

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.260
Is it the person who's
never done a major talk?

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.760
No.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.680
So I'm going to say this.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.360
So I go on Twitter
and I was, like,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.902
so there's this
conference that makes

00:25:27.902 --> 00:25:30.140
15 million euros a
year that wants me

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.000
to pay my way to speak there.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.970
And this is not OK,
because I find out

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.060
this pattern about payment,
this pay inequality.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.440
Yo, it went crazy.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.375
People on Twitter were,
like, oh, my gosh.

00:25:41.375 --> 00:25:42.500
That's happened to me, too.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.500
And then people also
figured out the conference,

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.450
because I also did not
not give them clues.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.900
So people were, like,
oh, is it the Next Web?

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:54.800
I was, like, yes!

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:04.860
No chill-- so in The List
is a "Forbes" reporter.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.610
And she hit me up.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.390
She was, like, I'm
seeing this thread.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.250
She said, would
you actually want

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.842
to go on record to
talk about this?

00:26:09.842 --> 00:26:11.550
Because I want to
write a piece about it.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.220
And I was, like, yeah,
I would go on record.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.240
She's, like, OK.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.600
And then she hit
up Gary Vaynerchuk,

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.053
because he had keynote
at the conference.

00:26:20.053 --> 00:26:21.970
And Gary decided to go
on record, too, and be,

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.423
like, yeah, no, they paid me.

00:26:24.423 --> 00:26:25.340
Yeah, he backed me up.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.670
He was, like, no, no, I
definitely got compensated.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.900
So she wrote this
piece in "Forbes."

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.818
Oh my, gosh.

00:26:32.818 --> 00:26:34.360
And the picture on
the "Forbes" piece

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.090
is my last Google
talk at Menlo Park.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.857
So it was, like,
Luvvie at Google.

00:26:38.857 --> 00:26:40.190
Hey, they don't want to pay her.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.100
So when the piece came
out, the piece goes nuts.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.970
The dude who runs
the Next Web sees it.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.670
European guy, doubt
he's used to being

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:58.270
challenged by a black
girl or anybody, really.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.840
So he sends me and the
"Forbes" write up an email,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.540
where it was three paragraphs of
straight dog whistle language,

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.390
right?

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.090
He was, like, well,
you know, yeah, I mean,

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.350
we do pay some speakers.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.030
We choose to pay,
I mean, the ones

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:17.380
who we feel have the
value in our market.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.300
Maybe if Luvvie was--

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.250
maybe if this was a
more urban market,

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.010
Luvvie could command her fee.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:27.590
He literally put maybe if
this was a more urban market.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.850
So let me get this straight.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.460
You're asking me to come.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.390
And then you say
because it's not urban,

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:38.840
because apparently white
people don't understand me,

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.770
because you know, I must be
speaking a different language--

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:47.320
and it was great, because in
that moment he proved my point.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.890
He actually proved my point.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.440
It was so good that the
"Forbes" writer copied the email

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.590
and added it to the piece.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.715
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: That's awesome.

00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:57.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.320
LUVVIE AJAYI: And
a couple of people

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.780
actually pulled out from
speaking at it that year.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.988
I don't know what else is
going on with the Next Web,

00:28:03.988 --> 00:28:06.125
but in those moments,
I think about that guy.

00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:07.000
You know what I mean?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Like, who got challenged in this
way, and bulked up in defense,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.033
as opposed to being,
like, you're right!

00:28:18.033 --> 00:28:20.200
And the fact that he basically
helped prove my point

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.182
was sweet.

00:28:21.182 --> 00:28:23.140
Because we don't get
these opportunities often.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.427
And I was, like, yes.

00:28:24.427 --> 00:28:26.260
And that is the year
that I did my TED Talk,

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.240
three months later.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.410
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: There you go.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.470
LUVVIE AJAYI: And
I think about--

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:30.820
and I use that as an
example for people

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.440
whenever they're
afraid of speaking up.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.720
Because I did put some
money on the line.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.360
I was afraid.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.740
I was, like, OK, let me see.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.790
OK, if I don't get any
more speaking engagements,

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.248
I guess I'm going to have to
write my second book for real.

00:28:40.248 --> 00:28:41.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.380
I'm going to have to figure
out a different business model.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.330
But I knew that it was risky.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.270
Because, yes, somebody could
see me and be, like, oh, my God.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.420
If we invite Luvvie to
come, is she going to--

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.490
I don't make a
habit out of talking

00:28:54.490 --> 00:29:00.100
about how people mistreat me in
that way publicly in business.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.080
I don't.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.630
And every week, she's,
like, oh, and then

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.970
this person asked me--
because I don't do that.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.280
So this was an
extraordinary moment.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.370
And I'm, like, again,
we have to ask ourselves

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.690
what we are afraid of.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.360
If the worst thing that
was going to come from that

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.830
was that I would get less
speaking engagements,

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.410
is that worth me
shutting up and letting

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:27.250
this conference continue to
do pay inequality things?

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.557
Is it worth me also
not showing and not

00:29:30.557 --> 00:29:32.140
putting my name on
the line in the way

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.682
that I'm telling other people
to put their names on the line?

00:29:34.682 --> 00:29:36.280
Sometimes the means
justifies the end.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.650
And I just know how it
encouraged other people

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.382
to speak up.

00:29:40.382 --> 00:29:42.340
And oftentimes, the thing
that we're afraid of,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.973
that consequence doesn't come.

00:29:43.973 --> 00:29:45.640
I didn't get fewer
speaking engagements.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.690
I actually got more as a result
of speaking up in "Forbes."

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.100
So yeah, do it.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:51.640
Say it.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.980
And then let the chips fall.

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.990
Just always ask yourself what
is the worst that could happen?

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.490
OK.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.440
If it happened, so what?

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.610
Do you die?

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:02.540
No.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.140
You'll be OK.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.380
Figure out something else.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:04.880
OK.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.640
If you go speak up at HR
because something awful happened

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.850
at work, or you saw something
awful happen to your co-worker

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.290
and you happen to
get demoted for it,

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.380
does that mean you
can't get a new job?

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.310
Truly, does it mean you
will be fired today,

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.610
can't ever get a new job,
and will end up homeless?

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.050
Is that the case?

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:24.680
OK.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.590
No.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.090
Great.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.620
Then why are you being quiet?

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.200
Because you're afraid
of a bad review?

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.700
OK.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.832
So what is the worst
that can happen?

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.540
You speak up in a
meeting about something

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.450
that's not OK, what is
the worst that can happen?

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.950
OK.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.730
Maybe your co-worker
who was your--

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.490
actually, maybe
your manager then

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.240
makes your life a
living hell because they

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.490
give you terrible
assignments or make

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:49.260
you stay at work for longer.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:49.760
OK.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.470
If your work environment
gets terrible,

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:52.940
can you not get a new job?

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:56.300
Truly, we are always
afraid of the consequence.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.550
But we don't really
think about, OK,

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.900
if that worst thing that you
are afraid of does happen,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.120
does it end your life?

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.100
Does it end your career?

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.720
Does it actually
end your ability

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.350
to feed yourself and
clothe yourself and put

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.320
a roof over your head?

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.910
If the answer is no, then
you've got to say this thing.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.610
I feel like we pass
the buck too often.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.430
Somebody else, oh,
that person will do it.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.347
I don't have to do it.

00:31:21.347 --> 00:31:22.264
I don't have to do it.

00:31:22.264 --> 00:31:24.180
But everybody's thinking
I ain't got to do it,

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.270
so nobody does it.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.668
And then you figure
out, oh, nobody did it.

00:31:28.668 --> 00:31:29.710
That's how nobody did it.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:30.950
Everybody passed the buck.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:32.283
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: Awesome.

00:31:32.283 --> 00:31:35.210
So we should get some
questions from the crowd.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.460
LUVVIE AJAYI: Ask me anything.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.520
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO:
Some questions--

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.010
who wants to be the first?

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.310
Who wants to be the domino?

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:43.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.580
AUDIENCE: First of
all, I loved the talk.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.520
And I love your attitude.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.910
LUVVIE AJAYI: Thank you.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:54.730
AUDIENCE: Just something of a
question that comes to my head.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.070
Sometimes, even when you
were talking about the MeToo

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.500
movement, a lot of times--

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.710
this is even when
someone wants to speak up

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:05.830
and is aware of all of
these consequences--

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.350
sometimes this thought
comes to mind that--

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.750
am I being too, you
know, sensitive?

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.030
Or is it something that
was just probably said

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.140
in a joke, or am I being--

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:23.290
you start to go on that
route of self-doubt.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.570
That am I being
too oversensitive?

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.580
Or is it really an issue?

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.310
And sometimes when
that happens, right,

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.870
even in the MeToo
movement, like,

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.090
I'm just taking an example
of the MeToo movement.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.280
Because after that
I realized I would,

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.010
like, especially from guys
and some girls, as well,

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.440
there were jokes coming.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.110
That you know, oh, now
she's going to say MeToo.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.910
So do you see that, you know?

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:49.150
Where is that line?

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.570
And how do you get
rid of that self-doubt

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.960
that, hey, I am raising my
voice about the right thing.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.030
LUVVIE AJAYI: The thing
is that we've been told,

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.740
we've been too everything
for a long time--

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.840
too sensitive, too much,
too loud, too bossy,

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.940
too assertive, right?

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.030
So we've erred on the
other side in order

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.190
to make sure we're not too.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.200
You will always be
too to somebody.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.670
No matter who you are.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:27.050
You will always be too much, too
loud, too quiet, too sensitive,

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.430
to somebody.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.130
In those moments, honestly,
just do a gut check.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.690
How am I feeling right now?

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:38.290
Does this actually feel like
something that is not OK?

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:40.090
That is the only
question to ask yourself.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:44.630
If the answer is yes,
it does not feel OK.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.762
Don't ask yourself 15 questions.

00:33:46.762 --> 00:33:49.220
Because you will always talk
yourself out of those moments.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.960
You will always talk
yourself out of speaking out.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.543
Because you'll be
like, you know what?

00:33:52.543 --> 00:33:55.370
I'm not going to be
any type of trouble

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.380
because I don't want
to be too something.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.410
Listen.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:59.960
Get used to being too something.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.410
You will always be too
something to somebody.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.110
There are moments where you can
even make yourself more quiet,

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.510
and even somebody will
still find you too loud.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.260
And you know what?

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.580
Next time I need to
give you something

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.955
to make you feel like I was
too loud, for real, for real.

00:34:12.955 --> 00:34:14.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.139
So I mean, I have to
say you have to do a gut

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.760
check with yourself.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.110
And just figure out
did that feel good?

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.670
That is really the question.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:27.449
Did it feel good?

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:30.530
If it did not feel good,
then that joke was not OK.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.650
And also, if the
joke is making me

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.460
feel like less than a
person, or if the joke makes

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.139
me feel like my voice does not
matter, that's a terrible joke.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:45.590
If the joke makes me
feel like I'm not safe,

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.239
that's a terrible joke.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:50.520
So whoever is making
it, a boy or a girl,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.179
that's a terrible joke.

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:54.060
And here's the thing.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.909
Here's a key you
can use if somebody

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.550
says a joke in your midst
that is inappropriate,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.020
that makes you
feel uncomfortable.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.470
Where you're, like, I
want to say something.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.600
I don't know what to say.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.780
Ask him a question.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.460
So say they make this joke.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.410
And they're, like, ha, right?

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.930
You should be, like,
I don't get it.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:11.440
Explain that.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.273
What does that mean?

00:35:12.273 --> 00:35:12.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.740
Literally, just ask
them the question.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.660
Because then, in that
moment, they actually

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.360
have to explain
that joke to you.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.210
And if it's a
racist, homophobic--

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.670
just any joke that
is not appropriate,

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.250
that person in that moment
is now put on the spot.

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.580
Explain that.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.540
What does that mean?

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.610
I don't get it.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.283
And then they'll have to
be, like, you know how.

00:35:33.283 --> 00:35:33.950
I know how what?

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.160
No.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.368
Ask questions.

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:39.160
In fact, if you want
to challenge something

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.080
that happens in a
room, and you don't

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.230
want to just say the words,
that's not OK, ask questions.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.390
So ask the person, so
tell me more about that.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.480
Because you've made them, in
that moment, sit in that thing

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.380
that they just did, and then
further dig deeper into it.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.260
And even they will be like hm.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.490
If they don't want to
explain the joke to you,

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:03.165
then even they know the
joke is not appropriate.

00:36:03.165 --> 00:36:04.540
So then you got
them in a corner.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.400
Just ask them questions.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.360
Just be the person
that's, like, really?

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.145
Tell me more.

00:36:09.145 --> 00:36:10.770
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: That's awesome.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.562
LUVVIE AJAYI: And it's
a great tool to use.

00:36:12.562 --> 00:36:13.510
So yeah.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:15.280
I'm definitely going
to use the question.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.030
LUVVIE AJAYI: Hey.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.640
Ask questions.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.190
AUDIENCE: So thank you very
much for sharing your conference

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.960
experience.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.720
As you were speaking
about it and you mentioned

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.240
tech conference in
Amsterdam, I immediately

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.640
thought it's the Next Web.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.450
LUVVIE AJAYI: See?

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.490
AUDIENCE: It's crazy.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.470
So I've been an attendee.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.110
In 2015, I was still a student.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.810
And I also had a very
misogynistic experience

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:42.830
overall as an attendee.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:45.400
And I wrote a Medium
article about it.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.350
And it also got quite
a bit of traction.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.370
It was also shared on
Twitter quite a bit.

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:56.410
And it also got to the
founder of the conference, who

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:02.345
also gave a very lame,
blah, blah, type of reply.

00:37:02.345 --> 00:37:03.345
LUVVIE AJAYI: Of course.

00:37:03.345 --> 00:37:04.012
This is a habit.

00:37:04.012 --> 00:37:06.700
AUDIENCE: So I feel,
like, it's crazy

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:10.420
that that happens at every
single level of that conference

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.273
from attendee all
the way to speaker.

00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:13.690
LUVVIE AJAYI: I
love this, though.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.270
Because the existence
of your article

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.520
and the existence of mine
corroborate each other.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.730
And that instantly gives
this story more credibility.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.960
Even if you were doubting what
I just said, somebody else just

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.770
essentially just verified it.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:32.130
And think about that same
type of thing in a room.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.660
I want us to operate like
that every single day.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.730
Where you're seeing
something, you

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.740
believe something
somebody else just said,

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.860
and you think your voice
is not needed in it.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.330
Your voice is absolutely needed.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.530
Because you end up
being somebody's backup.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.100
There's power in numbers.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.270
You and I saying the same thing
right now, it's hard to be,

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.897
like, both of y'all lying!

00:37:54.897 --> 00:37:56.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.580
It's super hard to--
somebody has to be, like, mm,

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.270
I don't believe it.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.510
Sure.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.890
You can maybe not believe me.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.720
Or maybe you don't believe her.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.720
But then we put our
stories together,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.420
and it's, like, now it's harder
for me not to believe you.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.360
So in a room, when
you are the person

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.947
who is always speaking up,
I hope you have that person.

00:38:13.947 --> 00:38:16.280
And if you are not the person
who is always speaking up,

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.740
please back up
the person who is.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.215
Here is my suggestion.

00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:21.590
When you are going
into meetings,

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.590
you should have a pre-meeting
with your allies--

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.495
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:24.495 --> 00:38:25.820
--dead ass.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.630
Have a pre-meeting where
you're, like, OK, we're

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.800
about to go into this
meeting about this campaign

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.430
that we already know is
kind of going to be tough.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.992
Right?

00:38:33.992 --> 00:38:36.200
Have a pre-meeting with the
other person who you know

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.760
agrees with you.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.310
And be, like, hey,
so in this meeting,

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.985
here's what I'm going to say.

00:38:41.985 --> 00:38:44.360
If I'm going to point out that
this campaign that we want

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.700
to do is not a great
idea because it

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.770
has misogynistic undertones,
it's kind of racist,

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.690
it's kind of Islamophobic,
or whatever it is,

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.390
whatever the reason, I
have a problem with it.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:54.770
Do you see where
I'm coming from?

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.400
The other person
goes, I actually do.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.400
Because you know, you see
somebody in a meeting,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.680
when they're deeply
uncomfortable across the table

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.765
from you, and y'all both
making eyes like eh.

00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:04.265
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:04.265 --> 00:39:05.515
But you're not saying nothing.

00:39:05.515 --> 00:39:06.860
Talk to that person afterwards.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.360
And then in the
pre-meeting, you're,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.680
like, I saw you in the meeting.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.060
You weren't digging it.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:11.990
I wasn't either.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.930
Great.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.430
OK.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.650
So in this meeting, I'm
going to bring this up.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.970
Can you back me up?

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:18.260
I got you.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.820
You instantly walk into the
meeting with more confidence

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.195
because you know
you're not going

00:39:22.195 --> 00:39:24.800
to be on the island by yourself
when you finally do speak up.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.780
You already know you
have built-in backup.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.480
And that built-in backup
makes your voice stronger,

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.350
because two of you
can't be ignored.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:34.340
One of you, maybe, one of
you can maybe be silenced.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.820
Two of you can't, really.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.320
And then, if you
get a third person?

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.330
Oh, oh, come on.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.830
If you get a third
or fourth person,

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.770
you're in that meeting winning.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.130
So if a third person
is, like, yeah,

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.550
I actually do agree with them.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.705
I don't think this
is a sensitive--

00:39:47.705 --> 00:39:48.440
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: That's it.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.410
LUVVIE AJAYI: --story that tells
something that we want to say,

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.750
literally the person who
is heading the meeting,

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.240
who is insisting
this campaign is

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.420
going to happen because they
think is the best idea ever,

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.520
now has to listen.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.430
Because as a leader, you can't
ignore three people telling you

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.027
the same thing in
the same moment.

00:40:05.027 --> 00:40:06.610
Because even if you
want to ignore it,

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.530
everybody else is watching.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.710
Get your pre-meetings
together, right?

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.980
Walk into the meeting
with the whole wolf pack.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.860
Because in the wolf pack,
nobody beats the wolf pack.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.200
They can beat you,
maybe, as an individual.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.198
The wolf pack, though--

00:40:21.198 --> 00:40:23.740
you come in there squadded up,
and you're, like, we're ready.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.713
We're going to do this.

00:40:25.713 --> 00:40:27.880
And then everybody walks
out the room better for it,

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.350
because you probably
just stopped

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.820
something disastrous
from happening,

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.880
which is what I always
think about whenever

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.190
brands do awful campaigns.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.170
Like the Pepsi stuff
and the Dove stuff--

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.670
I'm always, like,
there was somebody

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.030
in that room who knew this
was not going to go well

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.990
who was too afraid or
not empowered enough

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.070
to speak up about it.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.050
There were absolutely--
guarantee you-- there's

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:51.717
somebody along the
way, who was probably

00:40:51.717 --> 00:40:53.560
like this shouldn't
happen like this.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.770
But they either lived
in a working environment

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:00.490
where being challenged gets
you punished, which is awful,

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.183
and that comes from
leadership down--

00:41:02.183 --> 00:41:03.850
if leadership has
created an environment

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.780
where they are untouchable,
can't be challenged.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.280
If you listened to
the Theranos doc,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.350
you'll see that thing is real.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:14.500
People will end up just
not doing their best work

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.280
because you never grow
from being challenged.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.010
Either that, or this person
who is sitting in the room

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.670
was just like, this
is not my business.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.400
This is not my charge.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.260
So I'm not going to
speak up about it.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.937
Or this person was,
like, you know what?

00:41:27.937 --> 00:41:29.770
I'm usually the one
speaking up all the time

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.052
being on the island by myself.

00:41:31.052 --> 00:41:33.260
Today I'm going to take a
break and see what happens.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.670
I'm going to let him have it.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.020
I know this is going
to be disastrous.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.145
I'm just going to be quiet.

00:41:37.145 --> 00:41:40.300
Because I'm tired of being the
one that's always speaking up.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.510
And on that day, when the
campaign is checked off

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.330
and it goes out, and people
lose their minds on social,

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.240
because of course, it's
a terrible landing,

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.700
I'm always, like,
there was definitely--

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:56.740
this is a failure of leadership
beyond just the leader

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.520
not seeing it.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.940
It means the leader has been
breeding an environment where

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.350
they can't be challenged.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.210
And that person who
went to speak up

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.990
did not feel like
they had the place.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:10.320
I'm telling you, if
you have a company that

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.850
encourages challenging, you
will do the best work possible.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.960
Because in every
room, if people know

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.960
they are going to call
you out on your bullshit,

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.220
you will show up
in that room better

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.803
than you were going
to show up before.

00:42:21.803 --> 00:42:24.960
Because you'll be like, hm, if
I don't show up well, if this

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.470
is not going to be a
great idea, somebody

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:28.720
is going to call me out on it.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.137
And I don't want
to be called out.

00:42:30.137 --> 00:42:32.910
So I'm going to make sure when I
step in this room this idea has

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:34.380
been thought through.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.600
I have figured out
all the blind spots.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.600
I have figured out how
to make it already good

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.440
so nobody in that room has
cause to challenge me on it.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.640
It will make you
step up your game.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.160
I know it makes me
step up my game,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.830
because I surround myself
with people who challenge me.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.130
Like, my friends tell me
I'm useless all the time.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.220
It's great.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.040
It keeps me going.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:54.540
Right?

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.250
Because I know that
anything I bring

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.180
to them, if it is not correct,
they will call me out on it.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.210
Which means if I'm
bringing it to you,

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:00.960
it's going to be correct.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.580
Because I don't want you
to call me out on it.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.710
So then I come up better.

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:04.710
I show up to you better.

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.835
I'm not bringing trash to
you, because I've already

00:43:06.835 --> 00:43:09.043
realized if it's trash,
you're going to throw it out.

00:43:09.043 --> 00:43:10.710
If I'm allowed to
bring whatever to you,

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:12.470
I'd be bringing
all types of stuff.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.340
And you'd be, like,
who has time for this?

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.590
You didn't think this through.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.050
Why are you wasting my time?

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.390
It just makes everybody's
life better, easier,

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:20.830
and you will do better work.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.610
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: Awesome.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.420
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about the fact

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.230
that you said that we
usually think that we are

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.400
better than we actually are.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.180
LUVVIE AJAYI: Mhm.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.205
AUDIENCE: And if you are
in that kind of space,

00:43:32.205 --> 00:43:34.080
and you feel like this
isn't happening to me,

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.240
but I know it's happening,
I see in the numbers

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.650
that we are not 100% inclusive,
what would be your advice

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.770
to spot those things
and take action,

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:47.340
although it's not visible,
or it's not super clear

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.530
what that is?

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.100
LUVVIE AJAYI: Just
talking about it--

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.898
you know, if it's
not super clear

00:43:53.898 --> 00:43:55.440
that this thing is
happening, but you

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.260
feel this under tension,
this undercurrent,

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.300
start having a
conversation about it.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.702
Just being like, I know--

00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:03.910
I've been feeling this thing.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.990
I don't if anybody else has
been feeling this thing.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:08.800
Am I tripping?

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.770
Am I just thinking
too hard about it?

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:13.860
Even just, yeah, even
the whole too sensitive--

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.540
just have the conversation.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.030
Here's how I'm feeling.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:24.195
Am I being too
sensitive about it?

00:44:24.195 --> 00:44:26.570
Is there something else that
I should be looking out for?

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:27.440
What can we do?

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.220
Because I feel this
undercurrent of tension.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.380
I think in the moments
that we are not sure,

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.840
use your words to
say you're not sure.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.310
You can even say, I
don't know what to do,

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.030
but I see there's
something wrong here.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.790
That is actually an action, as
opposed to being quiet, trying

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:47.570
to figure it out in your
head, and then just not saying

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:48.080
anything.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.610
I say your lack of
being sure is OK.

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.130
You don't always
have to be sure.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:56.630
But I think you can
talk it through.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.338
Because somebody else
is probably feeling

00:44:58.338 --> 00:45:00.270
unsure, too, about
the same thing.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.060
And you can work it through.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.770
I think transparency is huge.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:06.020
Vulnerability is huge.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.640
In the moments when we don't
know, being able to say,

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.140
I don't know.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:14.330
We also live in a society
that wants us to always know.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:17.322
Like, everything
is figure outable.

00:45:17.322 --> 00:45:18.530
If you don't know, Google it.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:21.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.660
But there are some
things you can't Google.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.070
You can't Google your feelings.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:27.320
You can't Google certain
things that haven't happened.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.420
You can't Google the
undercurrent, right?

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.942
So be able to say to
somebody, you know what?

00:45:31.942 --> 00:45:33.150
There's this thing happening.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.640
I'm not sure about it,
but it doesn't feel right.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.830
It's OK.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:38.390
I don't know when--

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:40.970
I don't know how we're
expected to do business

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.900
properly when one, we're not
expected to make mistakes.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.320
And then we're also not expected
to admit when we're not sure.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.570
We're always supposed to know.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:50.810
So figure it out!

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.180
No, you didn't know,
say you don't know.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.670
I think talk it through.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:58.070
But again, I think it might even
take spaces like this, right?

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:00.080
Where maybe once a
month-- and I think

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.230
Google has this program in other
places, but just in general,

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.990
it helps to just have a
space where you can be, like,

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.130
let's just talk freely.

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:08.670
What's up?

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:09.553
How are you feeling?

00:46:09.553 --> 00:46:10.470
How's the environment?

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:12.470
Do you feel empowered
to speak up?

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:16.080
You know, you may be able to, in
the room with 40 other people,

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.910
be able to say I can't
really put my finger on it.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.182
But things don't feel right.

00:46:22.182 --> 00:46:23.890
And then other people
can be, like, yeah,

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:27.480
there's this weird tension that
I started noticing after this.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.010
Talk it through as a company.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.020
Talk it through as a
department, as a team.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.020
But again, it has to
be the environment that

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.280
has fostered that, right?

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.090
So hopefully it
becomes the environment

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:41.470
that then fosters that.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.610
I think companies like
Google are at least trying.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.670
We'll fall short.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.710
That's to be expected.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.580
It's not going to be all of a
sudden everybody's kum ba yah.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.163
But the attempt is
at least necessary.

00:46:55.163 --> 00:46:55.830
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:57.207
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:46:57.207 --> 00:46:57.790
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.130
Thank you, actually, for
just talking about this.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.050
Because that actually
answers part of what

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:04.188
I was going to ask about.

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:06.730
Because I feel like it doesn't
get underlined enough that you

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:08.188
can have a
conversation, as opposed

00:47:08.188 --> 00:47:10.450
to immediately going
to battle every time

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:14.800
you feel that maybe
it wasn't appropriate.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.440
But on a larger
scale, I wanted to ask

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.510
you do you feel at all
concerned about this sort

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.210
of current surge of this--

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:32.080
being more attentive
to and sensitive?

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.030
Are you worried at
all that it will

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:37.360
create sort of this
new party line,

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.970
and it will actually
prevent some people

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.250
from critically thinking
about these issues?

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:44.140
Because there will
be things they're

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.080
literally not allowing
them to think about at all.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.567
And I'm mainly referring
to, for example,

00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:51.400
a couple of months ago
in "The Nation" there

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.942
was this controversy
with a poem that

00:47:52.942 --> 00:47:55.660
was published by white poets.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.170
And it was mimicking
about a homeless person,

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:02.770
mimicking a way that some people
thought [INAUDIBLE] to speak.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.900
And then it was
disavowed immediately

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.150
by the editorial board
who published it.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.610
So are you worried at all
about this actually stifling

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.210
conversation out of fear?

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.680
LUVVIE AJAYI: No.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:20.260
Because if the idea
of being challenged

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:24.840
stops you from speaking, I think
you're taking the easy way out.

00:48:27.887 --> 00:48:30.220
I know now, especially now
people are, like, oh, my God.

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.840
Everybody is now being so PC.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.830
We're afraid to say anything.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:34.330
No.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.280
What's actually happening
is people are now, probably

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.710
for the first time ever,
being, like, you know,

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:45.160
people who are poor,
black, gay, trans,

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.490
they deserve to be treated
like whole human beings, which

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:52.780
means the old jokes and
the old do whatever,

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.910
say whatever won't fly.

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:57.100
If people are, like, well,
now I can't make jokes.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.220
Now comedy is dead.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.210
If comedy, and if
content, has always

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.770
been based in the
oppression of other people,

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.940
then it's been trash
for centuries, right?

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:14.080
So right now we're
at a place where

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.680
we're all being challenged
to be better than we've been.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.240
It means, maybe don't make
the joke about ha, ha,

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.630
ha, boobs in the office
when before it was fine.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.155
It could fly, right?

00:49:28.155 --> 00:49:29.530
So now men are,
like, oh, my God.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.030
I can't even make
jokes about boobs.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:32.180
No!

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.430
There are other jokes to make.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.280
What is this?

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.880
I think this is where I
think the conversations

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.577
on safe spaces are important.

00:49:43.577 --> 00:49:45.160
Because you have to
have a place where

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.090
you can go to speak
freely, be given

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:53.300
grace, and not necessarily,
like, hung out to dry,

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.700
like Ned Stark for it.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.270
I think there need to be people
you trust in your life, who

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:00.590
you can go to.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:04.128
I think everyone needs to have a
personal board of directors who

00:50:04.128 --> 00:50:05.670
are the people who
will challenge you

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.670
in your moments of failure, who
will pump you up in the moments

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.290
when you need it.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:12.120
And I always, whenever
I make mistakes,

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.895
I go to my board of directors.

00:50:13.895 --> 00:50:15.020
And they'll be, like, yeah.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:15.970
You did misstep there.

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:16.760
And I'll be, like, OK.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.177
If you said that
to me, and you're

00:50:18.177 --> 00:50:19.700
someone who loves
me, who's smart,

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.820
who's thoughtful about the
world, I will believe that.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:26.020
This doesn't mean you take
on every troll on Twitter.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:26.720
Because no.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.210
In fact, take on zero
trolls on Twitter.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:32.030
But also listen to the actual
constructive criticism.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:39.380
So a poem where a
white man is attempting

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.890
to speak like
somebody who he has

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:48.350
no idea what their life's
really like, it's punching down.

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:49.630
That's a rule, right?

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:52.460
The rule essentially
is don't punch down,

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:56.390
which is you shouldn't
make fun of people

00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:02.210
who are more marginalized
than you, essentially.

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:05.870
Which is why black folks can
make fun of white people,

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.480
because we're punching up.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.480
But the inverse is not
allowed, same thing.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:16.220
I can't make fun of
somebody who is trans.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.520
But they can absolutely
make fun of me.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.690
I can't make fun of them
for their trans identity.

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:23.210
I can make fun of
other things, right?

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:25.070
Because maybe they're
Scientologists.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:25.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.870
But I'm terrible.

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:29.740
I'm working on it.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.960
But the concept is always
punch up, not punch down.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.220
Which means if you're going to
talk about somebody's identity

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.710
and use it in a
point of a joke, it

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:41.600
can't be a point
of identity that is

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.190
more marginalized than yours.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.260
So I can't make fun--

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.290
I'm Christian-- I can't
make a joke about somebody's

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:49.830
Muslim identity.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:50.690
I am straight.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:53.720
I can't make a joke about
somebody's gay identity.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.980
You know what I mean?

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.960
So you have to kind of
operate in that way.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:01.860
So a white man who is well off
writing a poem that essentially

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.277
is making fun of somebody who's
homeless is punching down.

00:52:04.277 --> 00:52:04.902
AUDIENCE: Well.

00:52:04.902 --> 00:52:06.112
He wasn't making fun of that.

00:52:06.112 --> 00:52:08.320
That's my-- I mean, obviously,
I didn't [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.112
LUVVIE AJAYI: Yeah.

00:52:09.112 --> 00:52:11.240
But essentially think
about it, right?

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.860
We're also in a
moment where we're

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.520
seeing fashion-- for example,
in the US in the last month,

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.780
three major brands
have been in hot fire

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.020
because they created
products that

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.720
look like blackface,
which historically

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.770
has denigrated black people.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.640
So in that moment, you
can be, like, well,

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.520
it's just this thing with red
lips that happens to be black.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.740
What if it's just fashion?

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.790
Are we stifling the
creativity now because

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.860
of political correctness?

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:40.400
No.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.470
It takes historical
context into effect.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.410
So I think it's just
an interesting time.

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:48.050
There's going to be a lot of
mistakes being made, right,

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:48.860
across the board.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.540
People are going to
make poor choices.

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.470
But we have to then fix it.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.780
When we call them
in or call them out,

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.760
the point is that,
the hope is they

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.140
don't make the mistake again.

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:01.760
They see where the error is.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.400
And in that moment when
you are challenged,

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.830
you don't instantly go
to I'm being trolled.

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:08.330
Right?

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:11.120
You also go to, OK, what
have I done here that I

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.000
can make sure I don't do again?

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.650
And how can I be an
example of what it

00:53:18.650 --> 00:53:23.000
looks like to redeem yourself?

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.250
So it's an interesting time.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:30.725
Again, I just talk about
speaking up in these moments.

00:53:30.725 --> 00:53:32.600
I'm somebody who's
considered a truth teller.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.670
But I also make mistakes, right?

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:38.120
And my mistakes are
also loud mistakes,

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.800
because I have such
a giant platform.

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.610
So if I'm ever afraid of
making too many mistakes,

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:48.020
and I make that stop
me from speaking up,

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.750
essentially what am I losing?

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:55.500
I can't be so afraid of making
mistakes that I shut up.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:58.710
I just have to be willing
to make mistakes and then

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:00.600
grow from them.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.330
And that is ultimately
what we can all do.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:04.860
If you're willing
to make mistakes,

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.030
you're willing to be more risky.

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:09.510
And then when you make those
mistakes, try to grow from it.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.718
Try to learn from it and
try to figure out how to not

00:54:11.718 --> 00:54:13.285
make the same mistake again.

00:54:13.285 --> 00:54:14.910
NOEILA FENANDEZ
ARROYO: That's awesome.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.630
Thanks so much.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:18.847 --> 00:54:20.430
LUVVIE AJAYI: Thank
you for having me.

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.480
NOEILA FENANDEZ ARROYO: Oh,
it was a great, great time.
