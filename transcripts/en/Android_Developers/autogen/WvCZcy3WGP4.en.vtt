hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.740
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google so I saw a talk

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
Android team at Google so I saw a talk
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.509
Android team at Google so I saw a talk
recently at Google i/o where they were

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519
recently at Google i/o where they were
 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.549
recently at Google i/o where they were
showing some example animation code

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559
showing some example animation code
 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.970
showing some example animation code
which I always liked and I saw something

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
which I always liked and I saw something
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.980
which I always liked and I saw something
curious there which was someone said

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
curious there which was someone said
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.480
curious there which was someone said
well we need to animate a couple of

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
well we need to animate a couple of
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.220
well we need to animate a couple of
properties at the same time on the same

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
properties at the same time on the same
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.990
properties at the same time on the same
target object and we can't do that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
target object and we can't do that
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.970
target object and we can't do that
directly with object animator so we're

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
directly with object animator so we're
 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.439
directly with object animator so we're
going to use the value animator object

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
going to use the value animator object
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779
going to use the value animator object
and do it more manually and I thought

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
and do it more manually and I thought
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.110
and do it more manually and I thought
hmm that's not actually correct so I

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
hmm that's not actually correct so I
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.569
hmm that's not actually correct so I
wanted to so I realized at that point I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
wanted to so I realized at that point I
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430
wanted to so I realized at that point I
thought this was obvious how to do this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
thought this was obvious how to do this
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.160
thought this was obvious how to do this
and I realized maybe it would be good if

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
and I realized maybe it would be good if
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.720
and I realized maybe it would be good if
I actually explained to how to do this

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
I actually explained to how to do this
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250
I actually explained to how to do this
in general there's a there's a class

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
in general there's a there's a class
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.850
in general there's a there's a class
called property values holder that you

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
called property values holder that you
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160
called property values holder that you
might want to know about if you need to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
might want to know about if you need to
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.779
might want to know about if you need to
do this on your own targets and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
do this on your own targets and
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209
do this on your own targets and
properties so I have a demo to show you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
properties so I have a demo to show you
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.610
properties so I have a demo to show you
here with four simple buttons on it all

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
here with four simple buttons on it all
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740
here with four simple buttons on it all
of which want to be animated and you'll

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
of which want to be animated and you'll
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.270
of which want to be animated and you'll
notice that all of them animate

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
notice that all of them animate
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.580
notice that all of them animate
remarkably similarly in fact it's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
remarkably similarly in fact it's
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529
remarkably similarly in fact it's
effectively the same animation happening

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
effectively the same animation happening
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.140
effectively the same animation happening
on all of them but the code for doing it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
on all of them but the code for doing it
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539
on all of them but the code for doing it
is very different so for the first

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
is very different so for the first
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.260
is very different so for the first
button we use a value animator animation

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
button we use a value animator animation
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210
button we use a value animator animation
and this is the example that I saw in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
and this is the example that I saw in
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.830
and this is the example that I saw in
this particular talk said okay we're

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
this particular talk said okay we're
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.270
this particular talk said okay we're
going to use value animator and this

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280
going to use value animator and this
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.950
going to use value animator and this
will return a value between 0 and 1 and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
will return a value between 0 and 1 and
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109
will return a value between 0 and 1 and
then we take this value and we figure

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
then we take this value and we figure
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.210
then we take this value and we figure
out what the values what the target

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
out what the values what the target
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.760
out what the values what the target
value should be on the target object

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770
value should be on the target object
 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530
value should be on the target object
that we're trying to animate so I do

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
that we're trying to animate so I do
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390
that we're trying to animate so I do
that here so the approach to doing this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
that here so the approach to doing this
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.980
that here so the approach to doing this
with a value animator is you create your

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
with a value animator is you create your
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410
with a value animator is you create your
value animator between start and end

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
value animator between start and end
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.460
value animator between start and end
values here it doesn't actually matter

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
values here it doesn't actually matter
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.600
values here it doesn't actually matter
what those values are because we're

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
what those values are because we're
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.980
what those values are because we're
going to be using the animated fraction

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
going to be using the animated fraction
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.590
going to be using the animated fraction
anyway and then we add an update

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
anyway and then we add an update
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.999
anyway and then we add an update
listener so that we get a call back on

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
listener so that we get a call back on
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.710
listener so that we get a call back on
every single animation frame and then

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
every single animation frame and then
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870
every single animation frame and then
during that frame we get the animated

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
during that frame we get the animated
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.850
during that frame we get the animated
fraction this gives us a value between 0

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
fraction this gives us a value between 0
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.399
fraction this gives us a value between 0
&amp; 1 to tell us where in the course of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
&amp; 1 to tell us where in the course of
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.350
&amp; 1 to tell us where in the course of
this animation the animation is and then

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
this animation the animation is and then
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.209
this animation the animation is and then
we can take that value and use it to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
we can take that value and use it to
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.999
we can take that value and use it to
interpolate the value of our our end

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
interpolate the value of our our end
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.459
interpolate the value of our our end
targets and end properties so here we

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
targets and end properties so here we
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.139
targets and end properties so here we
simply set the translation X and the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
simply set the translation X and the
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.300
simply set the translation X and the
translation Y values directly on the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
translation Y values directly on the
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.260
translation Y values directly on the
object with a simple linear

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
object with a simple linear
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.210
object with a simple linear
interpolation and then we start the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
interpolation and then we start the
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.639
interpolation and then we start the
animation very straightforward but there

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649
animation very straightforward but there
 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.250
animation very straightforward but there
are easier ways to do this

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260
are easier ways to do this
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.009
are easier ways to do this
with a lot less code the second one is

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019
with a lot less code the second one is
 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.140
with a lot less code the second one is
probably the easiest way to do this an

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150
probably the easiest way to do this an
 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.300
probably the easiest way to do this an
important point to note here is I would

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310
important point to note here is I would
 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.100
important point to note here is I would
always use view property animator in

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110
always use view property animator in
 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.080
always use view property animator in
this particular situation right I'm

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090
this particular situation right I'm
 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.059
this particular situation right I'm
animating properties on a view

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069
animating properties on a view
 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.890
animating properties on a view
translation X and translation Y and this

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900
translation X and translation Y and this
 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.300
translation X and translation Y and this
is exactly why view property animator

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
is exactly why view property animator
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.789
is exactly why view property animator
was created the code is very simple and

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799
was created the code is very simple and
 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:31.960
was created the code is very simple and
streamlined you can do things in

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970
streamlined you can do things in
 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.360
streamlined you can do things in
parallel and the same animation and it's

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370
parallel and the same animation and it's
 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.220
parallel and the same animation and it's
it's very efficient at animating

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230
it's very efficient at animating
 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.440
it's very efficient at animating
multiple things because it has intrinsic

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450
multiple things because it has intrinsic
 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.630
multiple things because it has intrinsic
knowledge about views that make its

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640
knowledge about views that make its
 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.250
knowledge about views that make its
invalidation and rendering an update

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260
invalidation and rendering an update
 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.309
invalidation and rendering an update
system very efficient internally so it's

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319
system very efficient internally so it's
 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.050
system very efficient internally so it's
the right thing to use but sometimes

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060
the right thing to use but sometimes
 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.099
the right thing to use but sometimes
you're animating things that aren't

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109
you're animating things that aren't
 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.619
you're animating things that aren't
simply properties on a view in which

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629
simply properties on a view in which
 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.849
simply properties on a view in which
case you couldn't use you a property

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859
case you couldn't use you a property
 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.039
case you couldn't use you a property
animator and you'll need to use one of

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049
animator and you'll need to use one of
 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.869
animator and you'll need to use one of
the techniques that I show a little bit

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879
the techniques that I show a little bit
 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.670
the techniques that I show a little bit
later so if you can use view property

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
later so if you can use view property
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.319
later so if you can use view property
animator here's how it would work you

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329
animator here's how it would work you
 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.360
animator here's how it would work you
would call animate on the view that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370
would call animate on the view that
 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.759
would call animate on the view that
returns a view property animator object

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769
returns a view property animator object
 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.220
returns a view property animator object
and then we say translation X to the N

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230
and then we say translation X to the N
 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.979
and then we say translation X to the N
value translation Y to the N value and

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989
value translation Y to the N value and
 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.809
value translation Y to the N value and
you're done don't need to call start

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819
you're done don't need to call start
 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.129
you're done don't need to call start
don't need to do these in separate

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139
don't need to do these in separate
 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.420
don't need to do these in separate
statements you're basically just

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430
statements you're basically just
 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.220
statements you're basically just
building up the animation and when

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230
building up the animation and when
 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.780
building up the animation and when
you're done building it it automatically

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790
you're done building it it automatically
 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.640
you're done building it it automatically
starts in the next frame and you're good

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650
starts in the next frame and you're good
 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.349
starts in the next frame and you're good
to go

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359
to go
 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.970

straightforward easy to use use for your

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980
straightforward easy to use use for your
 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.939
straightforward easy to use use for your
property animator but if you can't maybe

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949
property animator but if you can't maybe
 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.740
property animator but if you can't maybe
you're looking at using object animators

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750
you're looking at using object animators
 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.250
you're looking at using object animators
instead so this is what's the example

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260
instead so this is what's the example
 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.869
instead so this is what's the example
that I saw was trying to avoid was

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879
that I saw was trying to avoid was
 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.089
that I saw was trying to avoid was
creating multiple object animators even

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099
creating multiple object animators even
 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.559
creating multiple object animators even
though you're only animating one object

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569
though you're only animating one object
 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.869
though you're only animating one object
we all know that creating more and more

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879
we all know that creating more and more
 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.939
we all know that creating more and more
objects especially during animations may

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949
objects especially during animations may
 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.920
objects especially during animations may
be a bad thing so maybe you want to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930
be a bad thing so maybe you want to
 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.390
be a bad thing so maybe you want to
avoid this but it's it's fairly

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400
avoid this but it's it's fairly
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.819
avoid this but it's it's fairly
straightforward this is maybe the the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829
straightforward this is maybe the the
 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.229
straightforward this is maybe the the
trivial approach to solving this problem

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239
trivial approach to solving this problem
 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.539
trivial approach to solving this problem
with an object animator which is I want

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549
with an object animator which is I want
 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.430
with an object animator which is I want
one object animator that animates the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440
one object animator that animates the
 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.099
one object animator that animates the
values for translation X I want another

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109
values for translation X I want another
 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.259
values for translation X I want another
object animator that animates the values

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269
object animator that animates the values
 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.119
object animator that animates the values
for translation Y and I want you to

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129
for translation Y and I want you to
 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.460
for translation Y and I want you to
start both of them pretty simple if you

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470
start both of them pretty simple if you
 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.869
start both of them pretty simple if you
need to choreograph it a little more

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879
need to choreograph it a little more
 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.610
need to choreograph it a little more
carefully you can use an animator set

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620
carefully you can use an animator set
 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.770
carefully you can use an animator set
add these things into play sequentially

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780
add these things into play sequentially
 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.330
add these things into play sequentially
or play together or play with other

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340
or play together or play with other
 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.270
or play together or play with other
animators all very straightforward not a

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280
animators all very straightforward not a
 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.430
animators all very straightforward not a
big deal but you are creating a couple

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440
big deal but you are creating a couple
 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.869
big deal but you are creating a couple
of object animators that are sort of

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879
of object animators that are sort of
 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.580
of object animators that are sort of
running without knowledge of each other

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590
running without knowledge of each other
 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.379
running without knowledge of each other
and maybe that's just not as efficient

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389
and maybe that's just not as efficient
 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.509
and maybe that's just not as efficient
at what

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519
at what
 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.860
at what
you really wanted to do what you really

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870
you really wanted to do what you really
 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.960
you really wanted to do what you really
wanted to do was the following you want

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970
wanted to do was the following you want
 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.969
wanted to do was the following you want
to use property values holders this is

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979
to use property values holders this is
 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.619
to use property values holders this is
actually what object animator uses

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:25.629
actually what object animator uses
 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.480
actually what object animator uses
internally but you can access it on the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490
internally but you can access it on the
 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.520
internally but you can access it on the
outside too in this case we're animating

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530
outside too in this case we're animating
 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.529
outside too in this case we're animating
the same object but we're animating

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539
the same object but we're animating
 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.719
the same object but we're animating
multiple properties on the same object

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729
multiple properties on the same object
 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.640
multiple properties on the same object
in parallel so what we're going to do is

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650
in parallel so what we're going to do is
 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.529
in parallel so what we're going to do is
set up a property's value holder to

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539
set up a property's value holder to
 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.540
set up a property's value holder to
animate our translation X property to

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550
animate our translation X property to
 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.670
animate our translation X property to
the end value another property values

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680
the end value another property values
 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.379
the end value another property values
holder to animate the translation Y

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389
holder to animate the translation Y
 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.320
holder to animate the translation Y
property on the same object and then

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330
property on the same object and then
 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.460
property on the same object and then
we're going to set up the object

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470
we're going to set up the object
 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.499
we're going to set up the object
animator and this is what associates the

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509
animator and this is what associates the
 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.499
animator and this is what associates the
property values holders with the actual

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509
property values holders with the actual
 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.629
property values holders with the actual
target object of our view so now that

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639
target object of our view so now that
 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.980
target object of our view so now that
we've set up property values holder

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990
we've set up property values holder
 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.300
we've set up property values holder
would come down here and we create a

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310
would come down here and we create a
 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.879
would come down here and we create a
single object animator and we say okay

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889
single object animator and we say okay
 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.740
single object animator and we say okay
on our target view I want you to use

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750
on our target view I want you to use
 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.540
on our target view I want you to use
this property value holder for

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550
this property value holder for
 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.149
this property value holder for
translation X the other property values

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159
translation X the other property values
 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.070
translation X the other property values
holder for translation Y and I want you

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080
holder for translation Y and I want you
 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.770
holder for translation Y and I want you
to start it and bang you're done so

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780
to start it and bang you're done so
 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.300
to start it and bang you're done so
animating multiple properties in
