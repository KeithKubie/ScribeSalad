00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.900
&gt;&gt; Yes I believe it is very important. One
of the problems that the Middle East is suffering

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:28.480
from is how many young people do we have,
and the amount of despair and lack of role

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:36.769
models that exist. I think the role models
play a key role in setting the stage and agenda

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.359
for a world that can hopefully be more peaceful
hopefully and more ethical. I think people

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:39.820
are looking at today's leaders and we are
brutally disappointed or feel lost. There

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.050
is no clarity of an election, for them to
inspire to be like. And more importantly corruption

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.639
seems to be the name of a lot of games being
played whether it's in politics or across

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.390
the world or just in the Middle East. We feel
that there are a lot of other reasons and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.379
motivations behind what is being done. I think
we all need role models, but particularly

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.080
younger generations. And when you look at
the percentage of young people in the Middle

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:21.460
East over all you can see 60-70 percent are
below the age of 25. They need to see the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.540
way to make it to the top, the way to succeed.
They still have a clear vision, good education,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.540
good ethics, hard working, and really have
a view for a better future for everybody not

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.553
just in good of interest or other countries
in the world. Thank you.
