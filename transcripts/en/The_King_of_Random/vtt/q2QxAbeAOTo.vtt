00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.490
Welcome back guys I'm Nate with The King of Random

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.839
Today we're gonna be showing you how to take the molds we made in a previous video, and use them to cast fiberglass

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.859
So far we showed you how to take rigid insulation foam and carve that into the shape of your choice

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.680
I chose shells from Mario Kart because that game has always been a favorite of mine and previously I've made giant Mario Kart shells for a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.890
video for Devin Supertramp

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.920
After carving our shells we made a two-part mold using silicone rubber and plaster at this point the mold is ready

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.300
And it's time to use fiberglass to make our shells permanent

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.229
We'll use fiberglass cloth and resin to cast the two halves of the shell separately and then glue them together with more fiberglass

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.219
After cleaning up our casting

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.969
We'll paint it and we'll have a complete shell. Fiberglass resin smells really strongly

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.659
And it's not very good to breathe it in so we're gonna take our shells outside and do our casting there

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.619
Fiberglass has three parts first there's a resin and a catalytic activator

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.750
This is what makes this liquid turn into hard plastic the third part is the fiberglass itself

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.629
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.980
As the name suggests, this is a cloth that is actually made out of glass

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.629
Extremely thin strains of glass are woven together into a sheet. So first thing let's cut our fiberglass cloth into small manageable pieces

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.619
It's crazy that this stuff is made of glass, but you can still cut it with scissors

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.949
It's important to note that while this stuff acts like cloth the individual cut or broken strands of glass can be very irritating

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:22.820
So it's important to always wear gloves while you're handling it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600
Now our fiberglass is all cut up and prepped. Let's mix up some resin

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.960
Follow the instructions on the can for the ratios of the hardener to the resin

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.400
Now using a disposable brush, let's spread an even layer of the resin with the catalyst mix into it along the inside of our mold

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.480
Once your mold is coated in resin begin applying the fiberglass cloth, press it into place and dab more resin on top of it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.020
You may find that this job is easier with two people one person applying the cloth and another person applying the resin

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.760
It's better to have the fiberglass overlap a little bit than for there to be gaps

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.020
If you're running low on resin just mix up another small batch

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.650
It's better to do several small batches instead of one big batch because it's easier to control and less likely to catalyze in your cup

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.070
Applying the resin on top of the fiberglass is almost more of a pressing motion than a brushing motion

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.120
It really helps drive the resin down into the fibers and make everything stick to the silicone below

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.600
Try to minimize air pockets where the fiberglass pulls away from the mold if you see the fiberglass pulling away

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.700
Just press it back down in with your brush

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.270
We now have a thin layer of fiberglass covering the entire inside of this mold

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.320
So let's let this fiberglass cure for a few minutes while we work on our other shell then we'll come back and add a second layer

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.380
Alright

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.229
We now have a first layer of fiberglass in both sides of our mold, so let's repeat the process and add a second layer

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.000
So it turns out the cups that I have been using are made of polystyrene which means that as the resin catalyzes

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.820
It's actually going to start melting through them not only from the heat

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.170
But also because it just chemically dissolves them a little bit

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.369
Now I've got two layers of fiberglass on each side of the shell once the fiberglass has cured and hardened

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.370
I'll peel them out of the mold

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.329
There we go we now have two layers of fiberglass cast in both sides of our mold the fiberglass has cured

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.990
It's rigid now

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.330
So it's time to peel what we have cast out of our mold with two layers the fiberglass should be fairly strong

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.109
But still slightly flexible which will help us demold. First step is to remove the mold jacket now we peel off the silicone

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.039
We have a fiberglass casting of a turtle shell

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.319
Look at that. That turned out great. few air bubbles in a couple spots

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.050
We can patch those up

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.620
And go there's the top half

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.680
We have the two halves of our shell and what we're gonna do

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.820
Is line them up and use a strip of fiberglass all the way around to secure them together

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.160
Before we attach the two sides together, let's trim the excess fiberglass that was sticking up over the edge of the mold

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.380
Slightly short amount of the pieces

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.080
This application of the fiberglass is basically the same as what we did before inside the mold we put a thin layer of the resin on

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.800
Then attach the fiberglass cloth to that and then use a thicker layer of resin to glue it all down

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.070
There you have it the two sides are now glued together with a layer of fiberglass and as soon as that's cured

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.480
All we have to do is clean it up and paint it and our shell will be complete

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.769
The fiberglass gluing the two sides together has now cured so all that's left is to take a rotary tool and grind down any sharp

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.430
Edges that may have been left by the fiberglass after that it'll be ready to paint

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.800
All the sharp points have now been taken down, so let's add some color

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.500
I've painted a base coat of white over the whole shell and now I'm going to mask off the part that I want to stay white

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.740
Which is the ridge around the middle while I add the other colors to the top and bottom of the shell

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.910
Even if you're wearing gloves, it's probably not a good idea to hold stuff while you're spray painting it

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.640
You can see that the splatter has just gotten all over my arm. That's a pain to get off. It's all painted up

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.640
Let's peel off the tape

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.869
We could say that this is good, but I want to add a few more details using colored ink in an airbrush

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.300
Oh my air brush running away

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:00.650
There you have it

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.530
Those are the exact same techniques that I use to make Devin Supertramp?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.389
Giant Mario Kart shells and you can use these same techniques to make whatever kind of project you want to

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.069
To recap what we did today

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:16.609
We took our silicone molds, and we laid fiberglass resin and fiberglass cloth down inside of them once that fiberglass was cured

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.669
We took the two pieces out of their respective molds and put them together

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.920
We then used some more fiberglass as a sort of belt that went around the center Ridge of the shell to glue it all together

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.400
After using a rotary tool to clean up any sharp edges or excess fiberglass

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:34.180
We use spray paint and an airbrush to bring some colorful life to our project and this thing is solid

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.169
You could probably stand on this. I'm not gonna try just in case it would crack, but like it's rigid

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:43.369
It is solid is firm. This is something that will last for a long time and it looks great

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.019
No matter what you want to do with this now the mold for these shells is not a single use item

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:51.049
We still have the molds and we can use them again as many times as we want

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.920
They're very durable

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.070
They'll last a long time and in fact a future project that I want to try is using a two-part foam to cast another one

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.109
Of these shells in this same mold

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.789
And then I'll have what basically a Nerf ball in the shape of a Mario Kart shell how fun would that be?

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.329
Thanks for joining us for this project and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:12.439
What if you could just make your own hard hats that look like turtle shells?

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:16.459
Need some padding

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:19.159
It's it's a little low on the head honestly

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.180
I like having it next to my head because that shows it like if it's out here. You can't tell it big

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.180
It really is but this size

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.610
It's basically permanent marker ink

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.220
not sharpie brand but

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.200
Yeah, it's just black paint really like a mama shell and a baby show

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.370
