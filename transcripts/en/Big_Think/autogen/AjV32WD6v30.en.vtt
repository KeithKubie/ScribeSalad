00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660
it's very ironic because then people
 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.640
it's very ironic because then people
think about history they think well

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650
think about history they think well
 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.039

reading dusty books which you know fair
 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.560
reading dusty books which you know fair
enough I would love to be reading lots

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570
enough I would love to be reading lots
 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.929
enough I would love to be reading lots
of dusty books right now I will concede

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939
of dusty books right now I will concede
 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.240
of dusty books right now I will concede
the point but when you've read all those

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250
the point but when you've read all those
 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.720
the point but when you've read all those
dusty books what happens is that you

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730
dusty books what happens is that you
 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.060
dusty books what happens is that you
have the ability to see certain patterns

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070
have the ability to see certain patterns
 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.490
have the ability to see certain patterns
you have a sense of what fits together

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500
you have a sense of what fits together
 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.090
you have a sense of what fits together
and what doesn't fit together Isaiah

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100

Berlin wrote an essay on the possibility

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560
Berlin wrote an essay on the possibility
 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.020
Berlin wrote an essay on the possibility
of a scientific history in which he may

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030
of a scientific history in which he may
 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.510
of a scientific history in which he may
said that history is not about knowing

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520
said that history is not about knowing
 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.980
said that history is not about knowing
what happened it's about knowing what

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990
what happened it's about knowing what
 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.610
what happened it's about knowing what
can't happen right that is extremely

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620
can't happen right that is extremely
 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.180
can't happen right that is extremely
useful so a historian will never look at

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190
useful so a historian will never look at
 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.240
useful so a historian will never look at
a problem and say this is entirely new a

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250
a problem and say this is entirely new a
 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.160
a problem and say this is entirely new a
story will look at a problem and try to

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170
story will look at a problem and try to
 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.830
story will look at a problem and try to
find the familiar aspects of it and

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840
find the familiar aspects of it and
 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.930
find the familiar aspects of it and
that's a that's a very big advantage

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940
that's a that's a very big advantage
 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.060
that's a that's a very big advantage
over certain for other forms of analysis

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070
over certain for other forms of analysis
 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.310
over certain for other forms of analysis
because if you look at something and say

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320
because if you look at something and say
 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.830
because if you look at something and say
that it's totally new that disables the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840
that it's totally new that disables the
 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.740
that it's totally new that disables the
mind right away it also tends to disable

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750
mind right away it also tends to disable
 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.359
mind right away it also tends to disable
I think political action because if

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369
I think political action because if
 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.399
I think political action because if
something's totally new it's very easy

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409
something's totally new it's very easy
 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.230
something's totally new it's very easy
to take the next step and say well if

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240
to take the next step and say well if
 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.029
to take the next step and say well if
it's totally new then what can I do

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039
it's totally new then what can I do
 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.310
it's totally new then what can I do
about it or you can say since it's

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320
about it or you can say since it's
 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.440
about it or you can say since it's
totally new all things are permitted

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450
totally new all things are permitted
 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.090
totally new all things are permitted
which can also lead you in some really

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100
which can also lead you in some really
 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.219
which can also lead you in some really
unproductive directions so the first

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229
unproductive directions so the first
 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.599
unproductive directions so the first
thing that historian will do is we'll

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609
thing that historian will do is we'll
 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.459
thing that historian will do is we'll
say whatever this problem is it's not

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469
say whatever this problem is it's not
 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.550
say whatever this problem is it's not
entirely new when a historian is

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560
entirely new when a historian is
 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.349
entirely new when a historian is
confronted by something very surprising

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359
confronted by something very surprising
 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.679
confronted by something very surprising
like the 2016 campaign and United States

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689
like the 2016 campaign and United States
 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.950
like the 2016 campaign and United States
the historian is is is is likely to say

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960
the historian is is is is likely to say
 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.919
the historian is is is is likely to say
well the things that this candidate er

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929
well the things that this candidate er
 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.809
well the things that this candidate er
is saying aren't true but the

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819
is saying aren't true but the
 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.609
is saying aren't true but the
possibility this kind of campaign could

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619
possibility this kind of campaign could
 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.309
possibility this kind of campaign could
work is a real possibility

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319
work is a real possibility
 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.370
work is a real possibility
so the historian is is freed from or

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380
so the historian is is freed from or
 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.969
so the historian is is freed from or
should be freed from the the the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979
should be freed from the the the
 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.059
should be freed from the the the
conviction of the day and the historian

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069
conviction of the day and the historian
 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.949
conviction of the day and the historian
looks it automatically looks back to

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959
looks it automatically looks back to
 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.050
looks it automatically looks back to
other moments where similar things like

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060
other moments where similar things like
 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.210
other moments where similar things like
this coalesced so for example we're in a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220
this coalesced so for example we're in a
 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.880
this coalesced so for example we're in a
second globalization there was a first

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890
second globalization there was a first
 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.800
second globalization there was a first

20th century
the second globalization began our

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520
the second globalization began our
 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.190
the second globalization began our
globalization began with all kinds of

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200
globalization began with all kinds of
 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.830
globalization began with all kinds of
promises that technology and export led

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840
promises that technology and export led
 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.450
promises that technology and export led
growth would lead to enlightenment and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460
growth would lead to enlightenment and
 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.300
growth would lead to enlightenment and
liberalism the first globalization did

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
liberalism the first globalization did
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.570
liberalism the first globalization did
two the first globalization crashed it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580
two the first globalization crashed it
 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.160
two the first globalization crashed it
crashed into the first world war the

things like that have worked before and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190
things like that have worked before and

once you see that it can come together

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840
once you see that it can come together
 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.540
once you see that it can come together
that way it's not that you're sure it's

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550
that way it's not that you're sure it's
 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.270
that way it's not that you're sure it's
something you predict it but although I

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280
something you predict it but although I
 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.380
something you predict it but although I
have made some predictions that were

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
have made some predictions that were
 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.750
have made some predictions that were
right but it's it's it's more that you

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760
right but it's it's it's more that you
 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.670
right but it's it's it's more that you
can see it coming together and then that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
can see it coming together and then that
 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.260
can see it coming together and then that
allows you to get out ahead and you can

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270
allows you to get out ahead and you can
 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.030
allows you to get out ahead and you can
think okay well if this is going to come

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040
think okay well if this is going to come
 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.330
think okay well if this is going to come
together this way then I can also steal

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340
together this way then I can also steal
 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.150
together this way then I can also steal
from the past people's correct reactions

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160
from the past people's correct reactions
 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.120
from the past people's correct reactions
to it or people's wise reactions to it I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130
to it or people's wise reactions to it I
 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.180
to it or people's wise reactions to it I
can I can use those things from the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190
can I can use those things from the
 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.100
can I can use those things from the
failure of the first globalization I can

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110
failure of the first globalization I can
 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.870
failure of the first globalization I can
just borrow them I can now extract them

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880
just borrow them I can now extract them
 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.030
just borrow them I can now extract them
and put them in the 21st century which

rather than saying okay I'm gonna wait

for this pack because by the time the

for this pack because by the time the
 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.710

pattern actually coalesce is it's too

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720
pattern actually coalesce is it's too
 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.110
pattern actually coalesce is it's too
late right you have to see that the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120
late right you have to see that the
 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.520
late right you have to see that the
pattern might be coalescing and then

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530
pattern might be coalescing and then
 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.650
pattern might be coalescing and then
start messing with the pattern that the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660
start messing with the pattern that the
 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.150
start messing with the pattern that the
way that you see it coalescing comes

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160
way that you see it coalescing comes
 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.980
way that you see it coalescing comes
from history and the tools that you use

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990
from history and the tools that you use
 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.560
from history and the tools that you use
to start messing with it also come from

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570
to start messing with it also come from
 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.300
to start messing with it also come from
history so in that way ironically a

actually a problem it maybe it's

something which is desirable from
certain points of view right so that's

certain points of view right so that's
 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.960
