00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.560
- [Michael] Today's talk, what I'm going
to discuss really, are properties of human

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.480
skin that support thermoregulation. Humans
have an exceptional capability to protect

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.150
against rises in body temperature, or
minimize heat storage when performing

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.030
physical work in hot environments. This
great thermoregulatory capacity probably

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.460
provides several selective advantages.
One, and these have been pointed out by

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.900
Dr. Dan Lieberman, that in early hominins
that the ability to forage safely during

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.130
peak heat times allow them to gather food
where the hunters that would use the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.410
humans as prey, basically had to sit and
use behavioral thermoregulation because

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.470
they couldn't do muscular work in the heat
of the day. Another potential selective

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.440
advantage is that some humans may have
participated in persistence hunting. This

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.520
required them to perform at a fairly
substantial metabolic rate for extended

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.550
durations to move animals probably of
larger size and maybe herbivores for

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.350
extended periods of time until these
animals suffered high body temperatures

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.890
and succumbed from heat stroke and thus,
then became food for the hunters. So the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.550
question really arises then, why can
humans thermoregulate in hot conditions

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.260
while foraging and hunting? Now remember,
we're talking two things, the skin for

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.380
thermoregulation, but also somehow the
skin not only dumping the heat, but also

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.910
maybe participating in the ability to
sustain exercise. So humans can do this

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.720
because they have, really from a
thermoregulatory point of view, two unique

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.110
features. The first is the ability to
regulate a steady state core temperature

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.510
during physical exertion. That's pretty
much dependent on the metabolic rate and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.300
reasonably independent of the environment.
We won't talk much about that today. But

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.710
that's very much made possible by the
skin's capacity to support a very high

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.640
heat loss.
Now, what I've done here is I've

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.110
constructed a table that I'm going to
address in the subsequent slides, "Factors

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.660
that support high skin heat loss." If you
look on the left here, where we have the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.460
different factors, you'll notice that four
of these obviously relate to heat

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.690
exchange, upright posture, which I'll
explain, skin blood flow, sweating and

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.660
large surface area. Now, these provide
certain advantages but on the other hand,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.680
as I'm going to show you a little later,
they provide also problems for the body

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.690
particularly cardiovascular nature. And
there's properties of the skin or organs

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.180
within the skin that help offset these
disadvantages, such as sodium

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.710
reabsorption, and several different
reflexes which I'll talk. So, the skin can

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.040
provide large heat exchange but it also
can present problems when trying to

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.370
perform sustained work in the heat. Let's
talk first about upright posture. The

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.460
advantages of an upright posture are
fairly obvious. First of all, you have a

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.170
smaller surface area exposed for solar
radiation. As a result to that, you don't

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.660
absorb the solar radiation as much. So you
have less of environmental heat stress.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.990
Second, and not as obvious, if you're
upright and your skin's exposed and I'm

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.770
locomoting and moving forward, I'm going
to have more air movement across my skin

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.010
than if I was haunched over. And as a
result of that, I improve both the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.440
convective and evaporative heat capacitie,
or the abilities for heat loss. And third,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.070
bipedal locomotion also results in lower
efficiency, so lower metabolic rate and

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.500
rate of heat production to be dissipated.
Now before I go on, I'm just going to give

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.950
some very basics of heat balance. When an
individual performs physical exercise, the

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.110
amount of heat they produce is
proportionally to how hard they exercise,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.450
because when muscles contract, only
roughly 20% of that energy goes into

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.730
contractal shortening.
The remaining 80% is heat that needs to be

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.040
dissipated by the body. Now, I showed the
brain here because as the body stores

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.480
heat, unfortunately there's a lot of myths
that humans have selective brain cooling.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.010
They don't. That the brain is pretty much
either similar to arterial blood pressure

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.610
or arterial blood temperature, our recent
evidence shows it might be slightly

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.790
higher, is that as body temperature
increases, we really rely on the skin for

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.480
heat loss. So that the central nervous
system acting through the sympathetic

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.140
nervous system has a proportionate
physiological thermoregulatory system

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.270
that, A, increases skin blood flow that
allows radiative and convective heat loss,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.230
and two, increases sweating which allows,
if adequate biophysics, evaporation. Let's

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:58.450
first discuss active vasodilation. Humans,
compared to most species, have very highly

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:04.870
vascularized skin. And for you sitting in
a room at a room temperature maybe 20 some

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.940
degrees, 22 degrees, you probably have
your subcutaneous vessels constricted. So

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.540
normally, if we look over here, we have
constricted cutaneous vessels. Now, when

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.060
an individual goes into the heat, two
things occur. First of all, the skin

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.960
becomes warm, and that takes away the
constrictor effect. And second, which is

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.180
very unique to humans, at least to my
knowledge, is that you have active

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.580
cutaneous vasodilation. That sympathetic
innervation through a variety of different

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.290
pathways, cause active vasodilation of the
skin in proportion to the heat load of the

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.630
body. So, the greater the heat load, the
greater the vasodilation. And thus, then

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:52.200
is this warm blood moves to the surface of
the skin, if the temperature gradient is

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.070
from the skin to the ambient conditions,
we now can have convective and radiative

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.400
heat loss.
So, in this figure cartoon, we show the

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.980
impact of skin blood flow and this is
whole body skin blood flow as a function

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.740
of core temperature. What you can see is
this, if an individual is resting, you can

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.670
achieve very high skin blood flows, up to
eight liters a minute, which is extremely

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.100
high because we know in a temperate
environment, cardiac output is only about

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.450
five liters per minute sitting, average
human. With exercise, we find again that

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:31.360
at a given threshold, that the skin
temperature will increase but it cannot

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.780
increase as high as it can when you're
sitting at rest. And this is because of

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.680
this blood pressure problem that you have
constrictor tones so that you don't have

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.950
as high as a vasodilation. But you
probably can have skin blood flows maybe

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.410
in the range of five to six liters. Now,
the second avenue of heat loss is through

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:54.810
eccrine sweating, eccrine sweat glands.
Eccrine sweat glands, at least in their

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:01.150
number and dispersion, are fairly unique
to humans. We have about one and a half to

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:06.090
four million. They're located over the
entire skin. They're sympathetically

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:13.340
cholinergic innervated. They secrete a
very hypotonic fluid to the surface of the

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.660
skin. Obviously, as this fluid evaporates,
it then results in cooling of the

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:25.890
superficial areas of the skin and also the
blood within the capillaries. So, eccrine

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.400
sweat glands are different from the
apocrine glands which are often located

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:37.690
with hair and again, they're located over
the entire body. Now, humans can have very

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.360
high levels of sweat rate. And as a
result, if that sweats evaporate, they can

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.210
have tremendous amounts of evaporative
cooling. And this is why they can live in

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:51.820
environments where the ambient temperature
is higher than their skin temperature.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:58.050
Here we have some data cartoon of a plot
of whole body sweat rate as a function of

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.920
exercise intensity.
As we move this way, people are running

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.820
harder, and it's going from a cool to a
hot condition. The first point I want to

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.170
make is this, we've all seen crazy numbers
in the literature about how much people

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.340
can sweat. Generally it's not unusual if
you're doing sustained hard work in the

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.830
heat to have a sweat rate of one liter per
hour, maybe a liter and a half. The

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:25.590
highest sweat rates that I've seen doing
thousands of experimental bodies, about a

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.020
little over two liters. People do report
in literature two and a half to three and

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.280
half liters per hour. I haven't seen them.
I assume it's possible and it's very

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.960
extreme athlete for short period of time.
But high sweat rates can be sustained in

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.940
the areas of a liter and a half. Now, when
you have these high rates of water flux,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.070
you have to remember that the sweat comes
from the interstitial fluid which comes

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:54.370
from the plasma. So as you sweat, you're
going to decrease water in your plasma in

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.140
your interstitial space and your
extracellular fluid volume. So as a

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.310
result, if you're sweating and you're not
replacing fluids, your blood volume with

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:08.450
decrease as you dehydrate. So now, what we
see is that as an individual is exercising

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:13.260
in the heat for whatever purpose, of
foraging or hunting, that we have this

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.960
great capacity for heat loss, but we have
two penalties, and this is shown in a

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.010
cartoon. The first is that if we look,
what we have here, is the blood

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.350
distribution in a person standing like
myself in a cool environment. You can see

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.580
that the blood's pretty much distributed
in the thoracic area, it's easier to

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.460
return blood volume to the heart so that
you can sustain cardiac output, or how

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.580
much blood flow goes per unit time. Now,
with heat stress, you have two things that

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:45.310
occur first. One is you have the increase
skin blood flow. But what I also didn't

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.660
mention, if the superficial veins become
warm, they become compliant, so the blood

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.200
sits in the periphery. This means that the
blood is not in the thoracic area, it's

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.160
more difficulty to return to the heart,
reduces filling and makes it more

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.280
difficult to sustain cardiac output while
simultaneously performing exercise.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.150
So one, the displacement. Two, that second
problem is that as I had told you, that if

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.100
you decrease your total body water and
dehydrate, the liquid portion of your

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.200
blood decreases so your plasma volume,
your blood volume reduces. All at the same

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.470
time, is when I'm standing upright, so I
have to work against gravity to perfuse

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.280
the brain, and I'm exercising and have to
perfuse skeletal muscles. So this really

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.350
causes a conundrum in terms of the human
body. Well, the skin helps to address

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.540
this. And I'm going to give several ways
that it does this. First of all, not only

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.760
do eccrine sweat glands secrete hypotonic
fluid, but they have the ability to

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.770
reabsorb sodium. That, basically you have
a reabsorption duct. So that as the sweat

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.040
comes down, that humans can reabsorb
sodium. And how much sodium they can

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:59.420
reabsorb depends on how well they're
acclimatized to the heat. Here's some data

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:06.080
that shows local sweat rate over an area
of skin, and the sodium concentration in

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:12.320
the secreted sweat in one, people that are
unacclimatized to the heat, people that

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.440
live in Boston in the winter time. And
people that are acclimatized in the heat,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.010
people that live in Atlanta, where I live
currently, in the summer time. And what

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.700
you can see that obviously the higher the
sweat rate, the less efficient the active

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.980
transport is because the sodium is moving
by and you can only retake up so much. But

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.990
with acclimatization, you can greatly
reduced the amount of sodium in the sweat.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.750
And in fact, you can basically have as
third as much...a third less sodium in the

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.340
sweat after acclimatization. So it may not
be unusual at all to see sodium in

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.040
secreted sweat on acclimatized person,
maybe 50, 60 mili-equivalents and 10

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.410
maybe, not 10, but 20 mili-equivalents.
Well, this is important because this

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:02.130
sodium that's reabsorbed goes back into
the interstitial, into the plasma and into

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.140
the extracellular space.
And when we look at the extracellular

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.760
fluid space, the volume in that space is
very much dependent on sodium

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.590
concentration. That's the primary cation
that's the difference between the

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:21.840
intracellular space. So as we absorb
sodium back into our plasma, our

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.400
extracellular sodium concentration
increases and this results in an osmotic

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.650
gradient that causes you to pull water
from inactive muscle, where water is

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:35.740
plentiful. So this retention of sodium
then, allows the inactive muscle to pull,

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.130
act as a reservoir. So this is a way that
you can defend your blood volume or your

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.460
plasma volume by moving water throughout
the body. So, it's very important because

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:50.320
at a given level of dehydration, plasma
volume would be reduced less. Now, what is

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.990
also not as obvious in, as being much more
well understood lately is that skin

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:01.560
provide sensory information that supports
thermoregulation. And just simplistically,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.540
I'm going to call these cold receptors,
warm receptors, and mechanical receptors.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.010
But through these receptors, we can sense
wetness, and we also can sense

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:17.290
thermocomfort, or thermal sensations. The
wetness sensation, I'm going to show you

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:21.190
in a minute, is very important because as
the skin is wet, that means that skin is

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.440
not evaporating that helps you basically
reduce your sweating rate so you have less

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.930
wasteful sweating to defend your body
water. And thermal sensations are

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:36.570
extremely important, is that A, they drive
behavioral thermoregulation, skin

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.490
temperature, skin wetness, as well as
heart rate are what drive that. And in

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.870
addition, I'm going to show you a reflex
that's probably related to the skin that's

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.790
not often appreciated that can actually
drive the core temperature to help reduce

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:55.780
skin blood flow requirements. Let's first
move and look at the impact of wet skin on

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.620
sweat suppression.
Here we have on the Y-axis, total body

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:05.510
sweating rate during minutes of exercise
where individuals are performing a given

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.880
metabolic rate of exercise over a 30
minute duration. One time, they are not

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.920
acclimatized to the heat and the other
time, they're acclimatized. During this

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.960
period of time, the investigators are
continually ramping up humidity. So, here

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:25.070
in the beginning, it's dry, and here at
the end, it's very humid, it keeps getting

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.740
more and more humid. First thing is that,
you can note that if humans acclimatize to

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.110
the heat, they can have a much higher
sweating rate. So you see a much higher

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:37.720
sweating rate in acclimatized individuals.
But second, and very important is that you

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.050
can see that as the humidity increases,
the sweating rate decreases, whether

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:47.150
they're unacclimatized or not. So the body
is sensing that the skin is wet, that the

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:52.040
sweat is not being evaporated, it's being
wasted, and as a result, I'll tune down my

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.890
wetedness. And this really can have a lot
of important implications. Here are some

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.200
old studies that were done, where they got
a large number of people and they had them

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.860
perform the same amount of physical
activity, outdoors, in a desert and a

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.360
tropic environment. So, they had the same
metabolic rates, so they had roughly the

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.830
same amounts of heat to be dissipated. But
on one condition, the tropics, the skin is

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:21.510
wet, and then the other condition, the
desert, the skin is dry. What you can see

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.910
that for 24 hours, sweat rates for this
population, it greatly reduced the water

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:31.010
requirement from about maybe five liters
down to two or three, so half the water

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:36.830
requirements. So, by reabsorbing sodium, I
can move water into, from reservoirs

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:42.120
within my body to defend blood volume, by
having skin wetedness, I can sense that

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.490
and I can reduce how much I lose and how
much I dehydrate. So, skin is very

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:53.180
important, then, for allowing individuals
to minimize the effects of dehydration.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.400
Now, I don't have a good slide to show
this. If I did, I would take my 10 minutes

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.450
to explain it.
But when humans basically perform exercise

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.700
under most environmental conditions, how
high their core temperature lies is a

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.780
function of metabolic rate. And it's
pretty much independent of the

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.470
environment. But what you see, as the
environment gets warmer, and the skin gets

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.930
warmer, there is a point where the steady
state core temperature will elevate. So,

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.350
the core temperature will elevate, but
there is still sufficient biophysics that

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.360
you can just maintain that. So for some
reason, and it's been known for a long

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.880
time, that humans then will somehow pick
to have a higher core temperature at

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.020
times. And this really kind of befuddled
physiologists because back in the old

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.170
days, they used to think high core
temperature's bad, low core temperature's

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:48.640
good, sort of like Animal Farm, "Four legs
good, two legs bad." So what Dr. Rall,

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.010
Larry Rall from University of Washington
pointed out very elegantly is that this

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:58.270
actually provides an advantage. And here
I'm going to show you a table. Here we

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.050
have an individual exercising in the heat,
three different times, same metabolic

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.200
rate, same amount of evaporative heat
loss. But here we have now a core

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.910
temperature of 38, skin temperature of 34.
So we have a core-to-skin temperature

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:17.950
gradient of four degrees. What we see,
then, is if we do the calculations, you

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.800
would require a skin blood flow of about
two and a half liters. Now, if it got

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.970
warmer outside, and the skin temperature
went up, you have a smaller gradient and

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.300
now it requires more, because you have a
smaller gradient now from the skin to the

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.460
ambient, so you have to move more blood
through the skin to have the same amount

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.860
of heat loss to defend core temperature.
So what happens is when core temperature

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.670
actually rises up, it widens the
core-to-skin temperature gradient, and it

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.610
reduces the skin blood flow requirement
thus relieving some of the cardiovascular

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:57.040
stress. So in summary, I think that when
we look at the skin and how it supports

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.530
thermoregulation, we not only have to
think about heat loss, but we have to

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.810
think about the other functions that it
does that supports the cardiovascular

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.130
system.
I think we've established that skin has an

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:14.230
exceptional heat loss capability. That you
probably can have maximum skin blood flows

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.330
up to eight liters. That would be for a
seated person in the heat, but very

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:24.310
substantial. That you can have a very high
sweating rates at least in maybe the

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:28.320
unique Olympic athlete up to three liters
per hour, but are probably generally must

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.340
be lower in other individuals. And that
skin supports blood pressure regulation,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:38.450
one, through sodium conservation, which
pulls water from the intracellular spaces

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:43.360
particularly in active muscle, to help
support blood volume. Two, by suppressing

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.370
the weted skin so that we don't have
wasteful sweat. All of these acting

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.720
against dehydration. And then through
thermal sensations, by one, working to

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.810
allow behavioral thermoregulation so that
the individual could titrate the work

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.490
load, or seek shade so they don't work too
hard. But also probably combined with

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.940
information from baroreceptors within the
cardiovascular system to allow the

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.710
thermoregulatory system to allow core
temperature to drift up and reduce

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:13.633
cardiovascular strain. Thank you.
