00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.779
Hey, Phil Plait here and this is Crash Course
Astronomy. In last week’s episode, I mentioned

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.400
that nearly all the information we have about
the Universe comes in the form of light. But

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.309
how does that light get made? What can it
tell us about these astronomical objects?

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.489
And honestly, what is light?

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:20.749
Here’s a hint.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.180
Light is a wave. It took centuries of thought
and experiments to figure that out, and to

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.760
also figure out that, at its most basic, light
is a form of energy. It travels in waves,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.120
similar to waves of water in the ocean. Except
with light, the things doing the waving are

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.239
electric and magnetic fields. Literally—light
is a self-contained little bundle of these

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.710
two fields, intertwined. That’s why we call
light electromagnetic radiation. The details

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.230
of this are very complex, but we can make
some pretty good overall observations about

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.630
light just from thinking of it as a wave.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.100
If you’re floating in the ocean, you’ll
move up as a wave passes you, then back down,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.250
then back up again when the next wave rolls
by. The distance between these crests in the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.030
wave is called the wavelength. Since light
is a wave, it has a wavelength as well, and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.500
this may be its single most important feature. That’s
because the energy of light is tied to its wavelength.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.180
Light with a shorter wavelength has more energy,
and light with a longer wavelength has less

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.840
energy. And our eyes have a really convenient
way of detecting these different energies: color!

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.360
What you think of as the color violet is actually
light hitting your eye that has a short wavelength.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.020
Red light has a longer wavelength, about twice
the distance between crests as violet light.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.740
All the colors in between—orange, yellow,
green, blue—have intermediate wavelengths.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.940
This spread of colors, wavelengths, is called
a spectrum.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.310
Over millions of years, our eyes have evolved
to detect the kind of light the Sun emits

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.899
most strongly. Well, that makes sense; that
makes it easier for us to see! We call this

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.640
kind of light visible light.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.759
But that’s just the narrowest sampling of
all the different wavelengths light can have.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.019
If light has a slightly shorter wavelength
than what our eyes can see, it’s invisible

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.660
to us, but it’s still real. We call that
ultraviolet light. Light with shorter wavelengths

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.590
than that fall into the X-ray part of the
spectrum, and light waves with the shortest

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.900
wavelengths of all are called gamma rays.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.760
At the other end, light with slightly longer
wavelengths than the reddest color we can

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.650
see is called infrared light. Light waves
longer than that are called microwaves, and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.840
those with the longest wavelengths of all
are called radio waves. These different groups

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.600
don’t really have hard and fast definitions;
just think of them as general guidelines.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.280
But together, we call all of these different
kinds of light the electromagnetic or EM spectrum.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.820
And remember, energy goes up when the wavelength
gets shorter. So ultraviolet light has a higher

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.710
energy than violet, X-rays have a higher energy
than that, and gamma rays have the highest

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.280
energy of all. Infrared light has lower energy
than red light, microwaves lower than that, and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.140
radio waves have the lowest energy.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.370
When you look at the whole EM spectrum, you’ll
probably notice that we really do only see

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.580
a teeny little sliver of it. Most of the Universe
is invisible to our eyes! That’s why we

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.700
build different kinds of telescopes -- to
detect the kind of light our eyes can’t

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.280
detect. They let us see a lot of stuff
that otherwise we’d never notice.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.800
So you might be asking: how is light made?
Well, one of the most basic properties of

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.709
matter is that when you heat it up it gains
energy, and then it tries to get rid of that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.589
energy. Since light is energy, one way to
get rid of energy is to emit light.

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.740
Another important property of matter is that
the kind of light an object emits depends

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.239
on its temperature. An object that’s hotter
will emit light with a higher energy, that is,

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.479
a shorter wavelength. Cooler objects give
off light with a longer wavelength.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.280
You may have seen this in action. Heat up
an iron bar and it starts to glow red, then orange,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.000
then yellow as it gets hotter. The color, the wavelength,
of light emitted changes as the bar heats up.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.819
Astronomers use a shorthand for this. We say
that light with a shorter wavelength is “bluer”,

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.640
and light with a longer wavelength is “redder”.
Don’t take this literally! We don’t really

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.820
mean more blue or more red, just that the
wavelengths are decreasing or increasing.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.820
So in this lingo, ultraviolet light is bluer
than blue, and X-rays are bluer than ultraviolet.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.480
So objects that are more energetic, that have a
higher temperature, are bluer than cooler,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.680
redder objects. This rule of thumb works really
well for dense objects like iron bars and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.480
stars. Even humans! You emit light, but it’s in the
far infrared, well beyond what our eyes can see.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.900
There are less dense objects in space, too,
like gas clouds, and the way they emit light

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.540
is different. To understand that, we have to zoom in on
them. Way, way in, and look at their individual atoms.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.560
And to understand that, we need to take a
brief diversion into atomic structure. Atoms

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.870
are the building blocks of matter. In general,
atoms are made up of three subatomic particles:

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.100
Protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons
have a positive electric charge, electrons

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.669
a negative charge, and neutrons are neutral.
Protons and neutrons are much more massive

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.330
than electrons, and occupy the centers of
atoms, in what’s called the nucleus. Electrons

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.930
whiz around the nucleus, their negative charge
attracted by the protons’ positive charge.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.930
The type of atom depends on how many protons
it has in the nucleus. Hydrogen has one proton,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.110
helium two, lithium three, and so on up the
periodic table of elements.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.970
It’s common to think of the electron as
orbiting the nucleus like a planet orbits

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.370
the Sun, but that’s not really the case.
The real situation is fiendishly complex and

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.979
involves pretty hairy quantum mechanics, but
in the end, the electron is only allowed to

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.499
occupy very specific volumes of space around the
nucleus, and those depend on the electron’s energy.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.880
Think of these like stairs on a staircase,
where the landing is the nucleus. When you

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.060
walk up the stairs, you have to use energy
to go up. And when you do, you have to go

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.000
up a whole step at a time; if you don’t
have the energy to get to the next step, you

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
can’t move. You can be on the first step,
or the second step, but you can’t be on

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.609
the first-and-a-halfths step. There isn’t
one!

00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:06.009
Electrons are the same way. They whiz around
the nucleus with a very discrete amount of

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.100
energy. If you give them an additional precise
amount of energy, they’ll move up to the

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.580
next energy level, the next step, but if you give
them the wrong amount they’ll just sit there.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.280
The opposite is true as well; electrons can
be in a higher energy state, up on a higher

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.280
step, and then give off energy when they jump
down. The amount they give off is exactly

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.460
the same amount needed to get them
to jump up in the first place.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.540
How do they get this energy? Light!

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.360
If light hitting the atom has just the right amount
of energy, the electron will absorb it and jump

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.930
up. It can also jump down and emit light at
that energy, too. An electron can also jump

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.310
two steps, or three, or whatever, but it needs
exactly the right energy to do it.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.020
But as I said earlier, energy and wavelength
are the same thing, and that’s equivalent

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:55.160
to color. So when an electron jumps up or down,
it absorbs or emits a very specific color of light.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.900
Not only that, but the steps are different
for different atoms. To stick with our analogy,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.710
it’s like different atoms are different
staircases, with different heights between

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.260
the steps. So when an electron jumps down
a step in a hydrogen atom, it emits a different

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.310
energy, a different color of light, than an electron
jumping down in a helium or calcium atom.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:19.120
And this, THIS, is the key to the Universe.
Because different atoms emit different colors

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.490
of light, if we can measure that light, in
principle we can determine what an object

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:29.120
is made of, even if we can’t touch it. Even if
it’s a bazillion light years away! And we can.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.040
Can you tell the difference between these
two squares? They’re a very slightly different

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.730
shade of red. Your eye probably can’t tell
the difference, but a spectrometer can.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.880
This is a device that can precisely measure
the wavelength of light, and can for example

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:45.900
distinguish light emitted by a hydrogen atom
from light emitted by helium. When you hook

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.400
one of these spectrometers up to a telescope, you can
figure out what astronomical objects are made of.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.330
In the case of thin gas clouds in space, the
atoms are basically floating free, rarely

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:01.140
bumping into one another. The atoms emit those
individual colors of light, allowing us to identify

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.120
them. Unlike dense stars, the color of the thinner gas
depends more on what’s in it than its temperature.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.040
And this is how we learned what the Universe
is made of. Stars and gas clouds in space

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.789
are mostly hydrogen, with some helium and
heavier elements thrown in. Jupiter has methane

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:20.709
in its atmosphere, Venus carbon dioxide. Everything
in the Universe has its own mix of ingredients,

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.289
like cakes at a bakery. With spectroscopy,
we can taste them.

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:25.940
But wait! There’s more.

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:30.789
You’re probably familiar with the Doppler
effect; the change in pitch when, say, a motorcycle

00:08:30.789 --> 00:08:37.020
goes by. In sound, the wavelength defines
the pitch; higher tones (“eeeee”) have

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:42.519
shorter wavelengths, and lower tones (“eeeee”)
longer wavelengths. When the motorcycle is

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:47.910
headed toward you, the sound waves get compressed,
causing the pitch to rise. After it passes

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.740
you, the pitch drops because the wavelengths
get stretched out.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.220
The same thing happens with light. If an object
is headed toward you, the wavelength of light

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.910
from the source gets compressed, shorter.
We say the light is blue-shifted. If it heads

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.640
away, the wavelength gets longer, and it’s
red-shifted. Apply that to a spectrum, and

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.260
by measuring that shift we can tell if an
object is moving toward or away from us.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.000
Here’s a teaser: This becomes super important
later, when we talk about galaxies.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.520
Spoiler alert: The Universe is expanding, and it's
this redshift that allowed us to figure that out.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.580
And that’s still not the end of it. With
other spectroscopic techniques we can determine

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.140
if an object is spinning and how fast, whether
it has a magnetic field and how strong it

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.610
is, and even how massive and dense an object
is. A vast amount of the fundamental properties

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.940
of astronomical objects can be found just
by dissecting their light into individual colors.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.280
Almost everything we know about the Universe
comes from the light objects in it give off.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.320
Pictures of astronomical objects show us their
structure, their beauty, and hint at their

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.860
history. But with spectra, we can examine
their blueprints.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.920
Today you learned that light is a form of
energy. Its wavelength tells us its energy

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.380
and color. Spectroscopy allows us to analyze
those colors and determine an object’s temperature,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.370
density, spin, motion, and chemical composition.
