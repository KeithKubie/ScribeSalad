you know what you've learned from this
experiment<00:21:36.929><c> it</c><00:21:37.350><c> made</c><00:21:37.620><c> a</c><00:21:37.649><c> big</c><00:21:37.860><c> difference</c><00:21:38.070><c> in</c>

00:21:42.889 --> 00:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
in the kids lives and performance so I
 

00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:45.139 align:start position:0%
in the kids lives and performance so I
think<00:21:43.049><c> by</c><00:21:43.379><c> enlarge</c><00:21:43.740><c> it's</c><00:21:43.980><c> mostly</c><00:21:44.370><c> a</c><00:21:44.519><c> positive</c>

00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:45.149 align:start position:0%
think by enlarge it's mostly a positive
 

00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:48.860 align:start position:0%
think by enlarge it's mostly a positive
result<00:21:45.509><c> but</c><00:21:45.929><c> of</c><00:21:46.350><c> course</c><00:21:47.059><c> you</c><00:21:48.059><c> know</c><00:21:48.179><c> we</c><00:21:48.690><c> get</c>

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:48.870 align:start position:0%
result but of course you know we get
 

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.749 align:start position:0%
result but of course you know we get
lots<00:21:49.049><c> of</c><00:21:49.169><c> knowledge</c><00:21:49.529><c> that</c><00:21:49.889><c> it's</c><00:21:50.309><c> hard</c><00:21:50.669><c> to</c>

00:21:50.749 --> 00:21:50.759 align:start position:0%
lots of knowledge that it's hard to
 

00:21:50.759 --> 00:21:52.490 align:start position:0%
lots of knowledge that it's hard to

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
figure out whether it is reliable and
 

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.619 align:start position:0%
figure out whether it is reliable and
accurate<00:21:52.919><c> and</c><00:21:53.370><c> I</c><00:21:53.429><c> guess</c><00:21:53.820><c> that's</c><00:21:54.059><c> the</c><00:21:54.210><c> bad</c><00:21:54.360><c> side</c>

00:21:54.619 --> 00:21:54.629 align:start position:0%
