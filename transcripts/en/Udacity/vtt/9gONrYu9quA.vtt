00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.337
Let's talk a little bit about number line notation. There are two main ways that

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:08.552
people use to show inequalities on number lines. One set of conventions uses

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:12.907
dots, either open or closed, and the other set of conventions uses parenthesis,

00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:17.312
either square parenthesis or brackets, or rounded parenthesis. The closed dot

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:21.606
and the square bracket are equivalent. And to one another or show the same

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:25.663
inequalities. In the open circle and the rounded bracket show the same

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:30.181
inequalities. Thinking about what you know about selecting numbers on number

00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:34.465
lines so far, which pair of inequalities do you think shows x is greater than

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:38.640
negative 2 and which one do you think shows x is greater that negative 2?
