00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Today, we're going
to test what happens

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.980
if you put burning charcoal
into a vacuum chamber.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.969
Are they going to keep burning?

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:05.747
Will they go out?

00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:07.160
Let's find out what changes.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.840
[Music]

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.700
YouTuber Donta Sharp asked
what would happen

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.280
if we put hot coals
in a vacuum chamber.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.354
Donta, we don't know,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.200
and so we are going
to find out.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.100
We've got some hot coals.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.700
We've got a vacuum chamber.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.200
Let's see what they do.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800
We got a camera
and a light going inside.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.800
Let's see what happens
when you turn on the vacuum.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.460
There's a tornado in there.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.400
We should film all sorts
of things inside vacuum chamber.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.060
I see glowing.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.900
There's orange starting to show
up on the edge of those coals.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.040
Oh, yeah.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.300
That's picking up.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.800
They're starting to glow.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.340
Good airflow.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.140
[Music]

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.000
There's charcoal in one type
of vacuum chamber.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.549
Now, I'm sure

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.500
what you meant was putting in
a low pressure vacuum chamber,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.200
and of course,
we're going to do that too.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.700
Let's talk about how.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700
As a control,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.924
we are just going to put
some unlit charcoal

00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:15.200
into our chamber to see
how that's different.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.300
My prediction is

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.200
that we won't be able
to see any change.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.100
Nothing will move.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.900
We'll just have
the charcoal sitting in there.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.536
And that's okay.

00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:23.160
The point of this
isn't actually to see

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.400
what happens in low pressure.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.600
It's the see
what happens in low oxygen.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.800
And once those are burning,
that should make a difference.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.800
Now to me,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500
that didn't look
like a whole lot changed,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.060
which as I said is
what we expected.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.000
Unburning charcoal,
doesn't do much in vacuum.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.600
Now, let's test burning,
and like I said,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.200
we're going to do this
in a few different ways.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
We're going to have
burning charcoal down

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.310
in our vacuum chamber,
sitting on top of some kaowool,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.923
so that the heat isn't directly
transferred into the glass.

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:48.500
We're going to
take another chamber,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.580
same size and shape,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.764
and we're going to put
some more charcoal in that.

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:52.300
In that one,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.500
we're also going to add
a bit of dry ice.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.300
Hopefully, that will just
flood the entire inside

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.300
with carbon dioxide,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
and we can see the difference
between a non-oxygen environment

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.540
and a carbon
dioxide environment.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.040
Then we'll have one final set
of charcoal off the side,

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:07.000
also not in a jar.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.500
It will be exposed to the air,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
but we're going to use our shop
vac to blow air onto it.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.300
So it has sort of an extra
oxygen enriched environment.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400
I figured that will give
us a good spread

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.540
from high oxygen down to no
or opposing oxygen environments.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.127
We'll see which charcoals
burn the fastest,

00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:24.900
and we've got

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.800
a temperature gun to see what
the difference is in heat.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800
Here's the basic idea.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.484
We're going to take
some burning charcoal,

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:31.800
we'll put it
in a vacuum chamber,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.110
another chamber
with carbon dioxide,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.050
a pile charcoal just
sitting in the air,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.900
and some more charcoal with
added air being blown on it.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.900
One idea that we did have
was actually to use

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.800
pure oxygen to show
what that did with the charcoal.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.900
There's a couple of reasons
we're not going to do that.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.820
One, this is not a very
common situation.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.580
The air around us is actually
not a pure oxygen environment.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.938
Most of it is nitrogen with
some oxygen, carbon dioxide,

00:02:55.938 --> 00:02:57.800
and other elements
floating around in it.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.701
The other reason is
that these tanks aren't free,

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:02.000
and we actually go through them
really quickly while trying

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.891
this experiment out.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.745
We are hoping to let things run
a little bit longer than that,

00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:07.095
but we did want to show you

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:09.197
what happens when we
put a pure oxygen stream

00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:11.300
onto one of these burning
pieces of charcoal.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.400
It's pretty neat.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.040
[Music]

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.340
You can already see how
much it heats the coal up,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.554
and gets it burning better.

00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:24.500
But watch what happens
as I get the oxygen even closer,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.900
making it more intense.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.580
[Music]

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.900
This wasn't a
brand-new canister,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.680
but it is now empty.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.895
Like I said, it goes
through it really quickly.

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:39.695
Look at that.

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:42.500
Where I was blowing
the oxygen right in, it just,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.326
it burns so well and intensely

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:46.580
that just tunneled
right down through.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.800
Also, it really sparks a lot.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.900
I think it burned me
through my glove a little bit.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:04:14.320
[Music]

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.300
Okay, now we're going
to fill this chamber

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.400
with carbon dioxide
by using the dry ice.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.848
So we're just gonna let
this overflow down

00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:23.660
into that chamber a little bit.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.720
[Music]

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.400
Of course now,
the GoPro can't see anything,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.960
but it'll clear out really soon.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.680
[Music]

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.900
Lot of vapor in there.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.020
[Music]

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.560
Using dry ice down
into there as well.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.500
At that point,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.195
there should be almost
exclusively carbon dioxide

00:04:53.195 --> 00:04:56.171
in that chamber without really
any oxygen or nitrogen,

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.800
or any of those other things.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:10.180
[Music]

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.300
Our thermometer is currently
showing our outside charcoal

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.820
at 850 degrees, approximately.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.760
That's in Fahrenheit.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.080
That's warm.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.200
Okay, this puts
out a lot of air.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.400
We're going to be blowing
that on the charcoal,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.200
and it's going to start glowing
orange like immediately.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:49.740
[Music]

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.800
All right, quick update.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.889
If you remember,

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.000
we are getting
about 880 degrees

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.688
Fahrenheit with the charcoal
just sitting there.

00:05:56.688 --> 00:05:59.100
Let's look at what it
is with the charcoal

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.200
we've been hitting with the air.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.500
1,300 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.260
[inaudible]

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.140
For a second, it was at 1,300.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.300
It's already dropping,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.474
but that was 500
degrees Fahrenheit hotter

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.420
just from the vacuum.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.500
That's a lot.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:36.380
[Music]

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.800
It's been 10, maybe 12 minutes
that we've been letting all four

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.032
of these types run,

00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:43.300
and we want to do
a temperature update.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.400
Sorry about the noise.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.430
The vacuum is running,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.120
and we do want
to let it keep going.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.100
But we're going to do a check.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.245
Oh, no, we lost them.

00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:51.100
Well, let's do
a check of this one.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.680
All right.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.639
The moment this tiny one
is only registering 1,100--

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.100
Oh, 1,200 for a second.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.377
Before, when all
three were stacked,

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.060
this registered at over
1,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.360
So we're going to put

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.800
that at 1,500 because those
just barely got blown over.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.000
Let's check the ones
just sitting out.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.120
All right,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.200
between 790 and 850 is kind of
what we're getting here.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.400
Our carbon dioxide.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.740
287.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.080
Wow, that is 220 down there.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.400
That's like barely
hot enough to boil water.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.300
This has gone way down.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.800
So under 300, definitely.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.600
All right, we are going
to let are back into this one.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.400
I'm gonna try and do it slowly

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.860
so it doesn't fan
the charcoal too much.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.840
255.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.700
So like the carbon
dioxide environment,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.800
this is really
suffering on heat.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.600
We've let some hot coals sit out
in the open air for a while,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.612
and we've gotten to the point

00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:02.800
where they're really
falling apart.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.824
They're mostly made of ash

00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:05.400
so I figure that's
a good time to compare

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.050
how they are to the ones
in our carbon dioxide chamber

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.200
and our vacuum chamber.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.100
Let's take a look.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.200
[Music]

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.100
Most of our mass
is gone from those.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.720
They've burned down
most to the ash,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.820
so let's do a comparison.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.420
We already looked at the ones
that we're blowing with a vacuum,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.580
and those just,
it took 10 minutes maybe,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.000
and there's just
down to this size,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.390
maybe even smaller.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.220
Gotta say, preliminarily,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.800
our charcoal in
here doesn't look

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.900
like it's been burning
very much compared to this.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.480
It's about the size
that they went in.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.671
So we've got thousand
degrees surface temperature

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.000
on these ones.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.300
80 degrees surface temperature
in these ones.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.780
All right, that--

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.600
I'm going to risk this,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.800
and just grab it
with my fingers.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.220
[Music]

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.160
That's--

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.540
I mean, that's just out.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.780
There is no burning
left to this.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.020
The carbon dioxide put
that charcoal out completely.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.600
There's--

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.040
It's not on fire.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.380
It's-- I wouldn't call
that a hot coal anymore.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.260
That's just left over charcoal.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.660
No longer burning.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.780
All right, let's check
our vacuum chamber.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.580
Also 92,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.500
and that is really similar
to the carbon dioxide one.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.280
Okay, I'm going
to risk it again.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.300
Pull that out.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.740
This one feels
a tiny bit warmer,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.233
just like a couple of degrees.

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:35.100
Like it does feel slightly warm
compared to the dry ice ones,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.220
which just didn't
feel warm at all.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.680
They felt fairly cool.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.700
But again, no danger
in me holding this.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.380
They're not hot.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.520
They are not going to burn me.

00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:44.500
Nothing is glowing.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.800
There's no ember left.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.060
Those are out.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.900
Donta Sharp, thank you
for your suggestion

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.540
of putting hot coals
in a vacuum chamber.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.500
I think we learned
some interesting things.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.300
It was really cool
to see what it did.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.920
Guys, you know, that's not all.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.970
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.400
Check out that box
up at the top.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.550
It's going to take you
to our last video.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.509
You should go check that out.

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:02.675
The other box
is going to show you

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.520
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching now.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.700
And if you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.875
you'll be subscribe
to the channel.

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:08.500
That way, you're not going
to miss a cool video.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.648
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:09.648 --> 00:10:10.870
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:11.840
Talk to you then.
