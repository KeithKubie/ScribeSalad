00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:11.260
Massive vines that blanket
the southern United States,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.533
climbing as high as 100 feet as they
uproot trees and swallow buildings.

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:21.109
A ravenous snake that is capable of
devouring an alligator.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.158
Rabbit populations that eat
themselves into starvation.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.149
These aren't horror movie concepts.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.545
They're real stories,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:32.410
but how could such situations
exist in nature?

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.880
All three are examples
of invasive species,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.033
organisms harmful not because
of what they are,

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:41.802
but where they happen to be.

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.443
The kudzu vine, for example,

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:47.695
had grown quality in its native east Asia,
eaten by various insects

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.461
and dying off during the cold winters.

00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:51.977
But its fortunes changed

00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:55.072
when it was imported 
into the southeastern United States

00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:58.639
for porch decoration and cattle feed.

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:02.665
Its planting was even subsidized
by the government to fight soil erosion.

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:08.061
With sunny fields, a mild climate,
and no natural predators in its new home,

00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.453
the vine grew uncontrollably

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:15.247
until it became known as the plant
that ate the South.

00:01:15.247 --> 00:01:19.018
Meanwhile in Florida's Everglades,
Burmese pythons,

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:21.558
thought to have been released
by pet owners,

00:01:21.558 --> 00:01:25.908
are the cause of decreasing populations
of organisms.

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:28.733
They're successfully outcompeting
top predators,

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.892
such as the alligator and panther,

00:01:30.892 --> 00:01:33.896
causing a significant reduction
in their food sources.

00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:35.916
They're not a problem
in their native Asia

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:41.582
because diseases, parasites, and predators
help to control their population size.

00:01:41.582 --> 00:01:45.635
And in Australia, European rabbits
eat so many plants

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:50.494
that they wipe out the food supply
for themselves and other herbivores.

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:52.137
They're a pretty recent addition,

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:58.768
intentionally introduced to the continent
because one man enjoyed hunting them.

00:01:58.768 --> 00:02:00.596
Like the Burmese pythons,

00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:05.012
various factors in their native habitat
keep their numbers in control.

00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:07.171
But in Australia, the lack of predators

00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:10.740
and a climate perfect 
for year-long reproduction

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.736
allows their populations to skyrocket.

00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:16.477
So why does this keep happening?

00:02:16.477 --> 00:02:18.272
Most of the world's ecosystems

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:22.458
are the result of millennia 
of coevolution by organisms,

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:24.711
adapting to their environment 
and each other

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.644
until a stable balance is reached.

00:02:27.644 --> 00:02:31.828
Healthy ecosystems maintain this balance
via limiting factors,

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:36.947
environmental conditions that restrict
the size or range of a species.

00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:39.942
These include things 
like natural geography and climate,

00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:41.451
food availability,

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:44.702
and the presence or absence of predators.

00:02:44.702 --> 00:02:49.303
For example, plant growth depends
on levels of sunlight and soil nutrients.

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:53.009
The amount of edible plants affects
the population of herbivores,

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.453
which in turn impacts the carnivores
that feed on them.

00:02:56.453 --> 00:03:01.338
And a healthy predator population keeps
the herbivores from becoming too numerous

00:03:01.338 --> 00:03:03.696
and devouring all the plants.

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:08.105
But even minor changes in one factor
can upset this balance,

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:10.903
and the sudden introduction
of non-native organisms

00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:13.417
can be a pretty major change.

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:16.667
A species that is evolved
in a separate habitat

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:19.558
will be susceptible to different 
limiting factors,

00:03:19.558 --> 00:03:20.852
different predators,

00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:22.519
different energy sources,

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.061
and different climates.

00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:28.514
If the new habitat's limiting factors
fail to restrict the species growth,

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:30.765
it will continue to multiply,

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:33.239
out-competing native organisms
for resources

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.777
and disrupting the entire ecosystem.

00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:41.358
Species are sometimes introduced
into new habitats through natural factors,

00:03:41.358 --> 00:03:42.346
like storms,

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:43.480
ocean currents,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.150
or climate shifts.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.983
The majority of invasive species,
though, are introduced by humans.

00:03:49.983 --> 00:03:51.844
Often this happens unintentionally,

00:03:51.844 --> 00:03:57.383
as when the zebra mussel was accidentally
brought to Lake Erie by cargo ships.

00:03:57.383 --> 00:03:59.546
But as people migrate around the world,

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:03.698
we have also deliberately brought
our plants and animals along,

00:04:03.698 --> 00:04:06.553
rarely considering the consequences.

00:04:06.553 --> 00:04:08.872
But now that we're learning more

00:04:08.872 --> 00:04:11.326
about the effects of invasive species
on ecosystems,

00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:15.925
many governments closely monitor
the transport of plants and animals,

00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:18.953
and ban the imports of certain organisms.

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:22.112
But could the species with
the most drastic environmental impact

00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:26.964
be a group of primates who emerged
from Africa to cover most of the world?

00:04:26.964 --> 00:04:30.401
Are we an invasive species?
