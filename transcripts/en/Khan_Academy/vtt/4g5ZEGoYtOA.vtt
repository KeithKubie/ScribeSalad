00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.295
- We're told that cars A, B, and C

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:04.629
are traveling at constant speeds

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.241
and they say select the car
that travels the fastest

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.573
and we have these three scenarios here.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:12.283
So, I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:14.984
and try to figure out
which of these three cars

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:16.734
is traveling the fastest,

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:18.651
car A, car B, or car C.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.143
Alright, now, let's work
through this together.

00:00:21.143 --> 00:00:22.333
So, car A,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.678
they clearly just give its speed,

00:00:24.678 --> 00:00:27.111
it's 50 kilometers per hour.

00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:27.944
Now, let's see,

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.261
car B travels the distance of D kilometers

00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:31.094
in H hours

00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:34.688
based on the equation 55h

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:37.402
is equal to D.

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:40.078
Alright, now, let's see if
we can translate this somehow

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:42.256
into kilometers per hour.

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:44.060
So, 55h is equal to D

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.663
or we could say D

00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:49.155
is equal to 55H

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:50.762
and here I'm doing,

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:51.968
this is this scenario right over here,

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.445
not scenario A.

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:54.929
And so, another way to think about it is

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.708
distance divided by time,

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:58.664
so if we divide both sides by hours,

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:01.527
we would have distance divided by time,

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.777
and so if we have D over H,

00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:07.654
then we would just be left
with 55 on the right hand side.

00:01:07.654 --> 00:01:09.483
All I did is I divided both sides

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:11.278
by H.

00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:13.986
Now, this is distance divided by time,

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:15.861
so the units here are going to be,

00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:16.694
we're assuming,

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:17.934
and it tells us D is in kilometers,

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:19.185
H is in hours,

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:20.861
so the units here are going to be

00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:22.528
kilometers per hour.

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.634
So, car B is going 55 kilometers per hour

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:30.057
while car A is only going
50 kilometers per hour.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:32.882
So, so far, car B is the fastest.

00:01:32.882 --> 00:01:36.965
Now, car C travels 135
kilometers in three hours.

00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:40.454
Well, let's just get the hourly rate

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:42.376
or I guess you could say the unit rate.

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:45.293
So, 135 kilometers

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.409
in three hours,

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.787
and so we can get the rate per hour,

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:55.998
so 135 divided by three is what?

00:01:55.998 --> 00:01:57.481
That is going to be,

00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:58.734
let's do it in our head,

00:01:58.734 --> 00:01:59.644
I think it's 45

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:00.806
but let me just verify that,

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:03.022
three goes into 135,

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.729
three goes into 13 four times,

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.673
four times three is 12.

00:02:06.673 --> 00:02:08.205
You subtract,

00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:09.367
you get, yep,

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:11.781
three goes into 15 five times,

00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:13.737
five times three is 15.

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:14.981
Subtract zero.

00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:17.270
So, this is equal to 45

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.937
kilometers per hour.

00:02:20.108 --> 00:02:21.894
So, car A is 50 kilometers per hour,

00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:24.186
car B is 55 kilometers per hour,

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:26.480
car C is 45 kilometers per hour,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.190
so car B is the fastest.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.953
Let's do another example.

00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:35.032
So, here, we're asked
which relationships have

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:39.584
the same constant of
proportionality between Y and X

00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:44.382
as the equation 3y is equal to 27x.

00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:46.249
And we have three choices here

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.165
and actually there's
two more below the fold,

00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:50.459
but just for the three that you see,

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.702
pause the video and see which of these

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:54.853
have the same constant of proportionality

00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:56.686
as 3y is equal to 27x.

00:02:58.014 --> 00:02:59.687
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:02:59.687 --> 00:03:02.067
So, first, let's figure out
this constant of proportionality

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:06.263
with 3y is equal to 27x.

00:03:06.263 --> 00:03:09.433
One way to figure out the
constant of proportionality

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:12.390
is you can get it in
the form Y is equal to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.972
R times X where R would be your
constant of proportionality.

00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:17.316
So, let's do that.

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:18.309
Well, to get it in that form,

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.515
you just divide both sides by three,

00:03:20.515 --> 00:03:22.473
divide both sides by three,

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:25.584
and you are left with Y is equal to

00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:28.666
27 divided by three is 9x.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.657
So, our constant of proportionality
that we're looking for

00:03:30.657 --> 00:03:32.400
is nine.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.784
Well, that's exactly what
choice A right over here is,

00:03:34.784 --> 00:03:36.323
Y is equal to 9x,

00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:38.407
constant of proportionality is nine.

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:40.240
So, I like that answer.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.455
Now, 2y is equal to 18x,

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.780
if we were to solve for
Y on the left hand side,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.867
divide both sides by two,

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:48.736
you're gonna get Y,

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:50.653
Y is equal to 9x again.

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:54.149
Once again, same constant
of proportionality.

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.854
So, B is a good choice.

00:03:56.854 --> 00:03:58.814
Now, let's see over here.

00:03:58.814 --> 00:04:00.945
When X is equal to one,

00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:04.492
Y is equal to nine.

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:06.030
Or another way to think about it is

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.867
Y, in this case,

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:10.399
is nine times X.

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.641
So, this is the point one, comma, nine,

00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:16.595
and so you see that Y is nine times X,

00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:18.511
Y is nine times X.

00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:20.421
So, our constant of proportionality again

00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:22.087
is equal to nine.

00:04:22.087 --> 00:04:24.165
So, actually, the three
that we can see on screen,

00:04:24.165 --> 00:04:25.375
and they say choose three,

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:27.412
so these are going to
be our three answers.

00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:28.456
Well, let's just verify that

00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.293
the other two choices that you don't see

00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:34.376
don't have a constant of
proportionality of nine.

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:38.379
Constant of propor, propor. (laughs)

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:39.876
Trouble saying that, alright.

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:40.830
Okay.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.780
So, here,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.809
we're given the relationship
between X and Y at a table.

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.023
And so, to go from three to one third,

00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:49.700
let's see, to go from three to one third,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.364
what do you multiply by?

00:04:52.364 --> 00:04:53.610
Well, to go from three to one third,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.231
you multiply by one ninth.

00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:58.389
To go from six to two thirds,

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.387
you multiply by one ninth,

00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:01.434
or another way to think about it,

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:02.771
you divide by nine.

00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:03.604
So, here,

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:05.657
our constant of
proportionality is one ninth,

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:06.615
not nine.

00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:09.282
Y is equal to one ninth times X.

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:11.976
Now, over here,

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:13.851
let's see, to go from two to 18,

00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:15.309
you do multiply by nine,

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:16.896
so that's interesting.

00:05:16.896 --> 00:05:17.976
And then, here,

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:19.269
but to go from four to 27,

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:20.815
you don't multiply by nine,

00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:23.025
you're multiplying by
something other than nine.

00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:24.352
And then to go from six to 36,

00:05:24.352 --> 00:05:26.063
you're multiplying by six.

00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:27.060
So, this last table,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.930
it's not even a proportional relationship,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.761
much less have the same
constant of proportionality.
