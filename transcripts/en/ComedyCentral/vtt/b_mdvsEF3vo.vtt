- Guys, mushrooms
and the abandoned "M.A.S.H."

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.908
[laughter]

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:12.378 align:end position:100%
I can't imagine a better thing
to do on mushrooms.

- Welcome to
"This Is Not Happening."

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:51.984
I'm your host, Ari Shaffir,

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.587
and tonight the topic
is psychedelia.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:55.955
[cheers and applause]

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.496 align:end position:100%
It was, like, three,
four years ago, we all decided--

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.997 align:end position:100%
we found--somebody looked
in their freezer,

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.598 align:end position:100%
and they looked
in the back, like,

00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:08.100 align:end position:100%
"Oh, I have, like,
an ounce of mushrooms,"

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.635 align:end position:100%
and, like,
"Well, let's do those..."

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:10.970
both: "Right now."

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.672 align:end position:100%
- So we're like,
"Let's go camping,"

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:16.109 align:end position:100%
and, like, "Okay,"
and we left at, like, 5:45 p.m.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.910 align:end position:100%
to go to
Malibu Creek State Park,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.147 align:end position:100%
which took us, like, 3 1/2,
4 hours to get there.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.783
It was great, but then we're
trying to set this tent up...

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:27.686
- In the complete dark.
- Yeah, by iPhone light.

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.822 align:end position:100%
And not the good iPhone,
where you have the flashlight,

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:32.492 align:end position:100%
the fucking shitty iPhone 3,
like an immigrant.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.460 align:end position:100%
"Okay," just the
front-facing thing, you know?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.928 size:84% position:42%
- We're using the screen...

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.463
- Yeah, the screen?
- On full brightness.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:38.798 align:start size:16% position:84%
- No.

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.333 align:end position:100%
And it was hard
to set this tent up.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.801 align:end position:100%
By the way,
as soon as we got there,

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.603 align:end position:100%
everybody jumps out of the van
we're all in.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:44.971 align:end position:100%
Everybody jumps out,
and they all go,

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.606 align:end position:100%
"Mushrooms! Mushrooms!
Mushrooms!"

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.207 align:end position:100%
And we're like,
"No, tent, first tent.

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:49.642
- Set up the tent.
- Yeah.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.811 align:start position:0%
- We're gonna need the tent
after the mushrooms.

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.312 align:end position:100%
- Yeah,
so we tried to set it up.

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:54.714
It was a big tent we had too.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.649 align:start position:0%
- I mean, we're, like,
climbing over each other,

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.051 align:start position:0%
sticking stakes--
I had his Jew 'fro in my mouth,

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.553 align:start position:0%
like,
three times.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.354 align:start position:0%
That's what Jew 'fro
tastes like.

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.557
- Yeah, what does it taste like?
- Money.

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.525 align:start size:66% position:34%
Stupid, stupid idiot.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.194 align:start position:0%
- It's, like, a 20.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.829
[laughter]

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.364 align:start size:66% position:34%
- That's a good bill.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.666 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, I would have said 5,
but that doesn't taste--

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.001 align:end position:100%
- Come on,
that's insulting.

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.503 align:end position:100%
So we're trying to set
this tent up,

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:18.704
and we don't know how to do it.

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:20.139
We're fucking--it's difficult.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.640 align:end position:100%
We're trying to get it--
and by the way,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.409 align:end position:100%
our one friend, Madonia,
refuses to help.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.011 align:start position:0%
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:28.181
He took the liberty of being
the grinder of the mushrooms.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.349 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, he was like,
"You guys set the tent up.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.852 align:end position:100%
I'll grind the mushrooms,
so they're ready."

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:35.555 align:start position:0%
- It was like,
"Don't break your back, Dan."

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.090
[laughter]

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.358 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, he was like,
"I'm really good at grinding."

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.026 align:start size:72% position:28%
Like, what, doing this?

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:42.194 align:start position:0%
- This?

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.896 align:end position:100%
- Where'd you go to school
for that?

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.698 align:start position:0%
- It's a grinder.
It's made to be simple.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.166 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, we could just do it
afterwards.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.001 align:end position:100%
He's like, "Trust me.
I'm really good."

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.504 align:end position:100%
I'm like, "All right,
fucking idiot, don't help."

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:52.838 size:84% position:42%
- That was a huge tent too.

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:54.240
- It was hard.
It was hard.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.075
- It was two-story.
- It was not two stories.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.177 align:end position:100%
It was a nice tent,
but it was not two stories.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.913 align:end position:100%
It was, like,
an eight-person tent.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.747
- It had a chimney.
- It did not have a chimney.

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:03.182
Stop it.
- It came with a receptionist.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.117 align:end position:100%
- All right, it did not come
with a receptionist.

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.287 align:end position:100%
It was a nice seven-,
eight-person tent,

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:08.387 align:start size:50% position:50%
but it was hard.

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:09.755 align:start size:69% position:31%
We couldn't set it up.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:11.390 align:end position:100%
Our real problem was that it was
just us there.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.792 align:start position:0%
- There was no men.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.627 align:start size:78% position:22%
- Yeah, there was no men.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.094 size:88% position:44%
- It was a bunch of dudes...

00:03:16.094 --> 00:03:17.463 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Yeah.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.065 align:start position:0%
- That never camp.

00:03:19.065 --> 00:03:21.367 align:start position:0%
Finally, our buddy Marino's
girlfriend was like,

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.869 size:84% position:42%
"Just move out of the way."

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.070 size:88% position:56%
- Yeah, she took care of it.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.404 align:end position:100%
She was like,
"You hold that pipe.

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:26.638 align:end position:100%
You hold that pipe.
Just do it."

00:03:26.638 --> 00:03:28.808 size:78% position:39%
- She was like a foreman.

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:31.144 align:start position:0%
And in, like, five minutes,
there it was.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.912
- Yeah, all set up.
- Perfectly.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.780 align:end position:100%
- It was great then.
Then we took the mushrooms.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.050 align:start position:0%
- Yeah,
took the mushrooms,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.984 align:start position:0%
and for the next hour,
there's that, like--

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:40.753
- Yeah, there's that moment of,
like, "Has it kicked in yet?"

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.121
- "Did you feel anything?"
- "I don't know.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.622 align:end position:100%
"I think I might feel it.
Do you feel it?

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:44.824 align:end position:100%
I don't know.
I sort of feel it."

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:46.225
- "No, that was a fart."
- "Oh, okay.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.794 align:start size:53% position:47%
Maybe I feel it."

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.995 align:end position:100%
And then when they hit,
like, 45 minutes in, an hour in,

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:52.232
they're just like this whoosh,
and you're like, "Oh, yeah.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.632 align:end position:100%
"Oh, I don't know what I was
talking about before.

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.067
- Yeah.
- This is..."

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.069 align:start position:0%
- No question.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.603 align:end position:100%
- "Yeah, this is
for sure it now."

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.338 align:start position:0%
- And that's how we--
that's how we knew

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:01.975
the 'shrooms were working, was
when we couldn't stop laughing

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:04.777 align:start position:0%
at how perfectly
we nailed the tent.

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.345 align:start size:78% position:22%
- Yes, it looked so good.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:07.613 align:start position:0%
- Just like on the box.

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:09.581 align:end position:100%
- It looked just like
on the box.

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:10.916 align:start position:0%
- Like, I put the box
next to the tent.

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
I was like,
"Which one do I sleep in?"

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:14.954 align:end position:100%
- It's so good.
It looked so good.

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:17.289 align:start position:0%
- The picture on the box
even had a camper

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.291 align:start position:0%
sleeping in front of the tent,
and our friend Luke

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.794 align:start position:0%
just so happened to pass out
in front of the tent,

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:23.462 align:start position:0%
so it was, like,
it even came with Luke.

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:25.765
- Look at that.
- Like...

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.466 align:end position:100%
- Guys, we fucking nailed it.
We nailed it.

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:29.936 align:end position:100%
And when mushrooms happen,
as soon as it starts happening,

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.470 align:end position:100%
you start laughing
at everything...

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.472
- Oh, crying, just--
- First at tent.

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:34.974 size:84% position:58%
Willie--our buddy Willie...

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:38.811 align:start position:0%
- Willie kept on guessing
the time.

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.145 align:start position:0%
He was so dialed in.

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:41.681 align:end position:100%
- No clock, no watch,
none of that.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.148 align:start position:0%
- Just, "11:58."

00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:44.651 align:end position:100%
- And we'd be like,
"What the fuck?

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.118 align:start size:50% position:50%
No fucking way!"

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:48.654
- "Thank you."
- "How'd you do that?"

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:51.657 align:start position:0%
- A few minutes would go by,
"12:13."

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.992 align:end position:100%
- "No way, man.
Fuck!"

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:55.694 align:start size:63% position:38%
It would just happen
over and over again.

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:57.196 align:start size:63% position:38%
Oh, man, good times.

00:04:57.196 --> 00:04:58.998
By the way, that was as good
as it got for Willie.

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.166 align:start position:0%
- Oh, yeah.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.333
- That was his pinnacle.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:02.735 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.370 align:end position:100%
- Mushrooms gives you good times
and bad times,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.805 align:start size:69% position:31%
then good times again.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.639 align:end position:100%
That was--he never had
the good times again.

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.008
It was just there and then gone.

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:14.313 align:start position:0%
- I've never seen anybody
walk home from a camping trip.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.816
[laughter]

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.218 align:start position:0%
Willie slept in his bed
that night.

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:21.687
[laughter]

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.056 size:78% position:39%
I called him a few hours.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.556 align:start position:0%
I was like,
"Willie, where are you?"

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:26.859 align:start position:0%
He was like, "I'm freaking out
in McDonald's, man."

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:28.561 align:start position:0%
He was like, "Yeah,
everybody's looking at me."

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.330 align:start position:0%
"Like, because you're probably
making a scene, Willie."

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.899 align:start position:0%
Like...

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.534 align:end position:100%
- Walking to McDonald's.
We were gonna get him at first.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.535 size:84% position:58%
We're like, "Where are you?
Where can we pick you up?"

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:38.204 align:end position:100%
He's like, "I'm at McDonald's."
We're like, "Oh."

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
- We're like,
"Oh, you're--you're fucked."

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.407 align:end position:100%
- "Yeah, we can't--
we can't get you from there."

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:43.375 align:start position:0%
- And he's like,
"Yeah, I think we need to go

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:44.710 align:start position:0%
our separate ways."

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.378 align:start position:0%
I was like,
"Yeah, we definitely

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:48.280 size:78% position:39%
can't get you right now."

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.682
"No, no, no, I mean, in life."

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:54.186 align:start position:0%
I was like,
"Are you breaking up with me

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:55.788 align:start position:0%
on the phone?"

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.256 align:end position:100%
- He thought he was better
than us.

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:00.692 align:start position:0%
- Earlier that day,
he had signed a contract

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:02.528 size:78% position:39%
to shoot a pilot for NBC,

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.798 align:start position:0%
so he's in McDonald's,
and he's telling me, he's like--

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.066 align:start position:0%
he's like,
"You know, like, lookit.

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:09.201
I'm a big-time TV writer now."

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.436
[laughter]

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:13.706 align:start position:0%
"And you're just taking drugs
out in the wilderness.

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:17.109
Like, you're--you're a loser."

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:20.780
And I was like, "Willie, you're
tripping balls in a McDonald's."

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.082
[laughter]

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:24.416 size:88% position:44%
"You're not better than me."

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:26.085 align:end position:100%
- "You're not better
than anybody, bro.

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:27.620
You ain't better than anybody."

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.088 align:start position:0%
- He's like,
"I know, I know, I know.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:31.557 size:81% position:41%
"I just--I just don't want
to lose this, all right?

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:32.758
"I just--I've worked so hard.

00:06:32.758 --> 00:06:33.992 size:78% position:39%
"I finally got something.

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:35.594 align:start position:0%
"I just don't want to--
hey, you.

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:36.929 size:78% position:39%
"What are you looking at?

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.465 align:start position:0%
"Yeah, you.
What the fuck you looking at?

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:40.766 align:start position:0%
I got to go."

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:41.968 align:start position:0%
"Willie?
Willie?"

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.603 align:end position:100%
- "Hey, where is he?
Where is he?"

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:45.505 align:end position:100%
He's like, "He won't answer
the phone anymore."

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.105 align:start position:0%
- Willie's in some shit
with some guy in McDonald's,

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:49.441
and there's nothing we could do.

00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:51.277 align:start size:59% position:41%
- Anyway, whatever,
but that was later.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.811 align:end position:100%
So then earlier,
here was the plan,

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.280 align:start size:75% position:25%
Malibu Creek State Park.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.614 align:end position:100%
I don't know if you've ever
been there,

00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:56.949 align:start size:78% position:22%
but tell them what it is.

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.818 size:75% position:38%
- Oh, Malibu State Park
is where--

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:01.687 align:start position:0%
Malibu Creek State Park
is where they shot

00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
the TV show "M.A.S.H."

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.959 align:start position:0%
So one of the novelties
of camping here

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:09.028 align:start position:0%
is that you could take a trail
and go see

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:10.762 align:start position:0%
the ruins of "M.A.S.H.";
they left the whole set there.

00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:12.164 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, they left
the whole set there.

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:14.766 align:end position:100%
It's all there,
which, guys,

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:16.769 align:end position:100%
mushrooms
and the abandoned "M.A.S.H."

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.038
[laughter]

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:22.307
I can't imagine a better thing
to do on mushrooms than go--

00:07:22.307 --> 00:07:24.276 align:start position:0%
- I mean, the set of "M.A.S.H."
is one thing.

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:26.345 align:start position:0%
It's, like, whatever,
but then on mushrooms?

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:27.679 align:start size:53% position:47%
- Yeah, for sure.

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:29.281 align:start position:0%
- We're going.

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:31.450 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, by the way, just spoiler
alert: we never found it.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.285
- Oh, we never made it, no.
- We never got there.

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:35.021
He went, like, two years later
and found out it was, like,

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.021
15 minutes away from where
we hiked--where we camped...

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:37.323
- It was right under our nose.

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.524 align:end position:100%
- But we could've never
found it.

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:39.859 align:start position:0%
- And, you know.

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.193 align:start size:81% position:19%
- So we smoked this joint.

00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:42.795 align:end position:100%
We were gonna, like,
we took it all.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.964 align:end position:100%
We were like, "Let's do it."
We're all laughing.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.198 align:end position:100%
We're like, "All right,
it's time to go find 'M.A.S.H.'"

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:47.733
And then we smoked this joint.

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.168 align:end position:100%
Our friend Erik Marino
had this joint.

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:51.169 align:end position:100%
By the way, the dispensary owner
who sold it to him

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.205 align:start size:81% position:19%
said it was really strong,
and he was like, "Really?"

00:07:53.205 --> 00:07:55.307 align:end position:100%
And the guy said,
"This joint is named

00:07:55.307 --> 00:07:57.510 align:end position:100%
The Joint that Will Kick You
in the Face."

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.810
[laughter]

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.346 align:start size:63% position:38%
And here's the deal.

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:03.182 align:end position:100%
If you're a stoner,
and I know most of you are,

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:06.752 align:end position:100%
when somebody warns you
about the potency of weed,

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:11.089
it's just like, "Who the hell
are you talking to, man?"

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:13.192
- How dare you?
- Yeah, how dare you?

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:14.760 align:end position:100%
Like, if they give you, like,
a cookie, like,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.329 align:end position:100%
"Only take half of this,"
it's like, "Fuck you.

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:19.998
"Now I'm taking three of them.

00:08:19.998 --> 00:08:21.901
How dare you say you know me?"

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.368
[laughter]

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:25.937
- Those are fightin' words.
- Yeah, exactly.

00:08:25.937 --> 00:08:27.873 align:end position:100%
So we smoke this joint,
and then we're like,

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:29.342 size:88% position:56%
"Let's start walking," and--

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.543
- That's when we broke up.
- Yeah.

00:08:31.543 --> 00:08:33.879 align:end position:100%
Well, me, okay, I was in
the front of this, like, line.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:36.181 align:end position:100%
It was me and, like, Erik--no,
not Erik Marino,

00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:38.050 align:end position:100%
Dan Madonia,
and this guy Ryan Mirvis,

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.885 align:end position:100%
and we all start walking,
and you just held back

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:41.186 size:88% position:56%
with the rest of the people.

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:43.622 align:start position:0%
- Well, my buddy Marino
started throwing up,

00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
'cause the joint literally
kicked him in his face, and...

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.227 align:start size:66% position:34%
- But it was a good--

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:50.396 align:start position:0%
- The guy that bought the joint
that initially laughed

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:53.031 align:start position:0%
in the face of the guy
that sold it to him

00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:55.033 align:start position:0%
was throwing up,
because he coughed too hard.

00:08:55.033 --> 00:08:57.269 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, but it was
a mushroom throw-up.

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:59.638 align:end position:100%
That's a good throw-up.
It's not like a normal throw-up.

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:01.039 size:88% position:56%
Mushroom throw-up is like...

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:02.641 align:start size:63% position:38%
[coughs and retches]

00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.577 align:start size:31% position:69%
[laughing]

00:09:05.577 --> 00:09:07.546 align:start size:72% position:28%
[retching and laughing]

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:10.616 align:start size:75% position:25%
So many shades of brown.

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.317 align:start position:0%
- The laughter
between the heaves.

00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:14.153 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, so we start--
we were gone,

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:15.921 align:end position:100%
and we didn't even know
they weren't even behind us.

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:17.156 align:start size:66% position:34%
We never looked back.

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.758 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, I went back
to get Marino some water

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:23.329 align:start position:0%
and help him out, and that's
when the cop showed up.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:26.231 align:start position:0%
You've seen the flashlight
in the dark.

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:28.300
You know that's only one thing.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.070 align:start position:0%
Like...
[imitates siren chirping]

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
The po-po here.

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:34.906 align:end position:100%
- What did you say, by the way,
when the cop showed up?

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:36.575
What did you say?

00:09:36.575 --> 00:09:38.477
- Oh, that's the beautiful thing
about mushrooms is that, like,

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:40.079 size:81% position:41%
it takes away your filter.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.681 align:start position:0%
Like,
you're the most animalistic you

00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.283 align:start position:0%
you would ever be.

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:45.951 align:start position:0%
So when he shined the light
at me

00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:50.122 align:start position:0%
right in front of his face,
I was like, "Uh-oh."

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:52.591 align:end position:100%
- That's the last thing you want
to say to a cop,

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.460 align:start size:66% position:34%
is the words "uh-oh."

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.463 align:end position:100%
No matter what you're doing,
if any cop shows up,

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:00.199
you're like,
"Oh, fuck, a cop,"

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:01.500
just don't say that.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.303
- "Oh, no. You got me, Officer."
- "Uh-oh."

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:06.371 align:end position:100%
Like, "Oh, I'm gonna
search you now," like...

00:10:06.371 --> 00:10:08.641 align:start position:0%
- That's probably why he asked
if I was on drugs...

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:11.310
- Yeah, when you go, "Uh-oh."
- Now that I look back on it.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.011 align:end position:100%
- This guy was a dick,
though.

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:14.379 align:end position:100%
That's what Marino
and all of them said.

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:15.781 align:start size:59% position:41%
That guy was, like,
not fucking around.

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:17.115 align:start position:0%
- He was a dick.

00:10:17.115 --> 00:10:18.684 align:start position:0%
He threw the whole, "You know,
there's a jail

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:20.185 align:start position:0%
"about 20 miles away,
and I don't mind driving there.

00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:21.787 align:start position:0%
Do you guys want
to drive there?"

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:24.990 align:start position:0%
And I was like,
"Well, no," like--

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.291 align:end position:100%
- Why are you in charge
right now?

00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:27.726 align:end position:100%
Why are you the guy
talking to him?

00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:30.396 size:88% position:44%
- Normally, I would never be
the guy to talk to the cops,

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:33.065 align:start position:0%
but, you know,
Willie's freaking out

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.699 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out
what time it is.

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:35.901 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Yeah.

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.336 align:end position:100%
He was still like,
"Hello, Officer.

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:39.471 align:end position:100%
What are you doing here
at 1:17?"

00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:42.308
[laughter]

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.677 align:end position:100%
And Mat's like,
"Willie, not now. Not now."

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:46.011
The cop was like...

00:10:46.011 --> 00:10:49.848 align:start position:0%
- "This isn't part of the trip,
Willie."

00:10:49.848 --> 00:10:51.683 align:start size:78% position:22%
- Yeah, Marino's barfing.

00:10:51.683 --> 00:10:53.485 align:end position:100%
Becca's all huddled up
in the corner.

00:10:53.485 --> 00:10:55.521
- Yeah, I was just the guy.
- Luke is still passed out.

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:57.423 align:start position:0%
- And at the time,
I had a lot to lose,

00:10:57.423 --> 00:11:01.427 align:start position:0%
because back then, my dad
was running for State Assembly.

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:02.828
[laughter]

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:05.697 align:start position:0%
So I just didn't want to fuck up
the whole campaign.

00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:07.733 align:end position:100%
- By the way, I love how you say
you have a lot to lose

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:10.236 align:end position:100%
because your dad is running
for State Assembly.

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:11.770 align:start position:0%
- I'd never be able
to go back home.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.672 align:end position:100%
- He's the one running;
you're gonna fuck it up,

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:15.741 align:end position:100%
but you have the--
it's so selfish.

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:17.676
[laughter]

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:18.944 align:start position:0%
- Well...

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:20.379 align:start size:63% position:38%
- "I'd be grounded."

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.747 align:end position:100%
He would fucking lose
his whole career.

00:11:22.747 --> 00:11:24.717 align:end position:100%
"I could've gotten grounded,
you guys."

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:26.885 align:start position:0%
- That would--that would ruin
everything for me.

00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:28.520 align:start size:31% position:69%
- [laughs]

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.690 align:start position:0%
- So I had no choice but to stay
in the pocket, you know?

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.092 size:84% position:42%
Like, I had to stay focused
on what the cop was saying.

00:11:34.092 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
"Yes, no," you know.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.295 align:start position:0%
He's like,
"How old are you guys?"

00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:38.764 align:start position:0%
Like, "Well, I'm 26.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.065 align:start position:0%
"Willie just turned 26.

00:11:40.065 --> 00:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
Becca's 23."

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.368 align:start position:0%
And he goes,
"How old's that guy?"

00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:45.270 align:start position:0%
Pointed to the guy--
Marino throwing up.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.406 align:start position:0%
I was like,
"He's 40.

00:11:48.406 --> 00:11:50.976 align:start position:0%
"What a loser,
right, Officer?

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:53.612 align:start position:0%
Like, come on, Marino,
there's a cop here."

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:55.080 align:end position:100%
- He knew it too.
He was like...

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.381 align:start size:72% position:28%
[retching and laughing]

00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:00.485 align:end position:100%
Sorry...
[retching and laughing]

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:02.287 align:start position:0%
- So he's like,
"There's no drugs here?"

00:12:02.287 --> 00:12:04.489
And I was like, "Nope," and he
was like, "Well, what's that?"

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:06.825 align:start position:0%
And he shines his light
on our picnic table,

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:10.396 align:start position:0%
and one of Ari's grinders--
I don't know if you've seen it--

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:12.831 align:start position:0%
it has, like, Ari's
psychedelic Jew face on it.

00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:14.567 align:end position:100%
- Yeah, it's like grinders
for merch,

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.902 align:end position:100%
and it's got my face with, like,
a third eye on it...

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:19.771 align:start position:0%
- A yarmulke made of mushrooms,
like,

00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:23.442 align:start position:0%
pretty much screams we're
taking drugs with this thing.

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:24.943 align:start position:0%
He said, "What's that?

00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:26.144 align:start position:0%
And I was like,
"It's a grinder."

00:12:26.144 --> 00:12:27.446 align:start position:0%
He was like,
"What's it for?

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.181 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking
the lesser here.

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:31.950
I mean, I know that that's what
we use to grind the 'shrooms in,

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.252 align:start position:0%
but usually, we use it for weed,
so if I just say "weed,"

00:12:34.252 --> 00:12:35.955 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be,
you know--

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.489 align:end position:100%
- It's California.
That's allowed. It's allowed.

00:12:37.489 --> 00:12:38.990 align:start position:0%
- It's California,
so I just let him have it.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.326 align:start position:0%
I was like,
"It's for marijuana."

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.860 align:start position:0%
And he's like,
"Do you have your license?"

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.829 align:start position:0%
I was like, "Yep,"
and he's like, "All right."

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:46.131 size:88% position:56%
- He threatened to take them
to jail if they didn't have

00:12:46.131 --> 00:12:47.265 align:start size:81% position:19%
their fucking pot license.

00:12:47.265 --> 00:12:48.600
- Yeah.
- What a dick.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.469 align:start position:0%
- Which is so--
anybody could get their license.

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:51.970 align:start size:66% position:34%
- Yeah, it's so easy.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.972 align:end position:100%
Everybody's got
their pot card here, right?

00:12:53.972 --> 00:12:55.374
[audience members cheer]
both: Yeah.

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:56.808 align:end position:100%
- You go to a doctor,
anything.

00:12:56.808 --> 00:12:58.043 align:start size:72% position:28%
They don't give a fuck.

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.878 align:end position:100%
You can be like,
"I had a cough once."

00:12:59.878 --> 00:13:01.480
[laughter]

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.616 align:start position:0%
- I told a doctor
that I have anxiety,

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:09.821 align:start position:0%
and he's like, "Well,
here's some more anxiety.

00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:14.192 align:start position:0%
"Use this anxiety to drown out
the other anxiety, and..."

00:13:14.192 --> 00:13:15.861
- It's the best system.
- It's simple.

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.329 align:start size:50% position:50%
- It's the best.

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:18.897 align:end position:100%
I remember the first time
I bought legal weed

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:21.233 align:end position:100%
from that place Zen
on Santa Monica and La Cienega,

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:24.169 align:end position:100%
and I bought it, and I had a bag
of weed in my hand.

00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:25.670 align:end position:100%
I was out there meeting
my friend,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.405 align:end position:100%
and then I went
to the dispensary and had it,

00:13:27.405 --> 00:13:29.308 align:end position:100%
and I was like,
"Wow, I just bought legal weed."

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.009 align:end position:100%
But then right then,
a cop pulled up with a light,

00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:32.878
and I was like, "Oh, shit,"
but then I was like, "No wait.

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:35.013 align:end position:100%
"This is legal; what I'm doing
is legal in California.

00:13:35.013 --> 00:13:36.314 align:start size:78% position:22%
I've done nothing wrong."

00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:37.382 align:end position:100%
And then I started walking
towards him,

00:13:37.382 --> 00:13:38.684
and I looked in my other hand,

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:40.352 align:end position:100%
and that was just a bag
of mushrooms,

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:41.820 align:end position:100%
and I was like, "Oh, fuck.
What am I doing here?"

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.522 align:start position:0%
- "There's no medical mushrooms,
son."

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:45.390 align:end position:100%
- No, there's no
medical mushrooms.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
- So he was like,
"Well, open the grinder."

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.394
And I just know...
- Fuck.

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:49.694 size:84% position:42%
- I'm looking at everybody.

00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:51.563 align:start position:0%
This is where we get busted,
guys; here we go.

00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:54.700 align:start position:0%
So I do everything I can to
stall reaching for the grinder

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.401 align:start position:0%
hoping that maybe he'll get
a call, like,

00:13:56.401 --> 00:13:58.003 align:start position:0%
"There's shots fired.
You got to go."

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.772
And then you'd be like, "Oh!"
Like, "Oh, sorry, Officer.

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:01.573 align:start position:0%
I couldn't get the grinder open
for you."

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:03.442 size:88% position:56%
- By the way, at this point,
as tense as it was for him,

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:05.276 align:end position:100%
me and the other two guys
that had walked away,

00:14:05.276 --> 00:14:06.845
we were having a wonderful time.

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:08.213 align:start position:0%
- Yeah.

00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:09.548 align:end position:100%
- It could not have been
more fun.

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.016 align:end position:100%
We saw a deer.
We saw a skunk.

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:12.551 align:start size:69% position:31%
That was a lot of fun.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:15.253 size:84% position:58%
Walked around in the woods,
really enjoyed ourselves.

00:14:15.253 --> 00:14:16.622
We even actually saw those cops.

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:18.790
As they came through the woods
the first time,

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.226 align:end position:100%
they were like, Mirvis' dog,
he was like, "Is it on a leash?

00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:22.728 align:end position:100%
He goes, "Of course it is,
Officer."

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:24.429 align:end position:100%
And we're like,
"What are you guys doing here?"

00:14:24.429 --> 00:14:25.864 align:end position:100%
They're like, "Oh, some people
making noise."

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.766 align:end position:100%
We're like, "Well,
you better shut them up,

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.868 align:end position:100%
"because it's all about
tranquility out here,

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:31.303 align:start size:75% position:25%
so fuck those assholes."

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:32.805 align:start position:0%
- "Make sure to check their
grinders, Officer."

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.606 align:end position:100%
- We didn't know
they were going to you.

00:14:34.606 --> 00:14:35.741 align:start position:0%
- I got a feeling.

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:36.975 align:end position:100%
- We didn't know
they were going to you guys.

00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:38.277 align:start position:0%
- All right.

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.711 align:start position:0%
So I do everything I can
to stall it.

00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
I would, like, make small talk
with the cop, like,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.248 size:88% position:44%
"So how long you been a cop?

00:14:43.248 --> 00:14:44.316 align:start position:0%
You know, I've always wanted
to be a cop."

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:47.619 align:start position:0%
When I--
when I was in high school,

00:14:47.619 --> 00:14:49.420 align:start position:0%
and I'd get in trouble
by the cops,

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.590 align:start position:0%
and they'd sit me on the curb,
I would always--

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.426 align:start position:0%
my go-to move was talk about how
I wanted to be cop

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:56.461 align:start position:0%
when I grew up,
and it would make them be like,

00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:58.063
"Yeah, you're just a dumb kid.

00:14:58.063 --> 00:14:59.598 align:start position:0%
Get out of here."

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:01.399 size:88% position:44%
It's worked a million times,

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:04.002 align:start position:0%
and I thought it would work
at 26.

00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:07.339 align:start position:0%
He's just like,
"Just open the fucking grinder."

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:10.175 align:start position:0%
So I open it
as slowly as possible,

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:11.676 align:start position:0%
and he shines his light
right in it,

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:16.147 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing there,
completely empty.

00:15:16.147 --> 00:15:19.851 align:start position:0%
Dan had grinded them up
so well...

00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:22.788
[laughter and applause]

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:26.492 size:84% position:42%
That it turned into powder,

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:28.427 align:start position:0%
and he just tap, tap, tap,
tap, tap.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.195 align:end position:100%
- No, no, that's actually not
what happened.

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.630 align:start size:69% position:31%
I talked to Dan later.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.031 align:start size:66% position:34%
That's not it at all.

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:34.766 align:end position:100%
He's such a fucking junkie
for mushrooms

00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:37.035 align:end position:100%
that he poured orange juice
into the grinder

00:15:37.035 --> 00:15:38.704 size:88% position:56%
and then fucking sucked out,

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:42.307 size:84% position:58%
so he'd get every last drop
of the powder for himself,

00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:43.876
so he could trip a lot harder.

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:46.277
- Took a shot of 'shrooms.
- Yeah.

00:15:46.277 --> 00:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
- So finally, the cop's like,
"All right, everybody go to bed.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.150 align:start position:0%
Too loud.
Time to go to bed."

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.485
And we're like, "You got it."
I mean, we're off the hook.

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.953 align:start position:0%
"Yeah, we'll go to bed.
Fine, Officer."

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:56.655 align:start position:0%
So we start walking in,
he walks by the tent,

00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:58.056 align:start position:0%
and he shines his light on,
and he's like, "Wait.

00:15:58.056 --> 00:15:59.324 align:start position:0%
Hold on a second."

00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:00.792 align:start position:0%
I'm like, "Oh, no.
What now?"

00:16:00.792 --> 00:16:02.894 align:start position:0%
And he leans over
to his partner, and he goes,

00:16:02.894 --> 00:16:05.130 align:start position:0%
"Nice tent."

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.633 align:start position:0%
"Right?"

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.534 align:end position:100%
- We nailed it, you guys.
Mat Edgar, everybody.

00:16:09.534 --> 00:16:13.872
Keep it going for Matty Edgar.

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start size:50% position:50%
Good job, buddy.
