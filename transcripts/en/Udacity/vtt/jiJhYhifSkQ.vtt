00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.130
&gt;&gt; So, if we think about the equation that

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.450
we were doing before, which was you know, the sum

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.290
of all these gammas times some R max. We

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.550
can basically take out the R max and what we

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.640
end up with is something that looks like that,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.650
right? You're summing together a bunch of gammas and then

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.220
multiplying the result by R max. So what does that

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.450
acutally look like? Well that looks like this. Gamma to

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.520
the zero, plus gamma to the one, plus gamma squared, plus dot dot

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.610
dot dot. Eventually multiplied by R max.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.200
Right? So let's call this x, okay?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.720
&gt;&gt; Does x include the R max or not?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.919
&gt;&gt; No. So we'll just call the little sequence of,

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:50.604
it's going to turn out not to matter. Let's just call

00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:53.460
the sequence of gammas we're adding together, let's just call that x.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.710
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.210
&gt;&gt; Well, if you look at it, this is actually recursive. Right? Because this

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.490
is an infinite sequence, if you sort of shifted it one over in time, you

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.980
would end up with just the repeated sequence again. All right? Which means that

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.460
we can write x in terms of itself. x equals gamma zero plus gamma times X.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.270
&gt;&gt; I

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.720
see, so it's shifted over, but then you have to multiply

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.320
it again by gamma, to get up to gamma one, gamma two.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.470
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly. So, so, this is just,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.408
you know, it's just math, that's just all

00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:30.560
it is. so, we can try to solve for x and figure out what x is, right?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.140
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.390
&gt;&gt; So, what is x? Well, we can subtract from both sides and so

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.410
we end up with like, something like x minus gamma x equals gamma 0. Right?

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.350
&gt;&gt; Seems

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.230
like we can stop writing gamma 0. Isn't that just one?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.710
&gt;&gt; Yes, but I've already, I've gone too

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.880
far, Michael. I've alrea, I've already written gamma 0.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.360
&gt;&gt; Alright. [LAUGH]

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.606
&gt;&gt; so, this becomes x times 1 minus gamma equals gamma 0, or as Michael so

00:01:55.606 --> 00:02:01.720
astutely points out, 1. [LAUGH]. Alright. Which means what? It means that.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.100
&gt;&gt; So then we divide by 1 minus gamma.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.242
&gt;&gt; a is 1 over 1 minus gamma.

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:07.058
&gt;&gt; Neat.

00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:07.540
&gt;&gt; And that,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.820
of course, we are going to multiply by R max.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.060
&gt;&gt; To get the formula that we had. That's, yeah, that's nifty.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go. So, why do we do this? Well, because you like

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.910
stuff like this and it points out something

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.180
very simple, which is that geometry is easy.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.620
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't think that's the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.460
kind of geometry that people usually think of.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.350
&gt;&gt; Well, they should be thinking of this kind of geometry.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.200
So geometry is easy. And by doing a little cute algebra,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.850
we can derive ridiculous equations that turn out to help

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.380
us deal with go an infinite distance in finite time.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.520
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.300
I don't think that's what they're doing, but okay.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.360
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, let's think of this as warmup for what I actually wanted to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.430
show you, which is going to turn out to be a whole lot of math. Okay?

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.400
&gt;&gt; Alright, let's, let's go for it.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.070
&gt;&gt; Alright, let's do that.
