00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
check it out this is crazy my silver

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.950
play button is melting hey guys welcome

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.330
back now in this video I thought it'd be

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.220
fun to focus on the YouTube silver play

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.900
button if you start a channel in YouTube

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.210
and gain 100,000 subscribers YouTube

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.370
will send me one of these it's a silver

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.750
play button award to celebrate your

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.029
dedication and your success but the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.350
funny thing is they're not really made

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.090
of silver and over the years they've

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.830
gone through a number of size shape and

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.109
style changes as well so for this video

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.640
I thought it might be fun to try casting

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.740
a metal play button of our own only this

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.300
one will have some very quirky

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.880
characteristic this here is the play

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.410
button that I just created now it is a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.550
little bit frosty because it's been

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.690
sitting in the fridge overnight and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.950
you'll understand why in just a minute

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.010
but it is pure and solid metal we flip

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.149
it over and look at the back you can see

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.980
that shiny metallic surface and if I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.620
drop it on the counter and here makes

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.510
the clinking noise expect solid metal to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.520
make but here's the interesting thing if

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.660
you strike up a flame on a barbecue

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.949
tighter and hold it just under the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.539
corner of the play button watch what

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.470
happen

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.150
you can see that within a matter of

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.820
seconds the tip of our play button

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.370
starts melting off how crazy is that

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.370
look at that nothing often forming a

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.720
little puddle of molten metal in the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.790
bottom of our dish which is crazy right

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.500
isn't it supposed to take an insane

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.450
amount of heat to melt solid metal not

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.430
just the flame from a BBQ tonight er but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.290
despite that fact our play button is

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.940
melting look it's coating the inner

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.150
surface with liquid metal we just ran

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.440
around that track now and it's leaving

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.040
behind a residue that's really cool oops

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.300
it just flushed right all over my

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.729
countertop look at that it's already

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.650
hard and we're if we get like peel that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.979
off with a spoon that's crazy shiny so

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.810
update guys we just use a small flame

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.880
from a BBQ igniter to actually melt the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.100
tip off of our play button but this next

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.960
experiment is even cooler I just want to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.520
filled up a glass with warm water and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.500
now if we stir our play button into it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.050
look what happens to the metal now in

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.600
just a second you're going to see the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.820
metal melts off the surface and drips

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.940
down to the bottom

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.090
moulton shiny silver metal liquefied by

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.610
water that is pretty cool just like an

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.350
ice cube would dissolve in hot water our

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.050
metal play button is doing the same you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.460
have melted off quite a bit of this

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.560
metal here parts of it are still liquid

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.850
and dripping off the surface and just

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.990
when I wonder if I could break it in

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.140
town

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.629
surprisingly it is still very very solid

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.659
metal excite it melting off in my hand

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.730
as we go there let's talk for a second

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.200
about what we've been noticing here this

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.700
solid play button once they got in

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.829
contact with a flame was melt and little

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.150
beads of metal would start dripping off

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.950
now they dripped off into this dish and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.090
some of it splattered onto the counter

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.200
and you can see if we take something

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.879
like a spoon and just nudge at it the

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.739
metal has completely solidified and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.540
turns into a type of foil almost like

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.959
tin foil you hear that it's screaming

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.239
like when I put into it except screaming

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.299
but if we swirl it into a glass of hot

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.010
water you can see the metal melt off and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.720
collects at the bottom forming a molten

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.120
pool with shiny metallic metal and yet

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.189
this really is molten metal but here's

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.659
the curious thing about it it's not

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.480
actually hot enough to burn you now if

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.980
you haven't figured out by now the metal

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.239
that I used to create this play button

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.519
is gallium it's number 31 on the

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.139
periodic table of elements and it's got

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.730
one of the lowest melting points of all

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.220
the metals gallium is in group 13 of the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.599
periodic table of elements because it

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.799
shares a lot of similar characteristics

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.229
to metals like aluminum and indium but

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:31.760
unlike those metals the melting point of

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.319
gallium is so low that you can actually

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.109
melt it with your body heat it's

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.280
relatively safe to handle because

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.560
gallium is considered non-toxic however

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.299
it is extremely corrosive to other

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.340
metals like aluminum and steel now

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.900
interestingly enough gallium is not

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.729
found anywhere on earth in its natural

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.010
elemental state by itself the stuff that

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.750
we have here is a byproduct of mining

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.459
other metals like aluminum and zinc and

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.620
it's extremely expensive the play button

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.049
I created here today costs me about $300

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.209
quite heavy and look at this clip great

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.479
cracks in my fingers right onto the

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.370
counter because the counter is cold you

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.959
can see the bottom of this mass there's

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.370
already two loads fine it's already

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.799
getting quite hard oh it's do a little

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.680
bit liquid at top that's crazy it looks

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.909
like it's solid that some parts are

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.840
still liquidy

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.750
whoa half solid half liquid that's got a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.580
really unique weight through it I mean

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.350
it feels pretty heavy but it's extremely

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.870
running at the same time if I jiggle it

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.190
back and forth I can actually feel the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.870
waves of motion swelling through it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.370
because they kind of come to a hard stop

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.960
if they bounced up against one wall and

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.080
bounced back very cool OOP and extremely

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.330
runny oh boy yeah do you maybe way that

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.930
peels off

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.419
oh good its place trade-off now I got my

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.889
gallium on Amazon it's very expensive

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.119
but i'll put a link down the description

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:16.009
in case you want to get some yourself it

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.719
comes in a container like this and when

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:18.919
you open it up it looks like a solid

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.509
chunk of oxidized metal because that's

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.159
basically what it is but to melt the

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.929
stuff downstairs easy is grabbing some

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:25.279
hot water and throwing it in their first

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.779
few minutes or just using a propane

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.459
torch and gently licking the sides and

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:29.959
getting to melt off that way the cool

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.129
thing about gallium is you can use it

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:32.839
over and over and over again you can

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.069
cast metal objects that are still

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.419
extremely hard but then with a little

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.919
hot water you can easily melt them down

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.419
and liquify them and catch something

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.279
else that's interesting about this if

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.360
you look down there right now you can

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.089
see it's kind of a dull gray also

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.529
happens if I heat it up and stirred up a

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.929
bit

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.490
it's so weird it's like the surface of

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.990
the metal just stops but you can still

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.520
see the motion swirling around there so

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.270
now it's so interesting 24 crazy well

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.980
just wipe this flag like we normally do

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.650
it's ready to pour now making my gallium

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.970
play button was just about as simple as

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.350
you might sing all I did was take a

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.420
little propane tortura map gas torch and

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.340
I melted down the chunk of gallium into

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.930
its liquid state then I took one of

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.670
these silicon play button molds that I

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.320
made a while ago and filled it up and

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.610
let it sit in the fridge overnight I

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.530
also found that the warmer you get the

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.140
gallium the shinier the metal get that's

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.180
pretty much it that right there is how

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.860
you make the world's first metal play

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.380
button it will melt in your hands let's

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.490
summarize what we just learned here

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.560
today gallium is a metal with a melting

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.600
point so low you can melt it in glass of

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.460
hot water you can also recast that

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.780
meddling to nearly any shape you want

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.550
and it still has the look and hardness

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.590
of other metals like aluminum it's very

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.940
expensive because it doesn't naturally

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.770
occur on earth it's the byproduct of

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.110
mining metals like aluminum and zinc and

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.690
you can find on ebay well guys thanks

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.100
