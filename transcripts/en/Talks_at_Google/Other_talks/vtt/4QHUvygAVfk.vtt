Maya: Today our guest is Kelly McGonigal.
She is an expert in body/mind relationship

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:14.019
and psychology of yoga.
So, she's teaching yoga and psychology -- meditation

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.180
 -- at Stanford.
And today, she's here with us to talk about

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.380
how to use yoga for pain relief.
So, let's welcome Kelly.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.380
[applause]

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.140
Kelly McGonigal: Thanks, Maya. Thanks, Cliff.
As Maya mentioned, I'm a health psychologist

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.629
and a yoga teacher, and I work a lot with
people who have chronic pain issues.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.219
But not a lot of people know about my own
experience with chronic pain.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.620
And one of the most interesting things that
has come about from writing this book is that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.510
 -- [video skips] -- I do have chronic pain
and that I have a headache just about every

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.739
day of my life from the last 20 years.
And the people in my life seem very kind of

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.460
perplexed by this.
They say things like, "But it doesn't seem

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:08.810
to be impacting your life." -- [video skips]
 -- and it doesn't seem to limit my life.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:19.240
-- [video skips] -- Students come up to me
and test me in class like, [in a whisper]

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.250
"Are you in pain right now?"
And if I say, "Yes," like, [whispering] "You

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.840
have a headache right now?
Wow!"

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.060
Because, of course, we have this idea that
pain comes with suffering.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.310
And in my experience -- through yoga and meditation
 -- it's possible to have pain not completely

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.170
go away, but to feel like you have your life
back again.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.200
And sometimes, the pain does go away, even
if you never knew what was causing the pain

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
and nothing else seemed to work.
And this is kind of part of the mystery of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.840
chronic pain -- that sometimes it doesn't
go away and life gets better anyway, and sometimes

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.350
it does go away through things that you never
thought might be the solution to healing your

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.280
pain.
And so, I'm here today to talk to you about

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.310
how yoga can be this kind of miracle worker,
creating unexpected healing where nothing

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.349
else seems to work for pain.
Because most people who come to yoga for pain

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:21.380
relief have tried everything else; they've
tried surgeries, shots, medications, acupuncture,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.599
massage, maybe a $600 office chair -- you
name it.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.860
'Cause when we think about heavy-hitting medical
interventions, we don't tend to think of yoga

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.500
as being sort of the first place to go.
You know -- yoga, all that stretching, ohming,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.129
lying around and breathing -- maybe that'll
take the edge off the pain if you chase it

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.190
with a Percocet, but it really, like how is
that going to help?

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.830
And, you know, sort of joking aside, there's
a growing body of scientific evidence that

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.600
yoga can provide profound relief for many
different types of chronic pain -- whether

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.340
it's chronic back pain, joint pain, autoimmune
disorders, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.341
headaches, IBS, you name it -- if it's a chronic
pain, there's probably a study showing that

00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.500
yoga helps and that yoga helps better than
traditional medical care.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.230
And you may not have one of these particular
chronic pain conditions, but we all have chronic

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.180
stress, and we all have this sort of chronic,
ordinary suffering of being a human being

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.569
in a world that's sometimes difficult and
in a body that sometimes does not seem to

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.299
cooperate.
And yoga helps with all of that too.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.440
So, I hope that you'll hear something today
that is useful, whether or not you have chronic

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.099
pain.
So, what I want to do today is talk a little

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.159
bit about yoga -- give you some of the latest
insights from mind/body science that's changed

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.220
the way medicine thinks about chronic pain
and gives us a sense of why yoga might be

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.450
so helpful for chronic pain as well as some
of the coolest findings on yoga therapy for

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.860
pain.
And then, we'll take some questions and do

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.439
a little practice.
So, for those of you who would like to stay,

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.909
we'll do a practice that incorporates some
of the most gentle yoga meditation techniques.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.390
You don't need yoga clothes.
You don't need a yoga mat, which is good,

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.579
because it doesn't look like anyone brought
one.

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.940
So, if you'd like to stay for that, you already
have everything that you need.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.030
So, one thing I want to just start off with
is that, when I say "yoga," I'm not talking

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.150
about sort of, you know, "power yoga" or just
the movement component.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.220
I'm talking about five different sets of practices
from the yoga tradition.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.750
There's the movement -- the exercise component
 -- but there's also breathing and meditation

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.350
and relaxation and what I call "befriending
the body" or the practices of self-care and

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.680
of making friends and making peace with your
body even if you have illness or injury.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.400
And, definitely not talking about circus yoga.
So, you don't need to be able to stand on

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.860
your head or put your leg behind your head
or anything else that would qualify you to

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.389
be on a yoga magazine cover.
This is really basic stuff, and there's always

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.620
a place to start.
If you can breathe, you can do yoga.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.830
If you have a body, you can do yoga.
And one of the things that I try to do in

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.600
the book was provide a true starting place,
even for people who've never done yoga before,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.680
and even for people who have some pretty serious,
physical limitations.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.080
Okay. So, I think I'll start by sharing these
three key ideas that come out of mind/body

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.190
science that's really changed the way people
think about chronic pain.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.490
It may change the way that you think about
your own pain and your own stress.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.720
And the first is the recognition that pain
is a protective and instinctive mind/body

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.410
response.
From Mother Nature's perspective, it's not

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.210
a problem.
Pain is not a problem. It's actually a solution

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.130
 -- a clever solution of evolution -- to make
you care about whether or not your body is

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.030
harmed.
It's a nice little trick to make sure that

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.610
you stay alive and that you're motivated to
keep yourself away from physical danger.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.760
And it starts -- the full mind/body response
starts -- any time there is a threat to your

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.560
body.
It could be someone punching you in the face

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.110
or it could be pulling a muscle from an activity
or touching a hot stove.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.060
And you've got receptors in your skin, your
muscles, your joints, and your organs that

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.639
live for this moment -- that have been waiting
for some kind of threat so that they can do

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.840
their jobs -- send a message up to the brain.
And that's just the beginning of the pain

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.830
process.
So once your pain receptors have identified

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.520
that "not everything is okay in the world"
 -- that there is this threat to your body,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.421
to your safety -- that message gets sent to
the brain, and not just the area to the brain

00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:34.349
that many of us think of as being important
for pain.

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:38.300
So yes, that message is going to be sent to
the sensory areas of the brain so that you

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.130
have a physical sense that you are a little
bit in trouble.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.380
But, it also gets sent to the emotional areas
of the brain that are going to make you "not

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.970
happy" about the fact that you are in pain.
And this is why, when we experience physical

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.979
pain, we start to feel anxious, we start to
feel angry and feel a lot of distress.

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.669
And that signal also gets sent to the areas
of the brain that control your attention and

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:05.830
that monitor for conflict and whether or not
you've met your goals yet.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.789
And so, when the signal gets to these areas
of the brain, it becomes very hard to focus

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.039
on anything else, except for the pain and
the emotions around the pain.

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.020
So now, your mind is going to be highly focused
on solving this problem -- whatever is threatening

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.169
your safety.
And when the mind is focused in this way,

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:28.539
it prompts the body into a physiological stress
response, so that you have the energy to handle

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.830
whatever the threat is.
So we've got a brain that's completely consumed

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.970
now with the process of pain -- your attention,
your emotions, and your sensation -- and the

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.349
body is going to shift into a state of stress
to help you deal with it to solve the problem.

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:45.789
And you can imagine how -- from an evolutionary
perspective -- this is really useful, because

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:49.979
it will allow you to protect yourself.
But, you know, if this is repetitive -- if

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.970
this is chronic -- this is really not a great
way to live.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:58.750
And the last part of the protective pain,
mind/body response is something that most

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.909
of us don't even realize is part of this biological
pain response.

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:07.449
And that's the process of learning from injury
or from pain.

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:13.759
You may have noticed the last time you experienced
a lot of pain, it was kind of sticky in your

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.620
mind.
You kept thinking about it or maybe you wanted

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.870
to tell the story to somebody else.
And that's a really common response to pain.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.340
The mind -- the brain -- is trying to grapple
with what happened so that it can learn from

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.250
it and avoid that pain in the future.
But it means that we get very stuck on our

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.170
painful experiences, and we may become even
more vigilant for any evidence of threat or

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.610
pain in the body.
And at the level of the nervous system, your

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.850
body and your brain are also trying to adapt
in a way that's going to make it easier to

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.051
respond to the same danger or threat in the
future.

00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:51.191
So, for example, if you've had a back injury,
the nerves of the spine and of the back are

00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:56.500
going to actually get better at listening
to signs of pressure or inflammation or damage

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.550
to the connective tissue or to the muscles.
Literally, those pain receptors are going

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.950
to get better at listening for it.
And they're going to be more eager to send

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:08.020
a signal of pain to your brain so that you
will be able to respond more quickly.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.830
And this way, we have a back now that is sensitized
to pain.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.770
And this learning process happens pretty much
with any injury or with any illness where

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.140
the body is prepared to experience that pain
again.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.140
And you can kind of think of this as being
like backwards from the immune system.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.810
If you get a cold, you're less likely to get
that same cold again.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.940
Or if you have a flu type, you're less likely
to get that again.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.620
But with pain, once you've had a certain type
of pain, you're actually more likely to experience

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.210
it again because of the way that the body
and the brain adapts to a pain experience.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.290
And then, this level of learning from our
pain shows up in one last way, which is that,

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.360
we may try to avoid things that could re-create
this pain.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.620
And for people who've had very painful experience
 -- like an accident or an injury or a serious

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.170
illness -- they may start to limit their lives
so that they're not exposed to as many dangerous

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.720
things.
And this can have a self-perpetuating cycle

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.080
where, the more we fear pain, the less we're
willing to do, and our lives get smaller and

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.580
smaller.
That was my experience for awhile also.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:15.530
Okay, so this first big idea is that -- thanks
to evolution -- we have an instinctive and

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.610
protective mind/body response that helps us
deal with real threat.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:25.280
And even though it can be annoying, it's useful.
But the second key idea to come out of research

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.890
in the last decade is that, chronic pain doesn't
work like acute pain.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.450
It is not useful in the way that an acute
pain process is.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:40.590
Chronic pain is overprotective and learned,
not protective and instinctive.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.610
People who have chronic pain have a body and
a brain that have learned to be oversensitive

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:50.400
to a particular type of pain or a part of
the pain process, because it has learned so

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:56.320
well from whatever the initial injury or illness
or accident or traumatic event was.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.260
And there's a lot of different ways that people
with chronic pain may have learned this sort

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.030
of over-responsiveness.
I mentioned one, which is the sensitization

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.830
of nerves.
That is, once you have an injury and illness,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:13.500
many times, part of the healing process is
making the nervous system more likely to think

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.960
that you are in pain.
And for some people, it goes as far as having

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:24.430
ordinary, safe sensations being strongly interpreted
by the nervous system and by the brain as

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:29.470
being "dangerous, unsafe, and painful."
And a classic example of that is someone who

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:35.700
has back pain or maybe an old shoulder injury
or knee injury where they start to exercise

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.320
again.
And the body interprets the very normal, safe

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.350
 -- even healing -- movements of a gentle
exercise practice as being painful and damaging.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:49.040
And that's a real experience.
The pain is not somehow in your mind.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.740
It's real -- and it is physiological, but
it's no longer realistic.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.440
It has nothing to do with actual harm that's
being created in your body.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.000
And this is a really key insight if you have
chronic pain that it's almost as if the body

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.060
and the brain are lying to you about what
is safe and the state of your body and the

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:16.210
state of your health.
And when the body has learned to be oversensitive

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.880
in this way -- sort of over-learned from the
experience of pain -- it's really important

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.360
to unlearn this process, and that's where
yoga and meditation comes in.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.931
It's a process of re-education.
The last key idea that's come from the pain

00:12:29.931 --> 00:12:36.600
research, which is the one that people tend
to resist the most, because it sounds -- well,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.310
it sounds both kind of discouraging and also
almost -- people have heard for so long that

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:47.140
"your pain is all in your mind" or "your pain
is just psychological," that we can be a little

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:53.810
resistant to hearing that, "When you have
chronic pain, emotional pain is not distinct

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:58.010
from physical pain."
This is not true for all types of pain, but

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.380
for most people with chronic pain, the brain
and the nervous system have stopped distinguishing

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:08.820
between stress, anxiety, depression, grief,
anger, and something going wrong in the body

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.690
that we need to be concerned with.
One of my favorite examples comes from research

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:17.540
showing that, people who have chronic back
pain -- when they get angry -- their back

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.940
muscles tense up, and there's inflammation
in the tissues of the back.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.690
And that only happens for people who have
chronic back pain.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:31.020
It's like the nervous system has associated
so many times anger and stress with that biological

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.770
process, that it's no longer that part of
the body triggering a stress response, but

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:41.071
the stress response or the emotion actually
triggers that reaction in the body.

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:47.130
Kind of in the same way that if you were to
remember a -- don't do this now -- but if

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.760
you were to remember a great sexual moment
in your life, you could trigger some very

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.940
real changes in your body, yes? It is possible.
It turns out that chronic pain works a lot

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.500
like that too.
And there's been some interesting research

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.920
at Stanford showing that, even just the memory
of pain can re-create changes in the body

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:11.990
that are consistent with that pain -- like
muscle tension, like inflammation, like an

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:17.270
increased stress response.
And, in addition, one of the things I didn't

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:21.501
mention is that, the protective pain response
that I described -- the one that is useful

00:14:21.501 --> 00:14:26.790
for us in most situations -- it's the same
for a physical threat as for a social threat.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:33.440
That is, the same areas of the brain are recruited,
including physical sensations of pain.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.840
If you have been punched in the jaw or if
you've been rejected by a loved one, when

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.400
you're feeling lonely, you've got pretty much
the same process going on -- same regions

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.700
of the brain activated -- as when you have
the flu.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.510
And that's one of the reasons why heartbreak
really, really hurts.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.650
We're being rejected or when you're feeling
angry at someone -- it actually hurts.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.690
And you can imagine, from an evolutionary
perspective, why that might be useful too.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:04.140
Because when we think about what threatens
our well-being, being separated from the tribe

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.030
is one of the most dangerous, dangerous things
that could happen for your well-being and

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.910
for your life.
And so, it seems like evolution has kind of

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.290
mapped these two together.
So that when you are in emotional pain or

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:19.030
particularly social pain, you're going to
use the same systems that help protect you

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.430
when there's a physical threat.
Again, this gets very tricky with chronic

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:28.980
pain, because it means that the emotions related
to social relationships -- stress at work,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:35.190
all of that -- it can reinforce the pain.
And, in fact, for people who have chronic

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:40.120
pain, there's evidence that psychological
stress even further sensitizes the nervous

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.980
system to send those threat signals up to
the brain.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.490
So, when you're stressed or when you're angry
or when you're lonely, it's like the whole

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.400
nervous system is listening for more evidence
that something is wrong.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.940
And what all of this means is that, if you
have chronic pain, stress management is number

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.530
one on the agenda for healing pain.
And even though it sounds kind of "woo woo"

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:08.251
or fuzzy, handling stress and emotions tends
to be a lot more effective for chronic pain

00:16:08.251 --> 00:16:13.710
than trying to find one thing in the body
that's wrong and fixing it with surgery or

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.870
medications.
Because with chronic pain, that one thing

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.610
that's wrong in the body,
that was resolved or healed probably a long

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.280
time ago, and what you're left with is this
kind of residual learning that is systemic.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.660
It's in the whole body, including the embodied
mind -- the nervous system, the brain.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:37.160
It's no longer just in your back muscle or
just in your knee or just in your jaw or wherever

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:45.070
the pain originated.
So, I think that might be fun to share with

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:51.820
you some of the findings.
Some of you know that I'm a yoga researcher,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.510
and I think it's really exciting how much
research is being done on yoga these days.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.260
I want to share with you some of the findings
that might either give you a little more motivation

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.290
to do yoga, or that -- for those of you who
are already yoga enthusiasts -- you might

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.530
be able to marshal some of this evidence against
the people who are resisting yoga who might

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.130
benefit from it.
I've heard that you shouldn't drag people

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:16.800
to yoga, but I think sometimes data can drag
people to yoga, which is useful.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.600
So there have been a number of studies in
the last couple of years showing that yoga

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:27.600
is more effective for chronic back pain than
regular exercise or standard medical care.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.200
And that a very gentle yoga practice done
a couple times a week for about 30 minutes

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.470
a day -- some very gentle moving, breathing,
and relaxation -- actually helps people reduce

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:43.360
their need for pain medications, including
very strong pain medications like opiates.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.080
As well as improving the symptoms -- the psychological
symptoms of chronic pain, like depression

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.990
 -- as well as the physical function and the
physical pain.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:57.990
And other studies have shown that yoga can
really change the way that the nervous system

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.040
responds to stress.
There's a study that just came out looking

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.330
at restorative yoga.
And this is a really easy way into yoga.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.280
Restorative yoga -- you basically lie around
in a bunch of different positions, hugging

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:13.170
pillows and breathing.
And this study showed that people who practiced

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.430
restorative yoga have lower baseline levels
of inflammation.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.120
And this is really key, because inflammation
 -- circulating levels of inflammation in

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.850
your body -- prime you to experience pain.
They sensitize the nerves so you're more likely

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.570
to experience pain and discomfort and swelling
and all of that.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.080
And not only do they have lower baseline levels
of inflammation, but when the researchers

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.460
expose them to a stressful situation, they
have less of an inflammatory response to that

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.490
stress.
So things were good from the get-go.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.370
And when you stress them out, that stress
response doesn't look so unhealthy.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.780
It certainly doesn't look like the kind of
stress response that really reinforces and

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:57.100
makes pain worse.
Another key study that came out recently was

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:02.880
looking at people who have an autoimmune disorder,
which tends to be characterized by high levels

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.750
of stress response in the body -- sympathetic
nervous system activation.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:12.380
And they found that a short yoga program actually
reduced baseline levels of sympathetic nervous

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.120
system activity in a population where that
can be one of the key factors in determining

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.280
whether you have a good day, a bad day, a
good week, a bad week -- whether you can get

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.610
out of bed or not.
And again, there's a really simple practice,

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.840
but one that included a little bit of breathing,
a little bit of relaxation, a little bit of

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.620
movement.
And then, there are all the studies looking

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:40.100
at meditation as a kind of a special form
of yoga -- a special -- this sort of unique

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.450
way to deal with pain, by teaching you how
to choose the focus of your attention and

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:49.530
also how not to panic when you feel pain or
a distressful emotion.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:53.170
And there have been studies looking at -- you
may think of as kind of "meditation masters"

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.810
 -- people who've been doing it for a long
time.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:01.170
And in these studies, they exposed the meditators
to some pretty serious pain, maybe thermal

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:06.490
stimulation, a point where this is not subjective
whether this hurts -- there's some real tissue

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.340
damage happening; this hurts.
And they looked at what happens in the brain

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.320
of the meditator when they're being exposed
to this subjective, painful stimulation.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:22.140
And meditators appear to be able to literally
shut down parts of the pain processing, particularly

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.310
the emotional aspect of pain processing that
makes you feel like there's something really,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.091
really terrible about what's happening in
your body.

00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:35.430
And I started this talk by mentioning that
I have a headache almost every day, and yet,

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.220
I don't really have any suffering.
It's just kind of there.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.600
And I think that's a big part of what's going
on with some of these meditators that you

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.730
can be receiving part of the pain signal,
and yet, it doesn't launch this full, overprotective,

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.360
learned response of the brain freaking out
and the body freaking out and having to solve

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.610
it as a problem.
There's even a study published a couple months

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:04.050
ago that took people who weren't expert meditators,
introduced them to mindfulness meditation

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.340
and a little bit of gentle yoga movement and
relaxation.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.800
And before and after this intervention, they
took pictures -- 3-dimensional pictures -- of

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.710
the brain.
And they were particularly interested in the

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:20.340
areas of the brain that detect threat and
produce the stress response.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:26.750
And they found that, after this 8-week intervention,
the participants actually had decreased neuronal

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:31.611
density in the regions of the brain that interpret
threat and produce a stress response.

00:21:31.611 --> 00:21:34.820
It is in a way like the brain was getting
smaller.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.930
And this is one of the first studies that's
been able to show this, even though there

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:44.340
are lots of studies showing that chronic pain
and chronic stress makes this area of the

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.001
brain bigger and more connected to other areas
of the brain.

00:21:47.001 --> 00:21:51.380
And so, this is the first study showing that
gentle yoga and meditation can reverse that

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:56.230
process and essentially create a brain that's
more resilient to stress and less likely to

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:03.130
produce this overprotective stress response.
There's lots of other studies like this, including

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:08.330
studies that aren't directly connected to
yoga and meditation, but show that shifting

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:14.550
your focus of attention or improving your
mood can have the equivalent effect on pain

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.840
as a dose of morphine.
And this is what yoga practice is all about

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.350
 -- choosing the focus of your attention and
boosting your mood a little bit.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:30.030
I guess the last finding that there's anyone
left unconvinced is, the most recent observation

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:35.280
that meditation and gentle movement like yoga
increases neuroplasticity.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.580
I'd mentioned that chronic pain is a learned
response.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:45.060
And the solution for most people with chronic
pain is not something like surgery, but the

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:50.920
re-education process -- the re-learning.
And meditation and gentle movement increase

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.150
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is
what allows the brain to actually learn new

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.670
habits.
And you can actually take a brain that has

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:04.830
trained itself to over-interpret stress and
pain and become much more resilient and less

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:11.660
reactive.
And I think at this point, it might be useful

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:20.380
to open it up to some questions about yoga
or pain or anything.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:25.840
Now, we're going to -- did you want to use
one of the other microphones for this or this

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.130
one?

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:35.000
Q Thanks. [pause]

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.580
A Hi.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:48.950
Q Hi. So my question is, you were talking
about the body kind of remembering an old

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:55.309
injury and being more susceptible or, you
know, triggering pain more than it would if

00:23:55.309 --> 00:24:01.150
it didn't have that.
Is it site specific, meaning like, if I had

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:09.650
one bad knee injury a long time ago, is my
entire body more sensitive to pain, or is

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.940
it just to that one spot?

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.410
A It's a great question.
Should I repeat it, or is that microphone

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.830
going to pick up?
Great. Yeah -- so, it depends. It's definitely

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:24.600
not all bad news.
Probably the knee will be more likely to experience

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.830
pain and discomfort, and it doesn't necessarily
translate to the whole body.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.500
For some people, it does.
And that happens more at the higher level

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.280
of the nervous system rather than the nerves
down at the joint or any scar tissue around

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.410
the joint.
And so, it could be possible for a site-specific

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:49.150
injury to translate into a more general sensitivity
to pain.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:54.510
It's not usually how it works.
Most of us will have a more specific vulnerability,

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:58.690
like back pain or knee pain or like with myself
with headaches.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.570
But there are folks for whom it becomes systemic.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:07.750
Q Hello?

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.841
A Hi.

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:20.101
Q Hi, Kelly. Question from -- oh. [Pause]
Hey, question from Crittendon -- "I have a

00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:25.130
friend -- or three or four actually -- who
I think should hear this talk.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:31.730
Do you have any public events where you'll
be giving a similar talk scheduled in the

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.150
area in the future?
Or is there a place where I can learn about

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.000
those if they should come up?"

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.970
A Yes, where is this question coming from?
I don't even know where to look.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.010
Should I look in the camera?

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:47.630
Q [laughing] You can just look at the camera.
I can see you. Sorry -- that's a little spooky.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.340
A That's a very kind question.
I like those softball questions.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.650
I hear that this talk will be available on
YouTube.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.850
I do have some public events coming up.
You can see my website for that.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:03.770
I have some talks at local libraries, JCC
Center.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.680
That's at KellyMcGonigal.com.
And I teach a class at Stanford through Continuing

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.970
Studies called "The Science of Meditation:
The Science of a Calmed Mind."

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.591
That's all about how these practices, including
yoga, change the brain, change the body.

00:26:17.591 --> 00:26:24.020
And so, for people who need that kind of academic,
scientific nudge to adopt this practice, that

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.182
class is a really good entryway, because there
are enormous piles of data in that class.

00:26:28.182 --> 00:26:29.182
Q Thank you.

00:26:29.182 --> 00:26:31.540
A You're welcome.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.630
Q So, I'm reading this really interesting
book.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.790
It's by John Sarno, called "The MindBody Prescription."

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.060
A Yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:45.180
Q You probably read it already.
So, for those of you who don't know, his whole

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.570
theory is that your pain is blocking some
deep emotional feeling, and it's like a distraction

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:53.320
from that feeling.
I was wondering what you thought of his thesis?

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:59.990
A You know, so -- I'm not familiar with his
work very personally, but I actually had a

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.950
student who claims to have been completely
cured through one of his lectures.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:10.360
John Sarno's idea -- this idea that most people's
chronic pain is a symptom of some sort of

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.750
distressed emotion and that just knowing that
your pain is not something wrong with your

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.220
body, but that it's related to emotions and
stress.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.880
His idea is that -- just knowing that -- cures
the pain.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.960
Kind of an education process of just kind
of cognitive insight.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.610
And once you have that "aha" moment, the whole
pain changes.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:33.290
So, anecdotally, I know one person who says
that that's true.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:37.440
As someone who's very interested in the mechanisms,
I like to know a little bit more.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.020
But in terms of what might be happening in
the brain, why an emotion that you either

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.200
experience or are trying to avoid might trigger
a pain response.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.720
I think that the -- I think the science is
not inconsistent with the hypothesis that

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.059
emotions can trigger chronic pain.
But I think that most of the evidence suggests

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:03.300
that there was a physical start as well.
So it's not going to be completely random.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:09.880
Like, you never had a back injury or any issues
around the back, but suddenly, anger is going

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.130
to create back pain.
I think it's useful to think about all of

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:18.330
us as having physical vulnerabilities that
chronic stress and emotions will latch on

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.970
to.
But I like his idea that dealing with the

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:28.760
emotions is a good place to start.
Yes. Oh, oh sorry.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:35.920
Did we -- where is this mic going?

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:44.120
Q You talk about different -- I guess -- modalities.
I'm not sure quite what the word is -- things

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:52.500
that you do to get this -- breathing, the
movement, the meditation, all this.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:29:00.280
Can you break that down a little bit, I guess?
I mean, like if I had only a few minutes to

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.850
do one, which one should I do?

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:06.410
A It depends. It's a great question.
When I mentioned "five modalities" -- you

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:10.890
got to breathe, you got to meditate, relax,
exercise, take care of yourself -- that can

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.900
sound like a 3-hour project, which nobody
has time for.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.179
And so, the question of "What do you do if
you only have one minute?"

00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:22.690
I think it's different for different people.
And when I work with students one-on-one,

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:27.420
it's kind of an exploration process to figure
out what's going to be the one yoga ritual

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.640
that most makes you feel safe in your body
and in your mind.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.559
I think that's the -- sort of the starting
question point, because chronic pain is the

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:38.720
experience of the body and brain not feeling
safe.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.100
And so, for some people it may be relaxation.
For some people, there may be a specific movement

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.020
or stretch that makes their body feel really
good and cared for.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.920
For some people, mindfulness meditation works
really well.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:57.429
Just sitting down, being with the breath.
And it could be other things as well.

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:02.860
So, in the book, I lay out lots of options.
And I encourage people to go to what they

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.780
feel drawn to.
And as soon as you hear about it or read it

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:11.130
and you think, "Well, that sounds kind of
appealing, not painful, not difficult -- might

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.481
improve something about my state of mind or
body."

00:30:13.481 --> 00:30:16.150
And when you find something that works, to
stick with it.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:21.640
So I mentioned that a lot of the studies that
look at yoga for pain relief use all of these

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.170
modalities.
And I'm not suggesting that you have to do

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.050
all of them in order to feel the relief, but
I think in the group setting -- in a clinical

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:33.360
setting -- you need to offer all of them,
because people will respond to different techniques

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.880
and different practices.
But you yourself may find that it's sitting

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.280
in meditation for a few minutes or that it's
a joint mobilization sequence.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.751
So I can't tell you exactly what to start
with.

00:30:45.751 --> 00:30:49.010
But I would say to start with where you're
naturally drawn.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:59.690
Q Hi. So you talk about this secondary pain
response where the injured part is not necessarily

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:06.059
being damaged anymore but our brain is kind
of tricking us by sending the pain signal.

00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:07.059
A Mm-hmm.

00:31:07.059 --> 00:31:12.480
Q And so, my question is, how do you recognize
that that's the case, that that's happening,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.591
because it seems like -- to the brain it seems
like the same kind of pain.

00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:20.049
A Yeah, it's real.
And, of course, pain only happens in the brain.

00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:23.670
I mean, one of the things I want to be really
clear about is that this pain in the brain

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.020
is real.
There's no other type of pain.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.500
And it doesn't matter whether it was generated
by someone punching you or something you can

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.000
observe that's wrong with the body or whether
it started in the brain.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.340
It's just as real and just as painful.
You know, the way that most people start to

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:44.620
realize that it's not about something that's
objectively wrong in the body anymore is by

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:49.679
going through every test under the book and
trying surgery and finding that that doesn't

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:53.610
work.
I mean, it's almost a trial and error, because

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.250
many times, when people are in pain, there
is a physical problem.

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:59.610
It could be cancer; it could be a joint issue
that could be repaired.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:05.559
And chronic pain is different than most of
those situations, because chronic pain is

00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:12.160
persistent and usually unexplainable.
And it's only -- you know, the mechanisms

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.010
that I'm describing by which pain becomes
chronic -- it's not like doctors have good

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.110
ways of diagnosing that.
A lot of that comes from animal research where,

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.560
you know, they can really look at what's going
on in the nervous system.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.480
And so, there's not a great way for your doctor
to look at you and say, "Hey, that pain is

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.610
starting in your brain."
Although, there are some researchers who are

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:39.929
using real-time brain imaging to help show
patients how their pain is being created in

00:32:39.929 --> 00:32:42.809
the brain.
But that's not yet a clinical technique, so

00:32:42.809 --> 00:32:47.659
that wouldn't be useful for you.
But I would say that, if you have been exploring

00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:52.030
 -- through standard physical care -- the
source of your pain, and nobody can find anything

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:57.200
 -- and that's what happens for a lot of people
 -- that's when exploring these other aspects

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.940
like yoga and meditation may end up holding
the key.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:09.490
Q And so, when you recognize that that's the
case, what do you then do, because if your

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.200
injured part is not hurting anymore per se.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.400
A Yeah. Yeah.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.900
Q The response probably should be different.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:20.670
A Right. And you start by retraining the response.
So, for example, breathing is a technique

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.910
that changes the physiology of the body and
the brain pretty quickly.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:28.120
You can breathe in a way that's going to shut
down the stress response, lower inflammation.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:33.299
You can breathe in a way that's going to calm
down the emotional centers of the brain.

00:33:33.299 --> 00:33:37.180
And that's the essential training process
of yoga and meditation is, you work with the

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:42.299
response and you practice a new response.
And you don't work with -- necessarily -- the

00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:46.090
area of the body that feels like it's in pain.
Most people, when they hear that I wrote a

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.890
book about yoga for pain relief, they're like,
"Where's the chapter on neck pain?

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.860
Where are the neck stretches for neck pain?
Where are the back stretches for back pain?"

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:58.220
And that does not work with chronic pain,
because you can't fix a nervous system problem

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:04.330
by just stretching out that part of the body.
And so, personally, I think that's good news,

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.980
because it means, even if you don't know what's
causing your pain, you can start with the

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:14.740
same basic practices of relaxation, simple
breath focus, and mindful movement of whatever

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:20.580
part of your body can move without pain.
So I don't know if that's of any use.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.669
Q Yes, thank you.

00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:29.260
Q You know, yoga is a science, and it's got
many different branches.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.560
So I've been thinking of getting into yoga
and meditation for quite some time.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.960
And every time I kind of gotten to looking
at what I should be doing, I come up with

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:45.481
various forms of yoga, like Kundalini and
Hatha and Astina and power yoga and then there

00:34:45.481 --> 00:34:49.670
are different forms of meditation.
And you know like Kundalini yoga says that,

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.359
if you have back problem, you should not be
doing this.

00:34:52.359 --> 00:34:58.050
So, you know, how do you really get started
just as a basic person without getting to

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:03.200
know that, you know, if I meditate.
Because somewhere I read that it takes you

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.430
years before you can even reach to that one
second of meditative state where you do not

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.960
have 500 thoughts crossing your mind in a
second.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:17.119
So, it's kind of, you know, demotivating as
well why you want to do it but then you just

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:20.260
get confused by all that information that's
out there.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.791
So, how do you just get started without -- you
know?

00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:28.080
A Yeah. I can actually give a very specific
answer to that, and then, I'll give a more

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.940
general response.
I actually almost always send people first

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.420
to mindfulness-based stress reduction programs.
Some of you may have taken that.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.670
It's an 8-week course where you learn how
to focus on your breath.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.600
You learn the relaxation technique.
You learn very gentle yoga movements that

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:48.810
are safe for most people.
And you learn some of the ideas of yoga philosophy

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:55.580
and how they relate to everyday life.
And even though it tends to be considered

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.210
a meditation training, because it involves
movement and breathing and relaxation and

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.560
yoga philosophy, it's like the perfect introduction
to yoga.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.441
And I know they offer NBSR all over the Bay
Area -- I think, probably even offer it here.

00:36:08.441 --> 00:36:09.441
Does Google have --?

00:36:09.441 --> 00:36:10.570
Q They're starting next week.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.119
A It's starting next week?

00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:13.119
Q Yep. Yep.

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:15.060
A There -- I think so.
I actually think that's going to be a really

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.950
great introduction.
And they will, I think, quickly disabuse you

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:22.420
of the notion that it's going to take millions
of years to achieve meditation.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:27.109
You know, with meditation, you don't even
need to empty the mind or clear your thoughts.

00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:33.119
You can just -- you can have one moment of
breath focus in a 10-minute meditation, and

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:38.470
that in itself can be healing.
So, you can get benefit much sooner than it

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:43.520
takes to become a monk.
And the other thing that I'll say is that,

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:49.520
one of the most encouraging things about the
research on yoga for pain is that they're

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:56.099
almost always looking at people who had no
yoga or meditation experience and saw these

00:36:56.099 --> 00:37:00.320
 -- not just statistically significant, but
clinically significant -- improvements in

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.580
8 weeks.
These aren't very long interventions.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.200
And so, you know, I think that there's hope.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.510
Q Thanks.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:12.450
Q Just adding to this discussion that was
happening.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:18.810
I am a yoga teacher, and I've had an experience
of teaching yoga back in India, practicing

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:25.350
yoga there and practicing yoga here.
And I have found a very big difference in

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.369
the U.S. -- the way you always talk about
yoga and meditation together.

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:33.340
In the U.S., there is this whole big thing
of looking at yoga as another form of exercise.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.859
It's like, you know, power yoga -- and I think
some of the injuries are created here, because

00:37:37.859 --> 00:37:43.380
there is so much of emphasis on totally the
physical part -- looking it as just like another

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.750
form of exercise.
And the way to enter yoga is to understand

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.660
it holistically -- body, mind, breath.
Like the way you said, the meditation part

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.030
is not to be neglected.
The philosophy is not to be neglected.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:58.180
And only then, yoga provides this healing
process, the whole.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:03.300
It's innate in it, you know?
But I feel that it's kind of neglected here.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.040
But the perspective in India is totally different
from it.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.859
A Yeah, and that's really the traditional
perspective.

00:38:09.859 --> 00:38:14.560
And thank God most of the studies are actually
looking at the traditional yoga rather than

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:20.600
super fit "yoga butt" yoga.
And that's not where I would send someone

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.410
initially.
Although physical exercise is really, really

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:32.000
important, but sometimes yoga classes that
are presenting yoga as a hard-core workout

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.109
really lose the elements of relaxation and
breathing that make it so healing for chronic

00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:39.470
pain.
So, exercise is important, but I definitely

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:44.640
would not start with any form of yoga that
was advertising itself primarily as a workout.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:55.650
You would miss a lot and possibly hurt yourself.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:00.960
Q Can you comment on the connection between
yoga and diet?

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:07.090
A Yoga and diet -- yes.
Well, in the yoga tradition, what you eat

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:12.540
is considered both a reflection of your willingness
to care for your own body and an expression

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.650
of your values.
So, you know, within the yoga tradition, it's

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:21.690
common to eat the kind of diet that Michael
Pollan might approve of -- mostly plants and

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.780
real food and not a whole lot of it or whatever
his -- what are his rules?

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.660
Says, you know, mostly -- eat mostly plants
and fruits and vegetables.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:33.869
Don't eat too much.
I think that that's the essential yoga diet.

00:39:33.869 --> 00:39:41.160
And there's some good evidence that eating
a mostly plant-based diet, possibly a vegetarian

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.850
diet, changes the way that the body responds
to stress, improving things like heart rate

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.730
variability and inflammation.
That could be really important for chronic

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:54.090
pain and chronic stress.
Now, I'm personally a vegan.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.001
So I always feel like I'm proselytizing a
little bit when I say that.

00:39:57.001 --> 00:40:02.660
So, let me just say that, you can go much
more broad than that and not worry about the

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.970
traditional diet and just think of -- starting
to pay attention to how "what you eat" influences

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:12.109
your energy, how it influences your mood,
how it even influences your pain.

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:16.180
Because many people will find that they have
triggers -- food triggers -- for being in

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.490
a bad mood.
Not what you eat when you are in a bad mood,

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.349
but food that actually puts you in a worse
mood -- makes you feel worse about yourself,

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:25.920
it makes your body feel sluggish and tired.
And so, yeah, you know -- without any sort

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.310
of moral judgments about what you might eat,
there's this basic practice of starting to

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:35.849
pay attention to how food influences you and
a willingness to take care of yourself by

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:38.310
eating what makes you feel healthier and stronger.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:50.260
Q How about yoga and other form of exercises,
you know?

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:54.710
If I practice yoga, is there other form of
exercise that are more compatible or they

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:59.130
are not compatible?
Any concern about that?

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:03.420
A Yeah. So, the question is, "Are there other
forms of exercise that are more or less compatible

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.510
with yoga?"
And, I think, the way that I would express

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:15.980
it is that, once you learn how to move skillfully
and honor your body in yoga, it's going to

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.599
improve your experience in any other form
of exercise -- whether it's weight lifting

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:25.109
or swimming or dancing.
And so, I would say more that, learning how

00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:31.890
to listen to your body through yoga, to not
push yourself beyond what seems like a reasonable

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:37.820
limit, to listen to the signals of your body
about fatigue and stretch and pain, and a

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.240
kind of willingness to stay in the process
mentally.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:45.700
All of that is going to make other forms of
exercise not just more fun, but a lot safer.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.720
So if you learn how to do those things in
yoga, you're going to be much less likely

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:54.109
to hurt yourself if you go to an aerobics
class or play a sport.

00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:58.040
And I have a number of students who are athletes
who kind of use their yoga practice in that

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.830
way as a kind of baseline so that when they
go out and do other things, they're less likely

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.200
to hurt themselves.
In terms of the physical benefits, yoga is

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.480
not cardiovascular.
So if you are thinking about your health,

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:14.410
the only way to get a really strong cardiovascular
workout from yoga is to do it wrong.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:18.070
To, you know -- to not breathe in a slow and
sustained way.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:21.310
Because, even if you're doing things that
are a little bit physically difficult, if

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:26.060
you're breathing in the yoga way, you're not
going to get your heart rate that high.

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:31.710
There's plenty of studies showing that.
So, it's nice to balance yoga with other forms

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:38.880
of exercise that are appropriate for your
body that would take care of that other stuff.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.340
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, I think that wraps up
our questions.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.960
So, thank you very much.
It was an outstanding talk.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.960
Thank you.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.430
A Thanks.

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.670
[Applause]

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:54.860
&gt;&gt; Kelly: So, I see we have about 15 minutes
left.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:01.010
Do you want to do a little bit of a practice?
Yes?

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:05.119
I'd thought that we would do some movement,
some breathing, some relaxation, and meditation.

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:10.880
It's kind of an unusual spot to lie down on
the ground and meditate.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.290
So, let's start with movement and that may
be -- movement and breathing -- and that may

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:21.800
be as far as we get.
I'm going to -- [pause] Yeah, so I'll use

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.840
this mic.
And we're going to start in a chair -- how

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.260
convenient.
But I want you to have a little more space

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:36.080
for yourself.
So, these chairs move. You can move your chair.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.050
Maybe come -- those of you who are sandwiched
in a row, there's a lot of room up front,

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:42.290
a lot of chairs up front -- you could come
up here.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:47.910
This is going to be interesting to demonstrate
and hold this at the same time.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.880
Oh, that's right. That's what the stand is
for. [pause]

00:43:52.880 --> 00:44:14.440
I feel like I'm on "American Idol." [pause]
Is that going to be about the right, no -- is

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:21.850
that about the right sound volume?
Okay, so we're going to be efficient with

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:28.360
this and move and breathe at the same time.
You were probably already breathing, but you

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.951
might not have noticed.
So we're going to breathe with some intention

00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:35.741
here.
And some of the key ideas about yoga movement

00:44:35.741 --> 00:44:41.330
and breathing is, first of all, it should
feel better -- not worse -- than if you were

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:46.400
not doing it.
So, as soon as something feels obviously worse

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:51.099
than before you started, come out of it.
There may be a way to come back into it with

00:44:51.099 --> 00:44:54.700
a little bit less strain.
You know, sort of relax a little bit in it.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.920
Or it may be that this is not the movement
or stretch for you in this moment and be willing

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.720
to honor that.
The other key principle is that, we join the

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.349
movement and the breath.
So if we're doing a movement with the breath,

00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:10.870
let the breath guide the movement, rather
than for example, if we were -- we're going

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:14.330
to take a movement where we move the spine
with the breath.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:19.890
This would be the movement of the inhale;
this would be the movement of the exhale.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:27.060
You wouldn't want to move and then breathe
and then move and then remember to breathe.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.359
There's really no difference between the movement
of the body and the movement of the breath.

00:45:30.359 --> 00:45:33.700
So just work with those ideas.
It shouldn't be worse than if you weren't

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.010
doing it, and we're going to link the movement
to the body and the breath.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:39.020
So let's start perched a little bit forward
on the chair.

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:42.950
If you're way slid back, come forward.
Let your feet be flat on the ground.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:47.880
Anyone who wants to take their shoes off,
you're welcome to do that.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.390
Legs comfortably apart.
And take a moment to lift your shoulders up

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:54.290
to your ears.
Some of you already have them there.

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:58.599
And then, drop them down.
And let's do that with an open-mouth exhalation.

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:04.150
Inhale -- lift your shoulders up to your ears.
Exhale -- relax and down.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.760
One more time.
Let the shoulder blades drop even a little

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:13.220
more. [exhaling]
And let them kind of rest in this place with

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:17.460
the hands on the thighs or on the knees.
And, on your inhalation, draw the shoulders

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:23.430
back, lift the chest, look up a little bit.
And, as you exhale, put it in reverse -- draw

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:30.380
your belly in, drop your chin a little bit.
And continue with your breath -- inhale, lift

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:38.240
the chest; exhale, curve the back.
Keep it going at your pace.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.820
And notice how the movement actually helps
extend the breath a little bit if you're patient.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:47.080
When you round the back and pull the belly
in, it helps push the breath out.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:51.310
When you lift the chest and relax the belly,
it creates a little more space for the breath

00:46:51.310 --> 00:47:07.099
if you're patient.
Take maybe two more breaths in this way. [breathing]

00:47:07.099 --> 00:47:11.200
And then, finish with the spine feeling pretty
neutral here.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:17.790
Bring one hand to the belly -- maybe both
hands to the belly -- and either close your

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:22.940
eyes or just drop your gaze a little bit.
And now, connect to the sensation of the belly

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.860
moving when you breathe.
If you're patient and your pants aren't too

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:34.210
tight, you will probably find that your belly
expands when you breathe in and it draws in

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:38.720
when you breathe out.
And let's take a few more breaths, resting

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:46.540
the mind in the sensation of what expands
 -- feeling the sensation of expansion as

00:47:46.540 --> 00:48:00.920
you "breathe in" and the sensation of that
expansion dissolving as you "breathe out."

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.630
And then, open your eyes.
So with that, we did movement, breathing,

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.790
and meditation in just a couple of minutes.
That first movement helped release tension

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:11.030
in the belly and the back.
That helps release tension in the breath.

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:15.140
Next movement is going to help release tension
in the side of the body to also release tension

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.660
in the breath.
So, we're going to take the legs a little

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:22.839
wider apart if you've got the space for that.
And again, kind of scoot forward on your chair.

00:48:22.839 --> 00:48:28.310
Let your left hand rest on your left thigh,
and you might even slide down to your elbow.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:34.599
Notice how just that movement lengthened the
right side of your body.

00:48:34.599 --> 00:48:39.119
That's already a stretch.
Bonus -- if you like -- inhale, take the right

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:42.720
arm up.
Notice that's a deeper stretch.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.750
Are we in the zone now of "It still feels
better," or did that make it worse?

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:51.220
If it made it worse, you can lower the arm
down and relax your head in whatever direction

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.961
feels best.
If it feels better to have that right arm

00:48:53.961 --> 00:48:58.580
reaching, do it with some intention.
Reach out through the fingers.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:03.160
Feel the length in the side of your body,
and make a conscious choice to position your

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:07.310
head and neck in a way that feels sustainable.
If you had to be here for a little while,

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:13.859
what would be the position of least tension,
least likely to leave you feeling worse than

00:49:13.859 --> 00:49:17.980
when we started?
And on your next inhale, come all the way

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:23.260
up and exhale -- release the arm down.
Take a simple breath in.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:27.030
And, on your next exhalation, lean onto the
right arm.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:33.940
Notice that subtle stretch, that subtle stretch.
And on an inhale, you can reach the left arm

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:42.560
up, and stay here for a few breaths.
Again, using the reach of the arm to improve

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.420
the sensation of opening.
And you might even have the idea of breathing

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:55.599
into the left side of your rib cage and waist.
If you just plant that idea, you may find

00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:59.720
that, if you inhale deeply, you can increase
the stretch from the inside out.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:05.000
There's a sensation of expanding underneath
the muscles that are stretching.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:11.619
One last breath here.
And, on an inhale, come all the way up.

00:50:11.619 --> 00:50:14.570
Exhale -- release that arm down.
You can walk your legs together.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:17.240
And now, let's bring our hands to the side
of the body.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.060
The ribs -- and whatever way is most comfortable
 -- to find that part of your body.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:27.400
And again, close your eyes or drop your gaze.
So it's easier for the mind to drop into the

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:32.900
breath.
And now, have the idea that, if you're patient,

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:38.550
the breath might expand the body where your
hands are resting.

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:43.550
Invite the possibility of some side-to-side
expansion when you breathe in without trying

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:51.180
to force it.
And let the mind rest in this feeling -- the

00:50:51.180 --> 00:51:00.970
sensation.
As you do so, relaxing the forehead, relaxing

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:09.550
your eyes, relaxing the jaw if there's any
clenching, and then open the eyes.

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:14.900
Relax your arms down.
And then, the next movement or stretch is

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:18.109
going to help release tension in the neck
and the shoulder.

00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:23.660
And you even have muscles in your neck and
in your shoulder that are involved in breathing.

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:28.820
When they're tense, they can turn your breath
into a kind of "up and down," shallow breath.

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:33.400
And by relaxing them, it can allow the natural
movement of the breath in a way that's not

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.080
quite so stressful and inefficient.
So for this -- very simple -- drop your left

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:44.320
ear to your left shoulder.
And notice if you are pulling your ear to

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.310
your shoulder with your neck muscles, that's
too much.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:52.070
We don't need that much tension.
Just drop the head and let gravity hold you

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:56.550
in this posture.
Gravity can help you on the right side -- the

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:59.980
right arm.
By dropping the arm heavy alongside your outer

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:05.560
leg or even hooking on and holding onto the
chair if there's some place easy to do that.

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:10.560
And let the weight of the arm bone be heavy
and the weight of your head heavy.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:16.980
And take another couple of breaths resting
in the sensation along the side of your neck,

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:24.420
the front of the shoulder and chest.
Smiling sometimes improves the sensation of

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:31.010
the stretch, because the muscles here connect
to the side of your face.

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:36.020
And on an inhale, come all the way up.
Before we do the other side, simply place

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:41.520
your left hand on the right side of your chest
underneath the collarbone -- underneath where

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:46.050
you were stretching.
And have the idea that there might be some

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:51.290
expansion of the breath under the hand here.
This is more likely to be a subtle expansion

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.460
of the breath.
And it doesn't involve lifting your shoulders

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:59.510
up to your ears.
If you close your eyes and drop your gaze,

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:04.490
see if there's a kind of massage that's happening
in this area of the easy, subtle expansion

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:14.200
of the lungs as you breathe in, and the release
of that expansion as you breathe out.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:22.230
As if the lungs and the heart's gently expanding
 -- gently swelling with the breath.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:28.430
And open your eyes, relax your arms.
And let's even that off.

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:34.760
Take the second side, dropping your right
ear to your right shoulder.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.560
And again, there's a real difference between
trying to pull the ear and shoulder together

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:43.440
with your neck muscles and shoulder muscles
 -- versus, once you've tilted, let it go.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:48.310
Let gravity drop the weight of the head.
And your left arm can hang down by your side,

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:52.220
or hook into the chair if that feels more
supportive.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:57.170
And you can even experiment here with how
much the chin is "tucked down" versus "lifted

00:53:57.170 --> 00:54:00.000
up."
It's a big difference.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.700
And you can find the position -- the angle
of the chin -- that feels best to you to what's

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:10.070
needed in this moment.
And see, there's a way to enjoy the sensation.

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:16.339
We sometimes interpret stretch as pain, but
this is probably a safe movement for you and

00:54:16.339 --> 00:54:19.869
maybe even a healing movement.
So, see if there's a way to interpret it in

00:54:19.869 --> 00:54:28.339
that way -- enjoy how it feels. [pause]
And on an inhalation, bring the head back

00:54:28.339 --> 00:54:31.640
up to center.
And then, take your right hand, rest it on

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:39.190
the left side of the chest.
And close your eyes, or drop your gaze.

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:44.150
And invite the possibility that this part
of the body will also have a nice rhythmic

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:56.359
expansion and release as you breathe.
This is one of my favorite meditations -- hands-on

00:54:56.359 --> 00:55:02.640
breathing.
It gives the mind something to focus on; helps

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:08.070
relax the body.
Go ahead and open your eyes if they're closed.

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:10.609
And let's take one last stretch.
This will be for the front of the chest.

00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:14.609
You can bring your hands to the back of your
chair.

00:55:14.609 --> 00:55:21.180
And, you know, depending on your shoulders
and how tight your jacket is, reaching on

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:25.060
top of the chair might feel better or reaching
along the side of the chair might feel better,

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:31.060
and see which is true for you.
And then, just kind of hang the rib cage forward.

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.890
And the head can rest in a neutral position.
And you're not looking for the world's biggest

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:38.310
stretch here.
This is a shape change -- the spine is moving

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:43.290
into the body -- the chest is being opened
as the arms are pulled back, and whether you're

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:47.750
feeling a lot or whether you're feeling a
very subtle stretch, you can kind of trust

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:48.750
this process.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:56:04.470
And see if you can feel the expansion of the
breath and your rib cage and chest.

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:09.940
And then, relax back to center.
And rest your hands over your heart, underneath

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:15.079
the collarbones.
And again, you can drop your gaze or close

00:56:15.079 --> 00:56:19.109
your eyes.
And invite the possibility that this area

00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:35.910
of the body will also expand gently when you
breathe in and sink as you breathe out. [pause]

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:43.290
And each time this area sinks -- each time
the heart sinks -- imagine any last bit of

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:48.730
stress or tension exiting the body.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:59.160
And then, go ahead and open your eyes. Okay.
So, that was a little meditation, breathing,

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:03.570
movement all at once -- something you can
do at your office without people giving you

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:09.410
funny looks, like when I used to try doing
strange yoga poses in my office.

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:11.000
Unless you have a private office, and then,
anything goes.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.090
Do they have private offices here?
See -- I don't know anything about Google.

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:21.070
Well, thank you very much for coming.
I think we are definitely out of time.

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.550
If anyone -- a couple of people had asked
me to sign books.

00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:27.000
I'm more than happy to write a dedication
to you if you'd like.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.180
And if you have any other one-on-one questions
you didn't want to ask for all of YouTube,

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:38.109
I'm here for that too.
We will turn off the camera and the mics.

00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:39.549
[Applause]
