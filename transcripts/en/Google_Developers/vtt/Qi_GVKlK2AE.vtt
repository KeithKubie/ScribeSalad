00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:06.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.207
So now we're in the
Android Wear area.

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:09.790
And we're going to
take a look at some

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.100
of the newest watches
with the design lead

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.810
from Android Wear, Bret.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.470
Hi, Brett.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.060
How you doing?

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.851
BRETT: Hi, Timothy.

00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:16.744
Doing great.

00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:18.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So, I was
talking to David Singleton

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.552
earlier today.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.760
And he said, you have to
check out the new TAG watch.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.810
Can you show it to me?

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.920
BRETT: Yeah.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.590
Yeah, I can.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.090
So, here it is.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.730
And you can also see that
it's available in, you know,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.200
this diamond studded
edition, as well.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.970
And one of the things that's
really nice about the TAG

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.190
Connected is that it's modular.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.960
And that's actually in the name.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.140
And so, not only can
you swap bands, but

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.350
you can also swap out the tabs
on the device, in addition to

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.915
the bands.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.790
So you could have like
a metal bracelet band,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.930
a leather band, a sport
band, as well as you

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.100
can change these
accents out as well.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.700
So, they can be-- you can go for
same tone, or contrasting tone.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.360
And that all snaps
back together.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.210
And when it's together,
it's like rock solid.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.090
So that's one example of
how partners are really

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.750
doing really interesting things
on the hardware side with,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.660
of course TAG, it's got
all its iconic watch faces

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.950
in the software.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.670
And it's all powered by
the Android Wear platform.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.367
Yeah, so that's pretty exciting.

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.950
It was fun to be in Switzerland
for the launch event for this,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.270
too.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.560
They know how to host.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I bet they do.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.010
Tell me one other
thing I want to know

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.640
is, for developers, what's the
new thing that they get to do

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.430
that you're most excited about?

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.620
BRETT: Really, I'm going
to demo a different watch

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.000
at that point.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.730
So the best thing that
developers can do now

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.140
is they can start powering
the complication slots,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.450
or developing watch
bases that show off

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.010
really actionable, in great,
great information for end

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.800
users.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.830
So here, I've got this watch
face that ustwo developed,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.910
and it's got four slots,
in addition to the time.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.580
So, all I have to do
is long press on it.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.870
Just, awesomely, it's
working just like it should.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.020
So I long press on it, and I
can change any of these slots.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.160
So I can make my next meeting.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.990
I can go and do a countdown to
some important upcoming date.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.570
I can show today's date.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.980
I can go and for, let's see,
let's change the layout,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.730
you know, over to
different ones.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.190
I can have more slots.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.930
And now, I can do stuff like
put a fitness goal that I've

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.300
set up, you know,
right on my watch face

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.406
with just a few taps.

00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:51.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Whoa.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.779
Cool.

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.560
BRETT: And so developers
can do two things.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.930
They can either be
the watch face itself.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.600
If you're a
developer, or you feel

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.450
like you've got a really
strong sense of style,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.710
you can develop a watch face.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.440
But you don't necessarily have
to be an expert in, you know,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.910
what data does the user want.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.130
You can just let
the users decide.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.432
You can add these slots
for complications,

00:03:11.432 --> 00:03:13.390
and let data providers,
either from the system,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.210
or from other apps, power them.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.760
And the benefit to users
is that they'll really

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.230
like your watch face.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.570
Or if the users
are already using

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.610
something like
Robinhood for stocks,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.979
or Google Fit for
fitness tracking,

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.020
they can get that data
right on their watch face.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.310
So, we're really
excited about what

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.580
developers are doing there.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.420
And what-- there's still a lot
of possibility left to mine.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.680
Thanks so much, Brett.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.805
BRETT: Sure thing, Timothy.

00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:39.470
