00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:06.419
Viewing pornography is actually nothing new. People have been doing it for hundreds, if not thousands of years

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.349
But it's only today that we're beginning to see pornography being distributed on such a widespread and easily accessible scale.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.000
This is thanks to the internet. With some people claiming that porn takes up a huge percentage of total web content.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.120
Because porns widespread accessibility is so new

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.260
Psychologists are still trying to find out what effect it could have on the human brain

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.469
It's all very new and unexplored territory for researchers but people are already coming to some pretty interesting conclusions

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.000
Here are five psychological facts about porn addiction

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.160
One you can develop a tolerance just like drug addiction. In the context of addiction, tolerance refers to a situation

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.140
Where someone becomes more and more acclimatized to the addictive behavior to the point where they need more and more of whatever it is

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.460
They're addicted to in order to receive the same effects. According to an article published in "The journal Behavioral sciences"

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.600
Porn an addiction may function in a similar way to a drug addiction.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.340
What this translates to is the Attic needing to seek out porn more often

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.520
and viewing more extreme or illicit types of porn to receive the same effect.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.460
Interestingly, a 2016 study published in the journal "Neuroimage" actually examined people's brains with the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.820
FMRI - "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging"

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.080
while they were watching porn. What they found was that while watching porn,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080
there was elevated activity in the ventral striatum.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.820
Which suggests that the brains pleasure centers were releasing dopamine.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.040
There's still a lot of research left to do on this subject and we'd love to hear your thoughts about it!

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.580
Two. Some studies have suggested that porn addiction does not affect sexual health and function

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.189
One of the most repeated facts about porn addiction and porn use in general is that it can negatively impact

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.938
Healthy sexual health and function, but is this really true?

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.799
More recent studies have challenged this and one published in 2015 really stands out published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.809
The researchers studied men in three different countries and came up to the inclusion that porn had no effect on male sex

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.590
disturbances

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.340
they also stayed that linking porn to sexual dysfunction is probably wrong and it's more likely due to stress and other

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.720
Factors, this is only one study, but there are others to back this up as well

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.559
Do you agree with what this study is saying three porn addiction could be fueled by the Coolidge effect

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.319
The Coolidge effect is an interesting phenomenon that could have a substantial role in porn addiction

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.269
Simply put the Coolidge effect is seen when males seem to become more aroused

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.940
Whenever a new female partner is introduced

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.119
It could be caused by male evolutionary programming to fertilize as many females as possible

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.899
how does this affect porn think about it almost endless new females are available to view on the internet and

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.919
Viewing one female after another can actually fuel arousal for prolonged periods due to the Coolidge effect

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.549
This could be one reason as to why porn addiction could occur

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.609
Do you believe the Coolidge effect has anything to do with porn addiction? We'd love to hear your ideas on this one as well

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.750
For porn addictions can impact the way we behave in relationships and intimate situations

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.169
This is probably one of the most important things about porn addiction

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.049
How does it impact our relationships an article published by the American psychology Association?

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.389
Try to tackle this important issue

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.209
They cited various studies that suggested men

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.089
Experienced lower levels of intimacy with their real partners after using porn these studies also

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.500
suggested that porn news and men

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.289
Resulted in lower sexual quality and even depression on the other hand those same studies also touched on some very interesting things

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.560
about women in porn according to these studies women watching porn resulted in increased intimacy and

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.429
Improved sexual quality in the relationships they were engaged in

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.480
Five

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.549
Neuroplasticity and porn will end things with a very interesting concept

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.149
Neuroplasticity this is the ability of a person's praying to change and a refers to increases in gray matter

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.920
Rhe routing of synapses and other interesting changes that can happen in the brain

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.159
These changes can result in different types of behavior in the individual and even different types of emotion

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.770
obviously the younger a person is the more

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.789
Neuroplasticity they have as young people are constantly learning and changing

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.860
But what does this have to do with porn because teen brains have higher degrees of neuroplasticity?

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.709
Some have suggested that their brains are more vulnerable to being rewired by porn

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.119
This could make it harder to resist addictive things in general and form lasting

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.950
Compulsive habits such as viewing porn regularly like many parts of porn addiction

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.379
This is an area which still needs tons of research as these are all very new concepts

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.699
Does this theory make sense to you our teen brains really more vulnerable to porn addiction due to neuroplasticity?

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.450
