1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,460
If you don't find shit to do,
you want to lose your mind,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,920
you would get addicted to that.
I just want to learn shit.

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,380
You would like it because there's so
much to learn. That's the thing about it.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,710
It's a, it's a long, long
never ending, never ending,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,260
never ending journey of shit.
There's also,

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:17,430
there's so many different variations
of each different individual move and

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,320
entries into new moves and defense
and then the structure of it is, it's,

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,090
it gets so crazy. It's, so, it's
super complicated. My son does, uh,

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,050
my son is heavy into boxing and
karate. I got him into those. So he,

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,860
he does them both.
So the reason why I want to do,

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,800
I just like to keep up with him so
we can, you know, do things together.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,040
I have trained as come to the house and
we'll work out together. He loves it.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,830
So I just don't want
to get left behind too.

14
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:48,450
My kids do the kick your
ass when you get 17, 18,

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,910
which you say, Dad, hold on.
Oh boy. I don't want that
boy. You better back up. Yeah.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,810
When he started getting
that much confidence.

17
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:57,570
I just want to be able
to keep up and maintain.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,220
So that's why I like to do it with them.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,970
What's good for a kid to have that
in your head where he's got to defend

20
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:06,390
yourself. Confidence. You
need that for confidence.

21
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:09,870
It'll help you avoid things
too. Well, I tell my kids,

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,050
you know your last name puts a target
on your back that you didn't ask for and

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,450
we don't go and create problems,

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,920
but you should always be prepared
for problems if they were to occur.

25
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,400
And if they do, I just want you
guys to know how to defend yourself.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,280
So the things that I have my kids doing,

27
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:31,580
it's just have the
knowledge and understanding.

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,660
The worst thing is just not knowing.
You know,

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,470
they're growing up completely different
than I grew up where I grew up.

30
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:41,240
You had no choice but to know if you
ain't not a fight that shit ass cause you

31
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:45,030
go gonna get tested. There's no way
around it. You're going to get tried,

32
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,420
you're going to get robbed,
you're going to get your book bag taken.

33
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,270
Somebody will try to take
sneaks like it's the reality.

34
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:54,900
It's not a false reality that's real.
So if you're not prepared for it,

35
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:59,880
if you don't have any type of heart,
you won't. Last. From where I grew up,

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,450
heart was everything.
And heart was sometimes saying,

37
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:07,620
I don't care if I get my ass whooped, I'm
not going to be a bitch. I'm not gonna.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,260
I'm not gonna allow y'all to
think that this can happen.

39
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:14,550
So I'm going to lose today, but tomorrow
I'm a come back and I'm gonna find you.

40
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,350
I'm going to talk.
Whatever that moment was,

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,300
it was about establishing any level of
respect that you could and I respect

42
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,250
eventually turned into
friendship from all.

43
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,270
So my kids don't know what that world
is like. They're never going to have it.

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,830
So as a parent,

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,540
I just have to make sure that you have
all the tools that I can possibly equip

46
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,980
you with because my parents didn't have
the ability to provide me with that.

47
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,240
They weren't in the financial space
to to take me here and had this

48
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,870
extracurricular activity or this
extracurricular activity or learn this,

49
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,380
learn that.
Didn't exist.

50
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,710
That is the big conundrum of successful
bird connection when successful people

51
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,300
have kids. The what made them
successful as dry. I grew up poor too.

52
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,040
We were on welfare and food,
the whole deal when I was

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,550
a little kid and that
always stuck in my head.

54
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,890
This thought like we might
not have enough food.

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,920
Like I remember thinking that when I was
little like what if we don't have any

56
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,460
food? What if we run out of food?
My kids will never feel that.

57
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,780
They don't understand what that is.

58
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,740
And everybody that I've ever met
that's interesting came from some crazy

59
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:21,430
struggle. Yeah. When they were young.
Yeah. And that's the thing of you're,

60
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,600
you and I and most people
that are doing well in life,

61
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,350
you're raising your kids in a completely
different way than literally what

62
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,980
brought you to the dance
and the first list.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,920
The hunger of not being one
of those people that's left
behind is what makes you

64
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,910
successful in the first.
Yeah.

65
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,790
And it's scary. It's scary because,
you know, my wife, my wife told me,

66
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:45,240
she was like, you know, I love
that you're not hard on your kids,

67
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:49,500
but you always make sure there's
a lesson within your conversation.

68
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,720
Like I don't yell.
I yell at my kids.

69
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,950
Nothing's going to register when I'm
yelling. So I try my best to talk to you.

70
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:58,350
Even when I'm at my angers,
I'm a talk to you.

71
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,740
So you can process this because you
need to understand what's the problem.

72
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,210
You need to understand what's wrong
and what I had to really realizes they

73
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:10,890
didn't ask to be born into this.
Yeah. You know what I mean?

74
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:12,740
Like it's not their fault,
right.

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,220
That they're coming up completely
different than how we were raised. Right.

76
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,610
And we can't have anger or frustration
that's dedicated than thrown towards them

77
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,400
because they got it so much
better than what we had.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How do we make sure we pass down a proper
lessons so that they appreciate and

79
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:37,050
understand and not take for
granted, right. They have, for me,

80
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,830
it's tough because could
kiss because students,

81
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,080
they apply themselves to school.
They listen. They don't do dumb shit.

82
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,100
Yeah. They want to play video games
and stay up like any other kid. Yeah.

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,420
There's no signs of a bad or or or crazy.
Yeah.

84
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:59,450
And the fear and panic is that you
gotta noted bad and crazy exists,

85
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,760
right? This fairy tale or
they were in isn't real.

86
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:10,320
And at some point when I'm not around,
when your mother's not around,

87
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,750
when you have friends or other family
on around, you may get tested. What?

88
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:19,410
The other side that's out here
that you never seen, right.

89
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,250
So I got to prepare you for the
shit that you don't know exists.

90
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,280
I got to take you to Philadelphia.
So you can see,

91
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,690
I tried to show my kids where I grew
up thinking it's going to be like a,

92
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,460
Oh my goodness backfired. There's
so cool. Can we live here? Shut up.

93
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,380
[inaudible] he hit a car right
now around you talk about this.

94
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:45,030
When we get back, there's, this does not
go as opposed to, oh my God, so cool.

95
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:47,580
Dad is so different.
Oh my goodness.

96
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:51,360
Walked him around the neighborhood
and it's like, it's, it's,

97
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,430
it's not a reality.
You didn't have grass canister.

98
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,870
Oh, that's great. Did you
play wow when you hear, yeah.

99
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,690
When you hear these things,
it's so different. Men.

100
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,520
These were your steps. The steps
are broken. How did you even play?

101
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,080
Oh my God, Dad. So wait,
where? Where was yours?

102
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,220
We lived on the top floor.
Knocked the whole thing. No, it's,

103
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:23,720
this is three separate units.
So to top floor was me and grand moms.

104
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,823
The middle,

105
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,040
there was somebody else
that was a neighbor and
downstairs with somebody else,

106
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,100
three different people lived
in this one thing together.

107
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:35,090
Y'All are strangers like, Hey, shut up,

108
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,850
ready to get this in my own ads.
It's everybody in the car get a car.

109
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,500
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to say at this part.

110
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,334
Get right in the car.

111
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,460
But when you see that that's the
reality that you get hit with of,

112
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,620
I gotta make sure that I'm talking,

113
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,090
I've got to make sure that I'm
constantly teaching. Yeah. If I'm not,

114
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,570
then I'm not doing my part.
I'm failing. You know,

115
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:00,920
took them to the neighborhood and showed
them how stores are in the neighborhood.

116
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,630
It's where we got candy from.
Here's,

117
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,470
here's what we would get a little
sandwiches from y'all walk.

118
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,300
We don't have no stores like this.
We can't walk the stuff.

119
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,130
It's a completely different world.

120
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,270
It's a completely different world.

121
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,640
See people standing on the street
corners, what they doing? A B,

122
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,990
they selling drugs. That's,
that's tough right there.

123
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,470
Those are people that your dad still
knows. They've been there forever.

124
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,420
That's what you don't want to do,

125
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,840
but they're forced with these decisions
just because of what they have to do.

126
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,150
You just need to see this dad to take you
here to see this drove them all around,

127
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,250
all around North Philadelphia,

128
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,420
all around South Philadelphia
made sure they could see it.

129
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,560
You got to physically see,
we go out the country.

130
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,110
We go to these resorts and islands.
Before we go there,

131
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:52,400
we're going to drive around so you can
see what exists before you get to this.

132
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,040
This is why we have to be good people.

133
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,750
This is why we treat everybody
with respect. This is why
your dad likes to give.

134
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,360
Everybody doesn't have,

135
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,790
I'm constantly beating my kids with
that information because then you assume

136
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,870
that everybody does.

137
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,800
You come off like such an ass hole when
you're around people that don't. Yeah.

138
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,053
Why?
How did you,

139
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,060
you don't also have Anders that they
had grown up the way they are now.

140
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,020
It's such a rare thing and they don't
understand that there's no way there's a

141
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,990
small percentage. Yeah,
a very small percentage.

142
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,360
And that's something that I'd
never want to let go of either.

143
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,260
So I was in the back of my head is all
you're talking about how, you know,

144
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,420
are we going to have enough
food when you were coming up?

145
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,760
Chris rock joke is so great that he used
to tell about how he keeps a bag packed

146
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,870
at the front door cause he don't
believe that this shit is his.

147
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,820
He said,

148
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,950
I truly believe that at any point
somebody's gonna go. Got You.

149
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,220
You thought you lived here,
did this joy. And I was like,

150
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,820
it's so real because
even though you have it,

151
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:04,710
you can't lose the sight of
reality of what once was. Yeah.

152
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,590
Yeah.

153
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,220
Do you,

154
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,090
are you comfortable where you are now
or do you still have those thoughts like

155
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,700
this is this real because you're,

156
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:16,870
you're at the stratosphere
of fame and success. That's,

157
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,400
it's rare amongst the rare, you know,
it's uh, like David Goggins said,

158
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:23,680
you are uncommon amongst uncommon men.

159
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,360
I will be a hundred percent
honest and say I'm comfortable

160
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,110
with the understanding of hard
work brings great rewards.

161
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,230
This is a reminder of the hard work and
dedication that I put into everything

162
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,224
that I've done.

163
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm not content because I know where I
came from and I don't ever want to go

164
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,480
back. That doesn't mean I don't
want to go back to the city.

165
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,150
That doesn't mean I'm going to go back
to the people that made that don't want

166
00:09:58,151 --> 00:10:01,420
to go back to living like I once was.

167
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,620
I'm going to go back and I wanna
help. I wanna inspire them, motivate.

168
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,270
I want to show people that there is a
way out, that there is a way to do more,

169
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:12,010
to get more,
to obtain more.

170
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,450
But I personally don't want to lose
all that I've been able to get.

171
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,600
So I need to make sure that
I do everything to keep
it so I can't be content.

172
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,370
Mm.
So there is an understanding,

173
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,660
but I refuse to click on the switch of,
Huh.

174
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,140
So even if you like,

175
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,560
even if you have more money than you'll
ever spend for the rest of your life,

176
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,510
that's not what it's about.
No.

177
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:46,110
It's about the inspiring people and the
influence and constantly giving back and

178
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:50,290
moving forward in a positive way. And the
only way you can do that as a stay act,

179
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,670
it's the story man.
