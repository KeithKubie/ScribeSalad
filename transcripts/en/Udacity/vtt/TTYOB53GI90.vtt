00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my result.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I construct an omega matrix of size 3 x 3, and initially I set the top left corner to 1.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then the vector xi, I set very first value to init. Everything else is 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now come the important additions for the first move and the second move.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Both times I do exactly what I told you before.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For the two involved variables, I add a +1 on the main diagonal and a -1 off-diagonal.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Same over here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Then I subtract move and add it 1 row later, and the same with move2 and move2 over here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Look very carefully. This is exactly what I told you about.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm going to draw this graphically.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I begin with a matrix like this. I then add this guy and then this guy.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
As far as the vector is concerned, I start with this, add this guy, and finally this guy.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Then these two together are being combined down here

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
where I compute the inverse of omega multiplied with xi.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That gives me the vector of res, and res is being output using those "show" command

00:01:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and returned from the procedure.
