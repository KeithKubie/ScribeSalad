NASH ISLAM: At G&amp;R, we're
rebuilding modernization

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.090
solutions for local content
in the Bangla language.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.070
We work the websites and apps
to publish ads on their Bangla

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.940
content, and we work
with advertisers

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.156
that want to
communicate in Bangla.

00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:20.280
MUHAMMAD NAZIMUDDAULA: G&amp;R
used to provide services

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.180
for our clients, like website
development, Facebook app

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.010
development.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.300
But later we found
that it's actually

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.740
defocusing us from
our main goal.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.400
So we stopped doing
that and started

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.850
focusing on our product.

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:42.210
NASH ISLAM: On the
developer side of things,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.130
we use various APIs--
Charts API, Maps API.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.250
We even use a Spreadsheets API.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.020
We also have built up a lot
of custom Chrome extensions

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.170
for our internal
client service needs.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.260
What's next for G&amp;R
is a lot of growth.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.519
We want to focus
definitely on incentivizing

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.800
more local content in
the Bangla language,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.600
but also in other
languages around the world,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.420
such as Burmese or
Persian or Nepalese

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.690
to help those people
bridge the digital divide.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.257
We also want to be more
of a big data company.

00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:21.840
As we're upgrading
our infrastructure,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.890
we see more room to help bring
other businesses in Bangladesh

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.160
onto that same stack.
