1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,380
[inaudible].

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,400
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,850
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,850
March six,

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,280
2017 what's going on everybody?
I am in Phoenix, Arizona.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,070
I'm isn't that exciting. Scenic Arizona.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,690
Um, it actually is madam psyched.

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,340
I'm working at stand up live doing
two shows tonight, two shows Tuesday,

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,360
two shows Wednesday. Um, um, you know,

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm putting together my new hour and
everything and I got a bunch of shit.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,830
I've actually been listening
to my act. I always, you know,

12
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,680
when I'm putting together a
new hour, oh, I always record.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,390
I just never fucking listen. Well
now I'm finally listening to my act.

14
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:48,330
I figured it out when I can do it cause
I've who the fuck months to sit there

15
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,690
and listen to yourself,
but I'm doing is I'm uh,

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,330
I listened to it on the car ride home.

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:55,910
Yeah.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,190
You know, if I had a decent
set, if I had a shitty set,

19
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,720
what's the fucking point?
You know what I mean?

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,000
It's kind of like if
you're always taping you

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,100
okay

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,310
your team, right. But you only
watch if they win. You know?

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,230
I know people who do
that shit. They like, no,

24
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:10,510
what the fuck happens before
they watch it and if they lose,

25
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:11,860
they just don't even fucking watch.

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,760
So I've actually been watching
and that type of shit. And uh,

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,800
speaking of which you're team winning
and losing all the freckles came in,

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,100
uh, last night and I went to
the Phoenix Suns were playing,

29
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:28,240
my boss did sell decks. So
I decide, you know what,

30
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:30,910
I'm going to go to that game. All right.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,490
My hundred and 17th fucking
franchise professional home team.

32
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:40,330
I've fought ever professional sports team
that I've seen a home game of hundred

33
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:44,290
and fucking 17 of these
motherfuckers. I got 10 more to go.

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,110
I can't get on any 10. Every time I get
to 10. And I'm like, oh, one more team.

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,170
I'll fucking, then I'll have nine
left and somebody moves, you know,

36
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:55,510
I got down to 10. I'm like, all right,

37
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:59,230
the next one's going to get me down
to nine and then the fucking ramp,

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,980
the rams move back up to 11. Right.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,820
So then I go see the thunder and I'm
thinking, all right, look man, I'm down.

40
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,470
I'm down to fucking, I'm
down to nine and I'm like,

41
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:12,304
wait a minute.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,300
Yeah,

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,133
wait a minute.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,530
Okay.

45
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,190
I saw the New Jersey Nets. I never saw
the Brooklyn Nets soda. It's still 10.

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,760
So I'm like, all right, next week,
next week when I go see the sons,

47
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:24,620
I'll be down to 19th left, right?

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,460
So I'm sitting there watching
the sons and I'm like Verizon,

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,740
I'm down to single digits.
The Fan Slam is going down.

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,220
One of the loneliest accomplishments ever.

51
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,180
I guess if you went with
a bunch of other people,

52
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,290
I got to find the old pictures of me
at these stadiums. I swear to God,

53
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,850
they're all like disposable camera
pictures held by a stranger. Um,

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,410
you know,

55
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,260
when I was doing all these fucking
gigs in the middle of nowhere and shit,

56
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,860
and I pass through the major cities
and I would just go to a Goddamn game

57
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,830
anyways. So last night
I'm thinking, all right,

58
00:02:56,831 --> 00:03:01,300
I'm going to the son's Celtics game.
I'll have nine teams left. And I'm like,

59
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,990
wait a minute. The fucking charges
just moved the Los Angeles.

60
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,573
So

61
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,400
in a month I'm working in San Antonio
and I'm going to a spurs game,

62
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,680
go into the fuck and spurs and then
I think I'll finally be down to nine.

63
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,660
You know, God forbid if the
fucking Raiders don't move
to Vegas after that. Um,

64
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,440
but anyways, I uh, I went
to the sun's game, right?

65
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,200
So I show up immediately. Um, the
club hooked us up with tickets,

66
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:36,400
gave us great ticks. We sit in two rows
buying the fucking one, one of the, uh,

67
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,880
what do you call it in basketball?
One of the nets, one of the goals,

68
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,050
one of the backboards,
right? Two, two rows back.

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,930
So it's really three rows back cause
they got all the fucking cameraman,

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,930
you know, but still it's like great seats.

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,580
And I looked down on the right and is
this guy just riding the reps in the,

72
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:57,760
in the first quarter? And
he really gives a shit.

73
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,290
So I'm looking at [inaudible] and
I'm just looking over going, look,

74
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,970
this fucking, this guy's out of his
mind. That is a guy who gives a shit.

75
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:07,850
This is a hardcore season ticket
holder, man. Look how much he,

76
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,170
and I'm laughing like he's just
like, he knows the refs names,

77
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,490
he's calling them out and all that shit
in verge. He starts going, he goes,

78
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,130
I bet that's the owner. I'm like, Nah,

79
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,510
I'm going to own it
wouldn't be sitting down.

80
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,790
He would be yelling like that if he
was the owner. And he's like, well,

81
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:26,140
Mark Cuban writes the reps like that. I
go get the fuck out of here. So finally,

82
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,450
you know, I go, I man, I'm going to
look this guy up, right? So we've,

83
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,970
we look them up and it's the owner.

84
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,380
I gotta to tell you, Phoenix Suns, dude,
you guys got a great fucking owner.

85
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,010
Uh, Robert Sarver is his name, man.

86
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,610
We ended up talking to him at the
end of the game cause I tweeted a,

87
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,170
I was making fun of, um, what's
his face, his shoes, his sneakers,

88
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,000
the fucking worst sneakers
I've ever fucking seen. Um,

89
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,350
Kelly Olynyk, the big white goof,

90
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,670
the seven foot fucking
pylon out there, right?

91
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,290
I don't, I, you know, Celtics love that
guy. Ain't he got so many Goddamn meds.

92
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,420
Maybe it's a road trip
or whatever, but do this.

93
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,010
He had these fucking sneakers on,

94
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,890
I think Garo your premium warm in there.

95
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,150
That fucking Superbowl
against the Redskins.

96
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,000
When he fucked up the field
goal two, they were like,

97
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,600
they look like black football cleats
from the early seventies the ugliest

98
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:29,940
fucking things I've ever seen.
So of course I tweet about that.

99
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,341
That's why I get,

100
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:33,490
so I tweeted about the thing and I guess
the owner's son was watching. He goes,

101
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:35,350
oh, he's probably sitting right
next to you, blah, blah blah.

102
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,870
That's how he didn't mean the guy.
But anyways, long story short,

103
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:42,730
so I tweet about this fucking things,
making fun of the guy's sneakers thinking.

104
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,620
Obviously these have to be the worst
fucking sneakers. Without a doubt.

105
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,280
Even with the Internet, even with Twitter,

106
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,460
even with all of these fucking
cons that are on social media,

107
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,940
nobody can argue with that. These are
the ugliest fucking sneakers ever, right?

108
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,910
They will low top fucking feel.

109
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,970
Go kick a cleats on the
fucking early seventies right.

110
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,040
And all these sneaker
heads are like, you mean,

111
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,190
you mean the Colby eleven's

112
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,920
I guess just the Colby
Bryan sneaker. And what?

113
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,970
Because it says Colby on it. All
of a sudden it's the coal piece.

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Do do you mean the shack fourteens
I fucking hate sneaker heads,

115
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,830
but fucking can't stay at them with
the 5,000 fucking pairs of sneakers,

116
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,480
taking him out of the box, showing them
off on MTV cribs and licking the soul.

117
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,350
So it's like, you see, I never, we, I
never even wore these joints before.

118
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,290
Okay.

119
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,220
Yeah. I can tell from your fucking man
tits she never worn before this sneakers.

120
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,690
Why don't you go take a fucking walk
in them versus a big sneaker head?

121
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,160
I'll tell you,

122
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,090
you know what it is fucking overrated
is so fucking overrated Jordans.

123
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,950
You know what I mean? I'm not saying
they're not good. Look at some of them.

124
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,920
Most of them are fucking
ugly as shit and dude,

125
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,690
the fucking mouth breathing
dope. Maybe that's what it is.

126
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,880
The amount of fuck up. Geez,
I'm walking around now.

127
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm walking through the amount of
fucking dokes that we're Jordans.

128
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,880
You know what it is about Jordans. It's,
you don't even have to fucking think.

129
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:22,910
Okay.

130
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,400
You know what I mean? All you
gotta do is get a pair of Jordans.

131
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,050
You know everybody's gonna like him. Oh,

132
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,940

Jordan six is to look at these sections.

133
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,010

the gold outline. John d, The these,

134
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,980

right? These things are crazy.

135
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,503
Okay?

136
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,563
Yeah. I don't know.

137
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,260
Fucking mouth breathing morons with
the Goddamn sweatpants in the Jordans.

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,670
You know furs? He's a big Jordan
Guy. He loves Jordans. He was,

139

140
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,940
Okay.

00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,780
They're all black.

142
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:01,900
And then they got like this white wall
tire thing done it just because it says

145
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,910
the Jordans Dude. These, these, these
are Jordan. Once. It's like, dude,

146
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,310
I don't give a fuck at the Jordan
night. I'm so sick of the numbers.

147
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,213
Okay.

148
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,780
Do. What's your favorite Jordans?
You like to seven's really?

149
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,160
You like to sevens that you gotta make
sure that that it just says Nike on the

150
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,310
back. If it has him on the back,
then those aren't the real ones.

151
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,763
Okay.

152
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,350
The Kobe 11

153
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,973
okay.

154
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,020
Like what do you guys think
that if you fucking put them on,

155
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,550
you're somehow going to be able to dunk.

156
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,910
You're going to score close to 80 points
in a fucking NBA game cause you're

157
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:51,580
wearing cobis the Sundale three seven.

158
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,090
I don't know. I don't understand

159
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,350

I cannot fucking believe you guys.

161
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,610
You have to go on and you have to look
at a picture of those fucking sneakers.

162
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,590
They like referees sneakers from the
fucking early eighties it's just a black

163
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,220
low top fucking slipper
with the Nike swoosh on it.

164
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:15,630
Yeah.

165
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,630
Do you mean the Kobe 11 do the
Colby eleven's of fucking crazy.

166
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,400
The crazy Tony. You get yourself,

167
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,020

you put on a pair of those dude over.

168
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,010
Oh, you go out to the club people.
People are, are those the sixes?

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,833
Okay.

170
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,100
I, I don't, I just don't understand
fucking basketball sneakers. Okay.

171
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,420
Some of a good look and some
of them aren't just a, they,

172
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,590
they drive me up the
fucking wall. Paul Vars,

173
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,650
he's the funniest fucking human being
I've ever met in my life. Like he's, he's,

174
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:59,840
he's one of these guys, like I love him
to death, but the shit that he likes,

175
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,910
it's so, he likes obvious shit. It'd
be like, dude, do you know what I like?

176
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,190
You know what I like? I like amenities.

177
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,420
Okay.

178
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,670
It's like, really, dude, you like getting
extra shit, extra comforting shit out.

179
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,080
It's amazing. You know? I never really
thought about that. I don't know.

180
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,190
I have to think about
this. Do I like amenities?

181
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,750
You know what? I like Paul. I like a
lack thereof. I'd like less than like,

182
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:30,910
who would ever say that? Dude?
You know what? You know what I do?

183
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:33,130
Is there anything better than pizza?

184
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,220
Is there anything better than
a great slice, a piece of do?

185
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,790
Do you know what I like?
I like a Bologna Sandwich.

186
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,230
Okay.

187
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,230
Do a Bologna sandwich with white American
cheese and mustard due to the mustard,

188
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,750
puts it over the top. It's
crazy. It's a joke. I mean,

189
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,690
it's literally a joke. It just,

190
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,013
I dunno.

191
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,170
Yeah.

192
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,490
So it's like, does it even need to be
said? Of course it's a Bologna Sandwich.

193
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,450
Yeah, it fucking hits the spot.
Well, mainstream Polly, dude.

194
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,550
You know what I like, you know I
like, I like a golden retriever.

195
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,140
Do you know what's crazy?
A white picket fence.

196
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,850
I'm sorry, I gotta get him
back on this podcast cause I w

197
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,360
Hartnett calls him Mr Maxim cause
everything that he likes, it's like, it's,

198
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,340
he likes what everybody likes,

199
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:30,510
but then she's got this simplistic
fucking great philosophy. We'll,

200
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,290
he'll be like, Bill,
but bill, what's wrong?

201
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,760
What's wrong with sweat pants? You
know, and you can't argue with them.

202
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,110
Exactly. There's, there's nothing
wrong with that. It's just, you know,

203
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:46,500
the conversation is just like,
it just doesn't need to be,

204
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,490
most of the conversation just
doesn't even need to be had to,

205
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,770
is there anything better than
just walking around in sweatpants?

206
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:56,741
Dude,

207
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:01,741
you put on a pair of sweatpants
with some Jordan threes over over

208
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,320
to what is better than have it on
a Hoodie and a pair of Colby 11.

209
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,830
You go to a massage parlor and she's
jerking your Dick. I mean [inaudible].

210
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,120
Oh Man. Am I crazy? I said, so
it's, it's short. It's literally,

211
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:25,650
it's a joke. All right.

212
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm sorry. Fuck all you
sneaker heads out there.

213
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,790
God bless you with your
little fucking hobby. Uh,

214
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,080
keeping your sneakers clean and you know,

215
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:38,100
fucking walking on your heels anytime
there's any sort of rubbish on the ground

216
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,480
ground. Fucking men just walking
like a Goddamn duck on their heels.

217
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,710
Hey Buddy, what the fuck
do I got on this seven?

218
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,540
What is it? The first day of school,

219
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,930
Dude, you know what I
love? You know what I love?

220
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,050
Is there anything better than
when it snows on Christmas?

221
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,690
That's the type of shit he says. It's
like, no. Yeah, it is. It's great. Paul.

222
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,820
I think everybody's pretty much in
agreement. I even think Jewish people,

223
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:14,830
like if it snows on Christmas,
you know what I mean?

224
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,650
It probably adds to their
Chinese food. I don't,

225
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,560
where could have fuck doesn't like a fresh
blanket of snow as long as it isn't a

226
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:21,394
God damn storm.

227
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,740
Dude. You know what I, I like amenities.

228
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,050
Is there anything better than
taking a steam? Uh, no. I mean,

229
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,250
you know, that's also, that is a great
thing that everyone is in agreement with.

230
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,760
You don't want to like,
dude, I like fresh air.

231
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,220
Is there anything better than like non
polluted air when you breathe in? I mean,

232
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:52,910
it's crazy. It's a joy.
It's literally, it's a joke.

233
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,590
Um, Jesus, I went on a
fucking tangent there.

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,010
Oh my gosh. I have to second. I
thought the recorder wasn't recording.

235
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,040
I forgot my fucking microphone. So
this might sound a little bit, dude.

236
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,390
Is there anything better?

237
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,100
Did Jess Lan in your bed and just
waking up and doing your podcast?

238
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,040
I mean, it's a joy. It's literally,
it's, it's, it's a joke. You know,

239
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,370
I have to look up these fucking
sneakers. How the Fuck Koby Bryant,

240
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,430
one of the greatest fucking top of
what, two or three players of all time,

241
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:28,320
individual players, teammates.
He was a fucking nightmare. Um,

242
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,450
you went to that fucking
confessional comes up. Um,

243
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,080
let me sit down, put in my password here.

244
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,420
Stupid Laker fans that
we, Chan MVP at the guy.

245
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,990
I hate that Celtic fans are chanting
MVP at Isaiah Thomas. By the way,

246
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,030
it reminds me of Laker
fans that were always,

247
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:48,960
every time fucking Colby stepped on
the court and did not pass the ball and

248
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:51,560
scored 40 fucking points
and they lose again.

249
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,940
And they did have VAPI. Um,

250
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,470
did you see him dunk on that guy
and then they lost? Oh my God,

251
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:01,460
he's unbelievable.

252
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,110
Maybe if we get 58 free agents
in here and fucking Phil Jackson,

253
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:09,890
they can win a title and v p all right.

254
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,930
I'm not what he's doing.

255
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,850
He's wearing the Colby sees
where we're in the Kobe left.

256
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,060
I have to look these fucking sneakers
up. How ugly these goddamn things are.

257
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,790
And the fact that these sprockets,
sneaker heads, you mean the Colbys?

258
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,510
I mean the rep sneakers, those
fucking cleats. This guys wearer,

259
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,910
he looks like fucking Ken
Stabler out there. Colby 11.

260
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,450
You cannot tell me that this fucking, the
computer doesn't listen to you. Oh my,

261
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:40,590
those are fucking dancing slippers.
Jesus. At least to get the best.

262
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,820
He got the best color

263
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:45,620
[inaudible]

264
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,990
they come in pink becoming red and
white. They got a Miami dolphin color.

265
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,160
Do those literally look
like women's sneakers? Like

266
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,030
you should have like the low cut sock
with the little ball on the back if you

267
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,280
wear those fucking things. And I'm
looking, look, look at the ones

268
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,220
220 $130

269
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,773
yes.

270
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,740
I bet this,

271
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,690
I bet if I went on youtube and this and
I looked up koby 11 I bet there's some

272
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:16,690
fucking asshole sitting there
licking the fuck. Who is that guy?

273
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:21,280
Fat Joe did that and his MTV cribs. And
he goes, he had like checked, he's off.

274
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,010
He's like the fucking George 60th.
And then he licked the bottom of them.

275
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,020
It's like, dude, do you
realize the sweatshop?

276
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,700
But those things were fucking Baden. Yeah.

277
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,490
And you think those things
didn't hit the ground in there.

278
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,390
And God knows they probably don't.

279
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,270
Like they probably make those people go
to the bathroom at the fucking station

280
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,300
and you're gonna let the bottom
of those. Goddamn sneakers.

281
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,793
Okay.

282
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,990
They were in a hermetically
sealed sneaker box. Dude.

283
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,710
They were in a cardboard box and was
shipped over here from the other side of

284
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:49,840
the world. I think I'll
put my tongue on them.

285
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,403
Okay.

286
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,330
All right. I'm going to look this up.
I'm going to see if I can find that.

287
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,410
I'm going to find a fucking video here.
Coby 11 all right. I don't know why,

288
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:03,730
but the first video that came up set
exploding pool and a guy had shit on his

289
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,210
face.

290
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:09,210
Now I didn't think they did that type
of stuff on fucking Colby 11 shoes.

291
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,550
Alright. And some asshole's
going to do a fucking review.

292
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,990
Nike Colby 11 Performance Review Too.

293
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:19,720
These are the ugliest fucking
sneakers I've ever seen in my life.

294
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,610
These ones are actually worse.

295
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,083
Okay.

296
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,900
Colby. Bryan gives the Brian
James's autograph shoes.

297
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,680
God, what the fuck did they talk about
other than winning championships?

298
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,300
That'd be like listening to fucking
superman and like fucking Batman talking.

299
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,250
All right. Coby gives away shoes to a
fan. Here's a shit all over the guy.

300
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:45,600
He's like the nicest guy ever.

301
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,940
Colby helps a busload of sick children
get to the staples center by towing it

302
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:54,840
with his own body and his Colby
eleven's or maybe I was wrong.

303
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,610
Um, Nike. Kobe, I gotta get
off this fucking subject.

304
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,070
What am I gonna listen to some guy
do a fucking review of the sneakers.

305
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,250
Nike Colby 11 performance overview. My
initial thoughts. I fucking love Youtube.

306
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,410
Who gives us, I guess you guys
are listening to my thoughts,

307
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:13,500
but I'm just being a fucking
moron. Anyways, let's get
back to the Goddamn game.

308
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,480
All right, so Kelly, a Lennox out
there and is Coby eleven's dude,

309
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,240
they will fucking crazy, dude.

310
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:24,150
You get a seven foot
white guy and Kobe 11.

311
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,880
It's all, it's all,

312
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,590
I mean the black guys are still going
to go right around them and have their

313
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,170
nuts in his face when they
dunk on it, but I mean his,

314
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,800
his feet from the ankles down, it's,
it's always going to be a such a joke.

315
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,010
It's literally a joke. Um, all right.

316
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,100
Anyways, so we go, we watched this game.

317
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,950
The owner of the sons is a fucking riot.

318
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,900
I'm totally this watching him ride
in the referees, like old school guy,

319
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,150
you know, right down there on the court
watching the game and uh, you know,

320
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,730
he's not about some luxury box or
anything like that. Right. So anyway,

321
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:03,810
so we'll watch it in the game
and the Celtics come out flat,

322
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,560
which you knew they were gonna you knew
they were gonna cause they've just beat

323
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:12,270
the Lakers anytime. I'm telling you
this right now, gamblers, gamblers,

324
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,940
anytime the, the, any Boston team, I,

325
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,650
the y would say the
Bruins are the fucking uh,

326
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,490
Celtics going that west coast trip. Okay.

327
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,930
If you want to make some money,

328
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,320
bet against them the day after
they'd play either the, the clippers,

329
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,280
the kings or the Lakers,
cause they fucking go to la.

330
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,870
And after the game they all go out.
They Bang a bunch of fucking broads,

331
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,810
a bunch of fucking actresses or
whatever the fuck it is they do.

332
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,200
And then the next game, when they
go to San Jose, down to Anaheim,

333
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,320
out to Phoenix, up to Portland,
whatever the fuck they go next,

334
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,530
there's always a let down.
So the Celtics come out flat.

335
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,770
The fucking sons are all over him. Um,

336
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,030
love the God was on the sons was
just as fast it seems as Isaiah.

337
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,890
So he was right up on them. Um,
frustrating the hell out of them. He,

338
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,830
Isaiah had I think four files
in the first half. And um,

339
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,310
so we're watching the game and I'm just
going like, I fucking knew it. I've,

340
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,910
I'm so excited to finally see
this team. I've been watching,

341
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,290
seeing almost every game of this year
and they come out flat. I'm like, Oh man,

342
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:20,250
am I really going to the fucking
hangover game? Ah, what do I give a shit?

343
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,830
I got three fucking tickets,
but still, you know,

344
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,870
there's a bunch of Celtics fans there.

345
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:26,460
They're all going fucking
nuts and everything.

346
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:27,600
We had like nothing to cheer about.

347
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,350
I think we were down by like
10 after the first half. Um,

348
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,650
and we just start chipping away,
chipping away, chipping away.

349
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,710
First half was ugly. I mean it was like,

350
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,320
it was like a first quarter score
with like four minutes to go.

351
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,660
It was like 30 to 27 it seemed,
maybe it was like six minutes to go.

352
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,291
So what the half?

353
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:50,740
I think they were both like the f
forties ain't don't even remember. And a,

354
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:52,540
and I said, Paul
Jokingly, I go, you watch,

355
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,880
the bolt's going to score over a hundred,
they're going to eat up or whatever.

356
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,550
So of course they come out,
everybody starts hitting their shots,

357
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:00,610
it turns into this great game. Um,

358
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,750
and then the fourth quarter comes and
we start chipping away, chipping away,

359
00:21:05,751 --> 00:21:09,470
chipping away with done by like 10
or 11, and then went down by eight,

360
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:11,690
then went down by five and then without
my four. And next thing you know,

361
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:16,190
we're up by like two. So you guys all
know how the fucking game ends, right?

362
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,850
We fucking missed what's his face? Uh,

363
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,120
Brown missed that foul shot
and Isaiah, Mr. Foul Shot,

364
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:29,470
that would've fucking iced it.
And uh, we let him hang around,

365
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:33,350
hang around and fucking hang around
the end. I can't remember who was tied.

366
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,060
We were up by one. It all
happened. So you know,

367
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,010
it happened so fucking fast when you're
at the game and you don't have an

368
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:42,250
announcer holding your hand and you don't
have something that you can actually

369
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:45,370
look at, there's too much shit
to look at. So we go to inbound.

370
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,360
The fucking ball.

371
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,810
Yeah,

372
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,010
right. This guy goes around Jae Crowder
I think tied it up with like fuck right.

373
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:52,281
That's right.

374
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:55,820
We were up by two instead of being up
by three and forcing him to take a three

375
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:58,070
and they probably would have missed
a fucking thing. That's right.

376
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:02,150
And the guy goes right around, Crowder
lays it in, crowd's going nuts.

377
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,850
There's like four seconds left.
The guy and I can try to get a toy.

378
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,800
Isaiah Thomas, let's see what
happens. We fucking inbound the ball.

379
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,693
Isaiah,

380
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,880
one of the only times I've seen him
mess up this year messed up the past.

381
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,170
Who's kind of looking up court, you know,

382
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,230
cause there's only four seconds
left before he caught the ball.

383
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,050
They kick it out to this fucking
dude. What the hell was his name?

384
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,090
I actually wrote it down so I would
give him the respect he deserves.

385
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:27,260
Tyler ulous,

386
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,540
they kick it out to him and he hits a
fucking three point or the buzzer to beat

387
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,630
the Celtics. Now here's the thing,
I had second row fucking seats.

388
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,550
And guess what? I didn't even see
the play. It happened on my end.

389
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:41,803
You know why?

390
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,460
Because the fucking assholes who were
in there in the front fucking row.

391
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,250
Yeah,

392
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,660
they inbound the ball and
they could see that, you know?

393
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,410
Okay.

394
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,680
Um, Thomas was, was fucking
it up. They stand up,

395
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,820
you're in the fraud. Fucking run.
What are you standing up for?

396
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,100
There's nothing in front
of you. You fucking cunt.

397
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,720
And all of a sudden I just saw the ball
go to the net and everybody goes and the

398
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,300
horn goes off. Everybody goes
nuts. I go, what the fuck

399
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,560
does that count? Did that just go
with what the fuck just happened?

400
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,790
I had to go home to watch the replay
to see what the fuck happened.

401
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:20,720
I was sitting in the second row.

402
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:24,530
I couldn't see it because he's fucking
assholes stood up in front of me. Um,

403
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,620
I don't, I don't understand standing
up when nothing's in your way.

404
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,990
They haven't. You ever
heard that expression?

405
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,590
Why stand when you could sit by
sit, when you could lay down?

406
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,980
Why stand up when you were in the front
fucking row and what is blocking your

407
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,720
God view anyways? All right, I'm done.

408
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,230
Fucking bitch in here. I had a a,

409
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:46,850
I had a great time and evidently
Kobe eleven's are fucking crazy man.

410
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,623
You know

411
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,300
dude, Chris Everett should wear that
fucking sneakers. That's what it looks at.

412
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,680
It looks like the one that different
colored ones. I'd like, you know,

413
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,510
do you know something that is a
testament to how great Colby Bryant was.

414
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,080
You know, it's almost
like he's so fucking good.

415
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:12,760
Nike was at the factory going like how
fucking ugly do you think we could make a

416
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,440
sneaker if we put your name on it?

417
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,470
These people that lick the
bottom of the fucking sneaker,

418
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,920
will they still buy these
goddamn things? You know what?

419
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,390
Now that I'm looking at
him, cause I'm an old man,

420
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,120
they don't look like you
played basketball. Great.

421
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,990
They look comfortable as hell as far
as when they're in a different color.

422
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:31,900
I guess they look like slippers.

423
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,240
Now here's the thing. What I want
is I want to fucking ask you.

424
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,000
Coby had that horrific, uh, Achilles.

425
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,690
Okay.

426
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,120
Um, injury, I swear to God, which is like,

427
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,600
that was the end of anybody's career.

428
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,200
That is like the classic
old man basketball injury
is you go to take a step in

429
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,160
your fucking Achilles, goes right
up the back of your leg. Um,

430
00:24:59,250 --> 00:24:59,780
okay.

431
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,410
I mean, I don't even let me, I usually,

432
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,010
obviously I don't fucking play
hoop it all, but I still fucking,

433
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,920
I'm always stretching my fucking Achilles.

434
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,100
I swear to God before I
get out of bed, that's,

435
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,750
I don't know what it is about that injury.

436
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:15,410
I just know like five or six people that
have had it and I want no part of it.

437
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,500
I want no fucking, you never walk right
again. I mean, if he got Kobe's money,

438
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,783
you know,

439
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,840
you can go to Germany and meet the grand
sons of the Nazi fucking doctors and

440
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:28,930
they'll spend your fucking blood in a
centrifuge, whatever the fuck they do.

441
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,230
And then you come back and you can
still dunk or whatever. You know,

442
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:35,290
but most people don't have Coby
money. So what's going to happen is,

443
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,170
is you're going to go down
to the veterinarian down
the street and he's going to

444
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,420
sell that thing back and you're never
going to, you're never going to be,

445
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,373
you know,

446
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,183
that's it.

447
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,241
God help you.

448
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:50,241
If you're ever in a situation where
there's panic and the crowd starts running

449
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:54,330
and it's a stampede and you've blown
out your Achilles at some point in your

450
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:56,340
life that's you're going to get trampled.

451
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,923
You know,

452
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,230
you're going to be that zebra in the
Serengeti that gets eaten by the fucking

453
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:07,050
alligators, basically what's going
to happen. Um, but he, you know,

454
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:10,130
he has the low tops. I wonder if that
probably had nothing to do with it.

455
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,110
I'm just surprised guys are wearing low
top fucking sneakers again. Like it's a,

456
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,620
yeah,

457
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,330
cause you know, I, I don't pay attention
to shit. I usually watch hockey. Right.

458
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,260
And versus going like, no, no, no.
Colby kind of brought the low tops back.

459
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,161
Everybody's wearing.

460
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:28,300
So I looked out on the court and I saw
a number of people with low tops or

461
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:30,350
people still had like
these high top sneakers on,

462
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,880
but the amount of ones like that,
that they were like Velcro, you know,

463
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:36,920
like a little kitty
can't tie sneakers. See,

464
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:41,900
have they had like velcro high tops with
like a fucking belt around your ankle.

465
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,423
And I was,

466
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,670
I dunno, I dunno about those either.

467
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,830
You know what's hilarious?

468
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,810
How arrogant I am that I actually think
that the world cares what a 48 year old

469
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:59,360
white guy thinks about
fucking sneakers. Oh,

470
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,050
why don't you just get a pair
of shell toes? Um, so anyways,

471
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,630
we went to the Goddamn game and uh,

472
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:11,250
we had a great fucking
time. Um, Robert Sovereign,

473
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:15,360
his family are great. We met, we met
him briefly, but, and just talk to him,

474
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:19,850
just great people like that guy.
Dude, if I was a feed experiment,

475
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,140
I would be very happy with
that guy. As an owner,

476
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,470
even though I know you guys
are rebuilding, that guy
fucking loves his team.

477
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,890
There's a lot of owners, they
don't give a shit. You know,

478
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:32,640
they own a team so they can have hookers
and blow it up in a fucking sweet dude.

479
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:35,610
That guy, he was, it looked
like he, I was going to say,

480
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,790
it's like he had money on the game and
he does. He's paying the fucking players.

481
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,723
Um,

482
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,850
anyways. Um, all right, so
let's plow ahead here. Um,

483
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,680
I should probably read some God damn
advertising radio. All right, Luke Craig.

484
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,670
Oh, give me the loop. Uh,

485
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,780
Be The envy of your friends. Why would
you want your friends to be envious? Gee,

486
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:04,781

Hey nerds, I don't know what the fuck
that, I don't even know what that is.

509
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,040
Do you guys have a dental?

510
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,440
He love it and you're buying this shit
cause they keep advertising on my podcast

511
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,380
. I know what Predator is.
I know what Wolverine is.

512
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,830
That's when that Australian guy has to
eat a whole fucking chicken day to get

513
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,570
jacked. And I was reading
the other day, that guy,

514
00:29:45,571 --> 00:29:50,571
he's played wolverine eight times and
he has to pack on like 25 pounds of

515
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,740
fucking muscle. He goes,

516
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:56,430
I eat a whole chicken every day because
my jaw is literally sore from eating.

517
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:01,340
It's like, why don't you
just do Royce? You know,

518
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,570
it's not like they test
you as an actor. Oh,

519
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,460
did you hear about the fucking wolverine?
Gay can't make any more movies.

520
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:11,630
He got suspended for three
movies. He did steroids. Um,

521
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,270
[inaudible] Oh, Bodo boat boat me on
these me is watching the Phoenix Suns.

522
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:21,890
But Dude, dude, dude, me undies me
undies, Atlantic is a fucking bomb.

523
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,220
He's fucking seven feet.
I don't give a fuck.

524
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,150
He's got the lateral movement of a fucking
dump truck. I don't know what to say.

525
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,233
Anyway,

526
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,780
your balls will feel nice and fucking
soft when you're wearing the Colby 11.

527
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,450
They're fucking ugly. Um, meet me on this.

528
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,450
The lateral movement of a dump
truck. I know it does. Whatever.

529
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:53,230
It fucking rhymed. You can
at least get me that Mandy,

530
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,510
she was one of the following
openers in your read. Okay.

531
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,660
Elevate your underwear game to
the next level with me undies.

532
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,323
Um,

533
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,860
you've perfected your wardrobe,
but what about the stuff?

534
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,180
Not everybody gets to see if
you've been settled. Dude,

535
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,870
is there anything better
than a new pair of underwear?

536
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,190
Okay.

537
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,550
I mean, it's crazy. Your
balls are alive, you know,

538
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:22,290
do you have on a new pair of underwear
and, and you have the Olynyk sevens on.

539
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,510
I'm telling you, dude, and you go to,

540
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:29,270
is there anything better than a bowl
of fucking great nuts? Um, great nuts,

541
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,120
right? You fucking, you. You're
nuts are fucking comfortable.

542
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:36,800
Your grape nuts are a soft you
touch. It's going to be a great day.

543
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:42,150
You put on your sweat pants, you
get a slice of pizza. You know,

544
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,480
somebody says something, you go, Oh,

545
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,020
if you'd been settling for store
bought underwear, five packs,

546
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,260
I have something that will change
your life for the better me on this.

547
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,140
What's the first thing you put on
and the last thing you take off,

548
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,220
it's your underwear.

549
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,170
Make your most important piece of clothing
the best it can be with me on undies.

550
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,360
What is me on these? Oh,

551
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:07,260
just seriously soft and feel good on
these delivered right to your door.

552
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,480
Biondi you've be funny as of Kelly.

553
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:13,890
Olynyk actually hears this and kicks me
in my red nuts with this fucking Kobe 11

554
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,880
so that would really be justice. There's
your lateral movement. You're wanting,

555
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:20,190
your balls is going this way.
The others go on the other way.

556
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,400
You know something. That's why
I think you have a ball bag.

557
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,700
You know what I mean? Cause it hurts
so much to get kicked in the balls.

558
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,880
God had to give your balls the
opportunity to try to get out of the way.

559
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,420
You know what I mean? It's like a running
back that knows how to take a hit.

560
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:36,030
You know you can't have
like, like Earl Campbell,

561
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:37,380
just one in straight up and down.

562
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:40,160
You're going to end up in a fucking
wheelchair. You know what I mean?

563
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,990
I know Jim Brown doesn't like it,

564
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,870
but these running backs that step out
of bounds, they prolong your career.

565
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,600
That's what your balls are doing
and your ball back. All right,

566
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:51,080
back to the book. Copy. Hear me.
UNDIES are designed in La. Oh Jesus.

567
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,030
And made from sustainably
sourced micro modal, modal R.

568
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,310
It's a fabric three
times softer than cotton.

569
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,050
Evidentaly eat me undies softer
than socks. Loves undies.

570
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,520
Isn't that supposed to
be luxury? Lux? See Luke,

571
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,510
say undies come in an ever changing
selection of classic colors.

572
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,760
Maybe you can find some to match your
Jordan sixes do to say anything better

573
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:21,320
than walking around in your underwear
and you find some Jordan's sevens that

574
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:22,880
match. I mean, it's fucking crazy.

some gimmicky fucking thing that's got a

shave from a dispose disposables like

598
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,100
the one they give away
for free at the gym,

599
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,970
which felt like shaving with a piece
of glass or you pay a fortune for the

600
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,500
latest gimmicky shave breakthrough.

601
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:02,120
You don't need like a laser
chin detector or 17 more blades.

602
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,160
Yeah, do the only thing you two
blades. One blade sucked, right?

603

It's one of my in lady shaving my legs
over here. Two blades was the shit.

604
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:16,460

one of those gladiator
noses, Mediterranean.

609
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,810
I can't say the obvious choice here
because everybody would get offended,

610
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:35,660
but you know what I mean? Those poor
people, what they've been through.

619
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,990

633
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,730
Here we go. Here we go. Let's
get back to the fucking podcast.

634
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,310
So I've been listening to a bunch
of fucking old school country,

635
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,740
not all the way back to Hank Williams,
but like that outlaw shit, you know,

636
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,080
right before the outlaws. Shit is
George Jones considered outlaw,

637
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,430
I dunno, but listening
to him late, obviously,

638
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,940
um, to all of these other
fucking guys, right. And uh,

639
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,860
I ended up listing, I
remember that the song,

640
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,930
do you guys remember Johnny paycheck?

641
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,060
Johnny paycheck was this country
singer and he, I swear to God,

642
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:28,690
he had a hit song called
take this job and shove it.

643
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,160
And it was such a fucking hit.

644
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,250
It's so struck a chord with people that
they actually turned it into a movie.

645
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:44,760
There was actually a movie called take
this job and shove it. It was just a,

646
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,820
it was about a fucking guy who was working
in a job that he hated and he wanted

647
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:54,710
to tell him, you know, basically
tell him to go fuck themselves.

648
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:55,760
But he didn't have the nerves.

649
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:58,910
And I think it was because the lyric was
someday I'm going to get the nerve to

650
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:02,900
say it and everybody could
relate to it being like, Hey,

651
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:06,560
I also hate my fucking life
and I want to make a change,

652
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,880
but I don't know how to do
it. You know what I mean?

653
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:16,250
It's like the whole Donald Trump fucking
phenomenon, not the informed people.

654
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:21,680
You know what I mean? I'm talking
about the, the, the mouth breather.

655
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,840
You know what I mean? Like
what the Hillary Clinton,

656
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:27,740
you had the informed person that wanted
to vote for her and then you had the

657
00:38:27,741 --> 00:38:32,600
hissy fit, fucking dope.
This will be great for women.

658
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:37,070
Like your life was really gonna
fucking change. Um, I swear to God, I,

659
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,410
I just don't, I don't,

660
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:42,760
I don't understand adults who haven't
fucking figured it out yet. That you're,

661
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:47,680
you're on your own. Okay. Play time
is over. Nobody cares about you. Okay.

662
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,340
I don't care what color they're fucking
tired them for. Their Bra is they,

663
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,453
they don't,

664
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:56,530
the level of money that you have to have
and then you have to give it to these

665
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:59,680
people to, for you to
even be on their radar,

666
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,620
you have to be going to these 10,000,

667
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:05,500
a hundred thousand $50,000
fucking plate dinners with them.

668
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,660
And then you have to stand in a line
of people that all paid that money.

669
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,310
Okay? And you got to get up there with
your fucking shapeshift or fucking lizard

670
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,520
eyeballs and you got to try
to appear into their soul.

671
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,370
I didn't think you'd talk to him.

672
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:24,340
You just walk up with a Napkin that says
how much money are you going to give to

673
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:26,050
them? And then you're
on their fucking radar.

674
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,260
Has nothing to do with your
genitalia anyways, so all the, okay,

675
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,080
so I'm getting off the rails yet. So
this fucking guy, Johnny paycheck,

676
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,440
he's got this fucking shot. The song
called take this job and shove it.

677
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,410
It's the funniest fucking, just,

678
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:43,840
there's no way to listen to this
song and not fucking just be,

679
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,800
I played it for Paul Versey. He
was crying, laughing. He goes,

680
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:50,140
this can't be a real song. I go,
dude, not only is it a real song,

681
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,710
I was turned into a movie.
Just the way he says, shove it,

682
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:56,950
his voice drops way down. He goes,

683
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:59,260
take this job and shove it.

684
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,590
I work in here no more.

685
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:08,570
My woman Don lab took all the reasons why
I was working for these are the actual

686
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,040
lyrics.

687
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,040
You better or not try to stay in the
my way cause I'm walking out the door.

688
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,460
You could take this job I working here
no more than the stupid baseline comes on

689
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,380
boot but du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du
and it gets all like [inaudible]

690
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,070
kind of quiet. You don't
want to red neck gets quiet,

691
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,370
you know and starts talking,
leans in. It's fucking scary.

692
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,050
You know non Whitey. Even for
white people. That's fucking scary.

693
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:44,770
There is nothing scarier than a redneck
leaning in at a bar thinking that you

694
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,200
were all on the same team.

695
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,800
That's some fucked up shit cause you're
immediately like, I don't want to do,

696
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,590
I don't, I don't want any part of what
you're about ready to tell me sir.

697
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,090
And I want to try to get out of
this conversation gracefully.

698
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:00,030
How do I dismount out of
this fucking conversation?

699
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,310
The second they went on a fucking
redneck looks the opposite way of the

700
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:08,010
conversation and then
leans in. I'm telling you,

701
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,640
this should be like a fucking an injector
seat on your bar stool to get you the

702
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:20,010
fuck out of it. Where did it
go? Did I get left behind?

703
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:26,100
Um, so I swear to God. So when he
gets into the verse, right? He,

704
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:31,101
it's like he's leaning in
happy and working in this
factory for now on 15 years

705
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,430
all his time.

706
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,200
Or Watch my woman drowning in
a pool that tears. You know,

707
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:39,890
and I,

708
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,400
what I love about all those old school
country songs is it fucking women always

709
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:48,230
leave. They're always crying or
whatever, but these fucking assholes,

710
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,100
they never say why. And whenever I listen
to these songs, it's just like, dude,

711
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,600
what the fuck are you doing? I get
it. You're working at this factory.

712
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,610
You don't like the job. Why is your woman
drowning in a pool of tears? What the,

713
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,330
I mean, are you taking this
fucking, so you don't have the balls

714
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,900
to try to get a better job? Tell your
boss to fuck off. So what happens?

715
00:42:10,901 --> 00:42:14,770
You come home, you take it out on
your wife. Is that what you're doing?

716
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,420
I bet. Shit jobs. I've had law
pay up for the first fucking,

717
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:23,580
I don't know how many years of being
a comedian. Was it a low paying job?

718
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,210
I never had a girlfriend
drown in a pool of tears.

719
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,690
I mean, I definitely made him cry,
but that's because I was an asshole.

720
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:33,790
Had nothing to do with my
fuck. I wouldn't blame my job.

721
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,303
Okay.

722
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,500
I've been featuring on the road for
now on 16 years on of these days.

723
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,040
Anyways. You got, you just listen to the
fucking song. You gotta hear this song,

724
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,680
you gotta you, um, Johnny paycheck. Um,

725
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,170
I know I'm making fun of
him, but I actually, I dunno,

726
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,120
there's something about this.

727
00:42:56,121 --> 00:43:00,740
I listened to this fucking song and
just gives me all kinds of ideas for

728
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:04,220
characters and shit like that
and movies and whatever. Um,

729
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,570
but I'm in download, George Jones,
George Jones. Tammy way net,

730
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,610
all of these fucking
people, and I swear to God,

731
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,980
you got to, you got to listen
to George Jones these days.

732
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,250
These days I barely get by

733
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,160
is inadvertently one of
the funniest buckets.

734
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:24,590
Songs you ever gonna listen to your life.

735
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:27,530
Do you have one of those friends that
just calls up and complains all the time

736
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,610
and you, you try to help them out and
go, hey, well what if you do? Nah,

737
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:36,390
I can't do that. And one blow the
fucking guy who just resigned himself.

738
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,233
Okay,

739
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,840
yeah. Hey, with my lot, this
would x, Y, and z would happen.

740
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,260
That's why I can't with
that fucking attitude,

741
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:43,520
that's exactly what's going to happen.

742
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,340
Okay?

743
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,650
You know what I mean? I've got
a couple of friends like that.

744
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:48,980
After awhile you just like, dude,

745
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,980
you're a white guy and the
United States of America.

746
00:43:50,981 --> 00:43:54,370
How far down the fucking track before
the race starts that you have to be

747
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,680
Jesus fucking Christ? How the
fuck are you complaining? I'm

748
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,790
complaining. I'm not saying that white
people should not complain. Okay.

749
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:08,230
I know there's a lot of people down
in a pool. It tears harder these days.

750
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:12,940
I'm going to get the, I'm going
to blow my top. It's like, dude,

751
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,850
why don't you just address the
fact that you don't like your job?

752
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,060
Apply from some other jobs. If
you don't have the training,

753
00:44:19,061 --> 00:44:21,460
take some night courses. You know,

754
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:26,490
get the training you need instead of
sitting there seething coming home,

755
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,110
taking it out on your fucking well.

756
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,840
George Jones has another fucking
song called the grand tour.

757
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:38,520
I listened to that. I'm telling you, you
got to listen to these fucking songs,

758
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:40,410
right? I listened to that
song. It's like, George,

759
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,020
what in the fuck did you do
to your woman? It's like,

760
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:49,590
step right up. Come on in.

761
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:55,230
If you'd want to tag the Grand Tor, Oh,

762
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:59,910
below where? How's the
woods was home. Sweet home.

763
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,200
You're like, Jesus Christ
and this motherfucker. He
goes through his whole house

764
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,500
over there.

765
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:08,920
Okay.

766
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,920
It is the chair where it should bring the
pipe to me and sit down on my knee and

767
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,930
whisper, Ooh, I love you.

768
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,040
I you're like Jesus Christ right there.
You want to get out of the house?

769
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,370
This motherfucker won't
stop straight ahead.

770
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,780
It is the bed where we lay low, boom. So

771
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,740
thought he gets all away to
the nursery. You're like,

772
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,110
oh Jesus Christ. He goes,

773
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,260
she took the fucking baby and the key
thing in all of this is he says there's a

774
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,930
rings and a things and it's
like this fucking woman

775
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:53,530
[inaudible]

776
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,290
left all of her stuff and
took the baby. George,

777
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:57,900
what the fuck did you do to him?

778
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:58,980
Okay,

779
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,190
this woman didn't leave you.
She fled the fucking scene.

780
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:07,350
There's some sort of detail [inaudible]
you're not fucking given me here.

781
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,600
Where are the empty booze bottles? I
mean, what do you, what do you, what did

782
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,690
I actually listened to that song?

783
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:19,200
I feel bad for the woman in his
life until I found out she left.

784
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:20,820
Then I actually feel good. Yeah,

785
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:24,810
get the fuck out I and get that kid out
of there told me that if I'm supposed to

786
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:25,644
feel bad for you.

787
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,733
Okay.

788
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,630
Sounds like you went out back to
chop some wood and she just grass.

789
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:36,380
She saw some daylight, somehow got the
chains off around her fucking ankles,

790
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:39,840
grabbed the kid and get the fuck
out of there. Um, anyway, so

791
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,380
[inaudible]

792
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,360
Oh, there's going to be some pure
country fans are gonna be like,

793
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,500
you're missing the point, man.

794
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:52,710
Take this job and show that
night working here in more.

795
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,190
Alright. Pro Flowers. Everybody.
Wallman Boon blessed me.

796
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:01,250
Okay.

797
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,870
My woman Doug, left me. Hey
Johnny paycheck. Come on.

798
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,120
It's just you and make, whoa. What did
she, what, what, what'd you do? You know,

799
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:13,810
I imagine if she fucked around on
you, you would've mentioned it. Yeah.

800
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,620
Okay.

801
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:20,160
All right. Maybe I'm taking these fucking
songs a little too seriously. Um, I,

802
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,190
I have a problem with that. Like when I
listen to rap music, you know, like who?

803
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,870
Suzette new group that
everybody's Migos. When I,

804
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,590
when I watch their videos and shit and
they've coming up in those supercars and

805
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:34,840
they're holding the fucking
money out, it just, it literally,

806
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:36,370
I have to look in the other direction.

807
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,240
It just drives me not seeing
artists doing that. I just,

808
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:43,000
I'm always thinking in my head,
please, please buy some real estate.

809
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,640
Please don't blow it all
on fucking Coby eleven's.

810
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,680
Oh my God, Dude.

811
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:55,500
Watch an artist's watch and people
who don't understand money I guess.

812
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:59,400
But I would say artists, you
know the shit that we fucking do.

813
00:47:59,401 --> 00:48:00,690
It's just the dumbest,

814
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,520
you know what's another
stupid fucking thing?

815
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,470
I love these people that buy watches
that are like you. It's like dude,

816
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:09,320
that thing you could hang
that on the fucking wall.

817
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,270
I'd know what time it
was from across the room.

818
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,310
Why do you have that on
that roof on your wrist?

819
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,040
The amount of guys that are like my
height and my size walking around with a

820
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:24,090
watch that only would look right on
like a fucking offensive lineman is,

821
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,220
it's like, did you take
that out of a submarine? Is,

822
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,680
is that like deep sea scuba dive and
Shit so you can [inaudible] you can go

823
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,740
fucking go down to like what?
9,000 feet now with the,

824
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,390
the Goddamn dial won't bust on it.

825
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,330
I got my big old watch.

826
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,820
People in a different time zone can
tell what time it is. Take this walk.

827
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:54,800
I can show that pro flowers everybody.

828
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,540
Have you ever forgotten your
anniversary? If you're not nodding yes,

829
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:00,500
you're lying.

830
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:02,040
Okay.

831
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,610
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

832
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,990
I don't forget my anniversary. It
gets up to, I'm not gonna lie to you.

833
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,440
It definitely sneaks up on me where
I'll be off pockets in two days.

834
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:19,560
What can I get or what can I get or I
don't have time. Maybe I'll get, uh,

835
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:24,180
some fucking flowers. Um, you know those
people that are just hard to shop for?

836
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,570
Like your wife, for your anniversary,
your sister for a birthday.

837
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,900
It's just the worst. Trying to
find that gift. A, you don't know.

838
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:31,763
You don't know.

839
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,720
I think that's supposed to say what
you don't know what the like and B.

840
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:40,280
[inaudible]

841
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,850
what? It's just the worst. Trying
to, okay. It's just the worst.

842
00:49:43,851 --> 00:49:46,730
Trying to find a gift at
a, you know, they'll like,

843
00:49:46,731 --> 00:49:51,380
and B won't cost an arm and a leg.
Well, I'm going to make it easy for you.

844
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:54,140
Pro Flowers is my go to for flowers.

845
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,710
It's actually a flower store down
the street. That's my fucking go to.

846
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,530
I hate the Internet. You know,

847
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,410
I'll go on there and I'll try to click
on something and next thing you know,

848
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:06,700
I'll eat the, either the or they
either won't go through all,

849
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,680
I'll have enough fucking
funeral to re up enough funeral.

850
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:12,080
I'll have enough fucking
flowers to rebury Elvis.

851
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,350
That's what I was trying to say. Then
I just started picturing his funeral.

852
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,690
Anyways, pro flowers is
my go to for flowers.

853
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:22,980
They're fresh price, right, and a
perfect gift for literally anyone.

854
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:28,070
Oh yeah. Get one for your guy
friends. That's a fucking gift.

855
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,940
If you just want to freak out

880
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,760
I was wondering why they were going to
be advertising flowers this time of year.

881
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,070
I was like, what are you
gonna get it for fucking East?

882
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,550
Get some Ash Wednesday flowers.
Why are they advertising it?

883
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,530
Cause you know what, they
probably had their maximum appeal.

884
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,980
They probably hit their maximum fucking,

885
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,500
I just realized it's probably somebody
sleeping on the other side. I mean,

886
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:28,850
I'm waking them up with my fucking Johnny
paycheck saying, let me get over here.

887
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,990
Um, anyways, so they'd
probably be like, well,

888
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:36,290
how can we get people that fucking
buy flowers all year round?

889
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:42,200
How can we create a need?
Everybody's got an anniversary.

890

Everybody's got a birthday
birthday, right? Hey,

00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:49,220

which I haven't done in a
minute, but I'm, you know,

912
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,320
I'm thinking I'm going to start fucking
doing that again. Now that I'm a father.

913
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,150
Now that I got my daughter, my
daughter, don't let me, don't go.

914
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:03,750

918
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:19,643

enter
[inaudible].

919
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,700
All right, I'm getting up against it
here. You know what I'm doing today,

920
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:27,300
by the way, I'm going
to go see, oh Cleo Odeo.

921
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,360
I'm going to see my dog Cleo. Um, the,

922
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,130
the people that ended up, uh,

923
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,840
rescue getting her from
us live out here. So, um,

924
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,580
I'm actually gonna get to see her. I'm
visiting her today and tomorrow and, um,

925
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,510
I can't wait to see her in everything.
She's probably not going to give a shit

926
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,010
cause she's probably gonna be so
in love with the other people.

927
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,510
Cause I kinda realized that going well.

928
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:59,540
She was in love with the people that
had her before us and within a week she

929
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:04,020
fucking loved us. I mean, dogs should
they adapt, they just fucking adept. So,

930
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,250
um, I've got another five minutes
here and then I, I gotta take off.

931
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:12,390
So I got time for like one question
here. Let me see. Um, let me get,

932
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:15,900
let me get a good one here. Uh, Alrighty.

933
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,120
Rady a dictator bill.

934
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,000
I'm 19 years old and I've been with
my girlfriend, my Wallman Dolan left.

935
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,900
I'm with my girlfriend
now for two years. Uh,

936
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,630
I know what you're thinking too
young for all these silly problems.

937
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,580
That's not what I'm thinking. I'm thinking
good for you. Way To go where to go.

938
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,930
Fell. Um, anyway, for the
first year of our relationship,

939
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:43,450
literally everything was perfect. I still
love her just as much as I did then.

940
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,360
I'm sure she loves me
just as much. However,

941
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:49,710
during the second year of our relationship
relationship and overnight shift

942
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:50,544
changed.

943
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,583
Yeah.

944
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,280
Um, and then we stopped
having sex it based,

945
00:55:56,281 --> 00:55:58,680
it's basically nonexistent
and now and again,

946
00:55:58,681 --> 00:56:02,610
every couple of months it will happen.
But I know she's not enjoying it.

947
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:07,970
This is because she was on the
implant contraception injection.

948
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,520
At first I was questioning myself and
if it was me that wasn't getting her in

949
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:17,370
the mood anymore, but she promises me
that it isn't because of the implant.

950
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:22,230
She says it's that what the fuck
is a contraception injection?

951
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:27,520
[inaudible] okay. Oh Jesus. I,

952
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,210
I didn't mean I've never
heard of that shit.

953
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,143
Okay.

954
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:35,350
It's an injection so you
won't get pregnant. Dude,

955
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,990
if you literally told me contraception
actually meant it's going to get you

956
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:41,030
pregnant, I would believe
that too. This week.

957
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:45,100
One of those fucking words that I
just ignored my whole life. You know,

958
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:49,330
like Soliloquy, like what the fuck does
that mean? You know, contraception,

959
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,253
implant

960
00:56:57,810 --> 00:57:02,020
official site. Get the facts. Fuck that.
I don't want facts. I want pictures.

961
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:02,913
Images.

962
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,790
Okay. They're showing it
that it's nice and small.

963
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,710
For some reason they keep
putting it up against the bicep.

964
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:17,690
They stick it in your fucking arm

965
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:24,563
watch.

966
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,360
So say some fucking robot shit. Okay.

967
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:33,190
It's birth control implant.

968
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:35,920
They stick a fucking toothpick in your
arm and then you can't have a baby.

969
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:37,900
I don't get it. Anyways. Well yeah,

970
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:41,320
that's probably fucking annoying to
have it in there. You know what I mean?

971
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,350
She goes to hug you in the
inside of her arm hurts. Anyways,

972
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,890
after the first I was
questioning [inaudible],

973
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:50,230
she says that that is caused her
to completely lose her sex drive.

974
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:55,540
She says she just had it removed and it's
been a few weeks since and nothing has

975
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:56,374
changed yet.

976
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,730
I feel so much resentment towards her
every day and what I can only describe as

977
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:02,830
depression. As soon as I see her,

978
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:07,120
most of the time I find myself being
such an angry short tempered person.

979
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:09,850
Now when normally I'm
usually happy and smiling,

980
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,390
a Jesus might be time to get
out of this relationship buddy.

981
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,540
But you know something, if it
really affected her like that,

982
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,110
it depends on how long
she had it in there.

983
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:21,520
Maybe she needs longer than
two weeks. Um, but you know,

984
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:22,800
if you're going to be an angry lunatic,

985
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,990
I mean if you don't leave eventually
she's gonna. But you know what,

986
00:58:25,991 --> 00:58:30,991
you get yourself a song on a warm
dawn port a to pick in her arm.

987
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,630
Now she won't suck my
Dick one of these days.

988
00:58:34,631 --> 00:58:38,560
I'm going to whip it out
and wipe it on the wall.

989
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:43,590
You can take mod dick and shove it, um,

990
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,970
Rodney and your fucking mouth,
you whore. But do, do, do, do.

991
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,910
But do you do okay? I always try.

992
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:53,200
I always seem to try and hide my need
for sex and act like I don't ever want it

993
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:56,560
and tried to show
disinterests but I never can.

994
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:59,230
I guess it just must be more
important to me than it is to her.

995
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,240
I never thought sex was such a big deal,

996
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:05,080
but the last year has taught me
that when there's bad sex life in a

997
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:07,900
relationship, it can really cause
the whole thing to just break down.

998
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:12,400
It just got to the point now that I've
said we need some space and a break,

999
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,270
cause the last thing I want is
to ruin our relationship. Um,

1000
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:21,990
dude, you're fucking miserable man.
And you have to, you have to, you know,

1001
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,810
it's, you gotta be with somebody and
like understand them and, and you know,

1002
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:32,120
be there when they're going through
a tough time, but like, you know,

1003
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,390
if they're not understanding how fucking
miserable you are, you're just gonna.

1004
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:39,800
You just going to keep getting
more miserable and then, you know,

1005
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,440
then they're going to be
miserable. And then in the end,

1006
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,810
they're gonna fucking break up with you
and you're gonna be like, what the fuck?

1007
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:47,730
I should have done that to them.
I'm not breaking up with somebody.

1008
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:48,740
It's not something you should do to them.

1009
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,190
It's something you should do for yourself.
All right? This is the deal, dude.

1010
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,430
You're not fucking happy.
All right? You're not happy.

1011
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,230
It's great that you've
taken a fucking break.

1012
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:01,280
And I would go out and I'd fucking go try
to enjoy myself and meet somebody that

1013
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:04,580
doesn't have a fucking toothpick in
their arm that doesn't want to touch my

1014
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:07,490
dick. You know? I mean, that's just
getting down to brass tacks here.

1015
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:12,050
That's what's going on, right?
They stuck that shit in her and a,

1016
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,140
you can't stick your shit in hurt. So
I mean, why you gotta get the fuck out?

1017
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,190
I get out. You're young, dude, you're
19. What are you gonna marry her?

1018
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:24,170
What do you in the military? People in
the military get married when they're 19,

1019
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,033
you know?

1020
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,780
Okay.

1021
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:31,710
But, and dawn left, um,
that's what you do. I,

1022
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:35,950
it's just sounds like
a, you sound like you,

1023
01:00:35,951 --> 01:00:40,460
you need like a long time away from
each other. The way that was read, dude,

1024
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:43,990
that sounded like a fucking 40
year old guy rather that Indian 19.

1025
01:00:43,991 --> 01:00:48,130
So that's kind of a good sign that maybe
she get the fuck out. Um, who knows?

1026
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:52,420
But I, I would not say anything mean
I would not. And uh, I just, you know,

1027
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:56,440
you want to be able to see the person
again and not get a glass to the head.

1028
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,150
You know what I mean? That's
kind of what you're going for.

1029
01:00:58,151 --> 01:01:01,600
So the art form is you just
tell them how you're feeling.

1030
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,290
Yeah.

1031
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:07,700
You know, I'm just not happy. I'm
sorry. That's just how I feel.

1032
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:11,420
I'm just not happy and I'm finding
myself less and less happy and,

1033
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:16,610
um, it's affecting my moods.
Everything you just said.

1034
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,120
Okay.

1035
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,570
And I'm finding that I'm getting angry
and I don't want to be angry around you

1036
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:25,440
and create any misery in your life. So
as much as this is going to hurt you,

1037
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:30,570
I'm walking out the door, you
can take this relationship,

1038
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:31,920
shove it. Um,

1039
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:33,610
okay.

1040
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:37,600
That's it. They walk
out the door, you know,

1041
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:41,970
and you'll probably walk out that door
and you'd be sad a little bit and your

1042
01:01:41,971 --> 01:01:42,890
walk a little more.

1043
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:47,850
Then you start skipping and then you're
running down the street. Yeah, yeah.

1044
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,140
It might be one of those breakups or it
could be the one, oh, why did I do it?

1045
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,900
I don't fucking know. But you're
19, you know, if you got the whole,

1046
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:57,780
you got your whole fucking life ahead
of you. You don't need to be in this.

1047
01:01:57,781 --> 01:02:01,950
This sounds like you're fucking married.
I'd get up. All right. That's it. Okay.

1048
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,500
And that's the fucking podcast
for this week. Go fuck yourselves.

1049
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:09,750
I will check in on you
on, I'm on Thursday.

1050
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,250
And uh, that said,

1051
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:15,270
I'll let you know how she and all
clear the next couple of days is,

1052
01:02:15,271 --> 01:02:17,690
which is going to be fucking
awesome. And it's also, you know,

1053
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,810
and I'm psyched that, you know,
we've got a cool family and uh,

1054
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,700
you know, I think I'll come out to
Phoenix a couple times a year, you know,

1055
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:30,930
do a run of shows like I'm doing here.
Go to a game or something like that,

1056
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:34,620
I'll hang out with the dog. It's kind
of Nice, you know? All right. That's it.

1057
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,000
I'll talk to you guys on Thursday.
