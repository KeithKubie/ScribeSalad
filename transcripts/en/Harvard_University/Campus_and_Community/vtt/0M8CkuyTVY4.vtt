00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.860
Harvard has a long tradition of service

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.669
to all of our neighbors both near and far,

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.219
and it has been a key part of the University
since its founding.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.199
Service is a core aspect of all we do at Harvard.
Service in terms of what we

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.170
discover and the ways it can change the
world. Service in the form of

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.480
teaching and communicating knowledge but also
service in the way

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.810
in which we relate to our community
both local,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.460
national, and global.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.870
Service experience gives Harvard students an
ability to try out ideas to understand

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.330
how they can have an impact on the
world around them.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.020
How can we be vibrant and integral 
parts of the communities in which we are

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.080
located.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.540
So that we serve that through being
engaged with them, and it's not a one-way

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.010
interaction but rather a reciprocal
interaction, in which we understand what

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.650
we can bring to the communities in which
we're located, but we also understand what

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.720
those communities bring to us. We have a
program at Harvard

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.439
for service employees, it's called
the bridge program. Recently I attended a

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.090
celebration

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.650
of citizenship of the naturalization of
thirty three individuals who were

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.050
participants in the bridge program,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.850
and a considerable part of their
preparation for their citizenship exams

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.340
took place in conjunction with
undergraduate students, who tutored them

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.660
on aspects of american history, american
government, and other kinds of things

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.930
they needed to know for these
exams.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.620
And wonderful relationships had grown up
between the undergraduate students and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.210
the new american citizens, and this
celebration for me marked a marvelous

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.530
achievement by a group of our workers,
but also how marvelous example of

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.049
engagement by

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.159
our students. Tough
economic times make what we do all

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.610
the more important.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.229
What we do in the communities that we
can help, that surround us and the ways

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.819
that we can translate skills and engagement
of our

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.629
students and faculty into helpful
interventions in communities life.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.109
But also the ways in which our knowledge
can provide a means of service to help

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.839
us understand how to get out of these
times.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:25.149
It's a teaching experience a learning
experience often for students and

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.569
integral part of their learning here at
Harvard.
