00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.620
Opening up DevTools we very quickly find this error for fail to load resource.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.030
Error name not resolved, yeah, that's how you're supposed to say it.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.750
Clearly this is not a real URL so we see the name not resolved error.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.990
Inside the Network tab we see that this GET request is in red,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.510
indicating that it failed.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.770
Well the other one here for

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.670
New York times showed up with a code of 200 indicating that it's a-okay.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.470
If something doesn't look right on your page, going to dev tools and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.820
opening up the network tab is a great place to get started.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.490
We can also see that error handling worked because we failed to

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.820
get Wikipedia resources.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.950
This is once again a nice way of letting the users know that, hey,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.970
something didn't quite go right without breaking the entire page.
