00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.410
Okay, square root's easy.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.880
Sort's going to be harder, as far as the por, postcondition is concerned.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.910
So I'd like you to, let's go back for

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.800
a minute to the natural language specification and revisit that and

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.030
then consider what the postcondition of sort's going to be.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.700
So we said in the natural language specification.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.100
That the output vector Y must be ordered, and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.370
somehow the contents of Y must be the same as the contents of X.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.299
That is, everything in X must be in Y, everything in Y must come from X, and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.940
the number of occurrences must, must match up.
