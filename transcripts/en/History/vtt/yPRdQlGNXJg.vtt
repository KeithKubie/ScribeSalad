00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.628
Bladesmiths, this
is the strength test.

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:05.547
To test the strength and
durability of your edge

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:07.382
as well as overall
construction of your knives,

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:10.135
I'll be batonning your
blades into these motorcycle

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.845
handlebars three times.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.304
Andy, you're up first.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:15.598
ANDY: I am a little
concerned about chipping.

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.100
I've got more of a
feeling that this knife is

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.811
going to roll before it chips.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:22.188
[music playing]

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.031
Well Andy, there is, on
my first hit down here,

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.366
a pretty significant roll.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.660
You can get your
fingernail under it.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.954
The second two hits, just
a slight, slight roll

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.831
right there.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:44.627
The handle is a little bit
square for me, but it is solid.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:45.795
In all, well done.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.964
Thank you.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:49.507
Jonathan, you're up next.
You ready?

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.885
Go for it.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.553
JONATHAN: I'm really nervous.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.597
I definitely think my knife
is going to take some damage

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.932
because I still don't know
enough about that steel

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:59.893
to know how it's going to react.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.687
[music playing]

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.527
Well Jonathan,
first things first--

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:11.029
love this handle.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.822
This thing is so comfortable.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.908
It feels like it's kind
of just hugging me.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.951
It's so wonderful.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.705
More importantly though, man,
your edge held up beautifully.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:25.794
There is some minor glinting
but very, very minor.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.962
Very well done.
- Thank you.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.547
Ed, are you ready?

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:30.924
Have at it.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:31.883
Because it's about
to happen right meow.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.890
ED: Motorcycles and knives
are two of my favorite things.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.558
They're going to hurt
the bike and they're

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:44.020
going to hurt my knife, so
it's a double whammy, you know?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.815
[music playing]

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:59.077
Well Ed, on the
first hit there

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.329
was a pretty significant roll.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.872
You can hear it.
- Yeah.

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:04.916
The second two
strikes were much

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:07.627
less damaging to the blade.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.587
I also like the overall
shape of your knife.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.381
Well done.
- Thank you.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:15.093
Next up, the
chopper seat slash.

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:18.054
To see how sharp your blades
are I will take your weapon

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.807
and slash across
these chopper seats.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:21.891
Andy, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.101
Sure.
Let's do it.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.727
Let's ride.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.522
[music playing]

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.167
All right, Andy, let's talk
about your blade right here.

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:51.170
Your edge, while it took
some damage, what's telling

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.132
is on some of the areas
that are not sharp anymore,

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:57.510
it kind of ripped parts of
that particular seat cover.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.512
But overall, it will cut.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.889
Thank you.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.181
Jonathan, your turn.

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:03.016
You ready?

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.894
Let's hope so.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:09.230
[music playing]

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:29.709
All right, Jonathan,
let's talk about your blade.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.210
It is sharp.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.879
From down here all the way
to the [inaudible] tip,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.592
as I'm cutting, it digs
in to this chopper seat.

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.511
This blade, sir, it will cut.

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.639
Thank you.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.307
Ed, it's your turn.
You ready?

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:45.642
Yeah.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.478
[music playing]

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.753
All right, Ed, let's talk
about your knife right here.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.839
Your handle, it
feels comfortable.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.218
That finger weld right
there actually works.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.470
Your blade right
here, despite taking

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.347
some damage in some
areas here, is razor

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.265
sharp on the other parts of it.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.310
It lacerated deep on
the slashes horizontally

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.063
and also vertically.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.024
It will cut.
- Thank you

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:41.698
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is Andy.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.325
Your blade didn't make the cut.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:47.912
Andy, we can really appreciate
your blade-making skills.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:50.915
But in the strength test,
two blades took damage,

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.625
one of them being yours.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.044
And your handle was the least
comfortable among all three.

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.338
For that reason, we're
sending you home.

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:58.339
Totally understand.
