00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to office hours for week 4.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I noticed that Units 3 and 4 were quite abstract.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Will the remaining units in the course be similarly abstract?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That is a good question.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Units 3 and 4 were relatively abstract--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to some degree, intentionally so.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We wanted to cover the basics of grammars, context-free grammars,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
how we might parse them ourselves--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and we taught you a particular algorithm for that in class--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and then how to interface with a tool that uses a similar algorithm

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and then given a context-free grammar and a description of how to build a parse tree

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or an abstract syntax tree puts it all together.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That was difficult material.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And if you thought it seemed a little more abstract than the rest of the course,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
you are absolutely right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And part of that is that we want to challenge you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is a world-class education, and these are the sort of concepts that we would go into

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
at a top-tier university covering these topics.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We want to make sure that you understand languages from the inside out

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and thus that you can manipulate in your mind grammar rules--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the backbones, the essential syntactic constructs of languages.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We want you to know them, how to change them, how to implement them.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That said, the course really does go up and then go back down a bit

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in terms of level of abstraction or difficulty.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In Units 5 and 6, we're going to turn our attention to interpreting parse trees,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
interpreting abstract syntax trees.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What comes next after a parser?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Well, we try to figure out the meaning of a program.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We'll look at interpreting HTML, interpreting JavaScript,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
as well as fun, off-to-the-side software engineering tasks like debugging programs

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and also optimizing them to make them go faster.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I think you'll find that Units 5 and 6 will be significantly more concrete and grounded

00:01:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
than Units 3 and 4 and possibly even a little easier.
