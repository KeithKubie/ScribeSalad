1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,260
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,460
And today we thought we would,
we would tell a lie, right?

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,920
That's we're looking at, we're going at,
we're going to, we're going to, yeah,

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,740
no, I think we should get on with it. Yes.

5
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:17,500
This one comes to us from an
producer, Lulu Miller. All right,

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:18,550
so I'm going to tell you a story.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,000
[inaudible] takes place in Germany who
can talk at an old folks home. Hello.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,300
That's not where we are right now, but,

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,780
and we brought two of the people who
work at the home flow into a studio.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,440
We have to close the door. It sounds
like you're having a party over there.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,040
So the story really belongs to this
guy. Richard knew right there. Yeah.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,340
He's the director of the home,

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,400
which is called Ben Wrath
senior center in Philadelphia.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,420
But we've also brought [inaudible] who
also works at the home and speaks more

15
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:54,620
English. I just held Mr
[inaudible] talked to today.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,440
We do it like this. Yeah. Okay. So
Mr New right there has a problem.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,720
John [inaudible], Lloyd as houseful.
It's a problem. Most nursing homes face.

18
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:06,220
I meant to mention this house, my lesson,

19
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,780
which is that many people
who develop dementia,

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,280
Alzheimer's, they'll become disoriented
and confused and suddenly think,

21
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,140
why am I am? Where am I?

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,160
This is not my world and I
have to go back to my house.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,730
My children are waiting for
me. And usually you know,

24
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:28,720
nurses will intercept them.
Relax, you are living here.

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,700
But occasionally people somehow slip
out the front door. Yeah. Escapes.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,730
They happen. And then they wander.

27
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,650
[inaudible] they had one woman make it
onto a bus and she escaped about how many

28
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:48,690
kilometers she eventually made it
to a town about 20 miles away. Yeah,

29
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,510
they've had people turn up at grocery
stores, wandering in the forest.

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,990
They've even had people make it all the
way back to their old houses and find

31
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,420
new people living there. Yup.

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,270
And for the people who work at the home
says regain Yo yo get crazy not knowing

33
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,010
ways

34
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,450
first. And then where did
she go? Test, test, test,

35
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,380
test. This is something
we all know about you.

36
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,840
Do you guys know I'm working on this
story about the Alzheimer's? Yes.

37
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,430
And while reporting this piece,

38
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:19,430
so I was checking in with my parents
about some stories like this.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,410
What happened to my grandpa. Wow. Wow.

40
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,240
And they told me when I never heard
one morning, this was in February. Yes.

41
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:30,170
This was on a very, very
frigid cold morning.

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,090
My grandpa got up five in the morning,

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,400
left the house and walked
to the train station.

44
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,610
You probably got the earliest tea ticket
all the way up to Cambridge cause he

45
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:40,880
thought he had to teach a class at
Harvard. Did he used to teach at home? No,

46
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:43,790
but he'd given lectures there.
So anyway, that's my pitch.

47
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,900
Dark early in the morning,

48
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,930
frigid Boston weather and he was only
in his long underwear with his coat and

49
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:53,960
hat and scarf on over that
he didn't even have shoes on.

50
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,340
He was just wearing a slipper. He was
picked up by the police because he was,

51
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,740
you know, um, hypothermic.
Yeah, he was hypothermic.

52
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,360
He was hypothermic. I mean his,

53
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,780
when they brought him into the hospital
and his temperature was too low down to

54
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,883
none on that,

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,120
it was the moment when I
knew that, um, you know,

56
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,070
that everything was
going to have to change,

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,590
that he would have to move into a place
that had a floor for people who are set

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,410
for locked floor. That's what it meant.

59
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,483
So

60
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,580
essentially is the problem. Some
people have to to be locked in,

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,800
which just feels cruel.
Yeah. That's horrible. Yeah,

62
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,843
it is.

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,830
And then in walks of fellow
named Mr Google. No, no,

64
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:53,810
no. Good, bad. No. Good,
good. Really awful.

65
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh really? Okay. Try to make
it more like Gerber goodbye.

66
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,860
Yeah. Okay. No good that.

67
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,120
Oh, okay. We'll just like, we'll
just use you saying it. We'll do it.

68
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,420
Your Mr. Mr. Good. Okay.
So Ms [inaudible] good.

69
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,020
It was an older gentleman.

70
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,140
He sat on an advisory board of the
senior center and one day he came up with

71
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:24,620
this idea. Yeah, that's
Richard. No, right there. Again,

72
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,900
I'm at Michelin and it's one of these
ideas that's so out there and yet so

73
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,570
simple that you think it
just couldn't possibly work.

74
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,600
When Mr Gerber came into the office
of the shot and presented his idea,

75
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,980
Chad was just laughing. Ally's come Altius

76
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,790
he thought it's very funny.
What a funny idea. Well,

77
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,860
what is it already? What's the idea? Well,

78
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,890
Mr Google thought that right in front
of the home they should build a bus.

79
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:01,040
Stop the bus stop. What? Build a bust. I,

80
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,880
I don't understand what,
what would that do? Well,

81
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:07,470
think about what a bus stop is.
When you see a bus stop. It's a,

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,260
the first step into the wide
world from the little bus stop,

83
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,910
you get a anywhere. Yeah.

84
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,630
Bergene says that in a lot
of these wandering cases,

85
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,820
the first place people often
head is to a bus stop. Ah,

86
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,760
and so back to our friend Mr Gerber,

87
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,470
he thought what they should do is build
a bus stop right in front of the home

88
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,430
that has just one crucially odd feature.

89
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,850
There's snow bus coming, no bus, never.

90
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,510
It's the best stuff to nowhere.
So his thought was moment,

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,470
it would be a way of catching
people who happened to wander. Okay.

92
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,730
They'd see the bus stop,

93
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:48,390
go and sit on it waiting for a
bus that would never come to.

94
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,470
And then eventually a staff member
could see them and bring them back.

95
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,090
No chief officer. So while Richard's
first thought was, this is ridiculous.

96
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:59,840
Second thought, hmm, maybe not that bad.

97
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,083
Right.

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,680
So they bolted in a bench, made off Iran,

99
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,150
put up the sign in yellow and green, just
like every government issued bus stop.

100
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,010
And when you get out of the
home, you see it immediately

101
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,060
[inaudible]

102
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,550
and the staff as I'm, or does she leave?

103
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,790
Say Richard and Regina just
thought this was a stupid idea. Oh,

104
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,980
it's not appropriate.

105
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:28,270
Or it's even cynical and most of all
that it probably just wouldn't work.

106
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,080
Yeah. And at first it
looked like they were right.

107
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,480
[inaudible] I've also one by
one, the neighbors, you know,

108
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,090
normal people, they said, oh, new bus.
And they waited there for the bus.

109
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,710
And so one by one Richard would have to
run out and explain this. Not for you.

110
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,410
That's fascinating. That sticked his
name. There was this period of adjustment.

111
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,310
Yeah, and then one day and now old lady,

112
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,460
an actual patient from the home.
He started having an episode.

113
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,160
She was very troubled in her mind.

114
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:06,310
She was a little girl and she
needed to get home to her parents.

115
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,420
My mother waits for me. I have
to go home. Her mom very quick.

116
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,200
The nurses talk to her
and try to calm her down,

117
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,230
but she began to cry
so they thought, well,

118
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,590
let's just let her walk out. It
was fall. It was brother cold,

119
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,760
so she went to the best of in her
coat and her head and she said,

120
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,880
they're very patient and
she waited for the bus

121
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,830
in the fresh air, Sun shining

122
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,740
and eventually a nurse came over and
sat with her and they weighted together

123
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,970
side by side.

124
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,590
Eventually she forgot why she was there.

125
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,510
The nurse said,

126
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,090
we go in and have a cup of tea together
and then she came back and everything

127
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,270
was fine. She was relaxed.

128
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,650
She was in the present time,
not longer. In the past time,

129
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,770
it's been two years since the bench
first went up and Richard and regain,

130
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,860
say they use it all the
time, every couple of days.

131
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,160
Sometimes the nurses will take someone
who's upset and wants to go home.

132
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:37,620
The nurses say, let's go to the bus stop,

133
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,340
let's see what we will do
and how we plan the day.

134
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:46,250
And or sometimes the nurses, they don't
see that somebody escaped and they say,

135
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:50,090
Oh way's Mrs. Smith. And then
they look out over the wall.

136
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:53,420
She's waiting for the boss.
Yeah, and somebody go out there.

137
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,040
But one thing is always the
same. When the people get to

138
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,080
the bus stop, the mood is very dark.

139
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm feeling so lonely. I want
to go home and also urgent.

140
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,710
My parents wait from me, my children
wait for me. I have to go there quick,

141
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:08,850
quick, quick. But then

142
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,980
after awhile

143
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,730
as they're sitting there thinking
their escape is on the way,

144
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,460
that urgent feeling disappears.

145
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,780
Did, do you know why or can, I guess,

146
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,510
can you describe it disappearing?

147
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:36,770
Like does it go away
slowly or suddenly be,

148
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:38,010
forget the Denzel's

149
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,780
[inaudible] almost undersigned
where his start and

150
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,140
[inaudible].

151
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,680
It's like another thought comes up
and then you forget what you wanted.

152
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,851
Yeah, no,

153
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:57,470
it's like a fish is coming
up to as a surface of a water

154
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,090
going down again and disappearing

155
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,590
thoughts come up and they disappear.

156
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,930
You don't know that they have
ever been there. Oh yeah.

157
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,860
You'll forget which is, it's interesting.

158
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:23,630
It's the forgetting is both the
problem and the solution. Yeah.

159
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,501
The Lulu,

160
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:29,501
I mean isn't this maybe a little bit
cruel because it is a lie that's happening

161
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:33,020
here. I mean they are lying to these
people. Well, sure. It's definitely a lie.

162
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,590
There's no way around that, but
what's the alternative? I mean,

163
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:40,970
take that woman at the bus stop.
What are you supposed to say to her?

164
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,610
I know that you're
utterly convinced of this,

165
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,630
but actually you're not a little
girl. You live in a nursing home.

166
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,010
As you can imagine, these kinds of
conversations don't go well. No.

167
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,290
They say sometimes they have to
restrain the people, hold them back,

168
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,120
call the police. They don't accept
it because it's not their world.

169
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,840
It's two completely different
world. And so they say,

170
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,320
why not just allow that other world to
be true for just a beat and then gently

171
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,210
coax them back beds.

172
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,270
The aim of the whole thing to lead
those memories very gently into this.

173
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Now this today and this idea has
sort of spread at the nursing home.

174
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,780
It changed the atmosphere in the home.

175
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:35,730
Now they try to do this sort of
time shifting in all different ways.

176
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:39,390
Sounds a little bit complicated,
but it isn't. Like for example,

177
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,990
they had this guy who's a baker who was
used to want to get up at two o'clock in

178
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:46,160
the morning and they used to say, no,
you know, go back, go back to bed. We're,

179
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:50,010
we're working. Yeah. But now they just
say, okay. And they let them get up

180
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,470
at two o'clock they take him the
kitchen and let him bake a van. He says,

181
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:56,891
well,

182
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:01,891
I'm always in time and I'm proud
I never miss an hour of mine.

183
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,890
And the interesting part for me is
that I think about my grandpa wandering

184
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,420
through the cold and his slippers,

185
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,650
and here's this way in which people can
be somewhat lost in their memories and

186
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:21,730
yet exist in the present, safely, safely

187
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,550
separate. It's

188
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,850
removing Miller with the music choice.

189
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:37,970
