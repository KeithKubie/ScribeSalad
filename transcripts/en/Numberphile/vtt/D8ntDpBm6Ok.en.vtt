00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
MATT: Okay, so we're going to look
at a sequence of numbers,

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.340
and it's not going to be this one,
which is where I start with a 1,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.920
and then, for no obviously
explained reason, another 1,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.340
and then I feel the need
to add them together,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.320
which gives me a 2.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.400
If I add the last two terms together,
I get a 3.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.580
If I add those together,
I get a 5, I get an 8, and so on,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.380
and most people will recognize these as 
our friends, the Fibonacci numbers,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.500
and they're famous for a number of reasons.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.800
In fact,—
Oh, well, Brady,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.140
do you know why, why people
get so excited about these numbers?

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.780
I mean, you've talked to many
people, I imagine, over the years.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.980
BRADY: It's because of sunflowers

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.640
MATT: Because of sunflowers, yes,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.420
or pineapples, or petals

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.300
and, so yes, often things in nature

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.060
occur in numbers,
and some of those numbers

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.480
are in this list.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.940
The other big one,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.220
and people almost take Fibonacci
to be synonymous with this,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.600
is the golden ratio,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.200
and people will switch between saying
"Fibonacci numbers"/"golden ratio"

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.600
and I think it's time
we stop doing that.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.260
I'm here to tell you that the
Fibonacci numbers are terrible,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
and they have very little
to do with the golden ratio.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.900
In fact, there's a much
better sequence of numbers

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.160
which we should use
instead of Fibonacci

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.000
when it comes to
the golden ratio.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.680
But first, we'll establish what we're
making fun of before we tear it apart.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.720
So the reason we like Fibonacci
numbers linking to the golden ratio

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.920
so if you take the ratio
of two of the terms,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.600
so the last one here I've got is 34,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.200
take the ratio of 34 with 21,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.480
so if I do 34 divided by 21

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.020
it equals 1.6190…,
so it's close.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.200
And so these terms approach
the ratio of the golden ratio.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.520
If I kept writing these numbers,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
If I carried on, and, you know, let's—

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.820
I don't know how much space
you've got on your camera,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.920
if we did this for two,
maybe three years,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.620
the numbers would be closer
and closer to the golden ratio,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.140
and the limit they're approaching
is the golden ratio.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.580
They'll never reach it, but if you do it for
infinitely many terms

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.080
in the Fibonacci sequence,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.480
the ratio is the golden ratio.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.840
It is a lovely link.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.280
The trouble is the Fibonacci sequence
is not the only one that does this.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.660
So, in fact, we're going to try another one
entirely at random.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.080
So can you give me, Brady, 
instead of starting 1, 1,…

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.900
can you give me a number in 
the thousands, four digits,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.800
What would you like?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.040
BRADY: Uh, 2308.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.040
MATT: 2308, and another number.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.380
BRADY: 4261

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.380
MATT: Okay, so there's our two random numbers.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.480
You got 2308, and you got 4261.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.280
So instead of starting 1, 1,
and adding those to get 2,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.940
I'm going to start 2308,
second term will be 4261,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.320
the next term
will be 6569,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.160
the then next term,
I'm going to cheat,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.680
and if I start using a calculator,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.120
if I add these up…

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.000
10,830…

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.560
45,628— I'll do a few of these,
and you can zip through, obviously.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.020
BRADY: So is this the Brady sequence?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.600
MATT: This is the Brady sequence!
We're going to call these the Brady numbers.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.580
So as we go down, I'm  —
you've got your very—

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.180
Am I the first person who has
given you your own numbers?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.480
BRADY: Is this going to get on the Online Encyclopedia—
MATT: I find that hard—

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.880
MATT: This will be in the Online
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.260
I guarantee you, someone
will put the Brady sequence up,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.300
and there's not even a Matt sequence,
which I find hugely offensive.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.800
So these are getting big.
Should we go until we get just past a million?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.460
Let's do that.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.040
Okay, so let's stop there:
1,325,165.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.520
BRADY: That's the lowest
seven-digit Brady number!

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.600
MATT: That is the first
seven-digit Brady number!

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.960
So now we've got this
list of the Brady numbers,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.480
Shall we see,
I mean the Fibonacci numbers,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.540
they have ϕ (phi) as their ratio,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.080
shall we see what the Brady numbers have?

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.260
Okay, so we start with the last one here,
1,325,165…

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.460
divided by the one before it,
so I'm doing the ratio of these two here,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.200
divided by 818,996…

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.020
equals 1.6180359,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:16.300
and the golden ratio is
1.6180339, and so on, right?

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.240
So, the ratio of the Brady numbers,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.840
How many have I done?
You started with two…

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.360
So let's count those. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten…

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.980
…eleven, twelve, thirteen…
the fourteenth.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.700
We only got to the fourteenth
Brady number,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.040
and look how many decimal places
it matches the golden ratio.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.820
It's because,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.340
I mean, I don't want to say it's not because
the Brady numbers are special,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.820
because obviously they are,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.100
but on top of that,
it works for any sequence.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.340
If you start any sequence where you add
the two previous terms to get the next term,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.700
you will always
approach the golden ratio.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.140
So it's not just Fibonacci, it's any sequence
whatsoever, that you come across,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.140
and we can prove that.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.480
MATT: What letter would you like, Brady?
Any Greek letter? Do you have a favorite?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.460
BRADY: Uh… Delta?

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.520
MATT: Delta
