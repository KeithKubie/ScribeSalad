00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's do a pomaceous thought experiment to find out

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
whether the motion of an apple really is somehow similar to the motion of a moon

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and if an attractive force could actually somehow produce a circular orbit.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Since this is such a cool experiment, our experimenter gets a suitably cool haircut.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
First, she's going to drop the apple.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, we all know what's going to happen. It's going to fall to the ground.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now let's say she throws the apple with some initial velocity--V₀.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, we learned in the last unit exactly how to quantify this motion.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The apple will follow some trajectory like this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now let's say she throws the apple with a velocity of 2V₀.

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which trajectory best describes the path the apple will take?
