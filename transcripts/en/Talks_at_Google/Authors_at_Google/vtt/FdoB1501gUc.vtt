RACHEL O'MEARA: I am
really excited to introduce

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.990
our speaker today.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.520
I'm Rachel O'Meara.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.160
And I'm in San Francisco
Google, and we're here today

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.489
with author Holly Payne.

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.280
Holly Payne is a very
special person to me,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.470
too because she's
also my writing coach,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.845
so I work with
her quite closely.

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:19.280
I'm really excited to
have her here today

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.440
to talk about technology of
the heart and her latest book,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.890
her fourth book, "Damascena."

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.800
So a little bit about Holly
before we get started.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.920
So the book itself
is a story that

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.600
demonstrates the power of the
ancient practices that first

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.950
identify the technology
of the heart and hence,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.810
that's what we're going
to be talking about.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.450
We're going to explore the
fascinating information

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.560
centers in the
heart and how they

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.990
can be utilized to optimize
communication, and even

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.500
create magic in the
workplace and beyond,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.540
no matter where you work.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.500
So Holly is an international
published author,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.070
writing coach, and founder
of Skywriter Books,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.380
an award winning
independent press.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.530
As I said, she's written
four novels novels.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.560
Her latest book is "Damascena:
The Tale of Roses and Rumi."

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.970
It's a mystical thriller
about the wisdom of the heart.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.560
She has served on the faculty of
the Academy of Art University,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.180
California College of
the Arts, and Stanford.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.527
So please welcome Holly Payne.

00:01:18.527 --> 00:01:22.006
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:24.770
HOLLY PAYNE: Thanks so much
for being here today, Google

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.530
and for having me.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.720
I was really excited to be in
front of a different audience

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.110
as a storyteller.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.060
I'm usually talking to readers
at bookstores or in book clubs

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.220
and talking about
the writing process.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.600
So I'm very excited that
this audience actually

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200
inspired me to really
think outside the box

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.220
and think of how technology has
affected me as a storyteller

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.710
essentially as Google as
affected me as a storyteller.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380
Google has been the go to.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.460
I couldn't have done this
presentation without Google.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.810
And so thank you for
giving me the opportunity

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.860
to do something I've
never done before.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.840
So this is a work in progress.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.500
And I'm definitely open
to feedback afterward

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.240
in terms of the
experiment of what

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.230
I'm about to present today.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.770
I was thinking a lot about--
on the ride over here

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.400
today --just having a moment
to really introduce to you why

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.830
technology of the heart, why
the subject matter especially

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.620
with the novelist
and I'm literally

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.860
standing in front of you
because of a particular affinity

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.110
for technology inside my body.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.790
I have a foot long
titanium plate

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.240
in my femur and
10 titanium screws

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.420
and they've been in
my body for 20 years.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.750
And so I literally am mobilized
because of technology.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.410
And when it comes to the
technology of the heart, one

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.190
of the ways that I
write and actually

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.130
one of the ways
that I can write is

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.940
if I have an idea that's going
to come to me as a storyteller

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.330
and it's coming
to my brain first,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.720
I always have to ask questions
and know that that's probably

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.150
not the best place
for it to come from.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.030
I was asked the other day
where does the writing process

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.510
start for you, and
I said it starts

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.110
when there's an anvil that
kind of drops onto my heart.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.150
And I actually have
to write my way out

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.650
from underneath that weight.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.555
And so that is the beginning of
this introduction to technology

00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:27.080
of the heart, that
my heart is literally

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.380
the guide to my
career, and without it,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.340
I question everything.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.500
So I'm going to tell
you a little bit-- we're

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.250
going to do a little
time traveling today.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.130
I'm going to read a few short
excerpts from "Damascena,"

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.960
and I want to bring
it kind of full circle

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.490
into the technology
of the heart and I'm

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.700
going to ask you right now to
go with me to Konya, Turkey.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.560
How many people here have
actually been to Turkey?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.620
A few-- wow --of course
a Google audience,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.450
international audience.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.449
When I was-- many
years ago I was

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.740
doing research for my first
novel, "The Virgin's Knot,"

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.090
and I ended up in Konya,
Turkey doing research

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.850
with a rug merchant
and his family

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.886
and I ended up here at
the Whirling Dervish

00:04:06.886 --> 00:04:08.260
Lodge at the
[? Teki, ?] which is

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.600
the monastery in Konya, Turkey.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.380
And I ended up at Rumi's tomb,
having absolutely no idea

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.680
who this person Rumi was.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.885
And I see some glimmer in
the eyes of some of you.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.400
You can imagine what
it would be like to be

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.090
at the tomb of this
amazing human being whose

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.290
poetry probably is unparalleled
in terms of how much he was

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.860
able to create in his
lifetime, 27,500 poems.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.670
I'll never get there
in my lifetime.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.680
So it was here that I started
to receive information

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.710
to write this book.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.890
In the story
"Damascena" is a story

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.940
of an orphan girl who ends
up receiving a transmission

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.320
to turn roses into
rose oil and she's

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.800
mistaken as a saint for
performing miracles.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.080
She wants nothing to
do with this gift,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.620
and she's sent on a
mission to meet Rumi.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.420
And in this relationship
that she has with Rumi,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.390
he initiates her
into this dance,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.740
into the Whirling Dervish dance.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.610
And the Whirling
Dervishes, I don't

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.800
know if anyone here
has actually seen them.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.470
They come to the Bay
Area quite frequently,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.770
I think once a year
at least, and this

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.350
is a dance that is all
about turning inward.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.730
So it's a dance that goes
on for at least an hour

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.270
with these dancers that are
literally turning in circles.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.960
So the idea of a dervish, you're
wondering what is a dervish.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.854
I'm sure we've all felt like
dervishes at some point,

00:05:39.854 --> 00:05:40.770
spinning and spinning.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.840
And in terms of
what the technology

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.790
of this dance, the
dervish is actually one

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.760
that is standing
on the threshold.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.830
That's the actual
translation of a dervish

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.820
and that threshold is meant
to be the threshold of change

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.400
and deep transformation.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.520
So this dance is an
opportunity for these people

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.580
to turn inward toward something.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.550
And that something that they're
turning toward is the heart.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.342
And when we talk about
in everyday basis,

00:06:10.342 --> 00:06:11.550
we hear this in our language.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.560
And we've been aware of
ever since we've been a kid,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.360
you know listen to your heart.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.000
What is it that we're
listening to in our hearts

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.720
when people ask that question?

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.640
Who's doing the
listening, right?

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.830
So I'm going to unpack
that a little bit here.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.940
I'm also going to read
you one little excerpt so

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.730
that you can actually see in
your mind what this dance is.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.710
This is the first time
this girl's actually

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.950
experienced
witnessing the dance.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.766
And it's very odd to
her to see someone

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:42.890
turning around in a circle.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.681
And the person that's
turning in the circle

00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:47.500
is Shams-- and Shams is
at this point in this book

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.110
a very, very old man
and Shams of Tabriz

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.080
was Rumi's most lauded
spiritual companion and probably

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.350
the inspiration for the
majority of those 27,500 poems.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.670
And so this is
what it looks like.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.290
"She's watching him
from this little house.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.970
She moved to the
front window seeing

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.620
the flicker of a small flame
burning in the fireplace

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.430
in the hooded shadow of Shams's
twirling about the floor

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.510
with his head tilted up.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.500
Her first instinct
was to giggle.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.030
She did not know the
old man could dance.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.710
He had complained
about his feet aching,

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.210
but nothing about his
movement suggested pain.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.090
Shams wore an odd cone-shaped
hat look like an upside

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.750
down flower pot.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.030
He moved in circles,
arms outstretched,

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.880
mouth slightly open as he
drew in breath after breath,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.200
chanting words that
Damascena had never heard

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.260
and could not understand.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.740
A confluence of accents
and vowels and rhythms

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.350
that sounded much
like a waterfall.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.250
She liked the cleansing
calming effect

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.700
even if she had no idea
what the man was saying

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.130
between the thunder
and the rain."

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.390
And this is an actual
poem from Rumi.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.630
" 'There is no salvation for
the soul but to fall in love.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.180
It has to creep and crawl
among the lovers first.' Shams

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.990
repeated the verses over
and over, faster and faster,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.090
gaining speed in his twirling.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.420
His left foot was clenched
with a nail, wedged

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.020
between his big toe and
the one after that, which

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.490
seemed to keep him in place
while he spun in a circle.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.310
He reminded Damascena of
a little spinning top.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.675
And she was surprised he did
not topple over or collapse

00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:22.290
from dizziness.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.240
Watching him spin
soothed her in a way

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.290
she had not felt
in a long time."

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.260
So one of the things that you're
hearing in this little passage

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.730
is this idea that it's
a deep intake of breath.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.470
So this dance is
coming from that place.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.280
It's a place-- it's a turning
inward toward the self

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.520
and it's a turning
inward, and the irony

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.630
is it's a turning and
a turning and a turning

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.450
to actually
experience stillness.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.580
So when we talk
about this breath--

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.710
and we're getting to the
technology of the heart

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.040
here --everything
starts with the breath.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.770
It's about an intake
of breath, and when

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.970
I talk about this
technology of the heart,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.080
it's actually all
about something

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.640
that you all are aware of.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.170
And this is about coherence.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.640
It's about heart coherence.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.670
And it's not a
cognitive coherence.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.090
This is literally about
a coherent heart rhythm.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.520
And there's an institute
here in the Bay Area

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.220
called the Institute
of HeartMath.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.510
And it was started by Doc
Childre and Rollin McCraty

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.930
several years ago, and they've
actually done research now

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.120
about how heart rhythms
affect our ability to think.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.770
And when you attain a particular
level of coherent heart

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.890
rhythms-- and the
higher the amplitude,

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.740
the better it is-- the
more focus you have,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.930
the less stress you have and
the more aligned you are.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.910
So when I saw this,
I thought that this

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.200
is what this dance is.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.170
These Sufis were completely
dialed in to this technology

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.150
without calling it technology.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.600
It was something rooted
in an ancient practice

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.520
that the body was
aware of that it

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.960
needed to do to actually
come into the stillness.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.100
So being a wordsmith, I can't
help but look at this word.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.330
Look at-- it's a
nine letter word.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.400
And the wild thing about
nine is that this dance

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.770
is supposed to represent
the turning of the universe

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.400
and the cosmos, as we are
turning with it every day.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.320
And so there's nine
letters in coherence.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.387
And there's nine dancers
that actually do the dance.

00:10:24.387 --> 00:10:26.220
When you actually see
the whirling dervishes

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.280
dance in a group, it's
only nine dancers.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.590
So they're there to represent
that turning of the universe.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.470
And if you actually
break the word apart,

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.990
there's a word "her"
and "hear" and "co."

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.230
And to me, this is a
dialogue between the heart

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.070
and the brain.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.180
It's a dialogue between, in
terms of the physiology of it,

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.730
the intake of breath and the
listening for the inspiration

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.910
and intuition.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.650
So clearly, if there's
an opportunity for you

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.750
to increase your
heart coherence--

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.390
and you literally can tap
into this in terms of getting

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.060
hooked up to an EKG.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.941
And they can actually know
if you have coherent heart

00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:09.440
rhythms.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.590
I'll show you a
little bit in the top

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:16.690
later what it looks like to have
incoherent heart rate or heart

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.290
waves.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:23.430
So this whole idea in terms
of turning and grounding

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.230
into yourself in order
to listen, when it gets

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.960
back to listen to
your heart what

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.000
is it that we're
actually listening to.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.190
So these Sufis
clearly were pretty

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.310
sophisticated in understanding
what this particular dance

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.600
could do and how transformative
it could be for people.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.470
And this is what Rollin
McCraty in his research--

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.030
he's given me permission
today to use his research.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.910
But clearly, here
is the coherence.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.860
And the co, it's the
collaborative experience

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.470
between this energetic
alignment and cooperation

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.150
between the heart and
mind, body and spirit.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.730
It's pretty phenomenal in terms
of what these people could

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.250
achieve just by doing a dance.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.000
But how do you do the dance
without doing the dance?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.760
So William Blake, at the
time that this was actually

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.220
starting to be recognized that
the heart was more than just

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.220
an organ-- this was in
the late 19th century.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.167
And William Blake,
he was talking

00:12:23.167 --> 00:12:24.750
about this in this
quote here and he's

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.290
saying "Man's
perceptions are not

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.720
bounded by organs of
perception (the brain).

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.290
He perceives far more than
sense (though ever so acute)

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.520
can discover."

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.600
And I'm going to substitute
the word discover to detect.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.590
So when William Blake
is talking about this,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.040
I think that what he's
actually talking about,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.450
what's outside of the
brain is this inspiration.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.500
Where does the
inspiration come from?

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.340
Where does actual
innovation come from?

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.100
The brain is certainly
a part of it,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.190
but is there a dance between
these things of inspiration

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.612
and intuition that actually
create the innovation?

00:13:03.612 --> 00:13:05.070
And you of all
people probably know

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.130
that more than most, right?

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.800
Doctor McCraty has been able
to show us through his research

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.800
that there's actually an
incredible heart intelligence.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.980
And that the heart is actually
an incredible sophisticated

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.720
information encoding
and processing

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.120
center, otherwise
known as a heart brain.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.480
So the idea, again, listen
to your heart, right?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.597
What's happening there?

00:13:31.597 --> 00:13:33.180
Where are we getting
this information?

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.450
What I love about his
research-- and this always blows

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.850
me away --is that the heart--
what they've discovered

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.620
--is the heart actually
has-- generates the largest

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.140
electromagnetic field
in the whole human body.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.220
And it's waves-- the
amplitude of these waves

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.280
are 60 times greater
than that of the brain.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.950
And the entire magnetic
component of it

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:05.370
is 5,000 times greater
than that of the brain.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.990
Is that pretty unbelievable?

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:12.526
So where we dismiss the
heart as just an organ that's

00:14:12.526 --> 00:14:13.900
pumping blood
through us, there's

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.760
something else that's happening.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.000
The story of this girl,
this little girl Damascena,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.060
who's an orphan, she is
raised by a tyrannical monk

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.520
in this monastery.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.070
And from the beginning, her
mother is sending her love,

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.612
telling her but she
loves her, trying

00:14:32.612 --> 00:14:33.903
to get through and communicate.

00:14:33.903 --> 00:14:35.340
But this tyrannical
monk will not

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.780
let the communication
be relayed,

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.660
and he completely
thwarts any attempt

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.840
the mother has to
meet up with the girl.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.750
So the girl grows up sensing
her mom, how is that happening?

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.900
How is it that we can be
across the world from someone

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.270
and think about them, maybe
not thinking from here

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.470
but thinking from a lower
place, dropping into our heart.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.080
How many of you have had this
experience where you actually

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.190
drop into the heart and
you think about someone

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.200
you hear-- they email
you the next day.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.030
Or they leave you a text
message, or they call.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.230
What's happening?

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.910
What's happening in
that moment, right?

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.720
How is that information
being transmitted?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.670
So this is an incredible space
that you have an opportunity

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:24.350
to tap into even here
in a work situation.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.650
The best thing about
this is that when

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.030
you're engaged with this
technology of the heart

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.500
and you're actually coming into
coherent heart rate-- wave,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.970
so you're basically raising that
amplitude of the heart waves,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.430
you're actually creating
more energy for yourself

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.390
on any given moment.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.720
I don't know about you,
but given all the things

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.280
we have to do every
day in our lives,

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.040
I definitely want to
increase my energy,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.990
I want to decrease my stress.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.680
So that means that
I need to understand

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.040
how to come into coherent
heart waves, heart rhythms.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.330
Bring it on.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.760
Although I don't know if I need
to dance in a circle to do it.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.680
So I'm going to read one other
short excerpt of Damascena

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.089
coming into this balance in
her body through the dance.

00:16:11.089 --> 00:16:12.630
Through this technology
of the heart,

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.860
of the Sufis
turning and turning.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.200
"Night after night
she spun and spun

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.460
and her whole body pulsed with
an energy she had never known.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.060
She felt uplifted,
as if she were not

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.220
just remaining in a fixed place,
but traveling with each turn.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.630
She saw flashes of pearly light,
odd colorful forms she cannot

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:36.190
identify, rainbow prisms,
shards of moonlight.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.220
She felt [? Daniz--" ?]

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.940
This dervish who's teaching
her-- he's her contemporary,

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.490
there's a little bit of spark
between them "--watching her

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.260
closely in the dark.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.380
He kept the rhythm each
night by whispering "hoos"

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.970
so much that she started to
call him owl by [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.640
He acted hurt, but his teeth
lit up the room when he smiled.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.490
'I'm no more an owl than you are
a rose trying to will yourself

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.150
to bloom,' he teased, 'but
speed will not deliver you from

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.319
what's holding you back.'
'And what is that?' she asked,

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.400
meeting his eyes in the
light coming into the window.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.040
It was the second
full moon since they

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.010
begun her training--"

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.551
And by the way girls
are not supposed

00:17:11.551 --> 00:17:14.900
to be doing this dance at
all-- totally forbidden.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.810
[? "--Daniz ?] paused
sensing her challenge,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.670
then walked closer
and leaned into her,

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.770
smelling the sweat on her neck.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.460
'Fear,' he said.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.911
'Of what?' 'Love,' he
said and swallowed.

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.369
'Well what do you
know of love' she

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.850
asked and studied his throat.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.850
'It is yours to claim.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.290
Do you know why we open our
vest with our right hand after

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.990
the last turn of this dance?'
'Why?' 'To let the world

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.840
into our heart.' She leaned
away from him uncertain she had

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.740
the strength to do that when
she had not yet let her mother

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.860
dwell there.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.500
She caught his eye before
she began to spin again."

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.700
So one of the things
that she's coming

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.627
into in this process--
this is an unfolding,

00:17:54.627 --> 00:17:55.710
this is a journey for her.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.350
The dance is just
the metaphor for her

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.300
to actually open up her
heart and claim what's

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.380
always been around her.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.524
So I love this picture
because it really

00:18:05.524 --> 00:18:06.940
is the way that
we should probably

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.430
start shifting our thinking
around the heart and the brain.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.840
And literally giving
the heart a little

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.590
bit higher valuation
than the brain.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.640
And you'll see in just a
moment how that actually

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.030
is now being quantified.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.530
But we have the opportunity--
Dr.Dominique Surel actually

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.420
studies intuitive intelligence,
and she wrote a paper.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.810
She's actually worked with
the HeartMath Institute.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.770
And I love what she
says about this.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:38.450
It's giving us this incredible
access to untapped potential.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.440
And being people here
that work at Google,

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.560
I think you're all about
getting into and tapping

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.840
into that untapped potential.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.830
This is like the incubator
of untapped potential.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.530
I mean this is the place--
the world is literally

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.380
looking at Google as
an innovator in terms

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.650
of untapped potential.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.870
What can poss--
what can be, right?

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.470
No limitations.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.610
So as far as I know,
there's been no limitations.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.940
A driverless car, right?

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.010
So I don't know about
you, but I would

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.460
love to have greater balance
and self-directed control.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.580
And if it meant that it was
all a matter of my heart

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.285
actually more than my
brain, I want to start.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.010
So the idea behind this,
there's a couple techniques,

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.050
and I'm going to share just one
very, very simple one, a tool

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.400
with you today.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.770
We all know about this energy
flows where intention goes.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.950
And one of the things in terms
of getting heart coherence

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:44.020
in raising those heart
waves is not just

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.337
about thinking about it.

00:19:45.337 --> 00:19:47.420
This whole dance, and the
whole point of the dance

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.710
is literally, the dance
is about losing your mind.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.180
And the Sufi dance
is called Sama

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.100
and it actually translates
in Persian into listening.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.270
So the dance itself
means listening.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.410
So when we say
listen to your heart,

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.530
this was a dance that
actually allowed people

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.240
to listen to their heart.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.740
And deeper than that, what is
it that we're listening for?

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.090
Are we actually
listening for words?

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.720
Are we listening for, lack
of a better word, a feeling?

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.720
Are we listening for something
that we actually tangibly

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.920
can feel.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.330
So the idea in terms of how
do we actually engage this

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.300
and what's one of the most
basic simple tools of technology

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.530
of heart?

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.900
It's not about faking our
way, it's dropping our mind

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.390
and coming into a deep
place inside ourselves.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.970
This is one
opportunity to do it.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.250
Appreciation is one
of those methods.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.250
We've all heard about it.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.250
A lot of you here have
been studying breath work

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.180
and you have this search inside
yourself program at Google.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.844
This is a really
progressive audience

00:20:50.844 --> 00:20:52.760
in terms of what you
already are understanding

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.600
about the interplay between
the physiology of the body,

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.830
the alignment of the mind
and the spirit and the body.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.230
But when you actually
look at appreciation--

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.490
and again I can't help but look
at the word in terms of there's

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.050
an app in there
--and why do we not

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.260
have any apps that actually
help us to engage our hearts.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.550
We have so many apps are
about engaging our minds.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.360
And if there's so much untapped
potential in our hearts

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.440
and its magnetic field
is 5,000 times greater

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.980
than that of the brain,
there's your next project.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.490
How can we tap into this?

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.690
So I'm going to invite you right
now to experience something,

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.420
it'll be a little experiment.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.170
So you can either keep
your eyes closed or open

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:45.350
and I want you to just take a
deep breath, and let it all go.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.750
I need to do that myself.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:52.730
And take one more
deep breath, and let

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.590
it go out of your mouth,
wherever you need to let it go.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:59.820
And I want you to think
of a person in your life

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.300
right now who you have
a deep gratitude for

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.540
and a deep appreciation for
what's something they're

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.330
teaching you, something
they're showing you, something

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.940
they're giving you,
or just who they are,

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.300
how they show up in the world.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.880
Maybe it's someone here at work.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.390
And I want you to
pretend-- I want

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.380
you to bring a viewing
screen in front of you.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.680
And I want you to see
their faces, their face.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.290
And if you can, look right
into in their eye, their eyes.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.340
And I want you to direct
a communication, not

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.870
from your head, but to direct
it literally from your heart,

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.240
from the center of your chest.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:50.040
Send them a message of deep
appreciation or gratitude.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.280
And see them
smiling back at you.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:03.100
And take one more deep breath.

00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:11.920
And let it go, just ground
that image and that experience.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.565
And when you're ready,
you can open up your eyes.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:24.320
Did you feel even just this most
subtle shift in your own state?

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.190
I could feel it in the room.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.990
It's an amazing slowing down.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.880
It's an incredible slowing
down and a quietude inside.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.920
And that took
probably 30 seconds.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.610
I didn't time it.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.890
It's so basic, right?

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.790
This is an amazing
directed, consciously

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.240
directed communication
from your heart.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.320
And the experience of that
when you're in someone's field

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.450
literally, that can just
shift things right here,

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.530
even in a work environment.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:05.840
And I'm always curious
why it hasn't been valued.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.060
People aren't talking
about bringing the heart

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.920
into communications in
the business world yet.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.360
But now all you have seen
some evidence, not a whole lot

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.200
here, but some evidence that
this heartfelt communication

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.470
is the source of a
whole lot of information

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.470
that can only actually
contribute to your well being.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.130
So I wanted to show
you what it looks

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:36.470
like when your brain, the
opposite of what you just did.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.940
What you just did, you got
into feeling these very, very

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.670
positive emotions.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:42.770
You actually felt it.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.790
You can't think appreciation.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.865
You can't think gratitude.

00:24:46.865 --> 00:24:48.740
You all know when people
are being insincere,

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.630
when they're trying to
express the gratitude

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.350
and it doesn't feel,
you're not feeling it.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.370
It's not literally
heartfelt, right?

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.610
We say that it's heartfelt.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.530
That's where that authenticity.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.250
And when it's coming
from that place

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.140
and it's a true
heartfelt experience,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.330
everyone benefits from it.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.200
Everyone in your field
benefits from it.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.930
So this is how the
heart activity actually

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.660
affects our ability to
think and vice versa.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.100
So you can look at it as
this two way dialogue.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.630
Again, that's always going on
between the brain in the heart.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.550
So any time you're
feeling stressed,

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.400
look at this incredibly
incoherent heart

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.530
rate, those heart waves.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.240
So any feelings that
are not actually

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.900
bringing you
grounding or alignment

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.410
are going to throw off
that heart coherence.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.080
And as a result,
it's actually going

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.350
to affect your ability to think.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.380
You're not going to
be focused, you're

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.630
going to be more stressed out.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.810
But when you go into that place
and 30 seconds, 30 seconds

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.350
you completely
shifted your thinking.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.210
You slowed down.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.060
And you got to
experience something

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.820
coming from here
versus always up here.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.240
And it's amazing and powerful.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.840
And I'm curious who it is that
you brought into that viewing

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.780
screen.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.770
Just going to check in your
text messages later on today.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.220
You'll have to let me
know-- or your emails.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:21.940
So this is a brain engaged in
just normal thought patterns.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.220
And when we're just kind
of not really having

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.020
a moment of directed, of
conscious communication,

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.520
whether it's our
heart or our heads,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.760
this is what the
brain looks like.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.670
But when you actually go
into appreciation-- and this

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:35.920
is that basic simple.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.420
And the HeartMath Institute
teaches these techniques.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.580
Look what happens to the brain.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.850
There's a 15% increase in
the activity of the brain.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.270
So why?

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.110
And that's what just happened.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.550
You just got smarter by
doing some appreciation.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:54.620
Things turned on
inside your brain

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.616
because you took 30
seconds to appreciate.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.540
Pretty wild.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:07.610
So why would we not bring
this into the workplace?

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.260
Think of how much
you could get done

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.440
and how much more efficient you
could be on a day-to-day basis

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.090
with your team, boss, whoever
it is that you're working with,

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.200
when you could actually
engage in this way

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.850
and feel safe about it
because it was valued.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.430
So Dr. Surel-- when I
found this picture I

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.909
couldn't believe it because
it was so perfect in terms

00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:31.450
of what she's actually
talking about.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.270
That the heart is so much
more than just an organ

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.920
pumping blood.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.060
She basically is saying that the
heart and cardiovascular system

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:44.080
are sending far more
signals to the brain

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.170
than the brain
sending to the heart.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.780
And if you look at this,
another way to look at it

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.300
is if there's a scale.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.330
Here's the brain up here
and here's the heart.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.040
So the heart is the heavyweight.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.630
60 times higher amplitude than
brain waves and 5,000 times

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.540
the magnetic field.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.150
And we talked about this
just a couple seconds ago

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:10.550
in terms of the actual
benefits of heart centered

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:15.980
appreciation, so it's very
much the same as coherence.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.870
Clearly, it's going to
be beneficial to everyone

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.730
to engage in this without
dancing in a circle.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.170
So Rollin McCraty was
talking about when

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.110
people are engaged in
this deep conversation.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.960
And to me this turning
inward, the dance

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.820
itself of the dervishes
is about getting

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.300
into a deep conversation
with yourself.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.550
Closing down all the
channels of chatter

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.190
and listening to that thing.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.440
And that thing is this
encoding and processing center

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.460
called the heart brain is
giving you so much information.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:54.240
And how many times has
your heart being wrong?

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.700
It might have been crushed a
couple times, I know mine has.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.790
But how many times has
my heart ever been wrong?

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.210
Never once.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:04.490
So Malcolm Gladwell
in "Blink" was

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.760
talking about this, that hit
right away, that intuition.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.740
So the intuition is
all being informed

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.850
it's a communication between
the heart and the brain.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.450
And so when we have those
first instincts, when

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.660
you have that instinct
about someone you hired,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.600
or someone you're about to
date, or whatever it is,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.060
have they ever been wrong?

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:32.250
But the voice is so subtle, we
just don't pay attention to it.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.460
And I don't think that
voice will ever get louder.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.370
You know why?

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.170
Because it's a mechanism
for us to clear out

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.470
the chatter and the
volume of our everyday

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:45.270
lives and actually go into a
place of quietude to listen.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.690
And there's many ways to do it.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:52.530
The dervishes did it by twirling
in a circle for an hour or so.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:54.465
What's your way,
what's your technology

00:29:54.465 --> 00:29:56.410
of the heart to get
there to listen?

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.330
So that you can start
really accessing

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.640
that amazing information
that's coming,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.776
that's actually only
and always going

00:30:04.776 --> 00:30:05.900
to benefit your well being.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.100
You can never go wrong.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:07.880
That's the thing.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.055
Our heads, we can definitely
go wrong, as we all know.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.230
What this can do
in the workplace,

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.570
this subtle dance that
you're getting into,

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.960
is a very generative and
collaborative experience

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.961
with people, versus
a competitive one.

00:30:23.961 --> 00:30:25.960
The competitive discourse--
how does it actually

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.290
feel to be in a
competitive discourse?

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.490
You actually feel-- and
you know the saying,

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.110
someone's brought you down,
or someone's bringing you up?

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.787
If you think about that down
and up, the heart waves.

00:30:38.787 --> 00:30:40.370
When someone's
bringing you up, you've

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.580
actually come into a place
of higher heart coherence.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.390
When someone's
bringing you down,

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:50.180
you're going into an erratic,
incoherent heart rhythm.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.250
So all of these phrases
of language and speech

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.190
are always telling us exactly
what we already probably know.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.730
So how untrained are
you and your team?

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:08.920
And what one action can you take
today on this first day of fall

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.580
that you can direct
from your heart

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.121
a thought that you can direct
from your heart that could even

00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:15.670
make this most subtle shift.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.412
Maybe someone's
been irritating you

00:31:17.412 --> 00:31:18.870
and you have a
moment were you come

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.290
into an appreciation with them.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.620
It's 30 seconds, it's
private, it's silent,

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.160
and just see what happens.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.320
Curious.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.360
So one of the things
I want to point out

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.697
in terms of these Sufis and what
they were doing with this dance

00:31:34.697 --> 00:31:36.280
and what they were
already dialed into

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.570
and how this relates to the
HeartMath Institute's research.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:42.290
If you see the dance,
you will always

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:44.590
notice that the left
hand is pointed down

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.420
and the right hand is
always pointing up.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.790
So for the Sufis, they're always
reaching out for something.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:53.260
And one of the things that
the HeartMath Institute has

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.070
discovered is when they've
done the research in our labs,

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:59.150
they actually found that when
people's right hands were

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.260
engaged and they were actually
into-- so in our culture,

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.680
you shake with the right hand.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.320
I don't know any culture you
shake with the left hand.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.820
Not sure if there is.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.620
We always shake
with the right hand,

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.770
and the right hand is
directly related to the heart.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.420
So what they found is that when
the right hand was engaged,

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.820
and it was held,
the heart coherence

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.160
was actually affected.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.030
And those waves
were actually raised

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.990
when the right hand was held.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.640
So here you have these Sufis
and what are they doing?

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.032
They're reaching out.

00:32:32.032 --> 00:32:34.490
For the Sufis, they're reaching
out to the divine-- to God,

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.810
whatever you want to call it.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:38.840
For us, for William Blake,
what was he reaching out to?

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.510
Probably when he was talking
about that sense of perception

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:46.050
beyond the brain, he was talking
about inspiration and wisdom.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:50.210
And what are we, in 2014,
what are we reaching out for?

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.840
What are we holding with
our right hand-- grasping

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.890
for in our right hand?

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.360
Probably innovation.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.249
At least here,
specifically, innovation.

00:32:58.249 --> 00:32:59.790
We're reaching out
toward innovation.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.780
Innovation has the highest
valuation right now,

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.450
in terms of what you can create,
an experience you can have,

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.984
it's an innovated,
inspired, experience.

00:33:07.984 --> 00:33:10.525
And whenever you hear that word,
you're just like sign me up,

00:33:10.525 --> 00:33:12.440
right?

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.060
People want to be inspired,
and inspire literally

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.960
means to breathe in.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:22.370
And so all of this is just one
big metaphor for the turning

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.860
inward and getting quiet
to listen to the heart.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.900
And when Rumi-- there
were many quotes

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.000
I could have chosen today, but
this one spoke to me personally

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.580
because I'm not sure about
you, but there's many times

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.230
in my life where
I basically built

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.390
a huge wall against the
very thing that I wanted.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.000
Which is love, right?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.210
So how many times in our
own lives do we do this?

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.930
Especially in the
workplace, because it

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.180
hasn't been made
safe yet to talk

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:59.320
about-- let's talk about the
love and bring in the love.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.280
You have a friend or
colleague who's miserable

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.990
in what they're doing,
how could we shift that?

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:07.670
What can we give you to do
that you're going to love?

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:12.550
Steve Jobs reaching
to innovation.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.139
Made with his right hand,
both hands, who knows?

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:17.920
All feet whole body in it.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.100
He said "The only way
to do great work is

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.989
to love what you do.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:24.610
If you haven't found
it yet, keep looking.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:25.810
Don't settle.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.560
As with all matters
of the heart,

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.920
you'll know when you find it."

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.489
There's a woman I know
that lives up in Oregon,

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.920
and she does a lot
of Vedic astrology

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:41.370
and she sends out in a very
inspired monthly newsletter.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.350
And this was just,
I want to quote

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:47.400
where the source of all
of this information.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.000
She basically asked
this question--

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.280
what's standing in
the way of expressing

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.741
your true heart
with wild abandon?

00:34:52.741 --> 00:34:54.699
I don't know If you can
do it with wild abandon

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.510
here at Google or
anywhere else, but I

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.220
think it's a good
question to start asking.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:05.170
What's standing in the
way of us as a group,

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.690
as a team expressing our
heart with this project

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:08.910
or with this client?

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.740
So I'm going to read you
the very last tiny excerpt

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.540
here where this--
hopefully this isn't

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.610
an spoiler with what
I'm going to read.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:21.610
It's only two pages.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:25.640
But I want to show you how
this girl Damascena comes

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.670
into full alignment
with her heart.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.810
And as a result, it's
literally transformed her

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.394
on a physiological basis.

00:35:36.394 --> 00:35:38.060
So this is the first
time she's actually

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.646
been permitted to dance.

00:35:39.646 --> 00:35:42.270
So all along, she'd been trying
to do this, it's been forbidden

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:46.810
and now she's finally invited
into the lodge to dance.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.070
"With her head lowered,
Damascena humbly entered

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.590
the circle as the ninth dancer,
completing the celestial

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:56.030
formation, bowing to the
dervishes and the [? day ?]

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.040
[? day. ?] They bowed to
her and to each other,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.040
honoring each other's souls.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.200
Then after removing their black
capes which represented the ego

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.360
and receiving the senior
dervish's blessing

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.500
and attentive gaze, they
spun off one by one,

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.470
counterclockwise on their left
foot unclasping their hands

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:16.120
and extending the right up
toward God and the spirit

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.620
and the left toward the ground
in the direction of the earth

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.490
of the material
world and mankind.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.760
Rumi and [? Hasam ?] sat
to the left to the orbiting

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.700
dancers with their
heads bowed, long

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.240
conical hats tilted toward
the circle in deference

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.730
to Damascena who moved
like a star among stars,

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.410
a heavenly body beyond form.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.640
They'd never seen anything
like the transformation

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.370
within this girl who had arrived
burned and unable to walk,

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.309
but dance now with
grace streaming

00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:44.100
through her whole body
is if she had tapped

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.140
into the source of
surrender itself.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.170
She wore a calm
smile beaming joy

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.150
from every particle
of her being.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.610
When the other
senior dervishes had

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.850
stopped after one
full hour of spinning,

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:58.090
the girl continued to turn.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.950
She did not stumble
or fall down,

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.960
but floated across the
floor of the great hall

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.910
transporting not
only herself but also

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.320
everyone who watched her.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.176
The look on her face suggested
she was lost to another world.

00:37:10.176 --> 00:37:13.130
She had let go completely,
she had allowed the dance

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.520
to dissolve her body.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.690
She had become one
with the unseen.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.450
For the first time the dancing
become a form of prayer

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.600
and inside it she felt
free and unburdened

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.160
by the limitations of form.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.740
She had left her
body and looked down

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.930
on herself turning,
turning, arms outstretched,

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.760
chin lifted ever so slightly,
eyes fixed on the air

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.630
and nothing else while the
neigh and the drum played on.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.220
She had lost the ability to
know where her body started

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.770
and where it ended, or where the
universe-- the outside universe

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.140
began.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.730
And here she met Shams,
who danced with her

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.020
and did not complain
of hurting feet.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.550
The dervishes felt ashamed
for doubting her simply

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.080
because she had no
formal training.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.020
No one could deny her
grace and endurance

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.460
but they felt
anxious and jealous

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.130
considering how
long it taken them

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:01.690
to learn how to
dance for 10 minutes

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.720
without pausing, not to
mention more than an hour.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.200
There'd been no
one in Konya known

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.540
to dance for more than
60 minutes except Shams.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.200
No wonder so many
divershes had come

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.530
to fear him as much as
they wanted to emulate him.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.360
Rumi wanted to get
up and join the girl

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.670
but remained transfixed,
tears streaming,

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.300
feeling a peace he
had not felt in years.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.100
It was as if
Damascena's dancing was

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.150
helping to heal the
parts of his heart

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.100
that had been frayed
by Shams leaving.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.920
I could die now he
thought and be at peace,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.740
but more words came.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.710
The girl's dance had triggered
a new source of poetry.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:40.660
It was not the time to
leave the earth yet.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.900
Damascena danced for
three hours straight.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.110
At the end of her last turn, she
faced Rumi and opened her vest

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.460
with the right hand as
Denise had instructed

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.640
to let the world into her heart.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.995
Ivan met her at the door
when she finished and walked

00:38:55.995 --> 00:38:58.600
her back to the garden
where she collapsed and fell

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.440
into a deep sleep.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.200
He watched over her
hearing the chatter

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.720
of dervishes who had come
to pray over the girl hoping

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.190
the dance had not killed her.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.520
Ivan wanted to assure
them that Damascena

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:15.250
was alive, perhaps
more alive than ever."

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.850
So with this understanding
that the brain is so much

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.160
more than the heart, I have
to share with you something

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.400
that literally came to
me in the mail yesterday.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.260
I don't know how
many people receive

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.220
or write handwritten
letters anymore.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.280
This is from a
reader that I just

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.420
met last month in Pennsylvania.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.410
And her daughter had
received a heart transplant,

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.910
and I cannot tell you I got
this yesterday and I burst

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:38.480
into tears.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.000
I couldn't believe it, and
I said I have to share this.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.730
They say the heart
is just a muscle.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:48.430
You and I know from
life-- with an underline

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:53.670
on know and life --that it
is that and so much more.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.150
I see this with my daughter's
incredible gift of a heart.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.930
Saying goodbye to
her birth heart

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.100
and welcoming her new heart
has been filled with gratitude

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.600
and just about every other
emotion known to man.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.750
So how will you step into
this place in your heart

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:15.210
to experience an enlivening in
yourself here in the workplace,

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:15.710
beyond.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.960
So on this first
day of fall, I'm

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.910
going to ask you how you're
going to lead with your heart

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.350
and I want you to
interact with me.

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:30.890
So send me a message and
let me know how it goes.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.790
I'm so curious, it's
all very subtle.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.430
Thank you so much for having me.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.150
RACHEL O'MEARA: Thanks, Holly.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.020
We'll open it up to
questions or comments

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.960
if anyone has any
in the audience.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.850
AUDIENCE: So Holly,
I'm curious what

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:49.250
got you to Turkey,
to Konya, Turkey.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.140
HOLLY PAYNE: I was
there to do research

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.010
for "The Virgin's Knot," which
I was researching the rug

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:54.510
industry.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:58.000
And I happened to live with the
rug merchant and his family.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.580
And his cousin said,
do you know Rumi?

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.690
I said no, should
I and he laughed.

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:07.420
Now I know why he laughed.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.600
You silly American
girl, he said.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:13.030
And every taxi cab driver
could quote from Rumi.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.140
And I thought I need to know.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:19.030
When he took me to the tomb,
it was literally electrifying.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.950
And I had no idea who he was.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:24.020
And when I came back, that
started the whole process.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.030
And I started to read Coleman
Barks, just a really simple

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.210
translation.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.670
It's an extraordinary book.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.660
But in terms of what
the West has access to,

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.180
it's a little decimal.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.180
Think about 27,000 poems.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.320
We only have a tiny little bit.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.360
And it's not in Persian.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.260
I wish I could read
and speak Persian

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.400
because just to hear the
musicality of the poetry

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.166
would be great.

00:41:48.166 --> 00:41:50.290
AUDIENCE: How do you envision
connecting technology

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.567
with the heart?

00:41:51.567 --> 00:41:54.150
HOLLY PAYNE: You mean how could
technology actually connect us

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.210
to our hearts?

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:56.957
AUDIENCE: Yes, that's
a better question.

00:41:56.957 --> 00:41:58.540
HOLLY PAYNE: I think
there's many ways

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:01.410
that we can start
engaging with the heart.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.400
I actually know of a woman
here in San Francisco that

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.660
has actually created a
probe that you can wear,

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.430
and you can go home
and download it.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:15.160
I'm a cyclist, so I know there's
an app for something called

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.700
Strava and you
actually can-- you

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.530
know how much
mileage you've done,

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.436
it's geo-coded so they
know where you are.

00:42:21.436 --> 00:42:23.060
That's good and bad,
sometimes you just

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.500
want to get out on the road and
have no one know where you are.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.660
But in terms of understanding
where your heart coherence,

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.360
you can actually get feedback.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.210
And there's a lot
of games out there--

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.120
the HearthMath Institute
has a lot of different ways

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.020
to engage people.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:44.520
I actually worked with
someone who knows Dr. McCraty.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.370
And he had me sit down
with a video game.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:52.960
And it literally was-- if you
had coherent heart rhythms,

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.610
you could actually go
on around the world

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.970
in this balloon,
this hot air balloon.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.950
And so be very
aware of my breath.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.010
And then you get timed
for how long you're

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:05.940
able to stay in
coherent heart rhythm.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.290
So you basically travel
all over the world.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.970
I think I got down
into the Grand Canyon

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:13.136
and my balloon was cruising
around the Grand Canyon.

00:43:13.136 --> 00:43:18.590
But there's ways that they're
engaging this through videos.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.400
I was just at a launch
of a new program

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.040
here in San
Francisco called Arc.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.930
And it's the fusion of
technology and health,

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:28.080
and medicine.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.337
And there was a
researcher from UCSF,

00:43:32.337 --> 00:43:33.920
and he literally has
created something

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.490
where you can step
inside the brain.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:36.990
And they've talked
about how they're

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.260
using video games to help kids
who have Attention Deficit

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.630
Disorder, depression,
and so forth.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.930
And the video game
itself is actually

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.180
helping to change the
physiology of the body.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.420
And it's actually
creating healing.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.190
And we also know the detrimental
effects of that kind of media

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:55.510
as well.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.760
So it's a great question to ask.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.124
And so being here
and speaking, I

00:44:00.124 --> 00:44:02.040
wanted to ask the question
so everyone else is

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.010
starting to ask
the question, too.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.850
Because there is an
app, there should

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:07.530
be an app for this thing.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.110
I mean if there's
so much information

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.960
here, let's tap into it.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:17.010
Just tap in to the power of
that imagination and intuition

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.767
and bring it all together.

00:44:19.767 --> 00:44:21.350
AUDIENCE: I've had
straight up debates

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.830
with close friends of mine on
whether to listen to your head

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:26.120
or to your heart.

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.160
And I have my own
answer but I just

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.860
wanted to leave that
open ended and hear

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.990
what you had to say about that
or what you would tell someone

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.400
that's struggling on
which one to listen to

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.860
or which one it is in general.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.000
HOLLY PAYNE: Well
it's a great question

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.710
I think we all struggle with it.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.620
I mean I don't think there's
one person, unless you're

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:49.127
at that level of consciousness,
which I certainly am not.

00:44:49.127 --> 00:44:51.460
I don't know if I'll ever
achieve that in this lifetime,

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.245
but I am certainly
humbled by the endeavour.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.120
I think that the brain
plays an extraordinary role.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.130
I mean without the brain, there
is a two way communication

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:05.840
going on here.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.970
But I think we, in this
culture especially,

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:14.390
we are so overdeveloped
in this part of our brain,

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:15.490
in that frontal lobe.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:18.810
It is so overdeveloped, where
you literally you literally

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:23.480
feel like you're-- it's
like you're burning up.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.080
As a writer, I can
feel that because I

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.320
feel I always go forward.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:31.170
And this is my writing line.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:35.500
And when I go back, when
I actually shift my--

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.180
where I am inside myself,
I know that sounds crazy,

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.850
but when I come from a place
that's not from my head,

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:42.850
I literally am dropping down.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:44.779
So this idea of
leaning forward, I

00:45:44.779 --> 00:45:46.320
don't want to get
into a huge debate,

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.990
but to me, it's about
let's lean back.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:53.750
Like lean back, lean
back, get quiet.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.089
If that person has the
courage to listen--

00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:58.130
a lot of times the reason
we don't want to listen

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.940
to the heart is because it's
going to give us information

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.450
that's pretty much going to
require something that all

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.470
of you here-- you
might be programmers.

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.930
In the world of tech, you
understand the word pivot.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.350
Pretty much it's going to
be an invitation to pivot.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.050
For another word,
it just means it's

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:17.530
an invitation, an opportunity
to change something.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:20.980
Anytime you have a
kernel of the truth,

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:27.240
clearly something is not
true and it's not aligned.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.040
But that truth is
usually going to require

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.140
us to do something that's not
going to be so comfortable.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.520
That's why I-- my
own personal belief

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.234
--is why we don't engage
the heart as much.

00:46:39.234 --> 00:46:41.150
Because it's going to
require a little change,

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.870
it's going to require
a little sobering up

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:47.220
to the fact like where am I
out of alignment with myself.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.350
If you think your
way through it,

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:52.405
pretty much nine times out
of 10, actually 10 times out

00:46:52.405 --> 00:46:55.600
of 10, you're not
always going to have

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.040
the best information coming.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.850
You can use your brain
to sort it out afterward.

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:06.950
But it's more of why do I
know that this relationship is

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:10.790
actually causing my disease.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.017
Why do I know that?

00:47:12.017 --> 00:47:12.850
There's no evidence.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.720
I can't go to a
doctor and say I'm

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.490
feeling this way because
of this relationship.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.260
Your body knows.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.200
We know this kind of stuff.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.000
The brain is a wonderful-- it's
like in the writing process,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.790
I have to write
from the bottom up.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:28.020
I always encourage people
when I work with them.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.490
When a story comes, really
check out where it comes from.

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:33.940
And where does it
sit in your body?

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.740
And right from this place
up, not from this place down.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:40.060
I love to engage my brain
when I have to do editing

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.240
and really looking
at story design.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.450
But to know that the
foundation's there,

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:49.270
the heart to me gives rise to
the foundation for everything.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.135
I mean Steve Jobs
said it best, right?

00:47:52.135 --> 00:47:56.270
The heart will always
lead you, it'll know.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.540
And this is the guy that we
look at as one of the smartest,

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:04.320
most literally brilliant,
brilliant people that

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.970
lived during our time.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:08.560
And what's that source
of the brilliance?

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.570
To me it's like,
wow, I would love

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.120
to have seen Steve Jobs'
magnetic field in terms

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.730
of just his love for technology.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:21.740
His love to develop something
that never been done before.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.950
So it will always be a debate.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:25.700
It will always be a
debate, because that's

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.480
where the fear is.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.700
The question was
asked to Damascena,

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.790
you're spinning so fast,
and spinning so fast,

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:33.640
our minds are "pfft."

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.240
The minds are the
whirling dervishes.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.080
But the heart helps
to slow you down,

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.040
or you can slow down the
heart to actually allow

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.750
the communication to serve you.

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:50.200
If you're willing to be
aligned with the truth,

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.900
that's the bigger question.

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.080
You can say, what you are
afraid of, to your friend.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.160
AUDIENCE: I had a
question about HeartMath.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.095
I don't know them
well, but are they--

00:49:01.095 --> 00:49:03.300
you may not know it
either --but are they

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.325
working with companies, or is
it more just research based.

00:49:06.325 --> 00:49:08.680
It sounds so interesting
that they're just--

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:08.730
HOLLY PAYNE: You
know, that's a great

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:09.010
AUDIENCE: dedicated
to find that.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.190
HOLLY PAYNE: --question.

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:12.540
And I can put you in
touch with Dr. McCraty.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.100
I know that they do teach this.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:20.050
So they teach something called
a freeze frame technique.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.550
And the appreciation
one, it was kind

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:27.039
of a really diluted version.

00:49:27.039 --> 00:49:29.080
But I wanted to just show
you how simple it could

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.120
be just based on, you don't
even have to brand it.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.090
It's just like, let's
actually feel an appreciation,

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:39.250
and just experience
physiologically what that does.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:41.410
And what that did
actually, in the room,

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:45.310
is it actually magnified
that heart field.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:49.290
All of us, our heart field
was totally untrained.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:52.740
So if you can do
that on your team,

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.010
all those little rocks line up.

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:58.740
It's not about loving
everything all the time,

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.990
it's about creating
harmonious outcomes.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.990
Harmonious outcomes
might require the brain

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.210
to think through some
things and strategize,

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:08.090
but if you have that
discourse from a place

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.330
of the heart versus
a competitive place,

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.390
you're literally going to have--
the chances are --everyone

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:16.870
engaged in that
communication, in that moment,

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:20.650
is having higher heart
rhythm coherence.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:23.130
Versus someone
bringing you down,

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:26.680
and we want to run
from those folks.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.740
AUDIENCE: Do have a
favorite Rumi poem?

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.910
HOLLY PAYNE: Do I have
a favorite Rumi poem?

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:34.230
Yes, and please don't put
me on the spot to quote it,

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:35.892
but I can paraphrase it.

00:50:35.892 --> 00:50:37.350
And it's the "Guest
House," I think

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:38.720
many, many people know it.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.190
And for me, just in terms of
my own recent personal life,

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:46.370
I've had many things showing
up and requiring change.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:48.670
And requiring really
a deep listening

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:51.760
and getting honest with
me with what aligned

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.410
and what's not aligned.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.080
And so the "Guest
House" in a nutshell--

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.610
sorry Rumi, forgive
me if I butcher this,

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:02.100
but I'm going to paraphrase
in the best way I can.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:05.006
Is basically-- there's going to
be a lot of people and things

00:51:05.006 --> 00:51:06.630
that are going to
show up in your life.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:10.790
And he says welcome them all
for they may be clearing you out

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.460
for some new delight.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.140
So I don't know about you,
but I'm in a place in my life

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.400
where I'm psyched to
have some new delights.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.290
I think the world is excited
to have some new delights.

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:25.930
And Google as a company, you're
in a really great position.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.224
You're all on a position
of power and leadership

00:51:28.224 --> 00:51:30.390
regardless of what your
role is here in the company,

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:33.550
because everyone's looking
to you, for this innovation.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:37.530
And your mission is to organize
the world's information.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:40.250
So to organize the
world's information,

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.419
and make it accessible
and useful, is that it?

00:51:43.419 --> 00:51:44.960
The last thing I'll
say is how do you

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.890
organize the information
of your heart

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.310
and make it
accessible and useful?

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:53.164
And welcome all of
those that come, right?

00:51:53.164 --> 00:51:55.330
RACHEL O'MEARA: Well thanks
and it's been a delight.

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:56.410
Thank you, Holly.

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:57.210
HOLLY PAYNE: Thank you, Rachel.

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:58.110
Thanks for having me.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:51:59.660
[APPLAUSE]
