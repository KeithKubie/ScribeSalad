00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.877
[music playing]

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:03.628
SHANNON: Hey, look, an El
Camino right in front of it.

00:00:03.628 --> 00:00:04.462
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:05.338
They got every car.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.048
What's that up there?

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:08.091
SHANNON: It's a Nova.

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.552
That Nova don't look bad.

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.053
Well, I think we
just got to stop.

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.638
SHANNON: Yeah.
- Come on there, big boy.

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:14.347
Let's go check this out.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.853
See, this one's nice.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.604
We'll look at them all.

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:22.522
What's going on, man?

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.690
My name is Mike.
- Adam.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.191
How are you doing, Adam?
Shannon.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.568
Nice to meet you.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:30.155
Well, we were looking
at this bad boy.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.365
SHANNON: What year is it?

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.575
'72 Nova.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.285
MIKE: When the Nova
first came out,

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.954
it was originally advertised
as a compact, economical car.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:41.458
But with its longer wheelbase
and multi-engine size options,

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.335
those with the need for
speed eventually caught on.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:48.047
The Nova would become one of the
great muscle cars of its era.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:51.342
And while the 1970s models had
to lose many of their power

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:53.511
options because
of the oil crisis,

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:56.598
the Nova still kept
its reputation.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:57.682
Where did you get this one from?

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.350
Mini Storage.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.852
The manager's daughter tried
to sell it for three months.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:01.853
I emptied my checking account.

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.521
I offered her $1,300 for it.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.773
Check the motor out inside.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:05.899
Yeah, it's a little dusty.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.442
Oh, it doesn't matter.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:11.488
We see dirt and
grime all the time.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:12.822
Damn.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:13.823
Does the thing got a
big cam in it, or--

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.200
- Oh, yeah.
- It does?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.785
This is one of
them fun ones, yeah.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.244
But you've got it all
running again and everything?

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.496
Yes.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.872
It's original interior,
original mileage

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.624
on the odometer, but
not the original motor.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.250
Well, the car looks solid.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.585
Who cares if the
paint's falling off.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.003
That happens all the time.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.589
ADAM: Yeah, that's
somebody's beautiful work.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.258
Yeah, usually that's
all rusted on the bottom.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.885
So is it something
you've got plans for?

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.178
Are you going to keep it?

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.721
Maybe you want to get rid of it?

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.139
Besides my true love,
that's the only other thing

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.182
I ever wanted in life.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.433
- Oh, this?
- That's right.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.643
I got a picture I
drew of that thing

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:42.435
when I was a junior
in high school.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.020
No kidding?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.021
So you're not exactly
looking at getting rid of it?

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.106
For the right price.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.442
What is your magic number?

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:53.404
As is, right now, I'd
take $15,000 for it.

00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:55.281
- Whew.
- Go ahead, Mike.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:58.493
Even though I would love to
paint this thing a nice horny

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:02.831
green, $15,000 is too
rich for my blood.

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:03.873
But who knows?

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.542
Danny might think it's worth it.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.252
I'm going to take it back
to him, see what he says.

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.212
Get that Nova painted
so I don't have to.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.964
Yes, sir.
