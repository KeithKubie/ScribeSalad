those very same technologies thus

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:37.290
those very same technologies thus
 

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.680
those very same technologies thus
increasing disparity between the those

goals so we're separating the means and

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:36.590
goals so we're separating the means and
 

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.500
goals so we're separating the means and
the ends the humans are talking about

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:38.510
the ends the humans are talking about
 

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:41.050
the ends the humans are talking about
ends and the AI is figuring out the

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:41.060
ends and the AI is figuring out the
 

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.030
ends and the AI is figuring out the
means and I think that this is a very

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040
means and I think that this is a very
 

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.020
means and I think that this is a very
important separation for the future in

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:47.030
important separation for the future in
 

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:52.330

ten years hmm and I want to ask the
 

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:04.779
ten years hmm and I want to ask the
question what is the thing you're most

01:19:04.779 --> 01:19:04.789
question what is the thing you're most
 

01:19:04.789 --> 01:19:07.299

didn't share these with the speakers

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:19.610
didn't share these with the speakers
 

01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:28.330
didn't share these with the speakers
ahead of time so I think we already seen

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:28.340
ahead of time so I think we already seen
 

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.040
ahead of time so I think we already seen
this happening maybe ten years is too

excited about the conversation that

01:28:56.010 --> 01:28:56.020
excited about the conversation that
 

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.080
excited about the conversation that
we're having today because it's not

01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:58.090
we're having today because it's not
 

01:28:58.090 --> 01:29:00.390

about the hype it's about the reality of

01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400
about the hype it's about the reality of
 

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.940
about the hype it's about the reality of
what it means to take these algorithms

01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:02.950
what it means to take these algorithms
 

01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:04.620
what it means to take these algorithms
and make a difference in the lives of

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:04.630
and make a difference in the lives of
 

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:06.600

and I'm Michael Skupin so my background

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:14.860
and I'm Michael Skupin so my background
 

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.670

is actually in this tough translation

01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:17.680
is actually in this tough translation
 

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:19.440
is actually in this tough translation
problem I think about which our session

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:19.450
problem I think about which our session
 

01:29:19.450 --> 01:29:21.180
problem I think about which our session
speaker talked about which is how do we

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:21.190
speaker talked about which is how do we
 

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:23.610
speaker talked about which is how do we
actually articulate our social norms in

01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:23.620
actually articulate our social norms in
 

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:25.470
actually articulate our social norms in
terms of technical decisions and

01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:25.480
terms of technical decisions and
 

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.420
terms of technical decisions and
technical processes that we're trying to

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:27.430
technical processes that we're trying to
 

01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:29.910
technical processes that we're trying to
champion so a lot of what I've done is

01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920
champion so a lot of what I've done is
 

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.340
champion so a lot of what I've done is
worked with students so on pedagogical

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:32.350
worked with students so on pedagogical
 

01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:33.930
worked with students so on pedagogical
practices for engineers who are in

01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:33.940
practices for engineers who are in
 

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.330
practices for engineers who are in
training but also on professionals who

01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:36.340
training but also on professionals who
 

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:38.130
training but also on professionals who
are designing technical system

01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:38.140
are designing technical system
 

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.720
are designing technical system
specifically machine learning systems

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:39.730
specifically machine learning systems
 

01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:41.550
specifically machine learning systems
and choosing what data mining operation

01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560
and choosing what data mining operation
 

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.380
and choosing what data mining operation
they're going to have or what training

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:43.390
they're going to have or what training
 

01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:44.460
they're going to have or what training
procedure they're going to use and

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:44.470
procedure they're going to use and
 

01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:46.530
procedure they're going to use and
actually trying to get them to project a

01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:46.540
actually trying to get them to project a
 

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:49.230
actually trying to get them to project a
future a little bit about well what does

01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:49.240
future a little bit about well what does
 

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.000
future a little bit about well what does
this small technical decision I'm making

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.010
this small technical decision I'm making
 

01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:53.130
this small technical decision I'm making
here of choosing this sorting algorithm

01:29:53.130 --> 01:29:53.140
here of choosing this sorting algorithm
 

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:54.780
here of choosing this sorting algorithm
on this interface or potential using

01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:54.790
on this interface or potential using
 

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:56.640
on this interface or potential using
this data set to try to train on this

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:56.650
this data set to try to train on this
 

01:29:56.650 --> 01:29:58.740
this data set to try to train on this
against this objective how do I get

01:29:58.740 --> 01:29:58.750
against this objective how do I get
 

01:29:58.750 --> 01:30:00.180
against this objective how do I get
people to actually think a little bit

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:00.190
people to actually think a little bit
 

01:30:00.190 --> 01:30:01.350
people to actually think a little bit
about what's going to be the social

01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360
about what's going to be the social
 

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.420
about what's going to be the social
impact of this choice and what are some

01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:03.430
impact of this choice and what are some
 

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:05.340
impact of this choice and what are some
of my options and how do they relate to

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:05.350
of my options and how do they relate to
 

01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:07.770
of my options and how do they relate to
that social impact and so that is

01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:07.780
that social impact and so that is
 

01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:09.330
that social impact and so that is
actually a very difficult translation

01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:09.340
actually a very difficult translation
 

01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:11.340
actually a very difficult translation
problem and that's what I spent most of

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:11.350
problem and that's what I spent most of
 

01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:12.459
problem and that's what I spent most of
my active

01:30:12.459 --> 01:30:12.469
my active
 

01:30:12.469 --> 01:30:14.680
my active
make time viewing but now I'm the

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:14.690
make time viewing but now I'm the
 

01:30:14.690 --> 01:30:16.089
make time viewing but now I'm the
director of a community center which is

01:30:16.089 --> 01:30:16.099
director of a community center which is
 

01:30:16.099 --> 01:30:17.830
director of a community center which is
in Wilkinsburg Pennsylvania which is a

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840
in Wilkinsburg Pennsylvania which is a
 

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.120
in Wilkinsburg Pennsylvania which is a
neighbouring borough right here in

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:19.130
neighbouring borough right here in
 

01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:22.149
neighbouring borough right here in
Pittsburgh and so what we're trying to

01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159
Pittsburgh and so what we're trying to
 

01:30:22.159 --> 01:30:24.790
Pittsburgh and so what we're trying to
do there is actually also a little bit

01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800
do there is actually also a little bit
 

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.410
do there is actually also a little bit
to our session speaker also he was

01:30:26.410 --> 01:30:26.420
to our session speaker also he was
 

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:30.009
to our session speaker also he was
talking about is be deeply engaged in a

01:30:30.009 --> 01:30:30.019
talking about is be deeply engaged in a
 

01:30:30.019 --> 01:30:32.500
talking about is be deeply engaged in a
community setting as a group our leaders

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:32.510
community setting as a group our leaders
 

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:33.850
community setting as a group our leaders
range from across the board at the

01:30:33.850 --> 01:30:33.860
range from across the board at the
 

01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:35.589
range from across the board at the
community center from technologists like

01:30:35.589 --> 01:30:35.599
community center from technologists like
 

01:30:35.599 --> 01:30:37.600
community center from technologists like
myself and a few others but also to

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:37.610
myself and a few others but also to
 

01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:40.089
myself and a few others but also to
educators and community servants who are

01:30:40.089 --> 01:30:40.099
educators and community servants who are
 

01:30:40.099 --> 01:30:42.850
educators and community servants who are
already working in the region and our

01:30:42.850 --> 01:30:42.860
already working in the region and our
 

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:45.279
already working in the region and our
goal is to be deeply connected with that

01:30:45.279 --> 01:30:45.289
goal is to be deeply connected with that
 

01:30:45.289 --> 01:30:46.899
goal is to be deeply connected with that
community and be sure that we're

01:30:46.899 --> 01:30:46.909
community and be sure that we're
 

01:30:46.909 --> 01:30:48.879
community and be sure that we're
creating an inner community space where

01:30:48.879 --> 01:30:48.889
creating an inner community space where
 

01:30:48.889 --> 01:30:50.589
creating an inner community space where
people can learn from each other and

01:30:50.589 --> 01:30:50.599
people can learn from each other and
 

01:30:50.599 --> 01:30:52.719
people can learn from each other and
work with one another and as our session

01:30:52.719 --> 01:30:52.729
work with one another and as our session
 

01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:54.640
work with one another and as our session
speakers said actually learn from folks

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:54.650
speakers said actually learn from folks
 

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:56.680
speakers said actually learn from folks
who understand problems on the ground

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:56.690
who understand problems on the ground
 

01:30:56.690 --> 01:30:58.390
who understand problems on the ground
better than folks who are in the

01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400
better than folks who are in the
 

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.129
better than folks who are in the
research lab or who are actually working

01:31:00.129 --> 01:31:00.139
research lab or who are actually working
 

01:31:00.139 --> 01:31:01.870
research lab or who are actually working
on these problems in an academic setting

01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880
on these problems in an academic setting
 

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.120
on these problems in an academic setting
and be able to actually help people

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:04.130
and be able to actually help people
 

01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:06.399
and be able to actually help people
articulate their problems to us so that

01:31:06.399 --> 01:31:06.409
articulate their problems to us so that
 

01:31:06.409 --> 01:31:08.709
articulate their problems to us so that
we can then actually correctly have the

01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719
we can then actually correctly have the
 

01:31:08.719 --> 01:31:11.080
we can then actually correctly have the
right head on our shoulders around what

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:11.090
right head on our shoulders around what
 

01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:12.629
right head on our shoulders around what
we're trying to do rather than

01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639
we're trying to do rather than
 

01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:15.069
we're trying to do rather than
potentially project what we think should

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:15.079
potentially project what we think should
 

01:31:15.079 --> 01:31:17.560
potentially project what we think should
be happening and so our community center

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:17.570
be happening and so our community center
 

01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:19.839
be happening and so our community center
is a very very I would say like scrappy

01:31:19.839 --> 01:31:19.849
is a very very I would say like scrappy
 

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:21.850
is a very very I would say like scrappy
effort to to try to make sure that that

01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:21.860
effort to to try to make sure that that
 

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:23.529
effort to to try to make sure that that
is happening and we do things such as

01:31:23.529 --> 01:31:23.539
is happening and we do things such as
 

01:31:23.539 --> 01:31:25.689
is happening and we do things such as
education services getting kids into

01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:25.699
education services getting kids into
 

01:31:25.699 --> 01:31:27.549
education services getting kids into
pathways around technology who might not

01:31:27.549 --> 01:31:27.559
pathways around technology who might not
 

01:31:27.559 --> 01:31:29.379
pathways around technology who might not
otherwise have those opportunities but

01:31:29.379 --> 01:31:29.389
otherwise have those opportunities but
 

01:31:29.389 --> 01:31:33.640
otherwise have those opportunities but
also as a civics and community service

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:33.650
also as a civics and community service
 

01:31:33.650 --> 01:31:35.319
also as a civics and community service
project to really just make sure that

01:31:35.319 --> 01:31:35.329
project to really just make sure that
 

01:31:35.329 --> 01:31:36.850
project to really just make sure that
those conversations are happening and

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:36.860
those conversations are happening and
 

01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:38.439
those conversations are happening and
that there's a space for them and so

01:31:38.439 --> 01:31:38.449
that there's a space for them and so
 

01:31:38.449 --> 01:31:39.580
that there's a space for them and so
that's a lot what the community center

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:39.590
that's a lot what the community center
 

01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:41.830
that's a lot what the community center
about which is a you know output of some

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840
about which is a you know output of some
 

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.209
about which is a you know output of some
of the things I think about an academic

01:31:43.209 --> 01:31:43.219
of the things I think about an academic
 

01:31:43.219 --> 01:31:46.870
of the things I think about an academic
setting so I was really excited to come

01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880
setting so I was really excited to come
 

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.209
setting so I was really excited to come
and moderate this panel because as a

01:31:49.209 --> 01:31:49.219
and moderate this panel because as a
 

01:31:49.219 --> 01:31:51.700
and moderate this panel because as a
journalist the question of access and

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:51.710
journalist the question of access and
 

01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:54.009
journalist the question of access and
impact of technology or things I deal

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:54.019
impact of technology or things I deal
 

01:31:54.019 --> 01:31:57.250
impact of technology or things I deal
with every day but also as a journalist

01:31:57.250 --> 01:31:57.260
with every day but also as a journalist
 

01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:59.890
with every day but also as a journalist
right my training is to be skeptical and

01:31:59.890 --> 01:31:59.900
right my training is to be skeptical and
 

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:02.020
right my training is to be skeptical and
question assumptions so when I was

01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:02.030
question assumptions so when I was
 

01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:04.120
question assumptions so when I was
invited to moderate this the first thing

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:04.130
invited to moderate this the first thing
 

01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:05.859
invited to moderate this the first thing
I did was have this knee-jerk reaction

01:32:05.859 --> 01:32:05.869
I did was have this knee-jerk reaction
 

01:32:05.869 --> 01:32:08.589
I did was have this knee-jerk reaction
and call up and say you know why are we

01:32:08.589 --> 01:32:08.599
and call up and say you know why are we
 

01:32:08.599 --> 01:32:10.959
and call up and say you know why are we
focusing on equity of access and equity

01:32:10.959 --> 01:32:10.969
focusing on equity of access and equity
 

01:32:10.969 --> 01:32:14.560
focusing on equity of access and equity
of impact because that really makes an

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:14.570
of impact because that really makes an
 

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:17.859
of impact because that really makes an
assumption that a AI is an inevitable

01:32:17.859 --> 01:32:17.869
assumption that a AI is an inevitable
 

01:32:17.869 --> 01:32:20.739
assumption that a AI is an inevitable
and B it's a known good that the good

01:32:20.739 --> 01:32:20.749
and B it's a known good that the good
 

01:32:20.749 --> 01:32:22.870
and B it's a known good that the good
outweighs the horn and we don't know

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880
outweighs the horn and we don't know
 

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:23.729
outweighs the horn and we don't know
that yet

01:32:23.729 --> 01:32:23.739
that yet
 

01:32:23.739 --> 01:32:28.580
that yet
and then I said you know also I think

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:28.590
and then I said you know also I think
 

01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:31.080
and then I said you know also I think
it's really important to focus on biased

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:31.090
it's really important to focus on biased
 

01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:34.470
it's really important to focus on biased
datasets and bias algorithms and

01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480
datasets and bias algorithms and
 

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.290
datasets and bias algorithms and
disparate impact but this obsession we

01:32:37.290 --> 01:32:37.300
disparate impact but this obsession we
 

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:39.690
disparate impact but this obsession we
have with computational fairness seems

01:32:39.690 --> 01:32:39.700
have with computational fairness seems
 

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:41.400
have with computational fairness seems
to distract also from some of the big

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:41.410
to distract also from some of the big
 

01:32:41.410 --> 01:32:44.130
to distract also from some of the big
problems and so I called my panelists

01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:44.140
problems and so I called my panelists
 

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.380
problems and so I called my panelists
and discovered that you know everybody

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:46.390
and discovered that you know everybody
 

01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:48.990
and discovered that you know everybody
also is a bit of an insurrectionist so

01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.000
also is a bit of an insurrectionist so
 

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.209
also is a bit of an insurrectionist so
we're gonna talk about some of the

01:32:51.209 --> 01:32:51.219
we're gonna talk about some of the
 

01:32:51.219 --> 01:32:52.920
we're gonna talk about some of the
expected questions but we're also going

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:52.930
expected questions but we're also going
 

01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:54.810
expected questions but we're also going
to talk about some of the fundamental

01:32:54.810 --> 01:32:54.820
to talk about some of the fundamental
 

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.990
to talk about some of the fundamental
questions and so you know the first

01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000
questions and so you know the first
 

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.430
questions and so you know the first
question is just an establishing

01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440
question is just an establishing
 

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.260
question is just an establishing
question Alex maybe you want to start

01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:01.270
question Alex maybe you want to start
 

01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:03.870
question Alex maybe you want to start
question is when we talk about AI and we

01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880
question is when we talk about AI and we
 

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.180
question is when we talk about AI and we
talk about equity what is it we're

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:06.190
talk about equity what is it we're
 

01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:10.140
talk about equity what is it we're
actually talking about I think in many

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:10.150
actually talking about I think in many
 

01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:11.910
actually talking about I think in many
ways we're talking about the very same

01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920
ways we're talking about the very same
 

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.890
ways we're talking about the very same
things that we're referring to and we

01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:13.900
things that we're referring to and we
 

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.560
things that we're referring to and we
speak about equity of any process so in

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:16.570
speak about equity of any process so in
 

01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:18.390
speak about equity of any process so in
my experience a lot of the concerns that

01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400
my experience a lot of the concerns that
 

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.209
my experience a lot of the concerns that
we have in let's say criminal justice is

01:33:21.209 --> 01:33:21.219
we have in let's say criminal justice is
 

01:33:21.219 --> 01:33:23.790
we have in let's say criminal justice is
a risk of just perpetuating the very

01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800
a risk of just perpetuating the very
 

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.940
a risk of just perpetuating the very
same disparities that the system already

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:25.950
same disparities that the system already
 

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:29.100
same disparities that the system already
absorbedly suffers from so I think

01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:29.110
absorbedly suffers from so I think
 

01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:30.360
absorbedly suffers from so I think
what's really important to keep in mind

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:30.370
what's really important to keep in mind
 

01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:32.250
what's really important to keep in mind
when we think about these equity issues

01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:32.260
when we think about these equity issues
 

01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.350
when we think about these equity issues
is compared to what baseline that

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360
is compared to what baseline that
 

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.420
is compared to what baseline that
there's certainly a risk that as we

01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:36.430
there's certainly a risk that as we
 

01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:39.180
there's certainly a risk that as we
switch to more algorithmic or at least

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:39.190
switch to more algorithmic or at least
 

01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:41.250
switch to more algorithmic or at least
algorithmically supported decision

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:41.260
algorithmically supported decision
 

01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.290
algorithmically supported decision
systems that we could exacerbate those

01:33:43.290 --> 01:33:43.300
systems that we could exacerbate those
 

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.450
systems that we could exacerbate those
same problems or we could address them

01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:45.460
same problems or we could address them
 

01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:48.180
same problems or we could address them
and I think that's really at the core of

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:48.190
and I think that's really at the core of
 

01:33:48.190 --> 01:33:49.860
and I think that's really at the core of
equity that this is not a new problem

01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:49.870
equity that this is not a new problem
 

01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:52.320
equity that this is not a new problem
that AI has brought about it's something

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:52.330
that AI has brought about it's something
 

01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:53.910
that AI has brought about it's something
old that we're now trying to address

01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920
old that we're now trying to address
 

01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:02.070
old that we're now trying to address
perhaps with some new tools yeah so I

01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080
perhaps with some new tools yeah so I
 

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.010
perhaps with some new tools yeah so I
think when we're talking about equity as

01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:05.020
think when we're talking about equity as
 

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.100
think when we're talking about equity as
as Alexandra said we're often thinking

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:08.110
as Alexandra said we're often thinking
 

01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:10.620
as Alexandra said we're often thinking
about inequities that already exist and

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:10.630
about inequities that already exist and
 

01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:14.970
about inequities that already exist and
then could be compounded by AI solutions

01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:14.980
then could be compounded by AI solutions
 

01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:17.010
then could be compounded by AI solutions
and the approaches that we take so so

01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:17.020
and the approaches that we take so so
 

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:19.110
and the approaches that we take so so
I'm very interested in and I'm when I

01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120
I'm very interested in and I'm when I
 

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.030
I'm very interested in and I'm when I
think about equity and I hear about it I

01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040
think about equity and I hear about it I
 

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.950
think about equity and I hear about it I
do have this kind of two sides of the

01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960
do have this kind of two sides of the
 

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.080
do have this kind of two sides of the
coin of is the AI system already out

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:25.090
coin of is the AI system already out
 

01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:25.620
coin of is the AI system already out
there

01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:25.630
there
 

01:34:25.630 --> 01:34:28.080
there
did we make something and then is it

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:28.090
did we make something and then is it
 

01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:30.420
did we make something and then is it
actually creating something an inequity

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:30.430
actually creating something an inequity
 

01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:31.890
actually creating something an inequity
that we maybe already understand and

01:34:31.890 --> 01:34:31.900
that we maybe already understand and
 

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:32.850
that we maybe already understand and
knowbut maybe it's already being

01:34:32.850 --> 01:34:32.860
knowbut maybe it's already being
 

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:35.040
knowbut maybe it's already being
produced in another way and now we're

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:35.050
produced in another way and now we're
 

01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:37.050
produced in another way and now we're
actually replicating it or accelerating

01:34:37.050 --> 01:34:37.060
actually replicating it or accelerating
 

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:37.670
actually replicating it or accelerating
it or maybe we're

01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:37.680
it or maybe we're
 

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.040
it or maybe we're
amazing it but we are missing some edge

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:40.050
amazing it but we are missing some edge
 

01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:42.740
amazing it but we are missing some edge
cases still but then there's also the

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:42.750
cases still but then there's also the
 

01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:46.370
cases still but then there's also the
side of how is inequity just exacerbated

01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380
side of how is inequity just exacerbated
 

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.800
side of how is inequity just exacerbated
by the push of this industry thinking

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:48.810
by the push of this industry thinking
 

01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:50.780
by the push of this industry thinking
about how where is investment coming

01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:50.790
about how where is investment coming
 

01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:52.220
about how where is investment coming
from who are the people who get the

from who are the people who get the
 

01:34:52.230 --> 01:34:54.080
from who are the people who get the
chance to decide what the objectives are

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:54.090
chance to decide what the objectives are
 

01:34:54.090 --> 01:34:55.520
chance to decide what the objectives are
as many of you probably know when you're

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:55.530
as many of you probably know when you're
 

01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:57.470
as many of you probably know when you're
designing an AI system it's always

designing an AI system it's always

designing an AI system it's always

you're trying to develop a machine

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:01.230
you're trying to develop a machine
 

01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:03.470
you're trying to develop a machine
learning algorithm for and who gets to

decide what is the relevant approach to
 

01:35:06.690 --> 01:35:07.820
decide what is the relevant approach to
that so when you think about say a

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:07.830
that so when you think about say a
 

01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:10.370
that so when you think about say a
recidivism score is there also an

01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:10.380
recidivism score is there also an
 

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:13.070
recidivism score is there also an
objective or we say does this prisoner

01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080
objective or we say does this prisoner
 

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.590

have the social support network to go

01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600
have the social support network to go
 

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.870
have the social support network to go
out and actually get a job or to

01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880
out and actually get a job or to
 

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.350
out and actually get a job or to
potentially go on a pathway out of you

01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360
potentially go on a pathway out of you
 

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:22.820

01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:25.790
know involved in involvement in crime
and is there a way to use AI to predict

01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800
and is there a way to use AI to predict
 

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.650
and is there a way to use AI to predict
whether this person's social system is

01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:27.660
whether this person's social system is
 

01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.810
whether this person's social system is
just not gonna be you know supportive

01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:29.820
just not gonna be you know supportive
 

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:31.520

their feet is that an alternative look

01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940

person when thinking about that problem

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940
person when thinking about that problem
 

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.630
person when thinking about that problem
see it that way and so yeah so that's

01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:38.640
see it that way and so yeah so that's
 

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.250
see it that way and so yeah so that's
what I'm kind of thinking about is where

01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260
what I'm kind of thinking about is where
 

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.050
what I'm kind of thinking about is where
does it come from when we first start

01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060
does it come from when we first start
 

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:44.600
does it come from when we first start
thinking about AI and then also thinking

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:44.610
thinking about AI and then also thinking
 

01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:46.640
thinking about AI and then also thinking
well now we have any AI solution is is

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:46.650
well now we have any AI solution is is
 

01:35:46.650 --> 01:35:49.400
well now we have any AI solution is is
it being equitable in practice and how

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:49.410
it being equitable in practice and how
 

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.470
it being equitable in practice and how
do you think about it in terms of equity

01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480
do you think about it in terms of equity
 

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.980
do you think about it in terms of equity
and health care yeah so it's really

01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:54.990
and health care yeah so it's really
 

01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:56.300
and health care yeah so it's really
interesting when you think about health

01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:56.310
interesting when you think about health
 

01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:57.980
interesting when you think about health
care as I mentioned earlier there's

01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:57.990
care as I mentioned earlier there's
 

01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:02.450
care as I mentioned earlier there's
nothing really more humane or human than

01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460

best quality care that you can to fellow
 

01:36:07.710 --> 01:36:09.380
best quality care that you can to fellow
human beings now when you talk about

01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:09.390
human beings now when you talk about
 

01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:11.530
human beings now when you talk about
equity in health care it really is about

01:36:11.530 --> 01:36:11.540
equity in health care it really is about
 

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:14.630
equity in health care it really is about
making sure that you have access to care

01:36:14.630 --> 01:36:14.640
making sure that you have access to care
 

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:17.240
making sure that you have access to care
and making sure that you're fair about

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:17.250
and making sure that you're fair about
 

01:36:17.250 --> 01:36:20.780
and making sure that you're fair about
who has access and what level or what

01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:20.790

01:36:23.130 --> 01:36:27.110
quality of access these human beings
have to those care processes so when you

01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120
have to those care processes so when you
 

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.030
have to those care processes so when you
really think about the three-legged

01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040
really think about the three-legged
 

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:31.700
really think about the three-legged
stool of health care the three point

01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:31.710

five trillion dollar industry that's

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:33.270
five trillion dollar industry that's
 

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:35.420
five trillion dollar industry that's
health care today it's cost quality and

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:35.430
health care today it's cost quality and
 

01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:37.520
health care today it's cost quality and
access right and you know some would add

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:37.530
access right and you know some would add
 

01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:40.220

a fourth stool there around experience

01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:40.230
a fourth stool there around experience
 

01:36:40.230 --> 01:36:42.710
a fourth stool there around experience
but when you think about cost quality

01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:42.720
but when you think about cost quality
 

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:45.170
but when you think about cost quality
and access cost continues to accelerate

01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:45.180
and access cost continues to accelerate
 

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.290
and access cost continues to accelerate
it continues to go up

01:36:47.290 --> 01:36:47.300
it continues to go up
 

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.640
it continues to go up

know I think it's time for us to double

01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:36.660
know I think it's time for us to double
 

01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:39.080
know I think it's time for us to double
down on these capabilities and making

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:39.090
down on these capabilities and making
 

01:46:39.090 --> 01:46:41.300
down on these capabilities and making
sure that we're able to do this in the

01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:41.310
sure that we're able to do this in the
 

01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:44.990
sure that we're able to do this in the
most ethical manner possible and Mike

01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000
most ethical manner possible and Mike
 

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.510
most ethical manner possible and Mike
who do we think should regulate this

01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520
who do we think should regulate this
 

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:50.480
who do we think should regulate this
when we talk about equity of access and

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:50.490
when we talk about equity of access and
 

01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:52.550
when we talk about equity of access and
equity of impact is it up to researchers

01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560
equity of impact is it up to researchers
 

01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.780
equity of impact is it up to researchers
to be accountable for their own

01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:55.790
to be accountable for their own
 

01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:59.060
to be accountable for their own
innovations should the government come

01:46:59.060 --> 01:46:59.070
innovations should the government come
 

01:46:59.070 --> 01:47:01.970
innovations should the government come
in and regulate or legislate AI and make

01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:01.980
in and regulate or legislate AI and make
 

01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:03.890
in and regulate or legislate AI and make
sure it's equitable and then we have the

01:47:03.890 --> 01:47:03.900
sure it's equitable and then we have the
 

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:06.290
sure it's equitable and then we have the
problem with you know there's a minority

01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300
problem with you know there's a minority
 

01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:08.480
problem with you know there's a minority
of politicians who actually understand

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:08.490
of politicians who actually understand
 

01:47:08.490 --> 01:47:10.400
of politicians who actually understand
how AI works so are they the right

01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:10.410
how AI works so are they the right
 

01:47:10.410 --> 01:47:13.520
how AI works so are they the right
audience yeah I mean I think it's gonna

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:13.530
audience yeah I mean I think it's gonna
 

01:47:13.530 --> 01:47:16.070
audience yeah I mean I think it's gonna
have to be a mixed bag to say that

01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080
have to be a mixed bag to say that
 

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.640
have to be a mixed bag to say that
there's some kind of you know simple one

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:18.650
there's some kind of you know simple one
 

01:47:18.650 --> 01:47:22.670
there's some kind of you know simple one
unilateral way in which we can kind of

01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:22.680
unilateral way in which we can kind of
 

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:24.950
unilateral way in which we can kind of
ensure that this trust and

01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960
ensure that this trust and
 

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:26.450
ensure that this trust and
accountability is instilled in the

01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460
accountability is instilled in the
 

01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:27.920
accountability is instilled in the
system I think that would be crazy so

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:27.930
system I think that would be crazy so
 

01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:30.650
system I think that would be crazy so
it's gonna have to come in part from I

01:47:30.650 --> 01:47:30.660
it's gonna have to come in part from I
 

01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:33.080
it's gonna have to come in part from I
do think some amount of legislation or

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:33.090
do think some amount of legislation or
 

01:47:33.090 --> 01:47:35.270
do think some amount of legislation or
regulation because even talking about

01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280
regulation because even talking about
 

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.490
regulation because even talking about
the things that Ross is talking about

01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500
the things that Ross is talking about
 

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:38.930
the things that Ross is talking about
and some of the exciting things you

01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940
and some of the exciting things you
 

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:40.970
and some of the exciting things you
think about well if we think that the

01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980
think about well if we think that the
 

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:42.830
think about well if we think that the
landscape of a certain industry say the

01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840
landscape of a certain industry say the
 

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.600
landscape of a certain industry say the
healthcare industry already has

01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:44.610
healthcare industry already has
 

01:47:44.610 --> 01:47:47.510
healthcare industry already has
inequities in it so the soil for the

01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520
inequities in it so the soil for the
 

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.790
inequities in it so the soil for the
seed to be planted in is already maybe

01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800
seed to be planted in is already maybe
 

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.920
seed to be planted in is already maybe
not actually the most fertile for

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:51.930
not actually the most fertile for
 

01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:54.439
not actually the most fertile for
equality you probably are going to need

01:47:54.439 --> 01:47:54.449
equality you probably are going to need
 

01:47:54.449 --> 01:47:56.569
equality you probably are going to need
some kind of regulatory mechanism to

01:47:56.569 --> 01:47:56.579
some kind of regulatory mechanism to
 

01:47:56.579 --> 01:47:57.979
some kind of regulatory mechanism to
make sure the development of these of

01:47:57.979 --> 01:47:57.989
make sure the development of these of
 

01:47:57.989 --> 01:47:59.390
make sure the development of these of
these technologies is fair and that

01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400
these technologies is fair and that
 

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:02.359
these technologies is fair and that
might be pushing on antitrust law and

01:48:02.359 --> 01:48:02.369
might be pushing on antitrust law and
 

01:48:02.369 --> 01:48:04.279
might be pushing on antitrust law and
actually saying that what we cannot have

01:48:04.279 --> 01:48:04.289
actually saying that what we cannot have
 

01:48:04.289 --> 01:48:06.049
actually saying that what we cannot have
constant mergers and acquisitions so

01:48:06.049 --> 01:48:06.059
constant mergers and acquisitions so
 

01:48:06.059 --> 01:48:07.879
constant mergers and acquisitions so
that a few companies who can kind of

01:48:07.879 --> 01:48:07.889
that a few companies who can kind of
 

01:48:07.889 --> 01:48:09.469
that a few companies who can kind of
lobby for a position that's really

01:48:09.469 --> 01:48:09.479
lobby for a position that's really
 

01:48:09.479 --> 01:48:11.299
lobby for a position that's really
really good for them to deploy these

01:48:11.299 --> 01:48:11.309
really good for them to deploy these
 

01:48:11.309 --> 01:48:13.399
really good for them to deploy these
technologies rapidly without IRB or

01:48:13.399 --> 01:48:13.409
technologies rapidly without IRB or
 

01:48:13.409 --> 01:48:15.770
technologies rapidly without IRB or
without really good informed consent we

01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:15.780
without really good informed consent we
 

01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.479
without really good informed consent we
might need a way to prevent that at the

01:48:17.479 --> 01:48:17.489
might need a way to prevent that at the
 

01:48:17.489 --> 01:48:19.189
might need a way to prevent that at the
level of business but then we might also

01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199
level of business but then we might also
 

01:48:19.199 --> 01:48:21.140
level of business but then we might also
have to say that okay there's gonna be

01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:21.150
have to say that okay there's gonna be
 

01:48:21.150 --> 01:48:23.419
have to say that okay there's gonna be
minimum standards for what data use or

01:48:23.419 --> 01:48:23.429
minimum standards for what data use or
 

01:48:23.429 --> 01:48:25.189
minimum standards for what data use or

Alexander is talking about an IRB you're

01:48:29.899 --> 01:48:29.909
Alexander is talking about an IRB you're
 

01:48:29.909 --> 01:48:31.790
Alexander is talking about an IRB you're
you're actually agreeing to a very

01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800
you're actually agreeing to a very
 

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.649
you're actually agreeing to a very
specific study which you understand the

development and to my partners using
 

01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:47.060
development and to my partners using
this data and I do think that that is

01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:47.070
this data and I do think that that is
 

01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:49.310
this data and I do think that that is
gonna take then business leaders who say

01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320
gonna take then business leaders who say
 

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:52.129
gonna take then business leaders who say
okay actually enough with these you know

01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:52.139
okay actually enough with these you know
 

01:48:52.139 --> 01:48:53.719
okay actually enough with these you know
broad blanket provisions and they're

01:48:53.719 --> 01:48:53.729
broad blanket provisions and they're
 

01:48:53.729 --> 01:48:54.979
broad blanket provisions and they're
gonna have to have some potential

01:48:54.979 --> 01:48:54.989
gonna have to have some potential
 

01:48:54.989 --> 01:48:57.229
gonna have to have some potential
pressure from maybe somebody on the

01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239
pressure from maybe somebody on the
 

01:48:57.239 --> 01:48:59.779
pressure from maybe somebody on the
litigation side or regulators saying

01:48:59.779 --> 01:48:59.789
litigation side or regulators saying
 

01:48:59.789 --> 01:49:01.399
litigation side or regulators saying
that hey if things don't clean up we're

01:49:01.399 --> 01:49:01.409
that hey if things don't clean up we're
 

01:49:01.409 --> 01:49:03.290
that hey if things don't clean up we're
actually going to have to change the way

01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:03.300
actually going to have to change the way
 

01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:04.910
actually going to have to change the way
that consent works and then maybe they

01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920
that consent works and then maybe they
 

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.109
that consent works and then maybe they
should say well we have to be more

01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119
should say well we have to be more
 

01:49:06.119 --> 01:49:08.449
should say well we have to be more
specific named who our partners are or

01:49:08.449 --> 01:49:08.459
specific named who our partners are or
 

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:10.819
specific named who our partners are or
named what exact things were actually

01:49:10.819 --> 01:49:10.829
named what exact things were actually
 

01:49:10.829 --> 01:49:12.770
named what exact things were actually
going to do with your data so people

01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:12.780
going to do with your data so people
 

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.569
going to do with your data so people
have a way to to meaningfully choose

01:49:14.569 --> 01:49:14.579
have a way to to meaningfully choose
 

01:49:14.579 --> 01:49:15.919
have a way to to meaningfully choose
because right now I wouldn't I would say

01:49:15.919 --> 01:49:15.929
because right now I wouldn't I would say
 

01:49:15.929 --> 01:49:17.719
because right now I wouldn't I would say
that there's a consent procedure but the

01:49:17.719 --> 01:49:17.729
that there's a consent procedure but the
 

01:49:17.729 --> 01:49:19.580
that there's a consent procedure but the
informed parts been slashed for the most

01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:19.590
informed parts been slashed for the most
 

01:49:19.590 --> 01:49:21.080
informed parts been slashed for the most
part but then there's also

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:21.090
part but then there's also
 

01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:23.540
part but then there's also
responsibility I think on on us as a

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:23.550
responsibility I think on on us as a
 

01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:25.819
responsibility I think on on us as a
public which maybe is an educational

01:49:25.819 --> 01:49:25.829
public which maybe is an educational
 

01:49:25.829 --> 01:49:27.609
public which maybe is an educational
responsibility to become literate and

01:49:27.609 --> 01:49:27.619
responsibility to become literate and
 

01:49:27.619 --> 01:49:30.890
responsibility to become literate and
data literate and understanding things

01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:30.900
data literate and understanding things
 

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.600
data literate and understanding things
that are really complicated right now

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:32.610
that are really complicated right now
 

01:49:32.610 --> 01:49:34.310
that are really complicated right now
and I don't want to put too much of an

01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320
and I don't want to put too much of an
 

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.870
and I don't want to put too much of an
onus on people that you have to go out

01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880
onus on people that you have to go out
 

01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:37.339
onus on people that you have to go out
and start reading up on machine learning

01:49:37.339 --> 01:49:37.349
and start reading up on machine learning
 

01:49:37.349 --> 01:49:40.069
and start reading up on machine learning
books but I do think people developing a

01:49:40.069 --> 01:49:40.079
books but I do think people developing a
 

01:49:40.079 --> 01:49:41.750
books but I do think people developing a
consciousness that when you put a photo

01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760
consciousness that when you put a photo
 

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.689
consciousness that when you put a photo
out there that there might actually be a

01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699
out there that there might actually be a
 

01:49:44.699 --> 01:49:46.819
out there that there might actually be a
way to make an inference about medical

01:49:46.819 --> 01:49:46.829
way to make an inference about medical
 

01:49:46.829 --> 01:49:49.160
way to make an inference about medical
information from a photo I think a lot

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:49.170
information from a photo I think a lot
 

01:49:49.170 --> 01:49:51.259
information from a photo I think a lot
of people don't even really know that or

01:49:51.259 --> 01:49:51.269
of people don't even really know that or
 

01:49:51.269 --> 01:49:52.969
of people don't even really know that or
can't connect those dots and so I do

01:49:52.969 --> 01:49:52.979
can't connect those dots and so I do
 

01:49:52.979 --> 01:49:55.640
can't connect those dots and so I do
think that's where I think academia and

01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:55.650
think that's where I think academia and
 

01:49:55.650 --> 01:49:57.439
think that's where I think academia and
educators probably have a responsibility

01:49:57.439 --> 01:49:57.449
educators probably have a responsibility
 

01:49:57.449 --> 01:49:59.719
educators probably have a responsibility
to their public to making sure as we're

01:49:59.719 --> 01:49:59.729
to their public to making sure as we're
 

01:49:59.729 --> 01:50:01.489
to their public to making sure as we're
developing these new techniques are we

01:50:01.489 --> 01:50:01.499
developing these new techniques are we
 

01:50:01.499 --> 01:50:03.439
developing these new techniques are we
actually doing outreach that helps

01:50:03.439 --> 01:50:03.449
actually doing outreach that helps
 

01:50:03.449 --> 01:50:05.239
actually doing outreach that helps
people understand the capabilities of

01:50:05.239 --> 01:50:05.249
people understand the capabilities of
 

01:50:05.249 --> 01:50:06.670
people understand the capabilities of
what their society around

01:50:06.670 --> 01:50:06.680
what their society around
 

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:10.390
what their society around
is becoming and so and so and I think of

01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400
is becoming and so and so and I think of
 

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.010
is becoming and so and so and I think of
course the the last pieces with

course the the last pieces with
 

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:14.800

academics and both Rossi and Alex are
 

01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:17.770
academics and both Rossi and Alex are
great examples of this but academics who

01:50:17.770 --> 01:50:17.780
great examples of this but academics who
 

01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:19.570

also continually to challenge those

01:50:19.570 --> 01:50:19.580
also continually to challenge those
 

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:21.100
also continually to challenge those
questions as they're doing the research

01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:21.110
questions as they're doing the research
 

01:50:21.110 --> 01:50:24.300
questions as they're doing the research
and put into place early on a priori to

offering up a paper of a new technique

01:50:26.710 --> 01:50:26.720
offering up a paper of a new technique
 

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.930
offering up a paper of a new technique
also putting in here's the questions you

01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:28.940
also putting in here's the questions you
 

01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:30.460
also putting in here's the questions you
should interrogate of this technique

01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:30.470
should interrogate of this technique
 

01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:32.470
should interrogate of this technique
before it's commercialized before it's

before it's commercialized before it's
 

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:34.330
before it's commercialized before it's
done at scale and having those questions

01:50:34.330 --> 01:50:34.340
done at scale and having those questions
 

01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:35.830
done at scale and having those questions
up front so that somebody doesn't have

01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840
up front so that somebody doesn't have

an excuse later to go back and say well

01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:37.880
an excuse later to go back and say well

oh I had no idea should ask that

01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:39.380
oh I had no idea should ask that
 

01:50:39.380 --> 01:50:40.840
oh I had no idea should ask that
question which I think a lot is what

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:40.850
question which I think a lot is what
 

01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:43.240
question which I think a lot is what
happens now people go wrap it forward

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:43.250
happens now people go wrap it forward
 

01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:45.010
happens now people go wrap it forward
and then once the question arises here

01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:45.020
and then once the question arises here
 

01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.510
and then once the question arises here
becomes obvious it's like oh man I

01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:46.520
becomes obvious it's like oh man I

something but we could potentially

01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:49.880
something but we could potentially
 

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.640
something but we could potentially
preempt that a bit by making that part

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:51.650
preempt that a bit by making that part
 

01:50:51.650 --> 01:50:54.160
preempt that a bit by making that part
of the research process so we talked

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:54.170
of the research process so we talked
 

01:50:54.170 --> 01:50:55.810
of the research process so we talked
about all the possible things that could

01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:55.820
about all the possible things that could
 

01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.900
about all the possible things that could
go wrong and Alex I was hoping you would

01:50:58.900 --> 01:50:58.910
go wrong and Alex I was hoping you would
 

01:50:58.910 --> 01:51:00.370
go wrong and Alex I was hoping you would
talk about you know how do we measure

01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:00.380
talk about you know how do we measure
 

01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:04.360
talk about you know how do we measure
fairness and what examples do we have of

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:04.370
fairness and what examples do we have of
 

01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:06.460

impact and and can you talk a little
 

01:51:09.230 --> 01:51:11.080

about your work with the Allegheny

01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:11.090
about your work with the Allegheny
 

01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:14.920

meeting this progressive reform goal at
 

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:44.990
meeting this progressive reform goal at

defenders and the individuals who are
 

01:53:48.090 --> 01:53:49.940
defenders and the individuals who are
being detained by these systems so if

01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:49.950
being detained by these systems so if
 

01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:51.650
being detained by these systems so if
you look at some of the early results

01:53:51.650 --> 01:53:51.660
you look at some of the early results
 

01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.570
you look at some of the early results
from New Jersey who recently replaced

01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:53.580
from New Jersey who recently replaced
 

01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:57.260
from New Jersey who recently replaced
their monetary bond system with risk

01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:57.270
their monetary bond system with risk
 

01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:59.630
their monetary bond system with risk
assessment this evolved a lot more

01:53:59.630 --> 01:53:59.640
assessment this evolved a lot more
 

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:01.730
assessment this evolved a lot more
process reform than simply putting in a

01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:01.740
process reform than simply putting in a
 

01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:03.440
process reform than simply putting in a
risk assessment score and saying go

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:03.450
risk assessment score and saying go
 

01:54:03.450 --> 01:54:05.420
risk assessment score and saying go
everything's fixed but at the same time

01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:05.430
everything's fixed but at the same time
 

01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:07.360
everything's fixed but at the same time
this is something where we're seeing

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:07.370
this is something where we're seeing
 

01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:10.340
this is something where we're seeing
we're replacing a root cause of

01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:10.350
we're replacing a root cause of
 

01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:12.380
we're replacing a root cause of

something else so I have one more

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:18.330
something else so I have one more
 

01:54:18.330 --> 01:54:19.940
something else so I have one more
question and then we're gonna open that

01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:19.950
question and then we're gonna open that
 

01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:23.180
question and then we're gonna open that
up for audience questions and so my

01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:23.190
up for audience questions and so my
 

01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:24.840
up for audience questions and so my
question is

01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:24.850
question is
 

01:54:24.850 --> 01:54:28.240
question is
the European Union is about to put in

01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:28.250
the European Union is about to put in
 

01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:30.280
the European Union is about to put in
this new data protection law the general

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:30.290
this new data protection law the general
 

01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:32.800
this new data protection law the general
data protection regulation and one of

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:32.810
data protection regulation and one of
 

01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:35.080
data protection regulation and one of
the stipulations is that citizens have

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:35.090
the stipulations is that citizens have
 

01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:37.510
the stipulations is that citizens have
the right to not to be subject to

the right to not to be subject to
algorithmic processing if it will

01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:40.310
algorithmic processing if it will
 

01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:42.729
algorithmic processing if it will
significantly impact them and they also

01:54:42.729 --> 01:54:42.739
significantly impact them and they also
 

01:54:42.739 --> 01:54:45.430
significantly impact them and they also
have the right to explanation about what

01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440
have the right to explanation about what
 

01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.170
have the right to explanation about what
criteria the algorithm used to make a

01:54:47.170 --> 01:54:47.180
criteria the algorithm used to make a
 

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:49.390
criteria the algorithm used to make a
decision about them and I'm interested

01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400
decision about them and I'm interested
 

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:51.100
decision about them and I'm interested
in what you think about that and what

01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:51.110
in what you think about that and what
 

01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:52.570
in what you think about that and what
you think the impact of that's gonna be

01:54:52.570 --> 01:54:52.580
you think the impact of that's gonna be
 

01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:54.670
you think the impact of that's gonna be
and whether you think we should have

01:54:54.670 --> 01:54:54.680
and whether you think we should have
 

01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:04.620
and whether you think we should have
that in the United States so I think any

01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:04.630
that in the United States so I think any
 

01:55:04.630 --> 01:55:07.720
that in the United States so I think any
movement that really looks at the rights

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:07.730
movement that really looks at the rights
 

01:55:07.730 --> 01:55:11.260
movement that really looks at the rights
of human beings and in the case of

01:55:11.260 --> 01:55:11.270
of human beings and in the case of
 

01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:12.760
of human beings and in the case of
health care the rights of patients and

01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:12.770
health care the rights of patients and
 

01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:15.250
health care the rights of patients and
consumers is a good good movement it's

01:55:15.250 --> 01:55:15.260
consumers is a good good movement it's
 

01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:17.830
consumers is a good good movement it's
good to ask questions right it'll be

01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840
good to ask questions right it'll be
 

01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:19.270
good to ask questions right it'll be
interesting to see how it plays out in

01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280
interesting to see how it plays out in
 

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.570
interesting to see how it plays out in
in the European Union to be very honest

01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:21.580
in the European Union to be very honest
 

01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:23.860
in the European Union to be very honest
you know perhaps we have the luxury of

01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:23.870
you know perhaps we have the luxury of
 

01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:25.750
you know perhaps we have the luxury of
standing back and really looking at

01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760
standing back and really looking at
 

01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.040
standing back and really looking at
what's worked and what's not worked

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:27.050
what's worked and what's not worked
 

01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:28.960
what's worked and what's not worked
maybe taking some of the best aspects of

01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:28.970
maybe taking some of the best aspects of
 

01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:30.550
maybe taking some of the best aspects of
that maybe modifying it for the United

01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560
that maybe modifying it for the United
 

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.550
that maybe modifying it for the United
States the notion in healthcare in

01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:33.560
States the notion in healthcare in
 

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.070
States the notion in healthcare in
general you know those reference earlier

01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080
general you know those reference earlier
 

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.250
general you know those reference earlier
this earlier speaker mentioned

01:55:38.250 --> 01:55:38.260
this earlier speaker mentioned
 

01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:42.729
this earlier speaker mentioned
participatory and and in and in making

01:55:42.729 --> 01:55:42.739
participatory and and in and in making
 

01:55:42.739 --> 01:55:44.560
participatory and and in and in making
the process more participatory I think

01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:44.570
the process more participatory I think
 

01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:46.750
the process more participatory I think
that's a good notion in healthcare in

01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760
that's a good notion in healthcare in
 

01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:49.360
that's a good notion in healthcare in
particular healthcare traditionally has

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:49.370
particular healthcare traditionally has
 

01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:52.570
particular healthcare traditionally has
been very paternalistic right you go to

01:55:52.570 --> 01:55:52.580
been very paternalistic right you go to
 

01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:54.670
been very paternalistic right you go to
a doctor's office and you expect for

01:55:54.670 --> 01:55:54.680
a doctor's office and you expect for
 

01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.020
a doctor's office and you expect for
care to be provided to you there's

01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:56.030
care to be provided to you there's
 

01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:59.560
care to be provided to you there's
almost a god complex of sorts between

01:55:59.560 --> 01:55:59.570
almost a god complex of sorts between
 

01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:02.290
almost a god complex of sorts between
the physician and the patient and also

01:56:02.290 --> 01:56:02.300
the physician and the patient and also
 

01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:03.670
the physician and the patient and also
between the patient and the physician it

01:56:03.670 --> 01:56:03.680
between the patient and the physician it
 

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:06.370
between the patient and the physician it
goes both ways and it's changing right

01:56:06.370 --> 01:56:06.380
goes both ways and it's changing right
 

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:06.610
goes both ways and it's changing right
now

01:56:06.610 --> 01:56:06.620
now
 

01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:08.680
now
you know consumers they go out and see

01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:08.690
you know consumers they go out and see
 

01:56:08.690 --> 01:56:10.300
you know consumers they go out and see
doctor Google before they go see dr.

01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:10.310
doctor Google before they go see dr.
 

01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:13.150
doctor Google before they go see dr.
Shrestha or my peers and that's a good

01:56:13.150 --> 01:56:13.160
Shrestha or my peers and that's a good
 

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.890
Shrestha or my peers and that's a good
thing right we're more connected we're

01:56:14.890 --> 01:56:14.900
thing right we're more connected we're
 

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:16.840
thing right we're more connected we're
more leaning in more more curious we're

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:16.850
more leaning in more more curious we're
 

01:56:16.850 --> 01:56:19.120
more leaning in more more curious we're
more participatory than we've ever been

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:19.130
more participatory than we've ever been
 

01:56:19.130 --> 01:56:19.750
more participatory than we've ever been
before

01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760
before
 

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:22.240
before
and that's that I think a good thing I

01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:22.250
and that's that I think a good thing I
 

01:56:22.250 --> 01:56:24.520
and that's that I think a good thing I
think what we can do however is we can

01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:24.530
think what we can do however is we can
 

01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:26.650
think what we can do however is we can
take the power of these algorithms to

01:56:26.650 --> 01:56:26.660
take the power of these algorithms to
 

01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:29.080
take the power of these algorithms to
further inform us because the notion of

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:29.090
further inform us because the notion of
 

01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:32.260
further inform us because the notion of
equity is not just one of providing

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:32.270
equity is not just one of providing
 

01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:34.450
equity is not just one of providing
access it's also one of empowering

01:56:34.450 --> 01:56:34.460
access it's also one of empowering
 

01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:37.560
access it's also one of empowering
consumers with tools incapable

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:37.570
consumers with tools incapable
 

01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:39.260
consumers with tools incapable
to make better and more informed

01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:39.270
to make better and more informed
 

01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:41.250
to make better and more informed
decisions about themselves and their

01:56:41.250 --> 01:56:41.260
decisions about themselves and their
 

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:43.260
decisions about themselves and their
loved ones and that's really the pursuit

01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:43.270
loved ones and that's really the pursuit
 

01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:45.240
loved ones and that's really the pursuit
that we're pushing forward with in terms

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:45.250
that we're pushing forward with in terms
 

01:56:45.250 --> 01:56:47.069
that we're pushing forward with in terms
of innovation in healthcare so overall

01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079
of innovation in healthcare so overall
 

01:56:47.079 --> 01:56:48.810
of innovation in healthcare so overall
it's a good thing you know we'll watch

01:56:48.810 --> 01:56:48.820
it's a good thing you know we'll watch
 

01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:51.240
it's a good thing you know we'll watch
and see what the Europeans do but to

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:51.250
and see what the Europeans do but to
 

01:56:51.250 --> 01:56:52.649
and see what the Europeans do but to
question this to make sure that we're

01:56:52.649 --> 01:56:52.659
question this to make sure that we're
 

01:56:52.659 --> 01:56:54.660
question this to make sure that we're
able to you know speak to the specific

01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:54.670
able to you know speak to the specific
 

01:56:54.670 --> 01:56:57.479
able to you know speak to the specific
rights of the individuals it's it's it's

01:56:57.479 --> 01:56:57.489
rights of the individuals it's it's it's
 

01:56:57.489 --> 01:57:00.030
rights of the individuals it's it's it's
a good thing I'm fascinated by this

01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:00.040
a good thing I'm fascinated by this
 

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:01.160
a good thing I'm fascinated by this
because I'm interested whether

01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:01.170
because I'm interested whether
 

01:57:01.170 --> 01:57:03.180
because I'm interested whether
individual Europeans are gonna challenge

01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:03.190
individual Europeans are gonna challenge
 

01:57:03.190 --> 01:57:05.729
individual Europeans are gonna challenge
you know algorithmic voter profiling and

01:57:05.729 --> 01:57:05.739
you know algorithmic voter profiling and
 

01:57:05.739 --> 01:57:09.209
you know algorithmic voter profiling and
advertising for example yeah I think

01:57:09.209 --> 01:57:09.219
advertising for example yeah I think
 

01:57:09.219 --> 01:57:11.669
advertising for example yeah I think
that that's the right to the explanation

01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679
that that's the right to the explanation
 

01:57:11.679 --> 01:57:13.169
that that's the right to the explanation
explanation is one of those interesting

01:57:13.169 --> 01:57:13.179
explanation is one of those interesting
 

01:57:13.179 --> 01:57:15.870
explanation is one of those interesting
parts because right now you know say in

01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880
parts because right now you know say in
 

01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:18.270
parts because right now you know say in
credit reporting we actually do have

01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:18.280
credit reporting we actually do have
 

01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:20.490
credit reporting we actually do have
auditing procedures that you have to go

01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:20.500
auditing procedures that you have to go
 

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.810
auditing procedures that you have to go
through to show that you're doing fair

01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:21.820
through to show that you're doing fair
 

01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:23.780
through to show that you're doing fair
credit reporting and similarly with like

01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:23.790
credit reporting and similarly with like
 

01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:26.910
credit reporting and similarly with like
investment transactions through the SCC

01:57:26.910 --> 01:57:26.920
investment transactions through the SCC
 

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:29.189
investment transactions through the SCC
although I've heard a lot of bad things

01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199
although I've heard a lot of bad things
 

01:57:29.199 --> 01:57:31.319
although I've heard a lot of bad things
about those audits I do believe it's

01:57:31.319 --> 01:57:31.329
about those audits I do believe it's
 

01:57:31.329 --> 01:57:32.879
about those audits I do believe it's
good that the audits are in place and

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:32.889
good that the audits are in place and
 

01:57:32.889 --> 01:57:34.890
good that the audits are in place and
yet there's no real audits for how we

01:57:34.890 --> 01:57:34.900
yet there's no real audits for how we
 

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:36.810
yet there's no real audits for how we
train AI systems or anything and I think

01:57:36.810 --> 01:57:36.820
train AI systems or anything and I think
 

01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:38.399
train AI systems or anything and I think
the right to an explanation is going to

01:57:38.399 --> 01:57:38.409
the right to an explanation is going to
 

01:57:38.409 --> 01:57:41.160
the right to an explanation is going to
be good insofar as I'm not sure how much

01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:41.170
be good insofar as I'm not sure how much
 

01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:42.930
be good insofar as I'm not sure how much
teeth that's gonna end up having we'll

01:57:42.930 --> 01:57:42.940
teeth that's gonna end up having we'll
 

01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:45.030
teeth that's gonna end up having we'll
see but I do think it will at least get

01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040
see but I do think it will at least get
 

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.649
see but I do think it will at least get
people starting to figure out well how

01:57:46.649 --> 01:57:46.659
people starting to figure out well how
 

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:48.300
people starting to figure out well how
do we even generate an explanation

01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:48.310
do we even generate an explanation
 

01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:51.089
do we even generate an explanation
what does useful audit actually look

01:57:51.089 --> 01:57:51.099
what does useful audit actually look
 

01:57:51.099 --> 01:57:52.919
what does useful audit actually look
like what information should be in place

01:57:52.919 --> 01:57:52.929
like what information should be in place
 

01:57:52.929 --> 01:57:55.919
like what information should be in place
for a court or for a judge to be able to

01:57:55.919 --> 01:57:55.929
for a court or for a judge to be able to
 

01:57:55.929 --> 01:57:57.750
for a court or for a judge to be able to
actually think meaningfully about what

01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760
actually think meaningfully about what
 

01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:59.970
actually think meaningfully about what
happened but the piece that I'm most

01:57:59.970 --> 01:57:59.980
happened but the piece that I'm most
 

01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:01.770
happened but the piece that I'm most
interested in actually is actually the

01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:01.780
interested in actually is actually the
 

01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:05.160
interested in actually is actually the
data Portability piece of this and

01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:05.170
data Portability piece of this and
 

01:58:05.170 --> 01:58:07.890
data Portability piece of this and
that's because right now obviously once

01:58:07.890 --> 01:58:07.900
that's because right now obviously once
 

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:11.700
that's because right now obviously once
you grow a huge user base even if you

01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:11.710
you grow a huge user base even if you
 

01:58:11.710 --> 01:58:13.169
you grow a huge user base even if you
find out that the company who has that

01:58:13.169 --> 01:58:13.179
find out that the company who has that
 

01:58:13.179 --> 01:58:14.700
find out that the company who has that
user base isn't really doing the best

01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:14.710
user base isn't really doing the best
 

01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:16.830
user base isn't really doing the best
things they have all the data and the

01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:16.840
things they have all the data and the
 

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:19.050
things they have all the data and the
data is the power in the case of AI and

01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:19.060
data is the power in the case of AI and
 

01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:20.939
data is the power in the case of AI and
I think data Portability is a very

01:58:20.939 --> 01:58:20.949
I think data Portability is a very
 

01:58:20.949 --> 01:58:22.530
I think data Portability is a very
interesting part of this of whether

01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:22.540
interesting part of this of whether
 

01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.359
interesting part of this of whether
really it's going to come down that

01:58:24.359 --> 01:58:24.369
really it's going to come down that
 

01:58:24.369 --> 01:58:27.000
really it's going to come down that
people have to allow you to export and

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:27.010
people have to allow you to export and
 

01:58:27.010 --> 01:58:28.950
people have to allow you to export and
move your data over into other services

01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960
move your data over into other services
 

01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:31.950
move your data over into other services
because this would allow actually a real

01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:31.960
because this would allow actually a real
 

01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:33.870
because this would allow actually a real
competitive force potentially to take

01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880
competitive force potentially to take
 

01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:35.490
competitive force potentially to take
place when Facebook suddenly does

01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:35.500
place when Facebook suddenly does
 

01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.229
place when Facebook suddenly does
something that people aren't so happy

01:58:37.229 --> 01:58:37.239
something that people aren't so happy
 

01:58:37.239 --> 01:58:39.600
something that people aren't so happy
about if Facebook is forced through the

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:39.610
about if Facebook is forced through the
 

01:58:39.610 --> 01:58:42.149
about if Facebook is forced through the
gdpr to actually have a way to export

01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159
gdpr to actually have a way to export
 

01:58:42.159 --> 01:58:43.979
gdpr to actually have a way to export
their data into a new social media

01:58:43.979 --> 01:58:43.989
their data into a new social media
 

01:58:43.989 --> 01:58:46.350
their data into a new social media
platform suddenly you could have smaller

01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:46.360
platform suddenly you could have smaller
 

01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.030
platform suddenly you could have smaller
groups show up and say well we're gonna

under gdpr they're gonna also have to
give you if you ask your algorithmic

01:59:12.090 --> 01:59:12.100
give you if you ask your algorithmic
 

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:14.040

about you and so far I haven't seen that

01:59:16.050 --> 01:59:16.060
about you and so far I haven't seen that
 

01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:17.640
about you and so far I haven't seen that
being portable so we're gonna have a

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:17.650
being portable so we're gonna have a
 

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:19.110
being portable so we're gonna have a
lightning round where I ask a few

01:59:19.110 --> 01:59:19.120
lightning round where I ask a few
 

01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.120
lightning round where I ask a few
questions and you can like take 30

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:21.130
questions and you can like take 30
 

01:59:21.130 --> 01:59:23.520
questions and you can like take 30
seconds to answer so one of the

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:23.530
seconds to answer so one of the
 

01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:26.850
seconds to answer so one of the
questions is is there a sense that we

01:59:26.850 --> 01:59:26.860
questions is is there a sense that we
 

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:29.130
questions is is there a sense that we
might seriously need equity of being

01:59:29.130 --> 01:59:29.140
might seriously need equity of being
 

01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:32.640
might seriously need equity of being
able to avoid a in certain circumstances

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:32.650
able to avoid a in certain circumstances
 

01:59:32.650 --> 01:59:34.830
able to avoid a in certain circumstances
so are there any circumstances in which

01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:34.840
so are there any circumstances in which
 

01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.310
so are there any circumstances in which
we should prohibit the use of AI or

01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320
we should prohibit the use of AI or
 

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:39.570
we should prohibit the use of AI or
where we don't want to develop a life

01:59:39.570 --> 01:59:39.580
where we don't want to develop a life
 

01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:45.240
where we don't want to develop a life
for that purpose I might steal Michaels

01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:45.250
for that purpose I might steal Michaels
 

01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:46.650
for that purpose I might steal Michaels
response here because we were just

01:59:46.650 --> 01:59:46.660
response here because we were just
 

01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:48.930
response here because we were just
talking about this question earlier but

01:59:48.930 --> 01:59:48.940
talking about this question earlier but
 

01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:51.630
talking about this question earlier but
my view is that there are certain times

01:59:51.630 --> 01:59:51.640
my view is that there are certain times
 

01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:56.190
my view is that there are certain times
when it's difficult to put all of our

01:59:56.190 --> 01:59:56.200
when it's difficult to put all of our
 

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.650
when it's difficult to put all of our
values into a single objective that the

01:59:58.650 --> 01:59:58.660
values into a single objective that the
 

01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:01.170
values into a single objective that the
ASIS the AI system would then optimize

02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:01.180
ASIS the AI system would then optimize
 

02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:03.540
ASIS the AI system would then optimize
for and so to the extent that we need

02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:03.550
for and so to the extent that we need
 

02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:05.730
for and so to the extent that we need
additional controls over and above the

02:00:05.730 --> 02:00:05.740
additional controls over and above the
 

02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:07.410
additional controls over and above the
specific objective that the AI is

02:00:07.410 --> 02:00:07.420
specific objective that the AI is
 

02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:09.210
specific objective that the AI is
optimizing I think that's a place where

02:00:09.210 --> 02:00:09.220
optimizing I think that's a place where
 

02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:11.610
optimizing I think that's a place where
we should either not rely on it at all

02:00:11.610 --> 02:00:11.620
we should either not rely on it at all
 

02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:13.680
we should either not rely on it at all
if no part of our objective can be

02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:13.690
if no part of our objective can be
 

02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:16.170
if no part of our objective can be
formalized in this way or rely on it

02:00:16.170 --> 02:00:16.180
formalized in this way or rely on it
 

02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:17.790
formalized in this way or rely on it
with human guidance if there are certain

02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:17.800
with human guidance if there are certain
 

02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:20.630
with human guidance if there are certain
aspects that still require human control

02:00:20.630 --> 02:00:20.640
aspects that still require human control
 

02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:25.380
aspects that still require human control
questions for you it says if a is judged

02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:25.390
questions for you it says if a is judged
 

02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:27.990
questions for you it says if a is judged
as a tool rather than an experimental

02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000
as a tool rather than an experimental
 

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.120
as a tool rather than an experimental
treatment an IRB is not relevant

02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:30.130
treatment an IRB is not relevant
 

02:00:30.130 --> 02:00:32.220
treatment an IRB is not relevant
so what internal policy should

02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:32.230
so what internal policy should
 

02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:36.080
so what internal policy should
healthcare providers have in place I

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:36.090
 

02:00:36.090 --> 02:00:38.760
think the specific guideline that we

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:38.770
think the specific guideline that we
 

02:00:38.770 --> 02:00:41.640
think the specific guideline that we
should have in place is one of our moral

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:41.650
should have in place is one of our moral
 

02:00:41.650 --> 02:00:44.970
should have in place is one of our moral
objectives right so why is it that we're

02:00:44.970 --> 02:00:44.980
objectives right so why is it that we're
 

02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:46.670
objectives right so why is it that we're
doing what it is that we're doing and

02:00:46.670 --> 02:00:46.680
doing what it is that we're doing and
 

02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:48.900
doing what it is that we're doing and
when you when you think about it in the

02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:48.910
when you when you think about it in the
 

02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:50.610
when you when you think about it in the
context of what I just mentioned there

02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:50.620
context of what I just mentioned there
 

02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:52.800
context of what I just mentioned there
then it becomes clearer for us because

02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:52.810
then it becomes clearer for us because
 

02:00:52.810 --> 02:00:55.740
then it becomes clearer for us because
what we're talking about here is to

02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:55.750
what we're talking about here is to
 

02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:59.940
what we're talking about here is to
really push not artificial intelligence

02:00:59.940 --> 02:00:59.950
really push not artificial intelligence
 

02:00:59.950 --> 02:01:02.610
really push not artificial intelligence
and these algorithms that you know

02:01:02.610 --> 02:01:02.620
and these algorithms that you know
 

02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:04.770
and these algorithms that you know
would look at all of the data elements

02:01:04.770 --> 02:01:04.780
would look at all of the data elements
 

02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:05.910
would look at all of the data elements
and say alright you know here's what

02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920
and say alright you know here's what
 

02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:08.490
and say alright you know here's what
must be done for this human subject but

02:01:08.490 --> 02:01:08.500
must be done for this human subject but
 

02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:10.710
must be done for this human subject but
the specifics of what's in the best

02:01:10.710 --> 02:01:10.720
the specifics of what's in the best
 

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:13.320
the specifics of what's in the best
interests of this human being that's at

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:13.330
interests of this human being that's at
 

02:01:13.330 --> 02:01:17.910
interests of this human being that's at
the other end so I say this because when

02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920
the other end so I say this because when
 

02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.280
the other end so I say this because when
we look at artificial intelligence I

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:20.290
we look at artificial intelligence I
 

02:01:20.290 --> 02:01:23.670
we look at artificial intelligence I
look at artificial intelligence as less

02:01:23.670 --> 02:01:23.680
look at artificial intelligence as less
 

02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:26.010
look at artificial intelligence as less
about pushing the artificial mess of

one of the things that we need to be

02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:33.070
one of the things that we need to be
 

02:01:33.070 --> 02:01:35.520
one of the things that we need to be
doing is to making sure to be to be sure

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:35.530
doing is to making sure to be to be sure
 

02:01:35.530 --> 02:01:38.340
doing is to making sure to be to be sure
that we're accounting for all of the the

02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:38.350
that we're accounting for all of the the

that are in place and other things that
 

02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:08.010
that are in place and other things that
we absolutely have to look at it from a

02:02:08.010 --> 02:02:08.020
we absolutely have to look at it from a
 

02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:10.830
we absolutely have to look at it from a
very human perspective so there's things

02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:10.840
very human perspective so there's things
 

02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.780

better at the same time we really need

02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:18.430
better at the same time we really need

better at the same time we really need
to look at this with the lens of why it

02:02:20.970 --> 02:02:20.980
to look at this with the lens of why it
 

02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:22.410
to look at this with the lens of why it
is that we're pushing these algorithms

02:02:22.410 --> 02:02:22.420
is that we're pushing these algorithms
 

02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:24.360
is that we're pushing these algorithms
forward and what it is that we're we're

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:24.370
forward and what it is that we're we're

objectives so two more questions when

02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:29.470

02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:31.140
objectives so two more questions when
Alex this is for you what are the

02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:31.150
Alex this is for you what are the

Alex this is for you what are the
techniques used to remove biasness from

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:33.730
techniques used to remove biasness from
 

02:02:33.730 --> 02:02:38.220
techniques used to remove biasness from
AI systems knowledge of how the bias got

02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:38.230
AI systems knowledge of how the bias got
 

02:02:38.230 --> 02:02:40.140
AI systems knowledge of how the bias got
there in the first place so it's

02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:40.150
there in the first place so it's
 

02:02:40.150 --> 02:02:42.330
there in the first place so it's
oftentimes extremely easy to write down

02:02:42.330 --> 02:02:42.340
oftentimes extremely easy to write down
 

02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:44.340
oftentimes extremely easy to write down
the mathematical correction formula and

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:44.350
the mathematical correction formula and
 

02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:46.170
the mathematical correction formula and
it's extremely difficult to estimate all

02:02:46.170 --> 02:02:46.180
it's extremely difficult to estimate all
 

02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:48.090
it's extremely difficult to estimate all
the terms involved so without getting

02:02:48.090 --> 02:02:48.100
the terms involved so without getting
 

02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:49.890
the terms involved so without getting
too technical there is no

02:02:49.890 --> 02:02:49.900
too technical there is no
 

02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:51.930
too technical there is no
one-size-fits-all solution you really

02:02:51.930 --> 02:02:51.940
one-size-fits-all solution you really
 

02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:53.310
one-size-fits-all solution you really
need to understand what is the mechanism

02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:53.320
need to understand what is the mechanism
 

02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:56.250
need to understand what is the mechanism
by which that bias got into there and

02:02:56.250 --> 02:02:56.260
by which that bias got into there and
 

02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:59.330
by which that bias got into there and
that's in part why this area of kind of

02:02:59.330 --> 02:02:59.340
that's in part why this area of kind of

ethics and algorithms is so

02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:01.390
ethics and algorithms is so
 

02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:03.060
ethics and algorithms is so
interdisciplinary that we have a

02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:03.070
interdisciplinary that we have a
 

02:03:03.070 --> 02:03:04.890
interdisciplinary that we have a
tremendous amount of literature from the

there on our way to correction

02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:12.470
there on our way to correction
 

02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:17.380
there on our way to correction
and here's another question how will we

02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:17.390
and here's another question how will we
 

02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:19.990
and here's another question how will we
create safeguards against possible AI

02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000
create safeguards against possible AI
 

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.390

so what do we do if you're in China and

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:49.250
so what do we do if you're in China and
 

02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:51.220
so what do we do if you're in China and
you use your app to call a driverless

02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:51.230
you use your app to call a driverless

be a kind of public utility now so sort

02:04:03.670 --> 02:04:03.680
be a kind of public utility now so sort
 

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:08.080
be a kind of public utility now so sort
of that's my add to that question yeah I

02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:08.090
of that's my add to that question yeah I
 

02:04:08.090 --> 02:04:10.690
of that's my add to that question yeah I
mean I think that it's this is a huge

02:04:10.690 --> 02:04:10.700
mean I think that it's this is a huge
 

02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:12.400
mean I think that it's this is a huge

this and and what it the consequences of
 

02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:15.910
this and and what it the consequences of
that are and I think we have to be

02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920
that are and I think we have to be
 

02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:17.860
that are and I think we have to be
serious about making sure things that

02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:17.870
serious about making sure things that
 

02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:21.370
