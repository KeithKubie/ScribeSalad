00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.540
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon and welcome all

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.210
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.260
I'm Mary Jane Deeb,
Chief of the African

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.760
and Middle East Division
here at the library --

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.560
we're just upstairs -- and I'm
delighted to see everyone here

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.160
on this very rainy day.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.830
We are a division, one of
the many divisions here

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.900
at the library, which
is responsible

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.960
for 78 different countries
including all the countries

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.760
of Africa, the countries
of the Middle East,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.340
central Asia, the Caucuses.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.900
We're made up of three
divisions: the African,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.420
the Near East, and
the Hebraic section.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.180
And we collect materials
from the region,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.010
in the languages of the region.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.750
And we are a medium-sized
division of 20 people,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.660
specialists, people
who know the region,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.150
people who know the languages
and the culture of the people

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.820
of these 78 countries.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.610
And we are a -- we follow in a
way the mission of the library

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.010
which is we collect materials,
we process them, we share them,

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.440
we preserve them, and then we
serve them to our researchers.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.350
But then in addition to this
we do a number of other things.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.940
We have displays
of our collections

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.940
so that people can see
actually the items themselves.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.640
We invite the authors, the
writers of these books,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.780
and today is a case in point
with Ambassador Swanee Hunt.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.290
And the writers themselves
are very much part

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.360
of what we consider our library
family because they are the ones

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.030
who create these books.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.920
They are the ones who have
experienced the various

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.650
upheavals in the regions that we
cover and certainly the Africa

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.670
and Middle East Division,
the countries

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.360
for which they are responsible
have gone through a great deal

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.500
of turmoil and we can
say that one of the ones

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.120
that suffered most perhaps

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.310
in recent memory is
certainly Rwanda.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.420
And yet there is not enough that
has been written about Rwanda.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:10.090
There's not enough knowledge
in not only in the world

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.790
about Rwanda but even among
the scholarly community,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.980
even among those who
have studied it most.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.520
So when we invite speakers, you
know, we invite them to leave

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.270
after their discussion more
enlightened, more enriched,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.240
by their own experience,
by their own understanding

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.900
of the cultures and the people
they have encountered while

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.590
doing their work.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.510
We also increase
our own collections

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.920
by acquiring their books and
their research and sharing it

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.290
with patrons when they come.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.740
As I was mentioning, our
division has specialists

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.000
and each one of our
specialists focuses

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.440
on a number of countries.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.550
And among those in the African
section is Eve Ferguson,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.080
and Eve handles east
Africa in particular.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.280
She handles outreach,
acquisition, reference services

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.090
for the public and
also, as all of us are,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.710
we serve Congress,
our first patron.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:40.150
She also works on her own time
in the weekends and at night

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.480
as a freelance art writer
and she has taught literature

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.280
and writing at University
of the District of Columbia.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:56.020
It is Eve who has actually
organized this program

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.560
with Ambassador Hunt.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.130
But we are doubly
privileged today

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:12.530
by having also the Ambassador
of Rwanda, an exceptional woman.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.830
Ambassador Mukantabana is
also a friend of the speaker.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.030
And so we are thrice
blessed, if I may say so,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.330
by having together the
Ambassador of Rwanda speaking

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.240
with Ambassador Swanee
Hunt about a subject

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.060
that we are all learning
more about and need

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.360
to know more about today.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.380
And to introduce Ambassador
Hunt is our own Eve Ferguson.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.180
Thank you.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.500
[ Applause ]

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.880
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Good afternoon.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.410
I'm very glad to see people here
this very cold, rainy afternoon

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.180
for a very special program,
something I've wanted

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.600
to do for a long time.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.380
I am Eve Ferguson, Reference
Librarian for East Africa.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.850
This is the third program
I've done on Rwanda.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.010
The previous two were
on subjects that most

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.070
of us are familiar
about with Rwanda

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.290
and that is the 1994
Rwandan genocide.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.380
We did a film, "As We
Forgive," and we did a book,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.830
"Killing Neighbors,"
by Lee Ann Fujii.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.500
The film was by Laura
Waters Hinson.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.110
And I am really pleased today,
and it's always been my goal

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.000
to do a program on something
really good about Rwanda.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.320
So today we are going to hear
from Ambassador Swanee Hunt

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.230
in conversation with
Ambassador Mathilde Mukantabana

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.900
about what is good
going on in Rwanda.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.240
We know that there
are a lot of things

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.030
that are going well in Rwanda.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.090
Rwanda's economy is wonderful.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.730
The arts and culture of Rwanda
have always been notable

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:22.770
and just for my own interest
I have to mention Hillywood,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.090
the Rwandan film industry
which is now taking off

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.870
and making its mark on the
African continent and beyond.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.690
So there are wonderful
things happening in Rwanda

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.990
and today we're going

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.820
to celebrate those good
things happening in Rwanda

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.820
and they are happening
at the hands of women.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.750
And we know in so many instances
women are the peacemakers

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.840
in the world.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.960
We are the ones who bring
forth the next generations

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.960
and we are the ones who ensure

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.290
that those generations have a
fruitful and productive life.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.530
So with no further ado, let
me introduce our author today,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.700
Ambassador Swanee Hunt,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.970
the author of "Rwandan Women
Rising" among other books.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.710
You will see some of her books
in the display in the back,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:17.640
including her autobiography,
but let me give you a brief bio

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.590
of Ambassador Swanee Hunt.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.200
Swanee Hunt founded and
chairs Inclusive Security,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.610
a Washington-based
nonprofit whose bold goal is

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.380
to transform decision-making
about war and peace.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.630
Through government
constitution research,

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.560
leadership development,
and advocacy,

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.860
Inclusive Security
increases the participation

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.100
of all stakeholders,
particularly women,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.890
in preventing, resolving,
and rebuilding

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.020
after deadly conflicts.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.430
Her work in this area began
when, as the US Ambassador

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:58.760
to Austria from 1993 to
1997, she hosted negotiations

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.510
and international
symposia focused

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.890
on stabilizing the
neighboring Balkan states.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.160
Her fourth book, "Rwandan Women
Rising," which came out in May

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.950
of this year, explores how
including women leaders enabled

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.460
Rwanda to rebuild after
the 1994 genocide,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.590
setting a powerful example for
women -- sorry [laughing] --

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.220
powerful example for
countries across the world.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.470
Inclusive Security
is one program

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.380
of Swanee Hunt Alternatives, a
private foundation she created

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.960
in 1981 which also combats the
demand for illegal purchase sex,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.120
supports leaders of US social
movements, and advocates

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.530
for political parity of
women in elected office.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.920
At Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.660
Dr. Hunt is the Eleanor
Roosevelt Lecturer

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.960
in Public Policy, founder of the
Women in Public Policy Program,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.550
core faculty at the Center
for Public Leadership,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.410
and Senior Advisor at the
Carr Center for Human Rights.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.860
She holds two masters degrees,
a doctorate in theology,

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.480
and seven honorary degrees.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.470
A Dallas native, she is a
widely published commentator,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.710
photographer, and composer.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.220
She was married for 25
years to Charles Aunsbacher,

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.170
international conductor
in impresario.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.770
Her world includes their three
children and a menagerie of cat,

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:38.240
parrot, horses, bison,
and grandchildren.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.740
And I do want to add, though,

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:45.020
that she is also a renowned
celebrity in Denver, Colorado,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.230
where she lived for some time

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.120
and where part of
my family lives.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.660
So she is also considered
a Coloradan.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.300
So I would like to welcome
Ambassador Swanee Hunt

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.230
to say a few words about
our interviewer today,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.010
Ambassador Mathilde Mukantabana,
who changed her schedule

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.380
in order to be here with us
today for this special program.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.510
Thank you.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:18.220
[ Applause ]

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.520
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: I am
pleased tonight to be here

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:26.250
and to see several very
good old friends among you.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.410
And thank you, Eve.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.710
This is great.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.300
And thank you so much,
for inviting us to be here

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.990
in the beautiful, beautiful
Library of Congress.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.540
How did we first meet?

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.480
I don't exactly remember.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.430
It seems like we've always
been connected at the heart.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.730
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
Several years ago,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.910
when you invited
women at Harvard.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.210
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Oh yeah!

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.510
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Yeah.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.810
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Yeah.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.110
And be sure you speak
into this, right?

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.410
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Yeah.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.710
This. Yeah.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.010
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: You
have to turn it on.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.310
The -- do you see the switch?

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.530
Yes. I think that's it.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.530
Yeah, OK. I met Ambassador
Mukantabana and immediately knew

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:16.870
that I had come to know one
of the treasures of Rwanda.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.000
She will tell you more about
her experience but let me say

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.810
that she has a deep, deep
understanding of her country

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.870
and the forces inside
of her country

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.340
that have led to,
really, this book.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.870
And even though we didn't know
each other at that time --

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:42.480
and when she was there
to represent her country

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:48.280
to our country, you know,
that's a very, very big deal.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.740
And I was impressed
with the wisdom

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:59.330
of President Kagame back home
in choosing you because you have

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.360
such a deep understanding
of the United States,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.100
being tenured faculty
in history in California

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:14.900
and so I think having the larger
context in mind as you're able

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:21.200
to describe your country to our
country has been outstanding.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:30.530
And may I begin by reading a
short passage and then turn this

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.720
over to you for however you
want to conduct this interview?

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.020
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Hello.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.320
Thank you so much, Swanee.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.620
Please do.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.920
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Alright,
thank you.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.070
This is in the preface.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.540
And again, and I wanted
to leave you with this

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.110
because it gives you
a sense of the whole.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.040
Hundreds of conversations
I've had

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.190
over the past 16 years
revealed an untold tale.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:06.120
Laden with personal burdens
but driven by an ethic

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.350
of responsibility,
women stepped forward.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:15.180
In villages, mothers made
sure bodies were buried.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.240
One initiated a countrywide
adoption program

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.620
that found homes for nearly
100,000 children whose parents

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.360
were murdered.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:30.040
The stories of Rwandan women are
awe-inspiring in their passion

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.340
and startling in
their pragmatism.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.230
The people around me were
women, says Father Emmanuel,

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.990
a newly ordained priest who had
lost his family in the genocide.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.830
His first posting after
seminary was to a rural parish.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.350
Their church had been burned
then bulldozed with hundreds

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.500
of desperate people inside.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.020
Women helped me restrict
the parish, physically

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.090
and in terms of the community.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.170
The way I saw it, men
were more affected

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:07.460
by a violence even though I
think women suffered more.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.920
Afterward, men couldn't
do much but women saw

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.740
that they had no alternative.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:19.110
And then my words, as chaos
cracked open the culture,

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.190
women were no longer
confined to hold the positions

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.590
of influence solely
in their homes.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.070
Given the urgent needs
pressing all around them,

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.410
they expanded their leadership
at a revolutionary pace.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.850
Still, this wasn't a
feminist uprising by design.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:43.080
I think that's a really
interesting point for those

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.540
of us who have been part of a
feminist uprising by design.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.840
OK [laughing]?

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.450
We didn't immediately think
of creating an organization.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.040
Chantelle was a founding member

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.710
of a widows' organization
I visited in 2001,

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.590
now one of the most
influential civil society groups

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.860
in the country.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.160
She goes on.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.950
Most women in our
group were housewives

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.250
who hadn't had much schooling.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:13.380
We met because we
needed to, to listen

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.770
and understand each other.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.080
We needed to think
things through together,

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.350
like how to provide
for our children.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.650
And then my words.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:28.070
With a strong pull from the
new president, Paul Kagame,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:33.270
women pushed for female-friendly
policies and prominent positions

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.130
in the government, led
initiatives to cope

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.270
with the traumatic
aftermath of genocide,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:45.660
and establish businesses in
the extremely fragile economy.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.110
Many who had found their voices
at the national level returned

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.850
to their rural communities
to encourage more women

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.730
to vie for public office.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.660
These were women who
actually at that point were

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:05.280
in the parliament and instead
of simply enjoying their power,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:12.060
they actually went back to their
rural districts and worked very,

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.570
very hard to get
other women to run --

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:19.260
not just for parliament,
for any positions.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.740
In 2003, the first
election since the genocide,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:32.080
women won 48.8% of the seats in
the lower house and parliament,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.530
far surpassing the newly
mandated 30% quota.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:45.540
In 2008 they took even larger
strides, securing 56% of seats,

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.650
and became the first
parliament in history --

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.020
anywhere in the world --
with a female majority.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.920
Their gains were [inaudible]
political across society

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.490
when women took up
influential roles.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.460
Does anyone here know what the
percentage is now, after the --

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.760
&gt;&gt; Sixty-five.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.060
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Sixty-five.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.940
Wow. On a good day, 64-65.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.110
Right. Yes.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.410
Thank you for knowing thing.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.710
Now, isn't that astounding?

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:22.610
It's something that we across
the way here from US Congress,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.550
we have no sense of that.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.650
No sense at all.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.480
And so as we talk about they
did this and that in spite

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.380
of the genocide, etc., etc.,
there was this pull from the top

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.900
and this push up
from the bottom,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:47.880
I don't think we can have a
clue of what that really means

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.910
if we don't turn to
Ambassador Mukantabana.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.700
In 30 -- it would
be the equivalent

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.080
of 32 million Americans
being killed

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.090
by their neighbors this fall.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:06.850
Thirty-two million Americans
this fall being killed

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.150
by their neighbors.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:14.000
But we don't have any way
to conceptualize that.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.350
And yet, and yet you all,
you not only lived through it

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.960
but you surged into the opening.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.350
But surging into the
opening sounds too positive.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:34.910
Could you go back and give
us a sense of where you were,

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.220
what you heard, what you saw,

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.830
anything you want
about the genocide?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.150
And then, even though we've
read a lot about the genocide --

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:48.310
we've seen movies and we can go
on and talk about this but not

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:54.400
without you really rooting
us in the background.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.720
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
Thank you so much, Swanee.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.770
You read a very powerful passage

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.810
and I think it gives
a good beginning.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.590
And quite frankly,
I agree with you.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.250
You can't truly appreciate
what women have done

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.490
if you don't go back and
look at, you know, genocide,

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.690
and what happened in Rwanda.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:20.540
You just mention it but you
can imagine for a country

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.170
that is the size of
Maryland -- very small --

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.050
when a million people
die within three months,

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:33.890
not killed by any calamity from
outside, by their own neighbors.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.250
Three million people were
implicated in the genocide.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.920
And you find that you have death

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.170
but also people leaving
the country.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.250
You know, going to
neighboring countries

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.370
like the Congo, Tanzania,
and Uganda.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:55.320
So in the 1994-1995, it
was practically empty.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.780
You know, few survivors,
people coming back,

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.970
and the site was one
of blood, you know,

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.630
completely destroyed housing,
the few infrastructures

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.120
in existence but also
the bodies in the street.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.680
You know, I have to tell you

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.030
in this whole stuff I lost
70 people of my own family,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.610
including my own parents
and younger siblings.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:23.580
And until 2009 -- 2009, it
was almost like yesterday --

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.980
we were still going
back to bury the dead.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.510
We are still finding, you
know, hidden somewhere

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.430
because of a system of
justice that was telling people

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.250
to tell us where
the bodies were.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.530
So the country was
but all destroyed.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.880
And when we talk
about the destruction,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.180
it's not just about death.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.850
It's about all the institutions,
all the, you know --

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.880
when you can't count on your
own church because the majority

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.740
of the people died in
churches as you know.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.870
When, then, you can't
count on your own family.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.230
All the institutions were
completely affected by genocide.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.120
You couldn't trust the state.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.370
You couldn't trust the church.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.720
And as a matter of fact, as
we talk about the whole area

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.360
of reconstruction
and reconciliation,

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.200
just a few months
ago the president

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.600
of Rwanda met with the pope.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.090
And now we are trying to
put behind our understanding

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.290
about the church and
the brotherhood of men

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.590
and so on and so forth.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:26.260
So what I'm saying is that
our country lost the soul

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.560
of the people.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.640
We didn't really have much
to draw from, any experience,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.390
any roadmap to rebuild
the country.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.460
And when we come
back to the women,

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.930
for historical reasons
also, most women --

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.770
now in Rwanda they didn't
kill also the survivors.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:48.270
The gender ratio was
skewed because of genocide.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.270
The many left -- the others
were killed and we were left

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.620
with a higher percentage
of women.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.690
But even starting with that,
they were the ones who were left

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.250
to mend the fabric
of a broken society.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.990
They were married
to the killers.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.290
They were widows.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.580
They were, if anybody
who was victimized

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.130
by genocide it was the women.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.430
They were raped.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.520
We had a number of -- you
know, as a matter of fact,

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.440
if you go back and I know
that Eve would be interested

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.120
in knowing that there
is a movie on Rwanda

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.100
but on international
side, you know,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.090
called The Uncondemned
that has been shown.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.360
The women came to
testify in Tanzania

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.990
and now we know the crime

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.470
of rape is included
within genocide.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.930
So we find a nation
that was completely --

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.600
we say maybe there was a
light still left shining.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600
That's why we were still alive.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.900
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Right.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.200
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.600
And I think you can't
really find it anywhere else

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:50.880
but among the women who are able
to take chaff and grain and bad

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.310
and ugly and whatever
to mold, you know,

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.780
to put together families,
create new families,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.310
and also really started
the whole arduous journey

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.460
of rebuilding nation.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.670
And as you said, I would be
remiss if I don't also add

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.680
that we had a very
strong vision.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.440
We had leadership that was
intending to empower the women

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.310
as part of the whole
community in the empowerment

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.360
of all the people of
Rwanda to become agents

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.130
of their own destiny, to become
agents in the reconstruction.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.750
And women were central
in that particular area.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.240
So before I finish,
I want to say that,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.730
as we rebuild the nation -- and
I think Eve mentioned the fact

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.550
that Rwanda now is
doing pretty well.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.310
I'm not going to brag but
we are doing very well

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.110
for a country coming
out of genocide.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.930
And we've done even better
than what we were thinking.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:54.310
But retracing these steps of
women, writing about women

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.350
and their empowerment
is also part

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.670
of that reconstruction
we are talking about.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.970
So I need really to
give kudos to Swanee

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.540
because she took all this
time to write about women,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.520
to interview women, to see
how they have been there.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.870
This narrative of ascent
you were able to retrace

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.320
in your book and
thank you for that.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.620
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Thank you.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.650
Well I didn't mean it to
be a longitudinal study

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.220
but it turned out to be one.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.520
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Yes.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.460
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Because I went
in 2000 for the first time.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.430
But I don't want to gloss over
something that you said, and you

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.810
and I haven't talked about this
but when you said they went

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:36.100
to Tanzania to testify in the
court and now rape is, you know,

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:43.470
a crime of war -- actually, the
women who went from the village

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.680
of Tava, these are women
who had been gang-raped,

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.070
who had been raped until
they were unconscious,

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.120
who had been raped in the town
square, you know, 14 years old

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.260
and then impregnated,
etc. I mean,

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.880
these are horrible,
horrible stories.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.250
And then there's a woman social
worker who starts working

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:09.030
with them in a group
and helps them starting

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.380
to tell their stories
and support each other.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:17.050
Then you've got the
world court happening --

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.700
not the world court,
but the tribunal.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.490
You had tribunal
happening over in Arusha.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.710
And so the question becomes,
will any of them go and testify?

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.820
Now these are women
who are illiterate.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:35.160
They have never been
outside of their country.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:40.070
And they, with all they've
been through, they go over.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:47.100
They walk into a room that is
much, much more sterile than any

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.780
that they've ever seen.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.900
There are all these people in
these robes and they have --

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.290
they're speaking a
different language.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.750
I mean, everything
about it is set

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:03.080
up to be disempowering,
everything about it.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.380
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Right.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.940
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: And yet they
testify about what happened

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.240
to them -- which is a taboo.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.630
I mean, it's like -- so when
we say, "oh, and then they went

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.080
to Tanzania and testified,"
I mean,

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.030
that's such an example for me.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.290
And you take an example
like yours --

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.120
70 family members killed.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.490
That was all over the country.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.790
That isn't simply about
Mathilde Mukantabana.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.090
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
That's -- exactly.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.010
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: That was
all over the country --

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.510
the trauma and the,
what we would call PTSD.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.700
I mean, the whole
country was suffering

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.600
from post-traumatic stress.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.900
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
That's right.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.200
Yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.290
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Well, no,
that's enough for me to say.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.590
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: No, no.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.890
You said it very well.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.350
The whole country was suffering.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:57.600
There was no family in Rwanda or
no individual who was attached.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.510
You know, you can even imagine,
for instance, generations.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.180
When we talk about generations

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.580
and the incredible task
we still have to continue

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.060
because when you talk about
reconciliation, when you talk

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.000
about building a nation,
it's an ongoing situation

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.400
because you have children.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.790
Even, OK, two cases of
children I can give you.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.510
They are products of rape.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:26.370
You know, here you have a woman
who was victimized by somebody

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.060
who killed their husband
and you produce a child.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.950
So these kids are
coming of age right now.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.830
You can imagine the sense
of alienation they feel,

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.670
especially that sometimes
initially they were a constant

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.890
reminder of the wounds.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.430
You know, how and when we talk
about our own reconciliation

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.010
in the country it's
not something

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.930
that is thrown at people.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.250
Sometimes it's an intimate
voice, it's looking

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.550
in the eyes of that child.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:57.660
And to say, "I'm going to love
you because you are my child.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.960
You are Rwandan.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.350
You are a victim
of circumstances."

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.010
But you have to understand
the human equation.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.410
This is going beyond
the human equation

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.830
because in the eyes you
might be looking at someone

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.190
who victimize you, who
killed your husband,

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.490
killed your children --

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:14.790
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: That's right.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:16.090
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
And so on and so forth.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:20.150
But also for the
children who were born

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.280
from parents who were killers.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.090
This is the huge
generation we have.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.920
And that's what we've
been trying to mend.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.390
You know, you are
not responsible

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.640
for the sins of the father.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.410
And women were a
big part of that

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.860
because you raised the children.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.420
You raised a new generation
of Rwandans, you know,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.040
so that level of reconciliation
comes from the lowest level

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.110
when you are able to really
come together as people

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:53.230
and to say we are going to
create a new phenomenon.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.900
We are going to come -- those
scenes are going to be cleansed.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.370
It's what you are going to do

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.190
for your country
and for yourself.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:03.260
And so the women have
that double task.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.430
Even when we talk about women in
politics, if we talk about women

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.040
in the parliament,
you really have

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.690
to take all these
things together.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.830
It's not just about
one job or another.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.030
It's mending the whole fabric.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.680
It's when you go to those
villages and, you know,

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:24.820
our parliamentarians are not
the ones sitting in offices.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.240
No. They travel.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.770
Each one of them is assigned
a village or an area they have

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.930
to visit to see that things are
being done but also the level

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.770
of how the families
are coming along.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.360
And when I say families
and extended family,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.060
quite a few lost
their own children

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.760
and now they are
raising the orphans.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.060
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Yeah, but --

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.360
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
But you know, yeah.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.660
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: The
amazing thing

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.560
that I've seen is
there'll be a woman --

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.990
and I will use the words
Hutu and Tutsi for you know.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:03.800
And 90% of the country
was Hutu and huge,

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.040
huge number of the
group traders,

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.500
a huge percentage, were Hutu.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.200
And so I say that because
I'll be with a Hutu woman

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.690
and she's talking to me about
having gone into the jungle

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:21.100
and brought her husband
out because he had fled

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.480
and he was the head of
intelligence for the Hutu

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.080
who were in Congo and who were
doing raids at night, you know,

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.410
keeping the war going.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:36.590
OK. So as I'm in her home,
and I'm meeting her children

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.530
and there are three children,

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.000
and then there's
some other children

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.540
and they're hiding behind doors.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.870
And everyone's playing and
laughing, etc. And I say, "now,

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.750
who -- are these
all your children?"

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.050
She said yes.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.010
And so, and I said, but this?

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:54.870
You know, and I'm trying
to put it together.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.170
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Mmhmm.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:57.470
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: So two of
them are biologically hers

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:58.770
with her husband.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:03.000
And then there are three
others and they are all adopted

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.210
but these are Tutsi children
who had been orphaned.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:13.910
So she, in the middle of this
Hutu story, takes it for granted

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.760
that she's raising
three Tutsi children.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.530
And that is something --

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:19.830
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Yeah.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.130
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: I
saw over and over

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:22.430
and over in both directions.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:23.730
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
Mmhmm, mmhmm.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.230
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: I saw Tutsi
women raising Hutu children,

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.710
etc. You know, we
don't have a --

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.760
we just can't get our
minds wrapped around that.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.310
I mean, that would be like
immediately after the liberation

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:44.710
of Dachau if you were to
say, well you German family,

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.350
we're going to give
you three Jewish kids

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.660
to raise or vice versa.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.960
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Mmhmm.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.250
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: We would
never think of doing that.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.520
And yet that was
actually a practice

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.840
that was very much promoted.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.820
It was natural but
it was promoted.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:06.280
And you take those kinds of
practices and multiply them

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.480
by the dozens and the
dozens and you come

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.560
to understand how
women were able

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.670
to knit the country together.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.970
And it wasn't just women

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:21.010
but women played really the
leading role whether it was

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.950
creating a justice system

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:27.730
because without justice it's
very hard to have peace.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.860
So they created this
local justice system.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.130
But they also created a health
care system and a system

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:40.400
to stop marital rape or other
kinds of gender-based violence.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.740
And then they created this
whole reconciliation process.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.380
And in each village there were
ways of getting the villagers

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.550
to tell their stories
to each other.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:59.370
And I mean, there's one example
where there were these camps

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.050
that were sort of
reintegration camps

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:06.420
for the mostly men
who were in Congo.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.210
So how are they going to
come back home, right?

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.250
But you've got to get
them to come back home

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.910
so that they won't be
the enemies from outside.

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:19.090
So you get these men
to come into this camp

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.190
that the women have
put together.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.360
But then the women are
thinking after a month or two,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.730
"where are these
guys going to go?"

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.510
Like, the only place for them

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.590
to go is back home
to their villages.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.950
It's not like people have,
you know, a second estate

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.550
or something to go to.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.850
So they've got to go home.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:43.780
So the women start going to
these camps to sit in circles

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:48.580
with these men who have got
to be reintroduced to say,

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.500
you know, what's it going to be
like for you when you go back

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.110
and you have killed the
children of the people

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.730
in the house next to yours?

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.240
Like, how are you going
to deal with that?

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:06.760
And that kind of very
practical action that comes

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.590
from this hugely
generous spirit --

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:17.380
I will complete that thought
before we ask for questions.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:21.060
But I want to complete
that thought with --

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:28.280
I was told of a woman who
went into that camp to help

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.020
with this reintegration, you
know, helping people think

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.200
through what it was
going to be like.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:40.900
OK. And she sees the young
man who slaughtered her son.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.430
And they were kids together.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:47.920
And she sees him
and he sees her.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.800
And there's this
terrible moment.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:57.830
And then she says, "I want
you to come home with me."

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:04.680
And she says to him, "You don't
have a family to go home to

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.300
and I don't have a son.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.150
So I want you to be my son now."

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:17.810
And she says, "When
you get married,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.020
I'm going to give you the cow."

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:26.050
And that, for those of you
who know of this culture,

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:31.050
that is about as
precious as a gift can be.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:36.200
And then she says, "And when
I die, this home is yours."

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.490
That's the story of
Rwanda over and over

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:44.400
as women led this
reconciliation.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.700
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Yeah.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.000
And, you know, you
said it beautifully.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.550
I just want to add that
all this was made possible

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.160
because of political will.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.170
Because no matter how much
women can try to do it --

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.860
we've worked with many women
in many different countries.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.440
Sometimes when it is that
level, political will,

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.550
and also the understanding
actually empowering those women

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.590
to do so, it can happen.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.530
That's one of the foundations
to understand that even

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:14.950
like the settlement,

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:20.290
the reconciliation towards
the whole country program.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.920
And the women came and
performed beautifully

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.630
within that general
country program.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.700
So it was not an appendage.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.620
What is maybe a takeaway
for me and, you know,

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:36.180
is that there was a
very good understanding

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.950
that once the vision on how to
rebuild the country happened,

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.790
the women became
actually the biggest part

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.170
of that reconstruction,

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.310
intricate part of
reconstruction.

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:50.270
But that thing was
embraced by all Rwandans.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:55.130
Rwandans were given the
agency to do that and women,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:59.490
in their area and even
beyond, they were able

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.680
to perform very more than
what we had dreamed of.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.520
But again, it's that
kind of cohesion

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.980
between the women understanding
where the country wanted to go

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.190
and then the will
actually they led the way

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.640
in many different areas.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.940
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: There's
no question --

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.240
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Yeah.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.540
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: That as I
said earlier it was pull

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.840
from the top.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.140
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Yeah.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.440
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: From
the top leadership.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.910
That would include President
Kagame as the head of the party.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.210
And then this push up.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.510
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
Yeah, push up.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.530
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: The women had
worked at a civil society level.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.830
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
That's so true.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.950
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: In these
women-only village councils.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.150
It's a brilliant, brilliant
story of how they pushed up

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.430
and -- I want to
look at the picture.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.510
This is the woman
who is the head

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.160
of the whole village
council system --

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.460
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Sorry.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.820
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Taking
the oath of office, right?

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.140
Should we see what
questions people have?

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.440
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
Yeah, that would be good.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.000
But I just -- maybe I start
with the question [laughing].

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.730
And many people might have the
same question but is to say --

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:05.730
this is a book, it's almost
like, you know, a labor of love.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.020
You've written this
book for a long time

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.620
and you took your time.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.180
You do your investigation.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.480
You went to Rwanda.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.780
You did many things.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.080
Tell us why.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.170
Why did you select
and want to do it?

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.880
There are many areas, you know,
of conflict and many places

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.790
where women also tried
to do similar things.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:31.630
But, you know, and I've heard it
from you but I want you at least

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.930
to explain it to people.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:38.670
Why Rwanda and why you really
invested all your emotional,

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:46.310
spiritual, physical, you
know, life to write this book?

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:47.610
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Right.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.040
It was very personal for me.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.260
It was, you know, in
our country, like --

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.640
as I said, you know, I've been
part of the women's movement.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.320
And we thought we were
up against, you know,

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.480
all of this patriarchy
and it's terrible.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.910
You know, we were making 49
cents on the dollar, etc.,

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:15.950
etc. When I was in my early 20s
I didn't have any understanding

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.450
of what women were
facing in other places.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:23.180
And so as I began bit by
bit understanding more

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:28.000
about the world it became clear
to me that that's where I needed

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.300
to be putting my effort because
it would be so meaningful to me.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:40.010
And having been brought
to Rwanda in 2000 to speak

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:44.770
at a meeting of several women,
maybe 20 women from the region,

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:49.570
and I was the only white
face there, and I came to see

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:54.890
that there wasn't any
place in the world

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:59.840
where women were facing as much
of a challenge as they were

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.640
at that moment in time in
that particular country.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.470
And I wanted, because
I was hearing stories

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:13.920
and I actually also -- that's
when I met President Kagame too.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.320
And I said to him, "you know,
if you want to change the face

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.500
of Rwanda, put women,
advance them

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.930
into the leadership positions."

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:28.740
And he did that immediately.

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.450
And they became, you
know, ambassadors

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.900
and they became members of
his cabinet in large numbers.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:40.520
So I'm sitting here watching all
of this happen and going back

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.880
because I was so inspired.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.790
And I had been involved
with the Bosnian genocide

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:50.240
and what they were doing in
Rwanda, what you all were doing,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:56.070
was so far advanced of anything
that was being done in Bosnia.

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.120
And I eventually realized it.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.010
I talked to one woman and she
would tell me about working

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:04.700
in the creating this
justice system.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.740
And another woman would
tell me about being

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.400
on the constitutional commission
that got the 30% quota.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.120
And another one would
tell me about, you know,

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:23.910
working in somehow, with let's
say the education system.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:27.770
But none of them had
the whole picture

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.070
of how it all fit together.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.460
And after I'd been going

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.470
for about five years I realized
that's the gift I could give

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.260
because I have the distance.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:42.260
And I could analyze how
all of this came together.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.560
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
Thank you so much.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.860
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: Yes.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.160
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Yeah.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.460
Maybe you can open?

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:49.760
Yeah.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.650
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson:
We have enough time

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:59.340
to take several questions
from the audience.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.000
I want to just put
out the housekeeping

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.900
that when you ask a
question you are agreeing

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.720
to be in our webcast.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.340
This webcast will be available
later for people to view

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.690
on our webpage,

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:17.300
the African/Middle Eastern
Division Reading Room webpage,

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.600
as well as the Library

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.690
of Congress general
webcast at loc.gov.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:26.960
So please speak your
question loudly.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:33.100
We will then, I think that we
will ask the ambassadors to give

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.310
up one mic and then share
the mic as they answer.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.580
So do we have some questions?

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:44.200
Yes. Young lady --
do we have, OK.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.290
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:56.540
I would like to know
from Swanee [inaudible].

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.720
My name is Margaret.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.460
I'm visiting from Nigeria.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:07.040
I'm part of the women
[inaudible].

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.060
So it's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.360
You know, I want to
comment first with Swanee

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.120
and then the rest of it
for this group around.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.880
You know, Swanee,
first thank you

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.040
for documenting what's
happened in Rwanda.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.130
A month ago as the
representative of Rwanda,

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:26.070
you know that --
you know the story

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.980
of Rwanda is a great
success from every angle,

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.220
especially from the
women's movement.

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:40.790
My question is individual
[inaudible] structural governors

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.560
of conflict [inaudible].

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:52.330
So I just wanted to find out how
far you think we can all reach

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.760
success off the Rwandan.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:59.930
Will it help in dealing with
the issues as I mentioned?

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.430
The [inaudible] you know,

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:05.390
the successes here
have been [inaudible].

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.780
Thank you.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.540
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana:
Thank you.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.150
You can answer.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.800
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: I'm very,
very pleased to get asked this

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.340
because one of the lessons that
I draw out relates to this.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.960
So I can give you a good
bit of stats which is

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:31.220
that illiteracy was at about 51%
for women before the genocide.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:38.040
And now it's compulsory
education through ninth grade.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.880
And that is extraordinary.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.470
And that very much
affects, then,

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:48.110
the whole emerging business.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:52.220
And because the women, when
they got into parliament,

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:57.690
one of the first bills that
they passed was the right

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:01.960
to inherit land and
then land reform.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.830
And you know, that
right to inherit land --

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.630
you know, I never really had
a sense of what that meant,

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:12.010
how important that was.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.310
That's like fundamental.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:18.930
When you are living in a
home and your husband dies

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:22.770
and the whole home goes
to his brother or whatever

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:26.550
and then you become
impoverished and --

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.480
I mean, that's really basic.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.540
And you don't have
that home as collateral

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.540
when you want to
start a business.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.850
So it's very much all connected.

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.960
But the point I want to
hone in on when I look

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:47.700
at other countries: there's
so much ado about the idea

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.770
that unless you have
a certain higher level

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:56.230
of literacy you cannot have
women fully represented

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.150
as leaders.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:59.800
That's just not true.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.540
I mean, do the arithmetic.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.520
It's not even math.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.360
Do the arithmetic.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:12.650
How many women do you need to
have as significant leaders?

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:18.480
100? 500? 4,000?

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.780
Whatever? Right?

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:25.040
Are you telling me that
there aren't 4,000 women

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.400
in any country on earth who
haven't had college degrees,

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.540
masters, doctorates, who
haven't been extraordinarily

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.030
well-experienced, who
haven't traveled the world?

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:38.920
Of course there are.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:44.990
And so we have this false
relationship that we walk

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:47.820
around thinking, oh well
this is a really, you know,

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:52.060
this backward country
where women haven't had all

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.390
of these opportunities,

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:55.680
therefore they can't
be in leadership.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.980
Those two don't go together.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:01.990
Do you want to add to that, or?

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.800
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: One
tiny thing I can add that you -

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:09.710
whoops -- were to say it very
well but just what I'm going

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:11.750
to add, especially
for Rwandan women,

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:15.740
and you mentioned it
a lot and it's very,

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.470
very important for
Rwandan women.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:21.180
But to think in terms
of after genocide,

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.400
people didn't have anything.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.540
And among the things that were
done to empower the people,

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:32.990
to make people wake up --
that economic leverage, basic,

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:34.990
was part of the program.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.780
It means that whatever
one has created

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.050
or what the women
themselves have done,

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.200
what we call homegrown
initiatives,

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:47.320
there were socioeconomic
programs specifically targeting

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.870
people with nothing.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:52.850
Like for instance, what they
call getting a, have a cow.

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.150
Where do they distribute
the cows?

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:56.630
The sort of poorest
families can have

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:59.580
at least a basic,
basic beginning.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.880
All the elements

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.280
of reconciliation
among women started

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.150
with economic initiatives, like
what they call peace baskets.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.940
When they get together,
they do stuff together.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.880
They bring a certain
economic livelihood

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:16.490
but at the same time they are
coming together as people.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:20.320
So those are the things that
when you address your attention

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:24.180
to the health issues -- you
know, people were dying.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.450
And the promotion of universal
health coverage was for that.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:29.830
People were dying.

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:31.470
Even if you survived --

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.370
sometimes they were
dying from AIDS/HIV.

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.910
They were dying from
tuberculosis.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.980
They were dying from
many diseases.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.650
So tackling the issues of
health, tackling the issues

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:45.940
of poverty were also a big part
of our reconstruction efforts

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.370
that the women promoted.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.730
Thank you.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.510
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Do we
have another question?

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:56.260
[ Inaudible Comment
From Audience ]

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.010
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: No, you're
Ambassador [inaudible].

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.310
[ Laughter ]

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:00.610
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Swanee.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:04.460
This is the third book launch
that I've been at for this book

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:12.700
but it is the first time I've
actually read the book back

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.140
to back.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.650
And I just wanted to say
[inaudible] and I'll try

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:27.490
to figure out how to put this
in the form of a question.

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:29.090
First, this is a [inaudible].

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:33.000
These are women who [inaudible]
or retracing history [inaudible]

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.200
through decades of
their country.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:41.560
You put their comments
into context.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:47.940
You explain beautifully
the messages

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.610
and really contain 16 years
of interviews [inaudible]

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:53.450
of pages of documentation.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:51:02.000
And to put them into a book that
is readable and [inaudible].

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:08.620
The second thing I wanted to say
is the book is like [inaudible].

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:15.580
We all know what
man's done to you.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:21.640
It's when [inaudible] or
it's already been 23 years

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.750
since the genocide, come on.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.380
Or you know, where is the
focus on human rights?

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.560
Or why don't you tell
[inaudible] and Hutu?

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:37.500
And what you do in this book
is to say, we're looking

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.800
at this the wrong way.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:59.080
We're looking at this
in [inaudible] the soul.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:07.970
And this was not a question of
the human rights [inaudible].

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:15.750
So your ability to take it and
say to the men who are trying

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.300
to say to you, you don't
understand the context,

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:22.040
you're reversing that.

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.240
And in 300 pages
you say [inaudible].

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:30.940
I guess I'm going
to give up on trying

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.510
to ask this as a question.

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:36.190
[ Laughter ]

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:37.840
&gt;&gt; Swanee Hunt: You could
say, "what do you think

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.140
about what I just said?"

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:44.020
[Laughter] Ah, there is
a what I think of it.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:51.290
OK? And that is that
after shock and awe --

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:55.050
you know, after we bombed
the hell out of Baghdad --

00:52:55.050 --> 00:53:00.050
so I went to the Pentagon
and Don Steinberg knows this

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:03.450
because years earlier I had gone
to the State Department to meet

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:08.030
with him to say,
"hi, my name is" etc.

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:10.400
And so I do this
kind of advocacy.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.630
So I went and I was
meeting with the general

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:22.100
who was running the invasion of
the US troops going into Iraq.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.070
And so he was very
generous with his time.

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.540
He told me that I should
have another cup of coffee

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.700
and then have another
cup of coffee

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.170
and have another cup of coffee.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:36.000
And I was going on
and telling him

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.930
about how this is the moment.

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:45.140
This is the moment you need
to bring women in to the core

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:49.610
of what you're doing through
our forces because if you want

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:56.730
to stabilize, those women know
which disaffected teenagers --

00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:00.700
these boys have a weapon
under their mattress.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:05.050
These women are the ones who are
perceived as less threatening.

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:09.510
So they can get into places
where the men can't get.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.520
These are the ones who
have a whole history

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.810
of working across lines.

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:18.650
And I went on and on.

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:22.860
And he listened very
attentively.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:28.080
And I said, you know, they have
tremendous leadership skills

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.380
that you can tap.

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.690
These are untapped resources.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:33.650
And he listened some more
and he nods his head.

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:36.080
And then he said,
"Madam Ambassador,

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.340
I cannot thank you
enough for coming

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.610
and I appreciate your time.

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:47.330
And I want to assure
you that as soon

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.780
as we can get the place
secure we can think

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.930
about women's issues."

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:56.870
And I thought, I am not
talking about cervical cancer.

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.430
I am talking about security.

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:04.640
Well, to think how hard it is to
-- I mean, he gave me the time.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:08.040
I said all the right
things but it's that context

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.150
that he didn't have, Don,
that you're talking about.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.700
And he was a good guy.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.990
He wanted to understand
but he just --

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.430
he was looking at it
from a different lens.

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:23.560
And that's what we mean
by inclusive security.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.980
We actually have
to look at security

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:32.030
through a different lens that
includes the women of Rwanda.

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:35.320
You know, not as these
women who need our help.

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.620
That's the problem.

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.920
We see them as victims.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.560
And you see this all the time.

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.830
Where do you hear about the
women leaders in any depth?

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:47.390
You hear about them as
victims, you know, and how,

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.040
oh well they became leaders

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.660
because so many men
had been killed.

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:54.200
That's not why they
became leaders.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.530
I mean, that was one of the
circumstances among many

00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:02.100
in which sparked all
kinds of their leadership.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.830
But they were surging
into a chasm

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:09.620
when the chaos cracked
open the culture.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.920
&gt;&gt; Mathilde Mukantabana: Right.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.320
