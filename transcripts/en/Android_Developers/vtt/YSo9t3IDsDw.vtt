00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.912
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:09.810
AARON MARSHALL: I am
in a tiny percentage

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.880
of people in the world that can
literally work from anywhere.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.280
And that was freedom for me.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.990
One of my family
values is we think

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.130
life is about living
great stories.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.900
And so to move to Cape
Town, started this business,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.892
and live like this, we
think is a great story.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.350
The possibilities
are endless here.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.570
We love it.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.940
Over is a simple app for
adding text to photos.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.750
You can rotate the
text, change the color,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.500
really dial into customization.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.939
We offer hundreds of fonts.

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.730
And we're always loading
new fonts in there

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.154
that you can unlock.

00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:42.945
We also have artwork,
some of it exclusive.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.790
The decision for us to go
to Android was obvious.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.880
80% of the global
market is using Android.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.970
And we were really passionate
about helping people

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.260
be creative, and
that was an easy way

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.785
to get to a lot more people.

00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:58.160
JONATHAN ORFORD:
It's everywhere.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.493
It's growing very, very quickly.

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.930
And we want to be
a part of that.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.429
The high-end and
the low-end devices

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.310
all support Over, which
is fantastic for us.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.310
When we decided to develop
the application for Android,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.080
I had two developers
already in mind.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.220
They had Java experience,
but very limited Android

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.140
experience.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.370
They managed to get up to
speed very, very quickly,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.465
and we were able to start
writing code within days.

00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:21.360
JOHAN NELL: I joined Over with
no prior Android experience.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.090
And myself and Herko were able
to get a working prototype out

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.900
to Aaron within the first week.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.650
HERKO LATEGAN: My
experience in developing

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380
Over for Android
was really quick.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.570
It took us two months.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.260
And originally,
our product manager

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.440
thought it was going
to take a lot longer.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.110
And I think that the main
benefit of working on Android

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.710
was the tools are amazing.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.074
You've got Android Studio.

00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:42.740
And you've got all
of this documentation

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.932
just at your fingertips,
which makes it easy for us.

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:46.890
JONATHAN ORFORD: We're
offering our application

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.440
to as many countries
as we possibly can,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.710
and therefore we have
to adjust the pricing.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.810
And some countries want
rounded pricing, some don't.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.401
We have complete control of our
pricing with the Google Play

00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:59.150
Developer Console.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.204
It's one place I can
go and see everything.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.370
I can go and see statistics.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.045
I can go and see my rollouts.

00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:06.195
I can see ratings and reviews.

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:06.820
It's brilliant.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.185
And it's all in one place
and very, very easy to use.

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:11.560
AARON MARSHALL: I really like
the Google Play experience.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.280
I can actually talk to the
customers in the reviews.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.544
And that customer connection
is hugely valuable.

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:18.210
If you don't know
what they're thinking,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.054
if you can't interact and
talk and ask questions,

00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:22.720
it's hard to figure
out what's valuable.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.870
And driving value
to customers is

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.710
what a company and a
start-up is all about.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.020
JOHAN NELL: I remember the
first day when we launched,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.054
just looking at the
analytics and seeing people

00:02:33.054 --> 00:02:34.470
starting and using
the application

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.120
and then going on to the
social networking services

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.100
and seeing these pieces of
art, these images people

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.310
are creating with
code we've written.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.895
The creativity that it
inspires is jaw-dropping.

00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:48.290
It was really exciting.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.165
AARON MARSHALL: Around
Over we have a mantra.

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:52.470
We like to say, go
big and go home.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.130
We don't think you should
be sacrificing your family

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.760
in order to make some wealth
or create value or change

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.500
the world.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.970
What good is it to have
all of those things

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.040
if you don't have a family
to then share in that success

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.690
with?

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.440
So for us, success
is two-pronged.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.950
We want to go big, and
we want to go home.
