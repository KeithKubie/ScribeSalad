00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.569
I'm sorry. I'm just getting
this. Breaking news.

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:04.771
â™ª

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:06.974
Now, back
to a "Tub Watch 2016" update.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.743
Updates now. The total count is
now 17 dead from cuteness.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.513
Let's check in with the puppy's
progress and see how he's doing

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:15.349
with that bath live
from the scene.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.451
(audience sighing)

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.754
(laughter)

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.323
(applause and cheering)

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.658
Mm.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.561
Yeah!

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.496
HARDWICK:
Mm.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.931
Not sure what breed that is.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.533
It looks like something
a Muppet baby coughs up

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.135
when he chokes on cotton candy,
but it is (bleep) adorable.

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:37.237
Comedians, this puppy is
permed and dangerous.

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.406
I would like you to give me
an eyewitness description

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:42.709
(duck quacking)

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:45.012
Flula.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.781
Oh, it looks like a deer
has pooped on a cloud.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.650
-Yes. It does, yeah.
-(laughter)

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:52.319
Points. Yeah, these look...
these are little poops.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.588
Little poops.
Tiny deer poo-poos.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.123
Aw, that is adorable.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:58.859
Aren't you guys feeling better
already about the world?

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:02.162
-(cheering) -Knowing
that this stuff's out there.

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:02.262
Aw...
