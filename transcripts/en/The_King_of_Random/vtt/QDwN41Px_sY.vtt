00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.030
Hey guys, welcome back. Thanks for joining us today on the king of random

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.060
We've had a few videos using silicone rubber to make a mold of an object,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.700
We already had and then cast it in a new kind of material.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.260
This is a great way to make a copy of something that you already have.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.100
We had a comment request from
"HundOhneStress as"

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.680
Saying you should take a vinyl record and cast it

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.440
in silicone then poured epoxy or resin in the mold to see if it sounds the same.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.080
Well HundOhneStress as we think this is a great idea so we have a vinyl record and a record player,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.880
We're going to try making a silicone mold of the record, and then cast it and resin to see if we can get a playable copy.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.500
First we have to test that our vinyl records will play. This is a record of some Mozart music

00:00:37.700 --> 00:01:13.260
♪ Music ♪

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.070
It can be fun messing with the settings on a record player alright

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.480
We now know our record play as well

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.079
So it's time to start prepping it to be molded so we can cast a copy of it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.190
I have some oil-based clay

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.509
And I'm gonna be using that to make a border wall that goes around our record that will hold it in when we pour it

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.310
Onto the record so it doesn't flood the whole table

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.400
There's a slight chance that the vinyl record will try to float on the silicone

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.869
So I'm also going to use a little bit of clay on for points around the edges of the record to try and hold it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.279
Down to the table these little bits of clay will show up in our casting which is too bad

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.610
But I don't know another way to make sure that our record doesn't go anywhere

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.949
They should easily trim off, and they shouldn't affect the playing of the music at all with the record secured in place

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.920
I'm now going to take some more clay and make a wall that runs all the way around it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.570
Now let's mix up some silicone to pour onto our record

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.479
Because we don't want this to go too quickly and we want to make sure it gets into all the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.979
Tiny grooves of the record. I am using the green catalyst which is much slower

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.969
Now we want to make sure that we get all of the air bubbles out of this silicone

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.789
So let's throw in the vacuum chamber and start sucking

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.120
Silicon should now be almost entirely bubble free

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.340
I'm just gonna clean off the record really quick

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.139
And then we'll start pouring it on probably more official ways you're supposed to clean records and someone out there is

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.259
Furious with me for using a paper towel all right. I think that's pretty good. Let's add our silicone

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.480
I'm starting by pouring the silicone right into the middle to let the rubber just sort of flow over the record

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.400
That's usually a good method to get it to get into all of the tiny little cracks and grooves

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.690
And courage it a little bit here

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.209
At this point our record is completely covered and our silicone is still going to keep flowing a little bit and reach the very edges

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.669
And settle itself down into a nice flat surface

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.749
This type of silicone and catalyst should take at least 12 hours to cure, so we'll come back tomorrow

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.620
And see how our mold has turned out

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.450
Our first layer of silicone is cured and dry and we could take it off now

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.609
But I want to be able to reinforce it just a little bit

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.350
So I am going to add another layer of silicone over the top of it to make it a little thicker and hopefully a little

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.219
Smoother this layer of silicone isn't going to be in contact with the record at all

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.130
So it doesn't matter if it says bubble free and perfect as the last one

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.930
So I'm not gonna use the vacuum chamber on it

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.750
I'm gonna use the red faster-acting catalyst this layer of silicone should only take about 45 minutes to cure so once it's ready

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.290
We'll de mold the record

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.460
Start by peeling all of the clay off and get it out of the way

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.459
This is an oil base to play it doesn't dry out. So this is still good to just save and use for another project

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.100
That's coming off and really nicely

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.060
POP

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.920
Beautiful, so if you get in really close you can see

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.140
The ridges from the record all the way around all of the tiny little grooves

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.120
are visible in the silicone

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.320
With this trim off the extra on the middle here. With our record successfully molded. I have two different types of resin

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.339
I'm going to try using to cast this record the two types of resin I'm using looked pretty similar

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.679
But this type takes about 15 to 20 minutes to cure and harden, and this type takes up to 24 hours

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.509
So I'm going to try both of them and see if we get any sort of good playable result from either one

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.510
I'm going to start with the fast-acting resin this mixes together in a one-to-one ratio, so equal parts of both, but first

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.210
I'm gonna lay down some

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.940
Protective cover because there's a good chance some of the resin will spill off of the record mold and onto the table

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.420
We also want to make sure that our mold is clear of any dust or dirt

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.160
Now before I start mixing and pouring my resin

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.949
I am gonna take a little bit of the oil-based clay and try and add some barriers

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.229
Where I have these marks in the silicone this is just in an effort to make sure that the resin doesn't run down

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.029
Through those gaps and onto the foil too much because I do need it to build up on the record a little bit

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.960
And the clay isn't really going to stick to the silicone much

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.560
But hopefully it will stay on there enough to make a difference

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.760
Now I'm going to pour the first half into the second half and mix it up. This resin does start to cure pretty quickly

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.680
So I'm gonna have to be fairly quick in my mixing all right. I think that's pretty well mixed now

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.680
I'm gonna pour it onto the mold

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:20.929
My resin is already starting to thicken up a little bit not pouring out of the cup as easily as it was when I started

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.320
yeah, rigid me it was like a

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.520
Warm syrup. Oh there we go it. It's barely even liquid anymore

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.909
now the resin in the cup had more mass of the resin all stuck together as a result its own heat would speed up the

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.439
Catalyzation process turning it rigid the resin on the record mold is a lot more spread out

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.450
So it's not holding a heat as well, so it's not catalyzing quite as quick. You can see that while this is basically

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.210
Solid at this point it's still flexible, but it's not sticky anymore these little drips over here

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.629
They're still quite gummy and even a little bit liquid

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.619
So let's give this resin 15 to 20 minutes to cure before we take it out of the mold

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.239
Clean up the edges and fix the hole in the center before we see if it will play on our record player all

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.970
Right our resin is now mostly cured. It's definitely cured enough that I feel comfortable pulling it out of the mold

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.980
Let's see how it turned out

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:35.879
Now while the resin is still a little bit soft. I'm gonna try and use a razor blade and trim off these excess spillage areas

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.409
Interesting parts visible where there were a lot of bubbles near the surface,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.779
That's one of the downsides of this type of resin,

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:55.019
It does tend to get a lot of bubbles and because it catalyzes so quickly there isn't time to put it in a vacuum. chamber

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.190
All right,

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.059
I'm going to try putting our original record down on to the player and

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.040
Then put our cast record on top of at the original record should hold it rigid enough,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.680
That it stays flat.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.740
It's playing!!!

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.960
ITS PLAYING! Oh my gosh.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.400
Nice going, Texas.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.580
It's worse audio quality definitely listen to all those crackles and pops

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:33.299
Scratchy stereo noises getting in there interference definitely but

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:38.369
It's playing on our molded and cast

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.050
record oh

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.050
There that's so cool. Oh

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:49.259
The audio quality is so much worse it's making scratching sounds every second, but that's so cool

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.160
I think it's also quieter interestingly enough

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.699
I'm gonna try to play the same spot on both the copy and the original it's gonna be a little tricky

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.440
But we'll try there in the blank spot

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.660
Well it does play it's a playing record

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.520
That is so funny. Oh my gosh

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.090
So I didn't really have a lot of high hopes that this resin would work very well

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.660
It casts very quickly it gets fairly warm

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.069
And I didn't think it would pick up quite enough detail to really be able to make out that it was music

00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:53.400
I thought maybe we would get some scratching noises from it, but the fact that we can definitely tell

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:59.570
What music is being played is amazing! We have achieved a level of success with our first casting now

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.040
we're going to try our slower resin

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.900
which is actually going to get put in the vacuum chamber to remove all of the bubbles and then it takes as much as 24 hours

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.920
to cure we start out the same way by mixing up even portions of our side a and side B resin

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.320
I've also got a new color that I'm going to try adding to this resin

00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:29.688
All right, I'd say that's now evenly mixed you can see how many bubbles mixing it introduced into that resin

00:10:29.689 --> 00:10:34.729
It's just completely full of bubbles at this point. That's why we're gonna throw in the vacuum chamber and suck them all out

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.160
I'm not sure this one will get high enough that I have to drop it or not

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.280
It's not super consistent with this resin. You can see some of the bubbles starting to get pulled out.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.640
Ooh! Excellent.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.520
Didn't have to drop the pressure at all now

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.520
It's just sucking air out of the resin

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:59.799
Looks like boiling candy actually looks a lot like when we made the candy for the thumb suckers looks pretty much

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.640
just like the boiling sugar

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.150
There are still a few bubbles rising up, but I think at this point

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.460
That's just the alcohol from the ink dye that I used boiling in the low pressure

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.680
I'm gonna slowly let some air back in see what happens to all those bubbles I bet they just disappeared

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.040
Try and get to the very edge on all the parts of the record this time

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.820
so we don't have that little gap that we had on our first casting

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:39.849
Alright I think that's going all the way to the edges everywhere it is spilling out in a couple of spots

00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:44.660
but that shouldn't be a big problem does look like right here. It's probably a little bit thin

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:48.399
you can maybe see that the green of the silicone is showing through a little bit more right there

00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:49.749
But it is still covered

00:11:49.749 --> 00:11:54.159
and I think it will still turn out just fine and now our second type of resin is cured

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.420
I did have something odd happen

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.579
I pointed out where there was a thin spot in the resin while it was curing a hole did form in that thin spot on

00:12:00.579 --> 00:12:03.248
The mold I mixed up a small second batch of the clear resin

00:12:03.249 --> 00:12:05.089
And I poured that on as a sort of patch

00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:08.169
Where it had gone so thin that you could actually see the silicone right through it

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.679
And then I reinforced a couple other small spots that looked like they were pretty thin as well

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.240
But at this point everything is cured, and it's ready to be de-molded.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.280
Alright, let's see...

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.820
Oh. Looks like it's coming off the actual record just fine,

00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:22.149
Which is what we were hoping for.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.120
Right here, you can see the patch

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.529
Where I filled in the gap and I didn't use any yellow dye in this spot.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:41.870
So that's why we have sort of a clear spot in the middle, and then you can see the a little bit of the texture

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.899
Around the edges where it was red.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.030
It doesn't like to spread super nice and thin

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.910
But I don't think that should affect a plane because that's just on the back side on the front. It's just

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.820
Perfectly smooth looks like uninterrupted record just like you would want to see it

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:05.560
*nate just cutting off the excess stuff* While you are here, here is some music.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.620
I'll turn on the power...

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.929
lay our record down. It is, I think, maybe not a hundred percent cured

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.370
it feels like it might be a little flimsy, but it's not much different from an actual vinyl record.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.020
so we'll try it without putting the actual vinyl record underneath it for support. See how it goes.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:35.740
:/

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.880
Not bad :|

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.880
This is kinda weird. :/

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.180
It's playing pretty well, there's a little bit of static in the background

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.640
But there's not nearly as much of the popping and crackling that happened with our first test.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.509
I think we definitely got a much better result with this second resin.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.539
I'm gonna move it and see what happens if it goes right over the thin spot.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.640
Doesn't really seem to be affecting it any I don't think it sounds about normal.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.980
Maybe there is a little warble as it hits it--

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.340
Just as a test. I'm gonna try putting normal record underneath our casting just to make sure it stays up nice and flat

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:28.519
And it's held in place

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:36.709
There you go, that is working

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.880
Pretty darn well. I'd say like I said there's a little bit of static noise

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.780
More than the original

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.340
There you have it you can make a mold of a record and cast it in resin and make something that plays

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.880
which is incredible to me especially that this first one worked

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.420
I didn't think this first resin would be high enough quality that it would get the details to really pick up the sound but it did

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:06.040
you can absolutely tell what music is playing on both records our second slow cure resin did give us a better result but

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.520
the first one's not terrible

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.400
Special thank you to YouTuber "HundOhneStress As" for your suggestion that we try this check the youtube inbox

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.440
I'm really happy. I got to try this experiment with you guys

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.260
Thanks for joining us for this project and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:33.240
This is probably the least efficient and most expensive form of music piracy ever invented. I drew on the foil the resin spilled over it

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.860
and it just lifts it right up I

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:38.779
Got a gold record

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.770
Hey guys, it's Grant here, I just want to pop in and say hello

You guys are wonderful Nate, and I are incredibly grateful for the way. You keep supporting us, so that's pretty much

00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:50.520
It just want to give you a quick. Thank you. I'll see you in the next video

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.940
