TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.173
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:06.850
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.400
This week, France hosts the
5th International Conference

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.900
on Learning
Representations, which

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.660
is focused on how one can
learn meaningful and useful

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.446
representations of data
for machine learning.

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:18.070
Click through to the
post to learn more

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.010
about Google's research
being presented there.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.370
Cloud Speech API, our automatic
speech recognition service,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.500
is now generally available.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.880
It's built on the
core technology

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.500
that powers speech recognition
for other Google products,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.730
including Google Search, Google
Now, and Google Assistant.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.670
But it has been adapted to
better fit the needs of Google

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.140
Cloud customers.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.660
Head on over to the post to
learn about the latest features

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.710
and how to get started.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.610
Dart 1.23 is now available.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.340
It introduces support
for overwriting fields

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.220
in strong mode, along with
a lot of other improvements.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.390
Notable changes and the
download link are on the post.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.980
Smart Display
Campaigns have begun

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.300
rolling out to all
advertisers, letting

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.634
you reach more customers easily
on the Google Display Network.

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:05.050
These campaigns use the power
of Google's machine learning

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.060
to automatically
connect your business

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.090
to prospective customers who may
be interested in your products,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.760
create beautiful image,
native, and text ads,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.540
and set the right bids to
meet your performance goals.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.395

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.100
