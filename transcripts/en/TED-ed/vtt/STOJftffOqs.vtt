00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.231
What do fans of atmospheric 
post-punk music

00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:15.610
have in common with ancient barbarians?

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.792
Not much.

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:20.211
So why are both known as goths?

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:21.502
Is it a weird coincidence

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:26.101
or a deeper connection stretching 
across the centuries?

00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.773
The story begins in Ancient Rome.

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:32.741
As the Roman Empire expanded,
it faced raids and invasions

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.862
from the semi-nomadic populations 
along its borders.

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:41.649
Among the most powerful were
a Germanic people known as Goths

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.930
who were composed of two tribal groups,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.165
the Visigoths

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:47.153
and Ostrogoths.

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:50.303
While some of the Germanic tribes
remained Rome's enemies,

00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:55.563
the Empire incorporated others
into the imperial army.

00:00:55.563 --> 00:00:57.862
As the Roman Empire split in two,

00:00:57.862 --> 00:01:01.613
these tribal armies played
larger roles in its defense

00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:04.438
and internal power struggles.

00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:08.924
In the 5th century, a mercenary revolt
lead by a soldier named Odoacer

00:01:08.924 --> 00:01:13.034
captured Rome 
and deposed the Western Emperor.

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:15.753
Odoacer and his Ostrogoth
successor Theoderic

00:01:15.753 --> 00:01:19.494
technically remained under the Eastern
Emperor's authority

00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:22.194
and maintained Roman traditions.

00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:26.204
But the Western Empire would never
be united again.

00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:29.363
Its dominions fragmented into kingdoms
ruled by Goths

00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:31.264
and other Germanic tribes

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:34.004
who assimilated into local cultures,

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:38.177
though many of their names
still mark the map.

00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:40.638
This was the end of the Classical Period

00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:43.775
and the beginning of what many call
the Dark Ages.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.524
Although Roman culture was never
fully lost,

00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:50.554
its influence declined
and new art styles arose

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:53.705
focused on religious symbolism
and allegory

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:56.605
rather than proportion and realism.

00:01:56.605 --> 00:01:58.805
This shift extended to architecture

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:04.487
with the construction of the Abbey
of Saint Denis in France in 1137.

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:07.846
Pointed arches, flying buttresses,
and large windows

00:02:07.846 --> 00:02:11.456
made the structure more skeletal
and ornate.

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:14.205
That emphasized its open, 
luminous interior

00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:19.912
rather than the sturdy walls
and columns of Classical buildings.

00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:21.336
Over the next few centuries,

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:25.156
this became a model for Cathedrals
throughout Europe.

00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:26.496
But fashions change.

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:31.437
With the Italian Renaissance's renewed
admiration for Ancient Greece and Rome,

00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:36.986
the more recent style began to seem
crude and inferior in comparison.

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:40.116
Writing in his 1550 book, 
"Lives of the Artists,"

00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:45.127
Giorgio Vasari was the first
to describe it as Gothic,

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:47.526
a derogatory reference to the Barbarians

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:50.847
thought to have destroyed 
Classical civilization.

00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:55.397
The name stuck, and soon came
to describe the Medieval period overall,

00:02:55.397 --> 00:03:01.317
with its associations of darkness,
superstition, and simplicity.

00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:05.849
But time marched on,
as did what was considered fashionable.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.248
In the 1700s, a period called
the Enlightenment came about,

00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:13.357
which valued scientific reason 
above all else.

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:17.169
Reacting against that, Romantic authors
like Goethe and Byron

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.068
sought idealized visions of a past
of natural landscapes

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:24.227
and mysterious spiritual forces.

00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:27.588
Here, the word Gothic 
was repurposed again

00:03:27.588 --> 00:03:33.388
to describe a literary genre that
emerged as a darker strain of Romanticism.

00:03:33.388 --> 00:03:35.906
The term was first applied 
by Horace Walpole

00:03:35.906 --> 00:03:40.429
to his own 1764 novel, 
"The Castle of Otranto"

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:44.048
as a reference to the plot 
and general atmosphere.

00:03:44.048 --> 00:03:47.148
Many of the novel's elements became
genre staples

00:03:47.148 --> 00:03:51.558
inspiring classics and the countless
movies they spawned.

00:03:51.558 --> 00:03:56.831
The gothic label belonged to literature
and film until the 1970s

00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:59.678
when a new musical scene emerged.

00:03:59.678 --> 00:04:03.400
Taking cues from artists like
The Doors and The Velvet Underground,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.679
British post-punk groups,

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:05.868
like Joy Division,

00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:06.739
Bauhaus,

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.750
and The Cure,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.419
combined gloomy lyrics 
and punk dissonance

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.599
with imagery inspired 
by the Victorian era,

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.720
classic horror,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.949
and androgynous glam fashion.

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.599
By the early 1980s, similar bands
were consistently described

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.471
as Gothic rock by the music press,

00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:28.089
and the stye's popularity brought it
out of dimly lit clubs

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:31.130
to major labels and MTV.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.671
And today, despite occasional negative
media attention and stereotypes,

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:40.849
Gothic music and fashion continue as
a strong underground phenomenon.

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.710
They've also branched into sub-genres,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.081
such as cybergoth,

00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:45.077
gothabilly,

00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:46.138
gothic metal,

00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:48.796
and even steampunk.

00:04:48.796 --> 00:04:51.051
The history of the word gothic is embedded

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:54.744
in thousands of years 
worth of countercultural movements,

00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:57.620
from invading outsiders becoming kings

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.083
to towering spires 
replacing solid columns

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:04.524
to artists finding beauty in darkness.

00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:07.222
Each step has seen a revolution of sorts

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:13.011
and a tendency for civilization to reach into
its past to reshape its present.
