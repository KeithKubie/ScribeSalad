00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.490
Let's try to evaluate
the indefinite integral 1

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.980
over the square root of
1 minus x squared dx.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.149
And you might try something
like u substitution,

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:14.940
but you'll find out
that it doesn't get you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.590
very far with this integral.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.180
And so instead, we
will do something

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.060
called trig substitution.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.400
And the whole idea behind
trigonometric substitution

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.740
is to substitute for x
with a trig function,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.670
so that this might simplify
using some trig identities.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.240
And maybe it'll turn this
entire integral into something

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.050
that we can actually integrate.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.380
And so the trig
substitution that we'll do--

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.590
and the big clue here is when
we see this 1 minus x squared.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.060
And in fact, if we ever
see an a squared minus an x

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.420
squared-- so 1 is
1 squared, minus x

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.160
squared-- it's a
pretty good clue

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.050
that we would want to
substitute with something times

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.690
sine of theta.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.340
In this case, if we just
make the substitution,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.710
if we say that x is equal
to-- let me do it over here.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.166
If we say that x is
equal to sine of theta,

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.290
then what we have under
the radical right over here

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.480
is going to become 1 minus sine
squared theta, which is cosine

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.340
squared theta.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.298
And then we could take
the square root of that.

00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:13.040
And that might simplify all
of this business a good bit.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.415
And we just want to make sure
that we're not artificially

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:18.030
constraining our x more
than what the domain here

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.970
would otherwise constrain our x.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.570
So if you look over here,
the x right over here

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.490
has to have an absolute
value less than 1.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.200
Or another way of saying it,
the domain right over here, x

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.550
has to be greater than negative
1 and less than positive 1.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.950
If it was 1, then
the denominator right

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.270
here is going to be 0.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.210
If it was greater than 1
or less than negative 1,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.690
then all of a
sudden, you're going

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.460
to have a negative
under the radical sign.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.320
So already, our
domain is constrained

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.850
for these values of x.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.340
So if we say x is sine
theta, this actually

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.840
allows x to be anywhere
between negative 1 and 1,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.090
including negative 1 and 1.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.180
So we're not constraining x
more than the domain has already

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.440
constrained it.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.200
Since we're going to have to
unwind the substitution later

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.600
on, let's also
define theta in terms

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.420
of x and in a way
that's not consistent

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.090
with this top statement.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.220
So let's also say that
theta is equal to arcsin,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.500
or inverse sine, of x.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.660
And what does this do?

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.640
Well, this actually constrains
what our theta is going to be.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.110
If I draw a unit circle--
my best to draw one.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.340
So this is my unit circle.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.550
And if I come up with
a particular x that's

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.180
going to be essentially
the potential sine value,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.190
arcsin is going to
give an angle that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.960
is in the first or
fourth quadrant.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.470
So if we say that this is
our x, then the arcsin of x

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.140
is going to be this
angle, not this one

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.130
out here in the second quadrant.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.430
If we say that this is
our x, then our arcsin

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.530
is going to be this angle.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.360
So this right over
here constrains

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.250
theta to be less than
or equal to pi/2,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.970
so less than or equal to
that, and greater than

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.650
or equal to negative pi/2.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.730
This is the way the arcsin
function is typically defined.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.070
It will return a value between
negative pi/2 and pi/2.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.350
Or another way of saying that,
in this range right over here

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.010
on the unit circle.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.760
And this will be
important later on when

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.295
we try to simplify
this expression.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.710
But let's actually try
to simplify it now.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.740
Before we do that, we
could substitute x,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.020
but we're also going to
have to substitute for dx.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.210
So let's figure out
what dx is equal to.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.550
dx is equal to--
well, the derivative

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.030
of sine theta with respect to
theta is cosine theta d theta.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.000
So now we're ready to actually
evaluate, or at least simplify.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.950
So our original integral becomes
the integral of 1 times dx.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.550
Well, dx is cosine
theta d theta.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.380
Cosine theta-- I'll put
the d theta out here--

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.920
over the square root
of 1 minus x squared,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.600
which is now going to be 1
minus sine squared theta.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.320
Well, what is 1 minus
sine squared theta?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.512
Well, that's going to
be cosine squared theta.

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:26.470
Let me write this down.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.652
1 minus sine squared theta is
equal to cosine squared theta.

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:33.860
This comes straight out of
the unit circle definition

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.640
of trig functions.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.620
Cosine squared plus sine
squared is equal to 1.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.670
So we can rewrite
this as being equal

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:47.050
to the indefinite integral
of cosine theta d theta

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.585
over the square root of
cosine squared theta.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.460
Now, we have to be a
little bit careful here.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.626
We have to think about
whether cosine theta is going

00:04:57.626 --> 00:04:59.320
to be either
positive or negative

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.720
or maybe we don't know.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.377
If we square a number and
then take its principal root,

00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:05.460
we're essentially taking
the absolute value of it.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.087
If cosine of theta
was, say, negative 1

00:05:07.087 --> 00:05:09.170
and we square it and then
take the principal root,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.130
it'll get 1.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.080
If cosine theta was positive
1, then we still get 1.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.940
So right now, all we
can do, without knowing

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.340
more information about
cosine of theta, is

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.080
say that this can be
rewritten as cosine theta

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.425
over the absolute
value of cosine theta.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:29.050
If you square something and then
take the positive square root,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.425
the principal
square root, you're

00:05:30.425 --> 00:05:32.680
essentially just taking
its absolute value.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.810
And so it's really tempting
to simplify this more,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.740
but we can't quite do
it without understanding

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.600
what cosine of theta is
going to be equal to.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.320
Well, lucky for us, we've
already constrained theta

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.211
to be equal to arcsin of x.

00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:45.710
And so that says
that theta is going

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.440
to be between negative
pi/2 and pi/2.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.230
And in this range
of thetas, we're

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.840
always in kind of
the positive x-axis.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.290
So cosine of theta, which is
the x-coordinate for wherever

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.210
we sit on the unit circle, is
always going to be positive.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.460
And since cosine of theta--
so let me make this clear.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.620
Arcsin of theta
is equal to arcsin

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.120
of x tells us that
cosine of theta

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.597
is going to be greater
than or equal to 0.

00:06:12.597 --> 00:06:14.180
It's going to be
non-negative, I guess

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.346
is the best way to say it,
not necessarily positive.

00:06:16.346 --> 00:06:21.606
It could still be equal to 0.

00:06:21.606 --> 00:06:22.980
So it's going to
be non-negative.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.060
And since it's non-negative,
the absolute value

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.240
of a non-negative number
is just the number itself.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.490
So this is just going to
be equal to the integral--

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.440
and I'll just do it in one
color-- of cosine theta

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.590
over cosine theta
d theta, which is

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.810
just equal to the integral of d
theta, which is equal to theta

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.940
plus C. And now all we have to
do is unwind this substitution.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.800
We already know that theta
is equal to arcsin of x.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.420
So we could say this is
equal to arcsin x plus C.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.430
And we're done.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.290
Using trig substitution,
we were able to evaluate

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.380
this indefinite integral.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.421
And another way you could
think about it is we've

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.320
just figured out what the
derivative of arcsin of x is.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.940
By taking the
antiderivative of this,

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.350
we got arcsin of x plus C. If
we take the derivative of arcsin

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.874
of x, we get this
business right over here.
