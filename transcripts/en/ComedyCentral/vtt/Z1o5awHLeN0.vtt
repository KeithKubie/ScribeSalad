00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.406
- Today is the day we
become Abbi and Ilana,

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.575
the boss bitches we
are in our minds.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.409
Are you with me?

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.643
Chya!

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:11.745

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.946

(hip hop music)

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.350
- Yas, yas, yas.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.551
This is Ilana.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.720 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I recognize you
from Abbi's Instagram.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.055
- That means so much to me.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.523
(shoes tapping)

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.491
This lighting is incredible.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.126
- Yas, yas, yas.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.027
Like, my friend Abbi.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.261
- You got a friend?

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.630
- Yeah, chocolate brown
eyes, ass of an angel.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.198
- I am not a mom.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.133
(thumping)

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.534
(shouting)

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.668
(thudding)

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:36.669
- I'm wild.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:37.504
- Yeah.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.672 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We could really
use some Abbi magic,

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.974
there's a pube situation.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.242
Somebody barfed on
an exercise ball,

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.377
and then it bounced down
two flights of stairs.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.279
- Oh Abbi, I love you.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.515 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I love you, too.
- You do?

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.482
- Yeah.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.450
- You're my little cupcake.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.718
- You're wearing a dog hoodie.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.019 align:start size:81% position:19%
- It's from the
dog owner section.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.021
- It has ear holes for dog ears.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:55.922
- Fixed it.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.526
(electronic beeping) -
Day 274, five hours late,

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.794
(laughing)

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.730
wearing a napkin as a
shirt, violently high.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.466
- You druggie lesbian Jews.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.936
(electronic music)

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:11.037
- Weed queen.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:13.606
- Is that your vaporizer?

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.642
- Vape life. (laughing)

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.044 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No pain when you're
gettin' your groove back.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.579 align:start size:88% position:13%
(smoke detector beeping)
No, no, no. (yelling)

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.081
(grunting) What?

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.183 align:start size:84% position:16%
- (beeping) you both,
you yuppie trash.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.051
- (beeping) my (beeping) dick.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.319 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hey listen, I
been there sweetie.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.153
- To my dick?

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.321
- Where's the bathroom?

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.023
- Where isn't the bathroom?

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.825 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're not a
baby, you're a man.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:33.893
- No. (high-pitched laughter)

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:35.095
- Chill out.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.097
- Miss hot lady, you
(lips smacking) got it.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.498
- Thank you.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:39.833
(hand smacking) - [Crowd] Hey.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.601
- It's kinda spunky, right?

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.703
- That's what she
said. (laughter)

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:44.971
- Jaimé, you are
the best roommate.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.673 align:start size:84% position:16%
When you're ready
to become a citizen,

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.841
my legs are wide open.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.808
- Thank you.

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.610
- I'm the king of America.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.978
- We are poly, we are bi.

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.046
- I'm not bi.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.149 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're right, how
do I know if I haven't

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.885
truly tested my boundaries?

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:02.956
- I (beeping) you in the
ass the first night that

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:07.026 align:start position:0%
we did anything, I think
that's pretty (beeping) mature.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:07.861
- Trey.

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.429
- Wassup?

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.430
- Wassup, hey.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.564
- You must be très horny.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.700 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm not Trey
anything Ilana, what?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.302
(laughing wildly) (kissing)

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.737
- Ooh.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:20.073 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I am at the farmer's market,
'cause this is so juicy.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.742
(moaning) Uh oh. (laughter)

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.278
- There's no trifecta,
it's more of like a duo.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.881
- Smart and sexy, she
is unreal, this girl.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.749
(lips smacking) Oh my God, I do.

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.051
You are sweeping me off my feet.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:35.955
(dramatic opera music)

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.491
- You are two lucky Jews.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.093
- We think so, too.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:43.363
(dramatic opera music)
