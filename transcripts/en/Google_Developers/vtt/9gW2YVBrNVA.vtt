Hi I'm Dan and I work on 
Open Social 

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.209
and today I'm going to take 
you through the basic steps 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.145
in running your own open 
social applications.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.380
So the first thing we are going 
to do 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.281
is a little primer on gadgets.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.752
And Gadgets at their basic 
level are just XML files.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.552
and so we are going to take 

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.455
a quick look at what a gadget 
xml file looks like

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.392
as you can see a gadget is just 
xml 

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.559
at the top of the file you 
can see the file

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.562
you can see the xml version 
type and encoding

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.799
and below that you can see 
the tags that specify this 

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.601
as a gadget file

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.803
we open everything up with a 
module tag 

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.905
and inside of that 
we have module preferences.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.408
that specify things 
like the applications title

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.844
and requires features 
necessary for the application

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:48.248
here requiring the open 
social feature 

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:52.685
and below that we actually 
define the content of the gadget

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.854
here the content  type is html 

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.790
 inside of that we have a 
"cdata" section 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.827
which is where all of our code, 
our html, and java script go

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.063
and the string "hello world".

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.165
so now that that little intro's out 
of the way we can 

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.168
go down and run our first 
social application.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.836
so there's a couple of things 
that you will need for this

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:13.573
First a text editor and a web 
hosting account.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.942
and in addition to that an orkut 
account 

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.644
and access to the 
orkut sandbox

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:21.848
which is where we allow you to 
test your social applications.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:24.250
i will assume that most of you 
have a text editor

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.186
and a lot of you probably 
already  have web hosting

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.555
but if you don't there are two 
things you can try.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.990
First is google code project 
hosting which is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.593
a place to host open 
source applications

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.462
so if you'd like to make your 
gadget open source

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.729
you can host it there

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.732
and if you don't want to do that  
you can use google page creator

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.535
which allows you to upload html 
files and edit html files 

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:47.273
and upload other non html files 
like gadget specifications

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.008
like what we're writing here.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.410
so once you have that out of the 
way 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.045
your going to need to
to create an orkut account

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:52.946
which is pretty straight forward.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.782
just goto orkut.com and it will 
walk you through the steps.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:56.549
once you've done that, 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.385
you're going to need to sign up 
for access to the orkut sandbox.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.387
which is pretty straight forward 
as well.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.456
we have a link that you can use 
to do that.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.824
and once you have access

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:07.861
you can log into 
"sandbox.orkut.com" 

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.062
and add your gadget

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.997
and I'll show you how to do 
that right now

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:14.834
so what you should do is take 
the text of the sample gadget

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:17.137
copy that into a text file 

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.807
and save it on your web hosting 
account as "helloworld.xml"

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.676
log in to your orkut account

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.145
click on the edit button, 

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:29.582
next to apps on the left 
hand side of the page

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:35.889
type in the url of your 
newly created xml file

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.893
click on the add application 
button

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:44.430
grant the application permission to 
access your account

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.568
and then click on the link that it adds 
to the applications on your page.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.171
so now you have installed 
your first social application into orkut.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.006
for more information on what i just did

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.042
as well as more information on the 
rest of the social API

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.545
check out the tutorial on  
"code.google.com" 

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.545
