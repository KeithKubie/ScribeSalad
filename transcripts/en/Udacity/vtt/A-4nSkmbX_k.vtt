Welcome to the Beginning Android
nanodegree.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.049
My name's Chris and
I'm a curriculum lead here at Udacity.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.280
&gt;&gt; And my name is Katherine, and
I'm a developer advocate at Google.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.760
&gt;&gt; There are over 1.4 billion
active Android devices today.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.540
So becoming an Android developer
means being able to build software

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.740
that can reach and impact the lives
of tons of users around the world.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a pretty incredible
time in history because mobile

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.340
apps are changing the way
that we live and work.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.980
So we're super excited that you're
taking the first step to becoming

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.150
a developer.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.970
For this nanodegree you don't
need any programming experience.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.330
If you know how to use a computer and
a smartphone, you're ready to go.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.010
No programming experience needed.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.170
So if you ever had an awesome idea for
an app but

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.050
didn't know how to get started,
then this is the program for you.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.850
&gt;&gt; We'll walk you through how to
build several simple Android apps.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.814
And along the way, you'll learn
the Java programming language and

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:48.689
also some key computer science concepts.

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.596
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're going to focus
on what's important and

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:53.930
how to directly apply what you've
learned to the apps you're building.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.590
&gt;&gt; It's going to be challenging,
and that's expected, but

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.250
that's why we're going to teach
you how to think like a developer.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.130
We'll explain the decisions
that arise in building an app.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.116
You'll learn how to read documentation,
search for online resources,

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:09.407
plan out your tests, and
also figure out how to get unstuck.

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:11.389
&gt;&gt; And signature to every
nanodegree experience,

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:14.240
you'll also have the opportunity to
complete projects on your own and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.510
get invaluable feedback on your code.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.310
&gt;&gt; And by the end of the program, you'll
have completed a whole portfolio of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.980
apps that you can share with
your family and friends.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.960
&gt;&gt; We hope that you become
inspired to learn more and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.490
go on to build some great apps.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go get started.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.360
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.
