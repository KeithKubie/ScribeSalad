Vsauce!

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:06.230
The Puss Moth Caterpillar is found in dense
woodland throughout Europe and Northern Africa

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.639
and is famous for having - a face.

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.619
It has a spike on the opposite end of its
face and can spray formic acid at predators

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.100
for self-defense.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.050
Their cocoon is one of the hardest of all
moth species and the adult puss moth can have

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.720
a wingspan of almost 10cm.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.960
What The Fak.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.529
The Facts and Knowledge on Weird Bugs.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.640
The giraffe necked weevil gets its name from
its enormously long neck.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.930
Males necks are generally 2-3 times longer
than the females and they use it to fight

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.789
for the chance to mate with female weevils.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.530
The females use their necks to create a nest
to lay a single egg.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.750
And it's native to the warm climate of Madagascar.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.579
The Devil's Flower Mantis is one of the largest
species of praying mantis.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.290
It mimics flowers and its coloration is considered
an example of aggressive mimicry which is

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.680
a form of camouflage where a predator's patterns
and color lure prey.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.860
They do this by climbing a plant and remaining
frozen near a suitable flower and wait to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.000
capture their prey.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.460
It's the only species classified under the
genus Idolomantis.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.510
The Scorpionfly is not actually a flying scorpion
but an insect with a stinger that doesn't

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.920
actually sting.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.460
It's the male genitalia of the scorpionfly
and females obviously lack this name-worthy

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.460
feature.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.020
To court females the males often offer them
a meal and then the mating occurs while the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.470
female is feeding on that nuptial meal.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.720
Amazingly, males are also believed to sometimes
pose as females to steal these nuptial meals

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.270
from competitors.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.920
The Golden Tortoise Beetle is native to the
Americas and notable for its shiny gold color

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.220
- giving it the nickname "gold bug".

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.500
The tiny metallic beetle was the first known
insect species that could rapidly change color

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.860
during copulation - or when disturbed by predators.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.480
They have a transparent shell and then red
pigment that flows, reflects and can be drained

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.910
depending on the color it wishes to create
when stimulated or agitated.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.870
The Stalk-Eyed Fly has long projections on
the side of its head that the eyes and antennae

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.920
are mounted on.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.629
When they emerge from their pupae, the stalk
eyed fly gulps in air and forces it through

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.400
ducts and into the stalks, growing them as
large as possible.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.609
The larger the eye stalks the greater potential
for reproduction because female stalk-eyed

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:37.040
flies prefer larger stalks and it gives them
a greater ability to fight off other males

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.140
for the females.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.180
Camel Spiders aren't actually spiders they
are solpugids, but they do belong to the arachnid

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.180
family.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.129
They became particularly notorious during
the Iraq War in 2003 when tales swirled about

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.079
them being blood thirsty and venomous.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.450
And while they don't quite live up to legends
they are still pretty frightening.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.390
They grow to 6 inches not including the legs
and can run 10 miles per hour.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.189
Their jaws can be up to one third of the length
of their body.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.249
And although they're not venomous they do
pack a powerful, painful bite.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:16.569
Extatosoma Tiaratum are also known as the
giant prickly leaf insect, spiny leaf insect,

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.690
Macleays Spectre, or the australian walking
stick.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.189
The females are much larger and covered with
thorny spikes for camouflage and protection.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.909
They are so large that their wings by comparison
are too small for flight.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.780
The males are smaller and only have spikes
on their heads, they also have the ability

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.400
to fly to avoid danger or find a mate.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.359
If there are no males around the female can
reproduce asexually through parthenogenesis.

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.390
These eggs take twice as long to hatch and
produce only females.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.319
I'm gonna leave you with this.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.290
What is it and what will it become?

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.659
Before we go here's last video's winner.

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.670
I'd like to thank my good friends at the BBC
for providing much of the great footage in

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.670
this video.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.230
Check out their channel Earth Unplugged and
this video in particular which answers the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.459
question "What would the Fox really say?"

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.980
While you're there make sure you subscribe.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.560
And as always - thanks for watching.
