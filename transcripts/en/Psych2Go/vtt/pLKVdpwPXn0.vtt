Have you been going on dates and wondering whether you should start a relationship or maybe you just moved because you got a new job

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.129
You're going to school since you don't know anyone and want to build connections. You might be asking yourself

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.899
Should I date and seek a relationship due to social norms?

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.019
We may often feel pressured to date when we're single but entering a relationship is a huge commitment

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.710
Have you been reluctant to try but not sure why?

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.879
Here are seven signs. You may not be ready for a relationship

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.239
One you care more about finding the perfect partner instead of working on yourself

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.460
Are you constantly daydreaming about finding your prince charming or Cinderella when you're walking down the streets and see many couples holding?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.729
Hands or listening to love songs as you're waiting for the bus

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.509
It's normal to think about who your ideal soulmate is

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.059
Love is exciting when you meet someone you share chemistry with but relationships always

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.799
require work in order to survive getting butterflies in your stomach isn't

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.939
ultimate love

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.339
Sometimes Prince Charming or Cinderella will let you down and it won't be perfect

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.399
Don't spend all your time and energy finding someone who meets every requirement on your list instead

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.009
Work on being the best version of yourself

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.109
- you're still working on your goals and discovering who you are

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.038
Do you want to travel and see more of the world or join programs that help you turn your hobbies into potential careers?

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.188
There's nothing wrong with doing you. In fact soul searching is an incredibly morning experience

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.619
That's when you get to reflect form connections with great people and do more of what makes you happy

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.679
3 you want someone to save you?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.129
it's not romantic to have someone save you from your problems or

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.509
misery if you're unhappy or want an easy way out of your problems a

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.289
Relationship is not the answer. You can't expect someone to be your hero or stop the hurt from hurting

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.670
It's dangerous to use relationships to distract yourself from your problems

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.289
In fact, this can even attract toxic partners who feed off of codependent behavior

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.919
Live your life actively and don't wait for someone to show up if you need help that's normal and healthy

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.659
Surround yourself with supportive people who can be there for you on bad days

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.450
For you want to save someone else?

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.129
You can't change or fix someone's damage when you want to rescue someone from their bad habits

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.129
You will consider them more as a project

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.099
Instead of someone you want to be in a relationship with although it was possible to fall in love with someone you want to save

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.129
this doesn't create the best or healthiest relationships trying to change someone who meets your

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.709
Expectations will only leave you with disappointment

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.290
Everyone has the capability to change

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.379
But through their own will and at their own pace

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.609
5 you still frequently think and talk about your ex. You can't control when or who you meet

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.619
That's why life works in mysterious ways

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.608
Unfortunately, that's how timing can sometimes be off

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.870
Just when you think you're ready to be in a relationship with someone they may still be

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.319
recovering from heartbreak and hung up on their ex or vice versa

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.269
If you're having a hard time recovering check out our video 5 ways to deal with a breakup

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.790
6 you have a hard time

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.040
Apologizing or admitting when you're wrong

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.519
There's one word that describes whatever relationship needs

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.790
Compromise if you have a habit of thinking you're always right and would rather hold on to your ego instead of making things

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.819
Right, and you may want to hold off entering a relationship?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.329
focus first on learning how to own up to your mistakes

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.459
reflect as often as you can and become more self-aware about the decisions you make

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.250
Everything has a consequence

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.010
7 you're emotionally closed off

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.770
If you have a tendency to keep your walls up

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.669
Then you may want to work on being vulnerable first practice with your friends and family or a therapist being in a relationship

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.550
Means allowing someone to see you for all that you are it's the only way for someone to love you, honestly

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.300
but if you have a habit of holding back

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.689
You must work through your fears and Trust issues before committing to someone a healthy relationship

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.410
