00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:50.983
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
TONY BLAIR?

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.652

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:17.176
THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.983
IS THE THEORY HELD BY MANY
THAT THE REAL REASON

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:33.653
THE U.S. IS SO INTERESTED
IN TOPPLING SADDAM

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.856
IS CONTROL OF THE OIL
THAT IRAQ IS SITTING ON.

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.257

THE U.S. WILL ACT

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:01.814
EVEN IF THE U.N.
IS RELUCTANT.

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:03.316

A PROBLEM WITH THAT,

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.383

YOU DON'T HAVE AN ARMY!

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.025
I GUESS THAT MEANS
YOU NEED TO SHUT THE (BLEEP) UP!

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:14.794

DISRESPECTING THE U.N.,

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:02.308
