00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.520
When you study physics, you can start to see
it everywhere – even here.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.320
As an engineer who studied physics, I have to say one the most interesting parts of the holidays is the lights.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.400
Just think of all of the crazy displays that you see, and what it would take to figure out the current required to power all of the tiny light bulbs that make them glow.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.820
So many resistors.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.010
Now, I’m not going to ask you to diagram
the holiday lights on your neighbor’s house.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.330
But, one of the best ways to understand how electricity works in a system like that, is through circuit analysis:

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.230
the process of breaking down a circuit into its key components, and studying each one, to see what it can tell you about the others.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.990
So far, you’ve learned about the key components of every electrical circuit – namely voltage, resistance, and current.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.050
These properties are all related to one another
through Ohm’s law.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.950
This means that if you know two out of the three variables, you can solve for the remaining one.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.190
For example, you can take a bunch of resistors in a circuit, find their equivalent resistance, and then use the voltage to figure out what the current is.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.460
And when you know the current, you can get even more important information, like the voltage across a particular component, or the current through a specific wire.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.420
So if nothing else, today’s lesson in circuit analysis will help you appreciate holiday lights on a whole new level.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:20.900
[Theme Music]

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.300
Let’s keep things simple.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.840
There’s an enormous number of circuit-building methods that I’d love to go over with you, but we’re going to stick to the basics, which you’ll use in every circuit problem you’ll encounter.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.460
These are DC circuits, with resistors in series
and parallel formations.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.959
You’ll recall that series formations occur when resistors are connected along the same path, so they have the same current passing through each one.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.740
And parallel connections are when resistors are placed on wires that branch out from a single point, all having the same voltage drop across them.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.580
And to find the equivalent resistance of resistors in series, you just add their resistances together.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:01.860
For resistors in parallel, meanwhile, you use a different method – one that gives you a resistor with an equivalent resistance that’s smaller than any of the individual resistors in the branches.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.860
Now, let’s put these equations to work!

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.000
Here’s an example of a circuit with resistors
in both series and parallel formations.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.060
Say you have a 20-volt battery, immediately
followed by a resistor of 10 Ohms.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.480
Following that, there’s a parallel
formation of more resistors:

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.380
One branch consists of two resistors in series,
one of 15 Ohms and one of 2 Ohms.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.580
The other branch has a 6 Ohm resistor, and then another parallel formation of resistors, 3 and 5 Ohms each.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.820
Our goal is to simplify everything down to one resistor, which will have the equivalent resistance of all of these resistors combined.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.340
With that equivalent resistance, you can then know
what the resulting current is in the circuit.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.600
Then, using Ohm’s Law, you can calculate the voltage across, and current through, each resistor.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.100
OK, let’s do the easiest steps first.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.180
Start by finding the resistors in a series.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.880
You can collapse these down into a single resistor by simply adding their resistances together.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.180
In this case, you add the 15 and 2 Ohm resistors
into a single, 17 Ohm equivalent resistor.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.439
Now that branch contains a single resistor.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.970
Let’s look at the other branch.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.800
This one has a single resistor and then two
in parallel.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.040
So let’s start by turning the parallel connection of the 3 Ohm and 5 Ohm resistors into one equivalent resistor.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.280
Using our equation for resistors in parallel, you find that they simplify to a single resistor of about 1.88 Ohms.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.820
Then, you can add the newly formed resistor to the 6 Ohm one, and the branch simplifies even more – to a single resistor of 7.88 Ohms.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.579
All right, you’re almost there!

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.800
Now, let’s combine the 17 Ohm and 7.88 Ohm resistors, which are in parallel, into one resistor and its resistance turns out to be 5.38 Ohms.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:44.100
And with that, you’re left with only two resistors in series, which you can combine to form a single resistor with the equivalent resistance of 15.38 Ohms.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.780
Now, there’s only one resistor left, which means you can easily find the current drawn from the battery!

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:58.340
Using Ohm’s Law, you can find that the current through a circuit with a 20 volt battery and an equivalent resistance of 15.38 Ohms is about 1.30 Amperes.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.700
Just pause for a moment and appreciate what
you’ve done so far.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.740
You were able to take what you knew about the power source and the number and configuration of the resistors to figure out the current that runs through the circuit.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.440
And it wasn’t that hard, was it?

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.760
And now that you’ve determined the current,
you can learn so much more!

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.400
With the total current in the system, you can expand the equivalent circuit back to its original form.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.260
And while you’re doing that, you can determine both the current through, and the voltage drop across, every single resistor.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.720
Just go back one step to the ten Ohm resistor,
and the 5.38 Ohm resistor.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.860
Nothing has changed about the current through
the circuit.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.580
And the two resistors are in series, so the
current flowing through them is the same.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.380
But the voltage drop across each resistor
is different.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.860
You can calculate the voltage drop across each
resistor by using Ohm’s Law, V equals I times R.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:52.600
You know the current, I, and you know each resistance, R, so you simply use them to find the distinct voltage drop, V, across each resistor.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:00.320
The voltage drop across the 10 Ohm resistor turns out to be 13 Volts, which leaves the remaining voltage drop across the rest of the circuit to be 7 Volts.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.080
And you don’t have to do anything with the 10 Ohm resistor, since that’s not a combination of resistors.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.040
So the current through and voltage across
that circuit element doesn’t change.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.260
In order to complete the rest of the circuit, let’s expand the 5.38 Ohm resistor back out again, to those two resistors in parallel.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:27.120
Now, you know that any two resistors in parallel have the same voltage drop, so both the 17 Ohm resistor and the 7.88 Ohm resistor have a voltage drop of 7 Volts, just when they were collapsed into one.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.380
But the current through each branch is not
the same.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.819
Since you know the resistance of, and voltage across, each resistor, you just use Ohm’s Law again to calculate the current through each wire.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.000
The 17 Ohm resistor, with a voltage drop of
7 Volts, will have a current of 0.41 Amperes.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.720
And the 7.88 Ohm resistor, with the same voltage drop of 7 Volts, will have a current of 0.89 Amperes.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.539
And look at this: If you add these two currents
together, they equal the 1.3 amperes.

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.979
That’s the same value for the current that
enters the junction where the wires split.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.180
This must be true, to satisfy conservation of charge, because remember: What goes in must come out!

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.080
Now, let’s expand the resistor on the right into its two components, a 6 Ohm and a 1.88 Ohm resistor.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:16.380
The current through these two is still 0.89 Amperes, but the voltage drop of 7 Volts is now split across the two resistors.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.220
All you have to do is implement Ohm’s law yet again, multiplying current and resistance in order to find the voltage drop.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.280
So 0.89 Amperes times 6 Ohms equals a 5.33
Volt drop.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.100
And 0.89 Amperes times 1.88 Ohms equals the
remaining 1.67 Volt drop.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.900
Now, It’s good to check that you’re on the right track by looking at the relationships of all of these values.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.860
Keep in mind that, for resistors in series, the larger the resistance is, the larger the voltage drop that’s required.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.020
Think of a big light bulb and a tiny light bulb on the same wire of holiday lights, using the same current.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.800
The little light bulb doesn’t draw nearly as much power, so it uses less voltage for the same amount of current passing through it.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.040
OK, back to work!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.940
Our 1.88 Ohm resistor is a combination of
a 3 Ohm and 5 Ohm pair of resistors in parallel.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.240
So the voltage drop across each resistor is still 1.67 Volts, but the current passing through each will be different.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.220
Using Ohm’s Law, you can divide the voltage across each resistor by its respective resistance, giving you the current through each branch.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.640
1.67 volts divided by 3 Ohms gives you a current
of 0.56 Amperes through the 3 Ohm resistor.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.320
And 1.67 volts divided by 5 Ohms gives you
a current of 0.33 Amperes.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:34.680
And since 0.56 plus 0.33 Amperes equals the 0.89 Amperes that enters the wire at the split, you know you’re on the right track.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.900
One last step!

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.200
The 17 Ohm resistor is a series combination
of a 15 Ohm and 2 Ohm resistor.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:48.220
Here, the current through them – 0.41 Amperes – stays the same, while the voltage drop across each one can be found using Ohm’s Law.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:54.440
0.41 Amperes times 15 Ohms equals 6.17 volts
across the 15 Ohm resistor.

00:07:54.449 --> 00:08:01.319
And 0.41 Amperes times 2 Ohms equals the remaining
0.82 Volts across the 2 Ohm resistor.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:08.500
To check your work, you can go back and see that the two voltage drops equal the total voltage drop across each branch after the 10 Ohm resistor.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.300
And you’ve done it!
Congrats!

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:17.840
You’ve taken a whole circuit, simplified it down to the bare minimum, then expanded it again, discovering the current and voltage values for every single resistor.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.979
But, even though we all love math, what if
that’s not enough for you?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.639
What if you physically constructed this circuit yourself, and you wanted to measure the values so that you knew your math checked out?

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.560
To measure voltage, you’d just need a tool
known as a voltmeter.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.800
Pretty creative, I know.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.100
Now, you want a way to measure voltage without
altering the actual circuit.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:40.620
No solution is perfect, but you can get a pretty accurate reading by attaching the voltmeter on either side of the device that you want to measure.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.100
And you do it that way, because you know that any components connected in parallel will have the same voltage.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.590
But even if you measure the voltage, you still
want to avoid changing the resulting circuit.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:55.780
So, what you do is give the voltmeter a resistance that's so high that it’s considered infinite, relative to the rest of the circuit.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:04.540
With an “infinite” resistance, the same voltage is read across both the voltmeter and the device you’re measuring, and a tiny amount of current ends up running through the voltmeter.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.640
OK, you’re a stickler, and even though you’ve confirmed your voltage, you want to do the same thing with the current.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.670
This time, you’ll use the fact that devices
connected in series share the same current.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.700
So, you need a device that can measure current, in series with another component, without changing the current.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.520
This is known as an ammeter, and it measures the current in Amperes by connecting in series with the circuit.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.400
It doesn’t affect the circuit, because the
device has a near-zero resistance.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.440
But here’s a pro tip: When you use these devices in the lab, be very careful not to mix up the methods of connection!

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:42.080
Attaching the ammeter, a device with near-zero resistance, in parallel with another resistor, will cause nearly all the current to run through the ammeter, possibly damaging it.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.900
And if a voltmeter is attached in series, you’re not going to see any current flowing, because the resistance is so large!

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:56.460
But used correctly, these devices can not only allow you to confirm your maths, they can also give you a hands-on way to measure the basic principles of Ohm’s Law in action.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.140
And they just might help you raise your holiday-lighting
game to a whole new level.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:05.680
Today, we saw how circuit analysis can be used on any series and parallel configuration of resistors in a DC circuit.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.080
We used Ohm’s Law to go from an equivalent circuit to solving for every current value and voltage drop in the system.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.060
Finally, we saw how to measure voltage and current in a real circuit using voltmeters and ammeters.
