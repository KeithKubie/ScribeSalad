00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.110
Shaving companies almost universally put out
both a men’s and women’s version of each

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.480
of their products, with the women’s version
generally costing quite a bit more.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.670
But is there actually any difference between
the so-called “gendered razors” and shaving

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.380
cream or is it all just clever marketing?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.800
We’ll start with whether there is any difference
in the razors.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.030
The answer to this question largely depends
on what exactly you are referring to when

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.030
you say “razor”.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.210
If we’re exclusively talking about the razor
blades themselves, then there is, for the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.110
most part, no difference whatsoever between
men’s and women’s razors, with the one

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.870
caveat being potential differences in the
quality of razor blades between brands.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.730
Beyond that, no brand we could find claims
to use different designed blades for their

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.730
gendered products.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.730
In fact, companies are not shy about admitting
this.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.580
For example, a few years ago Gillette issued
a press release in which they stated that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.729
the blades used in their gendered products
are both using the same “blade technology”.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.549
So the blades are the same, what about the
rest?

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.090
After all, women’s razors are generally
more expensive than men’s, so are you getting

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.090
anything for your extra money?

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.950
For starters, women typically use razors to
shave a much larger surface area than men

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.950
(18 times as much by some estimates).

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.160
In anticipation of this, many razors made
for women are built with a head that is more

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.460
rounded and often much larger than a comparable
male product.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.460
Why?

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.420
This extra stuff around the blades generally
includes some sort of “guide bar” like

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.890
device that essentially helps get longer,
fine hairs in the right position to be cut.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.290
This is done as many women, particularly in
the winter, let their leg hairs grow out between

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.290
shavings.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.250
This extra surrounding casing also typically
is designed to reduce the likelihood of cutting

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.820
yourself when shaving quickly as such a large
surface area often induces.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.930
On the flip side, the heads of men’s razors
are designed to facilitate more accurate facial

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.480
grooming with smaller heads around the blades,
as well as having the blades more tightly

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.480
packed.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.220
This serves to better cut thicker hair commonly
found on men’s faces vs. women’s legs,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.429
and to cut hair closer to the skin.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.920
The downside is that one has to be slightly
more careful when shaving if you want to avoid

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.489
accidentally cutting yourself.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.170
To further facilitate this difference in shaving
area, the blades of men’s razors are also

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.810
often put at more of an oblique angle than
women’s razors, along with a different contour

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.810
of handle.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.841
The difference in angle and handle shape allows
women to see better what they’re shaving

00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:31.380
when, for instance, looking down at their
legs, vs. men looking straight across into

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.380
a mirror.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.010
So what about shaving creams?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.160
Well, unlike razors, which while extremely
similar do have some differences, shaving

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.400
creams and foams are almost always identical
save for two differences- smell and price.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.530
The base ingredients of both for a given manufacturer
are generally the same, they’re just fragranced

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.150
and packaged differently depending on who
they’re marketed to.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.599
As for why women pay more for theirs (and
pretty much all other grooming-related products),

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.569
this is up for debate.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.440
Consumer Reports did an article on this very
phenomenon in 2009, specifically asking various

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.180
bath product manufacturers why there was such
a (often large) price discrepancy, with the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.860
responses from all companies leaving something
to be desired.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.540
The best, or perhaps just the most amusing,
was from Nivea, whose equivalent body washes

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.440
for men vs. women differ in price by about
27%.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.440
They claimed the price difference was because
the women’s version has “skin-sensation

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.370
technology”, which apparently isn’t a
technology that shows up in the ingredients

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.370
list.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.190
In an interview with Boston Magazine, Dr.
Kristina Vanoosthuyze ,who works at the Gillette

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.819
Innovation Centre, had this to say when asked
about the price difference, “The elastomer

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.701
materials in the grip points, finger rests,
and how women hold the razor are different

00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:47.900
and more comprehensive.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.860
It’s important to make the razor ergonomic
to use, because women typically shave in a

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.140
fairly wet environment.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.030
And for women, shaving can be like acrobatics,
trying to get the ankles, back of the legs,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.030
knees, etc.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.790
We want the handle to have good control so
she can move it around in her hands.”

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.140
This does a fair job of explaining the subtle
differences between men’s and women’s

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.660
razors, but is not quite as satisfactory at
giving a firm answer to the posed question

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.810
about the price difference, other than to
imply the slight difference in design is the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.289
reason for the large markup.

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.460
This, at least, is better than Nivea’s explanation.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.900
Perhaps the most reasonably explanation is
that proposed by Psychology Today.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.590
Lacking any good explanation from the manufacturers,
they speculate it is because women are under

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.000
a lot more pressure to be as well-groomed
as possible, so are simply willing to pay

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
more.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.460
By making it seem as if the women’s version
is superior for women, whether true or not

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.979
with a given product, they assure most will
be willing to pay a markup for the “best”.

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.800
So, in the end, with razors, there are some
tangible differences that may affect your

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.870
shaving experience depending on what you’re
shaving, and which you prefer may be more

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.389
a matter of personal preference and shaving
technique than your gender.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.809
And as for shaving cream- do you like that
flowery scent?

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:06.349
You’ll quite literally pay through the nose
for it over the more “manly” scented (or

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.900
men’s unscented) variety, which is often
made of the same thing as the women’s version

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.599
for a given brand.

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.669
This markup on women’s products doesn’t
just exist in the personal grooming world.

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.689
Inch for inch on material, women’s clothing
typically costs more than men’s.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.689
This is partially because tariffs on men’s
and women’s clothing products often differ,

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.789
with women’s being taxed at higher rates.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.680
Of course, this doesn’t usually account
for the full discrepancy.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.810
In addition, if you go to buy a bottle of
Excedrin Menstrual Complete, you’ll find

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.650
you’ll typically pay about 8% more for the
same number of pills as a normal bottle of

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.289
Excedrin Extra Strength.

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.520
The kicker is the pills in the two bottles
have the exact same active ingredients, in

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.930
the exact same amounts.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.990
But it’s not all about the gender divide
here.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.039
For instance, Excedrin Migraine gels will
cost you about 50 cents more for 100 gels

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.279
than the regular Extra Strength 100 gel bottle.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:01.279
As with Menstrual Complete, the active ingredients
are identical.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.770
I suppose the lesson here, beyond once again
demonstrating product manufacture costs often

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.389
have little to do with what consumers pay,
is that the more pain someone is in, the more

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.779
they’re willing to fork out to relieve it.

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:19.539
Think it’s weird that Gillette employs a
PhD in Dr. Kristina Vanoosthuyze to study

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:20.539
shaving?

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.590
Well, it might blow you away to learn that
at that one facility alone where Dr. Vanoosthuyze

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.339
works, there are more than 150 PhDs working
for Gillette, all studying how individuals

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:33.319
shave and testing numerous variations on their
products to improve people’s shaving experience.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:38.319
In fact, on average, almost 100 people per
day are observed shaving at that facility

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.319
in Reading.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.839
The ProGlide alone was tested on over 30,000
men before making it to market.

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.930
Needless to say, given the vast sums of money
that can be made in the shaving industry (and

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.490
that customers are mostly locked into buying
some shaving products), hiring the best and

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.409
brightest to get an edge (sometimes literally)
in the industry results in a lot of PhDs being

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:00.099
hired by the various manufacturers.

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:24.949
Somewhat unfairly, it is humorous to note
that the major changes to the razors are almost

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:40.029
always just adding another blade to the head
with each successive model.
