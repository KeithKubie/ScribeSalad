and microscopy methods to look at the
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.179
and microscopy methods to look at the
living brain and then we use them to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
living brain and then we use them to
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.769

at a data science institute event on
 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.520
at a data science institute event on
data visualization I gave a presentation

microscope and how it generated tons and

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
microscope and how it generated tons and
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.479
microscope and how it generated tons and
tons of data and there were all

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
tons of data and there were all
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490
tons of data and there were all
different ways of looking at that data I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
different ways of looking at that data I
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110
different ways of looking at that data I
presented a lot of results on

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
presented a lot of results on
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420
presented a lot of results on
neuroscience samples and I thought this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
neuroscience samples and I thought this
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.209
neuroscience samples and I thought this
would be billion for Volcanology and for

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
would be billion for Volcanology and for
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.420
would be billion for Volcanology and for
looking at the microstructure bubbles

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
looking at the microstructure bubbles
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.270

together and got funded I've always
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.080
together and got funded I've always
found volcanoes fascinating and of

interested in answering is is
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.289
interested in answering is is
understanding the way in which materials

appreciative of anything in the world
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.670
appreciative of anything in the world
where we're trying to understand the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
where we're trying to understand the
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260
where we're trying to understand the
fundamental principles that kind of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
fundamental principles that kind of
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.539
fundamental principles that kind of
govern the properties of these more

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
govern the properties of these more
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.450
govern the properties of these more
complex systems so to understand how it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
complex systems so to understand how it
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460
complex systems so to understand how it
will kind of curve up so how it evolves

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
will kind of curve up so how it evolves
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.399
will kind of curve up so how it evolves
you need to have an understanding of the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
you need to have an understanding of the
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.380
you need to have an understanding of the
physics and the chemistry that controls

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
physics and the chemistry that controls
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.770
physics and the chemistry that controls
it and some of these processes are super

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
it and some of these processes are super
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.170
it and some of these processes are super
big and some of the fossils happen at

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
big and some of the fossils happen at
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.469
big and some of the fossils happen at
the very small scale and and all this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
the very small scale and and all this
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810
the very small scale and and all this
knowledge is going into computer

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
knowledge is going into computer
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.420
knowledge is going into computer
simulations for example where we say

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
simulations for example where we say
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.609
simulations for example where we say
under these conditions will this volcano

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
under these conditions will this volcano
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.280
under these conditions will this volcano
erupt but we need to know what types of

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
erupt but we need to know what types of
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.980
erupt but we need to know what types of
physics to put in their models and this

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
physics to put in their models and this
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900
physics to put in their models and this
can only be done by doing experiments

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
can only be done by doing experiments
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.580
can only be done by doing experiments
and getting the observations to put into

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
and getting the observations to put into
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.330
and getting the observations to put into
these models in my lab we use lasers and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340
these models in my lab we use lasers and
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.009
these models in my lab we use lasers and
optics to try to gather information

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019
optics to try to gather information
 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.199
optics to try to gather information
about living tissue and the thing about

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
about living tissue and the thing about
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.030
about living tissue and the thing about
living tissue is that it's alive and

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
living tissue is that it's alive and
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.030
living tissue is that it's alive and
it's moving and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
it's moving and
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.160
it's moving and
it's got a lot of dynamics to it and so

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170
it's got a lot of dynamics to it and so
 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.800
it's got a lot of dynamics to it and so
we tried to build imaging systems and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810
we tried to build imaging systems and
 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.179
we tried to build imaging systems and
microscopes that could go really really

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189
microscopes that could go really really
 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.399
microscopes that could go really really
fast and then because we were imaging

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409
fast and then because we were imaging
 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.080
fast and then because we were imaging
the brain we needed to image deep into

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090
the brain we needed to image deep into
 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.059
the brain we needed to image deep into
the brain so we needed to do 3d imaging

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069
the brain so we needed to do 3d imaging
 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.179
the brain so we needed to do 3d imaging
the idea for escape came about over like

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189
the idea for escape came about over like
 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.729
the idea for escape came about over like
a 10-year period we we were doing lots

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739
a 10-year period we we were doing lots
 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.099
a 10-year period we we were doing lots
of different methods and we came up with

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109
of different methods and we came up with
 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.470
of different methods and we came up with
this kind of really weird way of

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
this kind of really weird way of
 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.330
this kind of really weird way of
collecting images that in the beginning

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
collecting images that in the beginning
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.800
collecting images that in the beginning
we didn't even know if it was gonna work

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
we didn't even know if it was gonna work
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.470
we didn't even know if it was gonna work
but as things developed gradually you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
but as things developed gradually you
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.209
but as things developed gradually you
know we realized it was a microscope and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219
know we realized it was a microscope and
 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.679
know we realized it was a microscope and
we started some collaborations with

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689
we started some collaborations with
 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.020
we started some collaborations with
people who had small things that they

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030
people who had small things that they
 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.149
people who had small things that they
wanted to image in 3d like fruit flies

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159
wanted to image in 3d like fruit flies
 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.440
wanted to image in 3d like fruit flies
and crawling and fruit fly larvae and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
and crawling and fruit fly larvae and
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.580
and crawling and fruit fly larvae and
then you know it grew from there and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590
then you know it grew from there and
 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.500
then you know it grew from there and
more that we realized it could do we

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510
more that we realized it could do we
 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.690
more that we realized it could do we
expanded its capabilities we expanded

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
expanded its capabilities we expanded
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.250
expanded its capabilities we expanded
the things that we wanted to image using

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
the things that we wanted to image using
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.839
the things that we wanted to image using
it the experiments run by a postdoc from

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849
it the experiments run by a postdoc from
 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.909

engineering and they put together the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060
engineering and they put together the
 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.449
engineering and they put together the
instruments one is making the mixture

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459
instruments one is making the mixture
 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.399

the other setting of the microscope and
 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.129
the other setting of the microscope and
then the images before we started with

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139
then the images before we started with
 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.379
then the images before we started with
them small experiments we also had

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389
them small experiments we also had

processes that they can then miniaturize

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079
processes that they can then miniaturize
 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.619
processes that they can then miniaturize
and put in the microscope this project

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629
and put in the microscope this project
 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.719
and put in the microscope this project
is certainly rekindled my childhood love

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729
is certainly rekindled my childhood love
 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.360
is certainly rekindled my childhood love
of volcanoes and geography I took my

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370
of volcanoes and geography I took my
 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.159
of volcanoes and geography I took my
