00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.140
Many people claim their "thing" is under assault
by culture.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.360
But, yo, this might actually be true for science...

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.629
Hey friends who love science (or other people
who hate it), my name is Trace Dominguez,

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.810
and this is DNews, a science show.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.810
Just FYI.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.810
Cool.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.230
Yes, I know science isn't literally under
attack.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.230
Not really.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.039
I mean, earlier this year, the former Secretary
of Justice of the UK did say, [quote] “people

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.250
in this country have had enough of experts.”

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.960
And at the time of this video, the possible
head of the EPA here in the US has called

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.019
climate change policy one of “many pretexts
for expanding government," and called global

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.879
warming "phony" and "not based in science…"

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.100
Plus, the Vice President-Elect called climate
change a "myth" and "a theory" and the President-Elect

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.249
said it's not caused by humans.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:54.179
Though it might be a "hoax" perpetrated by
China... where humans live, so someone will

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.100
have to figure out how that vogues.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.079
Maybe if we could call in some extra experts,
I'm sure the UK has some.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.530
Meanwhile, according to multiple reviews of
the scientific literature, 97 percent of publishing

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.250
scientists who study it say climate change/global
warming is real, it's happening now, and we

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.250
need to act.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.860
The sea levels are rising and the sixteen
warmest years since 1880 have all been in

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.630
the 18 years since 1998, with most of the
temperature increasing since 1970.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.230
The science is settled.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.230
There's a lot of evidence.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.070
And yet, people don't believe it.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.970
We sitting are in a metaphorical car sinking
in a river and debating how we got off the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.470
road and whether cars float!

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.470
It doesn't matter!

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.530
We need to do something!

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.130
Why don't people believe evidence?

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.110
A 2015 study in the Annals of the American
Academy of Political and Social Science explores

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.850
that exact question!

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.530
But before we look at that study, let's go
a bit more broadly… a study in Public Opinion

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.950
Quarterly, points out politicizing something
like nuclear power at all "renders arguments

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.310
about the environmental benefits… invalid."

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.840
Even if there is a consensus!

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.000
Basically, when something is politicized,
we react emotionally, and stick to status-quo…

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.100
because change is scary.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.440
So, knowing that, let's go back to this new
study about why we hate evidence so much.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.330
Researchers created a model of human cognition
to see why people don't believe evidence,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.080
even when it's right in front of them.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.170
They believe essentially, we have a problem
separating our emotion from decisions.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.540
Political opinions and ideologies are part
of those emotions.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.140
Let's say I'm asking you about global warming...
according to their model and other research,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.570
within 200 milliseconds you'd feel your "hot
cognition," basically prejudgement of the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.570
topic!

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.530
You've already evaluated your feelings on
this topic and thus have an opinion.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.830
And that hot cognition and your emotions are
then tainting how you feel about the evidence.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.150
For example, if you've been told humans cause
climate change and you believe that climate

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.390
change equals regulation, and that regulation
is bad, then because of hot cognition, climate

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.920
change equals bad.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.640
It only takes milliseconds for this to occur
-- and it's one of the first steps in forming

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.720
an opinion… but it's super important.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.100
Because every memory, every thought and everything
after this can be tainted by the hot cognition

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.100
opinion.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.630
The psychologists who published this paper,
think the reason you don't believe the evidence,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.530
is because we prejudge everything with our
emotions.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.140
And it's not just politics that can cause
it… sad music, attraction to the person

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.700
speaking, even the weather can affect your
true feelings on… well, everything.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.610
But that's just one model of many.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.660
Emotions do affect everything we do, but we
can fight the natural tendency to react emotionally

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.650
to evidence by THINKING.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.050
The problem is that takes energy and effort.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.819
Humans have a natural tendency, according
to early 20th century social psychologist

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.630
Kurt Lewin, to resist change -- thinking is
hard.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.599
He says we like the status-quo (and our inherent
opinion) because we value the groups we belong

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.820
to now, change means inviting discomfort into
our social reality.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.300
It's so much easier to say, I don't believe
you, you're challenging my status quo, my

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.650
default, my social reality, and even though
I've never read anything on what you're talking

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.220
about -- I feel that it's bad, and will fight
to not expend energy on this.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.109
The moral of this story, as I see it, based
on this research, is people don't believe

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.680
in science because it requires we think, evaluate,
and re-evaluate.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.810
Which is hard.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.110
At times science does feel unnatural, it asks
us to question, be skeptical, and to debate

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.000
as objectively as possible -- all things we
don't naturally do well.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.730
It's a skill we can learn, if cultivated,
and encouraged.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.500
So, knowing this, if you want someone to believe
your evidence, don't appeal to their emotions,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.410
appeal to their curiosity.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.490
Avoid presenting evidence that will trigger
joy, anger, fear, or disgust -- instead, trigger

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.600
their thinking caps, their cognition…

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.300
And if I haven't convinced you of that, maybe
re-watch this video.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.220
If you like thinking about how we think about
things, check out this video on our SeekerDaily

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.220
sister show about an ancient Greek dude who
says we all know nothing, even if we think

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.240
we know stuff.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.320
