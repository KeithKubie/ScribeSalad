00:00:00.661 --> 00:00:03.831
- [Voiceover] Let's compare 5/6 and 5/8.

00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:05.369
Let's think about what they mean.

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:09.036
5/6 means five out of six pieces.

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:12.307
If you have a whole,
let's say a whole cake

00:00:12.307 --> 00:00:14.357
and you cut it into six pieces,

00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:18.722
5/6 is five of those six pieces.

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:21.548
5/8 again is five pieces.

00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:22.797
That's something that's the same.

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:24.900
We're both talking about five pieces,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.716
but this time, we've split our cake

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:31.323
into eight pieces, so it's
five out of eight pieces.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:33.900
We can represent that by drawing it.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.746
Maybe we can draw, here is one whole.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.496
And then another one.

00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:44.047
So these are two equal wholes,

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:46.330
and on one of them, we can shade 5/6

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.646
and the other 5/8.

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:50.335
That way we can look and compare them.

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.657
So for 5/6, if we divide this whole,

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:55.610
and we were using the example of cake,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.860
into six equal-size pieces,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.729
not sure if those are perfect,

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.619
but let's say those are
six equal-size pieces,

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.786
5/6 is talking about five of those pieces.

00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:11.637
So one, two, three,

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:16.233
four, five.

00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:21.572
This image represents 5/6.

00:01:21.572 --> 00:01:25.659
Now for 5/8, let's think
about it for a second.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.185
Will the pieces in 5/8 be bigger

00:01:29.185 --> 00:01:31.461
or smaller than 5/6?

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:34.961
Are eighths bigger or smaller than sixths?

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.813
Well, we can draw and see.

00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:39.578
If we have the same size whole,

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:41.712
which we need to have the same size whole,

00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:45.879
and we draw and we split it
into eight pieces this time,

00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:50.468
so now we have fourths, and eighths,

00:01:52.948 --> 00:01:55.263
these pieces, these eighths,

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:57.851
1/8 is smaller than a sixth

00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:59.482
'cause this time we had to split the cake

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:03.054
between eight people, so
we got smaller pieces.

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.823
Now again we can shade five of them.

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:07.561
Seems like five pieces might be equal

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:10.721
to five pieces, but we can look and see.

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:13.971
Four, five, and now we can look and see

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:19.379
the 5/6 takes up more
space, takes up more area,

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.051
this is a larger amount,
and the reason is because

00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:27.432
each sixth, each piece is larger.

00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:31.599
So five larger pieces is more
than five smaller pieces,

00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:37.520
or is greater than, and
remember with our symbol,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.265
the open side, the larger side,

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:43.009
should be facing our larger number.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:47.092
So 5/6 is greater than 5/8.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.947
Here's one more, but this time,

00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:51.801
let's try to compare them without drawing,

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:54.818
let's just think about what these mean.

00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:58.485
2/5 means two pieces out of five.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.050
So one whole was split five ways

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.467
and we got two of the pieces.

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:09.755
2/3 means that same whole
was split three ways

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:12.679
and we got two of the pieces.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.429
Well which two pieces are larger?

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:19.921
The 2/3 are larger, 'cause if we only

00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:22.405
have to split our pieces three ways,

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:24.423
we can have larger pieces.

00:03:24.423 --> 00:03:27.347
So the 2/5 are smaller.

00:03:27.347 --> 00:03:30.347
These two smaller pieces are less...

00:03:31.873 --> 00:03:34.620
These two smaller pieces are less

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.303
than the two larger pieces, and again,

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:40.260
the open end of our
symbol should be facing

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.607
the larger number.

00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:45.440
So 2/5 is less than 2/3.
