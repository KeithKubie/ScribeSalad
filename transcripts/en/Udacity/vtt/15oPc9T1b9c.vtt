00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.920
Okay Michael whats the answer? Let's start with resigner resigner.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.900
&gt;&gt; Alright, resigner resigner. Resign resigner diner.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.200
Alright, E, so resigner vs resigner. So resinger,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.910
if A is a resigner that means whenever A gets a red card A resigns. Yes.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.065
&gt;&gt; And that would be a negative 20.

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:21.460
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.400
&gt;&gt; But that's not going to be the answer is it. Because A

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.460
doesn't always, A doesn't always get a red card A

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.490
sometimes gets a black card if A gets a black

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.740
card [CROSSTALK] than a resigner, resigner that means B is

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.582
going to resign and, and a plus 10 will happen.

00:00:36.582 --> 00:00:37.140
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.362
&gt;&gt; So those are the two possibilities and they're equally likely, so it's a

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:46.290
minus 10 divided by 2 which is minus 5. Right. You were correct, sir.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.860
&gt;&gt; Whew. Alright.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.830
&gt;&gt; Which one do you want to do next?

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.600
&gt;&gt; Resigner seer.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.110
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.330
&gt;&gt; So again, oh, so the, yeah, good. This is a good choice, because

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.860
now it's the same as argument as before, except for when we end up in

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.960
that far right node, and that means minus 20 in half the cases, plus 30

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.720
in half the cases Which is a plus 10 divided by 2, or plus 5.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.380
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Well done Michael.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.550
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.340
&gt;&gt; Okay which one next?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.470
&gt;&gt; So holder resigner. So holder reigner.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.260
That means when A, gets a card. A is going to hold the card.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.561
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:22.610
&gt;&gt; And that's true, red or black.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.910
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.910
&gt;&gt; And then, then, it's going to be B's turn, and B is

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.120
going to, oh, we're doing holder resigner. So, it's going to resign.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.535
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:32.750
&gt;&gt; So, oh, well, interestingly, I think that takes us

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.490
to those two leaves, both of which are plus ten.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.810
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.210
&gt;&gt; Because, why does that make sense?

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.810
Because B, oh, 'cause B doesn't get any,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.230
no. Right, right, right, because it's independent of the

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.900
card. You actually said that when you explained the rules.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.795
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:48.800
&gt;&gt; So its, its average of plus 10 and plus 10, which ought to be plus 10.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.011
&gt;&gt; It is in fact plus 10. Well done. Okay what about holder's here?

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:58.126
&gt;&gt; Whew, alright, so that's a case where A holds so we go down those

00:01:58.126 --> 00:02:03.940
branches and we end up, we always end up in one of the blue circled states.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.720
&gt;&gt; Yep. And

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.889
B sees half the time that leads to minus 40, half the time that leads

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:15.050
to plus 30. So that's minus 10 divided by 2, which is minus 5 again?

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right. So that's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.330
correct, Michael. And that's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really like this game. I didn't think you could

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.450
have anything that had sort of poker essence and be this tiny.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.970
&gt;&gt; So yeah, so we live in this really nice

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.410
little structure here. So I have a question for you.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.140
You ready for the question?

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.130
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to guess what it is, but sure.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, here's my question. What is the value of this game?

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.830
&gt;&gt; I was thinking that you might ask that. So,

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.520
can I, can I step through it, is that okay?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure, go ahead. So a's choosing the first row or

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.750
the second row. So if a chooses the first row, and then

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.150
b chooses the column, then if it's the first row, then b

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.620
is going to choose the first column. So a's going to get minus 5.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.133
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:01.260
&gt;&gt; The same story's going to go through on the bottom row. If a chooses

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.300
the bottom row, then b's going to choose

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.640
the seer position which gets the minus 5.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.170
&gt;&gt; Right. So from this so, it seems that the value of the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.030
games minus 5. But now let's do the same thing on the b column.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.250
So if V, resigns, now a gets to choose resign or holder. And

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.830
it gets a plus 10. And if B is a sire. Then A chooses

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.253
between re signer and holder and gets plus 5.

00:03:24.253 --> 00:03:24.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.470
&gt;&gt; So then from this perspective, the value

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.050
of the game is plus 5. So, so here's

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.400
a case where it better not be that

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.730
we could take a perfect information game and put

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.610
it into a matrix and get this out,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.090
because this is something that can't, like, it doesn't,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.860
it doesn't fit your theorem, right? We can't get

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.220
the value of it by doing minimax or maximin.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.870
&gt;&gt; Exactly, the problem here is that once

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.900
you move the hidden information. Minimax is not

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.600
necessarily, and in this case, definitely is

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.130
not equal to maximin. So von Neumann.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.150
&gt;&gt; Fails.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.690
&gt;&gt; As we all see.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.290
&gt;&gt; Idiot.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what has, what has he ever

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.460
done for us, anyway? His theorems and his computer

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.400
architecture that rules the world. Anyway, so we

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.290
seem to have a problem here. And the problem

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.320
is that once we go to this hidden

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.750
information, as I promise complexity enters in Michael, and

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.680
now we can't do something very simple with

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.990
the matrix, find a pure strategy that's going to work.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.470
It really is the case that A strategy depends upon what B will do and

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.410
B strategy depends upon what A will do.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.579
And if you don't already know what that's

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.980
going to be, you don't actually have a value for the game. And in some sense

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.880
you can get every single one of these

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.269
values. So, there's got to be some [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:27.269 --> 00:04:29.200
&gt;&gt; I feel like, that's sort of what you'd

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.390
expect in a game like this. Right. So, if, because

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.950
of the way that it is. If you know that

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.330
I'm always a resigner. That I'm always going to, what?

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.560
[LAUGH] Oh, that when ever I have a

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.170
red card, I'm going to resign, then. You know

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.370
that if I don't resign, I have a black card, so you know that you should resign.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.301
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:47.301 --> 00:04:50.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's, it's, it's one of these things where if I

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.930
am really consistent and never bluff, say, then you can take advantage of

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.620
me, and vice versa. Like, if you always respond the same way to

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.490
when I act a certain way, then I can manipulate that. So it's kind

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.390
of like this game of this sort of mind game like I want you to

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.920
not know that I know the thing that you don't know that I don't know.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.370
&gt;&gt; Right but the problem is that I know what you

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.870
know and I know that you know what I know. And that

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.520
I know that you know that I know that you know

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.530
that I know that you know that you know what I know.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.360
&gt;&gt; Did you really think that I didn't know that?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.870
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so you end up in this terrible situation. But. There

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.670
was a key word that you used there, Michael, and it was consistent.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.680
And everything we've talked about so far, pure strategies, is

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.480
exactly the same thing as talking about consistency. So, the way

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.590
we're going to get around this is, we're going to stop

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.440
being consistent, or at least, consistent in the same way. Okay?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.520
&gt;&gt; And to cheat here, is that we are now going

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.770
to introduce, instead of pure strategies. Let's see the opposite of pure.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.800
&gt;&gt; Is?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.120
&gt;&gt; Impure.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.630
&gt;&gt; Mixed, that's exactly right.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.820
&gt;&gt; Contaminated.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.220
&gt;&gt; No, so, rather than sticking with pure

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.850
strategies, we're going to start using mixed strategies.
