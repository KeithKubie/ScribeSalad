00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 in this capsule we see 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.150
 definitions related to the process of 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.650
 marco decision well then start 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.599
 firstly to define what is 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.549
 that a decision process marks well 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.189
 which is called in English mark up of this 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.410
 gene process or so despite a 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.330
 decision process mark returns that's 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.420
 four things first one set 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 convinced states where we define 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.960
 often in addition an initial state to those 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.540
 that's also a set of actions 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.520
 action community did action is going to be 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.200
 a function that will take at the entrance 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.719
 a possible state 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.930
 is going to belong to big is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.910
 our set of states and therefore action s 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 is a function that returns if I 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.500
 find out what the actions are 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.710
 possible that I can take how 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.530
 that my agent can take kind then 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 a transition model then expresses 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.290
 knowing s is to or must belong to 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.450
 possible actions in the state s 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.280
 when I use so small instead of 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.810
 the action for to say the same thing 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.369
 so actions like that it's the same 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.619
 thing that they on the small screen so pds 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.780
 premium knowing st1 it's going to be the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.869
 probability that I am in the state s 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.570
 bonus if I am the state s is that I 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.299
 do the action so that's what I'm going 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 call my transition model and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.100
 finally kind of a function of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 rewards air de s who tells me what 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 is the utility of finding myself in the state s 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:49.979
 what is the use for money 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:51.329
 to be in the state and therefore in fact a debit 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.369
 on a general model for a 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.229
 stochastic environment in which 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.939
 an agent to make decisions and 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.400
 receives rewards one can 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.020
 actually modeled 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.560
 any environment 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.470
 stochastic where there is an agent who can 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.380
 make decisions so we make a 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.990
 first guess keynes provision 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.300
 marc collienne of the first order 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.670
 to say that and so we see the assumption 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.920
 here in the transition model 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.280
 so we assume that if I know in what 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.270
 state I am and that I determine a 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.010
 action to take 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.150
 that's all it takes for me to 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.010
 determine the probability of the state where I 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.680
 could be found at the next moment 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.810
 minds so it does not depend on the pond 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.260
 where I was at 8 pm under two 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.610
 instances or three years was working these 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.270
 institutes so that's an assumption 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.550
 marco come we do in this 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.140
 context and so for a process of 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.870
 decision mark good care appropriate 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.250
 we must be satisfied with what we 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.630
 believes that its provisions 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.470
 can make it not too bad 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:03.770
 in the context of our application in 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.770
 more 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.660
 we could use a process of 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.350
 mark decision comes back that will require 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.000
 that we describe the goal to athens to 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.660
 from a reward function 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.580
 so if we want to model a swimmer 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.140
 that we want to see act intelligently in 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.590
 a given environment and then reach a 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.320
 certain goal like winning result a 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.900
 poison or won a game in a game 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.990
 or a website in this case also it goes 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.640
 we need to describe this goal 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.300
 there in the form of a function of 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.280
 rewards 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.290
 a typical way of doing things is 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.040
 simply high rewards partner 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.340
 to a state that matches winning a game 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.260
 or solve not so we put a mdp 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.780
 a rat as a decision of process vote 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.910
 appropriate help if the purpose that I 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.780
 wishes to describe can be described under 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.730
 the form of a reward function 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.459
 so if we take the example of the grid 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.239
 where we have a robot agent that can 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.830
 move but when if the whole s &amp; d 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.720
 is impossible it would be all of 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.230
 possible positions in the grid so 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.570
 all the cars they identify here 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.830
 will have some examples to identify this 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.010
 would be all of his 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.380
 positions when possible 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.270
 it's about the stock equities of m 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.550
 that would be the possible actions by 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.740
 example if I was here I prefer 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.140
 the four actions go up to 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.430
 the carry she hung at 3 if I got 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.410
 found here I could not 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.120
 allow in the right because of the wall 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.680
 right next so manage a whole 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.479
 of actions that would only contain 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.550
 three possible actions would be 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.620
 returned simon steps correspond to 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:52.130
 this winery the uci and then finally ben 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.310
 may the reward function air de s is 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.020
 described in this secular rectangle if I 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.380
 find me a state that matches game 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.180
 white 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:06.169
 rds 0.6 to find a square like that 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.560
 it would be less 0.4 and then for goal 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.850
 for the few and to associate it with 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.979
 where I want my agency to 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.979
 places I had a positive reward 

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:22.999
 and finally it was mentioned that 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.799
 effects of the shares was uncertain so 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:26.919
 in this case it did that 

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:30.259
 represent by my transition model 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.929
 so in this example if if I find myself 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.589
 in this grid there and that I took 

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:38.089
 the action go room 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:40.879
 so that would be the value of 'then is 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:43.909
 that would be where they stand because they are 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:46.369
 found in my grid and well 25% this 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:50.059
 would be the probability that s prime is 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:51.679
 equal to because we have it here 50% this 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:57.049
 would be the probability that s prime is 

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:59.149
 that then we would have 25% by the tpo 7 is 

00:05:57.049 --> 00:06:01.159
 also and then for the other steps 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:04.789
 passive to know be here ben I would have 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:08.389
 a priority expressed in this respect to this 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:11.749
 state if equal to zero 6 aces corresponds to 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:14.769
 7 sits and that corresponds to the action 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:14.769
 was going south 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:23.659
 another important concept is that 

00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:26.449
 from a decision to a decision this is the 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:29.749
 choosing an action for a given state 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:33.799
 so it's a kind of estate rules 

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:39.169
 vein action one has an example here of 

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:40.849
 the illustration of a mbp where we have 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.539
 actions that correspond to 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:47.989
 coordinates ex y different boxes 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:51.439
 possible and then what we have a 

00:06:47.989 --> 00:06:54.079
 tag for each of the links that 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:57.229
 corresponds to a possible action by 

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:59.929
 example for if I'm in this state 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:02.659
 if the action w that is the west action 

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:08.029
 with a driving range 0.2 it will make me 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:13.969
 go from 21 21 to 20 13 0.32 May 21 from 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:15.759
 21 21 to 21 13 then with 0.5 21 forgiveness 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:20.299
 not 21 21 May 21 12 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:21.229
 vervins doubt so we notice what 

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:22.519
 is the most likely it is 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:24.679
 actually to move directly 

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:27.409
 towards the west but that there is some 

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:28.920
 quality that I do not make investments 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:31.890
 direct to the west 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.020
 because I have notion of uncertainty in 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.970
 the result of actions age and at 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.280
 arrows that are rather labeled by s 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:43.020
 it would be for the action kids alpine 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:45.750
 so locates a decision so that would be so 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.660
 an example it would be for example that if 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.840
 I find myself in 21 12 I do the action 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.880
 west so that would mean that according to 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:58.590
 this decision there if I'm in 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.760
 this vise so badly the distributions that the 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:04.320
 distribution that interests me is the one 

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:06.300
 given by the action where is our 

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.120
 different decision that would mean that 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.270
 if I'm in 21 12 I want the action 

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.240
 taken so be it that corresponds to 

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.560
 east to east what could be discreet 

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:22.260
 in this example if but it's another 

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.710
 example of possible action now a 

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.150
 plan 

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.760
 it's a strategy that will determine the 

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:34.979
 choice of an action for all states 

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:37.200
 of big s so sometimes I will use 

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:38.880
 the word full sometimes I used the word 

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.470
 political these two words that are 

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.390
 used to describe the same thing so 

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:45.750
 if it's exactly I'm referring 

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:47.610
 will have exactly the same concept is 

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.620
 so a plan or a policy that's 

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:53.010
 really a set of these rules and 

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.980
 free state vein action so we could 

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:58.530
 as well as on a plane we often use 

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.350
 the symbol pis to represent 

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:04.170
 plans you will be brought a set of 

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.880
 decisions in what if in this plan there 

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.070
 if I find myself in 21 12 

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.750
 I should take the action wes if I 

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.450
 found in twenty thirteen should take 

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:16.040
 the action is what you find me in 21 13 

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:18.780
 my agent will take action titled 

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.690
 and so stood out here in my 

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.060
 example of rdp 

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.630
 where the actions the decisions that 

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.870
 would be taken by this policy then 

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.880
 1 are shown in dashed lines here 

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.400
 Sunday around 21 12 

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.740
 I take west action so it wants 

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.310
 to say that of this state if I try 

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:42.890
 probability the demand to these three states 

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:47.090
 following there and if I was in 

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:50.900
 twenty eleven is not the industry here 

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:54.500
 but if I had a lot like 20-11 as 

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:58.360
 that and then I had association the 

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:01.330
 decision of the action not shown here 

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:06.800
 then because some qualities come up to 

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:09.260
 other states next and here we have a 

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.450
 another example of plans that is called 

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.030
 peter so in this case also the decision 

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.830
 in 21 12 is different it's rather 

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.650
 action is what is taken 

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:22.220
 then in vain to the action that is 

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:24.410
 pressed is so we see that it is 

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:29.300
 well life these transitions the water are 

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:31.400
 indicated dotted here a plan or a 

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.960
 politics it's just a whole 

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.850
 decisions that determines all 

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.310
 actions that I should take for all 

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:46.340
 the possible states as a whole 

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:49.130
 of states of my mbp and so we will note 

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:52.310
 often pi 2 aces committing action 

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:55.010
 designated by my clan and if I'm in 

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:58.640
 the state is this so an algorithm that 

00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:00.820
 run ray or would apply a plan 

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:05.540
 what they would do is 

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:09.520
 for as long as 

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:13.610
 I'm waiting for the end too, no hunger 

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.200
 the execution of the money so when if 

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.150
 I'll have a sailing loop that would finish 

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.970
 never will I do that at each 

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:22.639
 iteration game 

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.410
 I measured what is my current state 

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:28.370
 in my environment 

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.720
 that's the part of s for my state's I 

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.490
 ask my plan that she should 

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.129
 to be the action I have to take who wants 

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:37.160
 put back i'm going to noted hadopi 

00:11:34.129 --> 00:11:39.259
 2 is equal to the action in question and I 

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.779
 will execute the action and then I will 

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:45.410
 1st measure what is now my state 

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:48.050
 ask for my action again given the 

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:51.529
 plan i'm running pi and run this 

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.870
 action and continue like that so 

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:56.329
 infinitely or until I have a 

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.519
 stop condition that I can 

00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:59.949
 determined but generally speaking we 

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:05.870
 pose in fact another age hours 

00:11:59.949 --> 00:12:08.000
 runs infinitely so where one 

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.769
 can simulate the shot he would run 

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.170
 without knowing when hunger to live and in 

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:17.449
 so does step 1 could involve 

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.850
 some detection so that the call 

00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:22.100
 to censors could do why 

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:27.250
 maybe locate the agent in his 

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:29.689
 environment and the result so the state 

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.759
 following after performing an action to 

00:12:29.689 --> 00:12:33.139
 your stochastic heads it's not 

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:36.529
 something we can predict 

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:39.199
 for sure because I a month 

00:12:36.529 --> 00:12:40.910
 mdp I have a transition model that is 

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:43.579
 probabilistic so I have probabilities 

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:45.230
 associated with what will be the next state is 

00:12:43.579 --> 00:12:48.259
 this crime which expresses that is the 

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:50.870
 next next value of s after 

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:54.199
 have performed the action a kind 

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:56.240
 several different parity kind not 

00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:58.279
 necessarily to take advantage of 1 for a 

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.290
 alone and then following elections so that's 

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:04.100
 really transitions that are going to be 

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:10.850
 stochastic for the actions that I 

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:14.389
 will finally take in a mdp 

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:17.059
 if I specify a plan many countries 

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:20.209
 finally for a fixed shot will result 

00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:23.930
 in a brand chain actually if 

00:13:20.209 --> 00:13:25.879
 I know a plan ppi given its 

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:29.740
 state it means that s 

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:32.620
 my action here is going to be a function 

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.200
 deterministic of my state s 

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.930
 so in fact it's like I have a 

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.210
 markov chain which determines the 

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.550
 probabilities of going to express myself 

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.260
 so given is this so eventually it's 

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.420
 as if the balls of the transitions 

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:50.080
 costs of food only 2 aces 

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.430
 since then and give me my action 

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.500
 as well as it's not something that 

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.630
 that I can vary something that who 

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.240
 will be fixed if I suppose that the implant 

00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:01.600
 data and therefore sets for a policy 

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.550
 who gives and I get a chain of 

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.290
 markov and if I go to rimont plan in 

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.820
 do the same policy 

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.130
 I'm going to have a markov chain that 

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.750
 vote is different and it's a chain 

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.230
 of markov of first order since that 

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:17.680
 depends only on the previous state 

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:20.320
 so there the state according to its distribution 

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.540
 departure only from the previous state and 

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.990
 normalize the states further in 

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.990
 the story
