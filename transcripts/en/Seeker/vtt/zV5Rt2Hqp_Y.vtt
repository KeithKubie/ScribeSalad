00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.240
From drug trials to brain research, mice are
critical to scientific studies.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.640
Some labs are just lousy with mice.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.680
You know what science needs though?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.210
More mice.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.150
Hi everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.400
The power of science derives from testing
an idea over and over.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.560
Obviously that raises ethical problems when
something needs to be tested on humans.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.600
You can’t just create a new drug and then
immediately start trying it on people, who

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.199
knows what the side effects might be?

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.630
That’s why between test tube experiments
and human trials, a new drug has to pass the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.390
gatekeeper that is Mus musculus, the humble
lab mouse.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.260
Mice have been crucial to advancing science.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.460
They’ve contributed so much to so many fields
that there’s even a statue dedicated to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.470
them outside the Institute of Cytology and
Genetics in Novosibirsk, Russia.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.830
Animal rights groups may not like it, but
the mice’s sacrifices have saved many a

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.830
human life.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.780
Still, there’s a bit of a problem.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.610
For years, decades even, studies have mostly
been using male mice.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.149
When studies report what sex mice they used,
males outnumber females five fold.

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.329
And in a survey of 1,200 papers, only 42%
of them bothered reporting what sex their

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.409
lab animals were at all, meaning that gap
could be much greater.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.259
According to a Scientific American article
by Brook Borel, the thinking was that male

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.609
mice didn’t have that pesky hormone cycle
female mice have, so their results would be

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:23.729
more consistent.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.259
Once the male mice gave you a result, you
could just extrapolate to females and start

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.520
testing with humans.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.632
Well not to sound like a hackneyed comedian,
but have you ever noticed that men and women

00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:33.632
are different?

00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:38.200
Our brains and bodies do not function identically
so if a drug is going to be used for both

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.950
sexes, it’s probably a good idea to know
how that drug will affect each sex.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.369
The drug example Borel gives is Ambien.

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.929
As it turns out, many women metabolize the
sleep aid much slower than men, to the point

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.569
that they’re still too impaired to drive
the next day.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.380
It took 21 years for the FDA to half the recommended
dose for women.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.399
Oh incidentally the U.S. National Institute
of Health (NIH) mandated the inclusion of

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.479
women and minorities in clinical trials receiving
their grant money in 1993, a year after Ambien

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.149
was approved by the FDA,

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.950
So for over two decades women have been represented
in human trials, but female mice have been

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.950
getting snubbed.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.140
The problem with excluding female mice is
researchers might miss something important.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.000
Women have adverse reactions to prescription
drugs more often than men do, even with a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.400
drug as innocuous as aspirin.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.620
A low-dose has long been recommended to help
prevent heart attacks.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.700
But according to a study published in the
journal Heart in 2014, healthy women under

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.340
65 are more likely to suffer from intestinal
bleeding from regular use.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.950
Since women are 1.5 to 1.7 times more likely
to have an adverse drug reaction, it makes

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.879
sense to have analogues that might catch that
early.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.290
And they may benefit from certain drugs more
too.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.599
One experiment looking into using oxytocin
as an autism treatment used males and females

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.620
of a strain that had problems socializing.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.350
The female mice started socializing more quickly
than the males, suggesting oxytocin might

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.819
be a more effective treatment for women than
for men.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.390
Sex differences can also help point researchers
in a new direction.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.409
For example, women are more susceptible to
multiple-sclerosis (MS), but the disease is

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.920
usually less severe.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.459
By studying male and female mice that suffer
from a similar condition called rodent experimental

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.969
autoimmune encephalomyelitis, it’s been
discovered that some genes on the Y chromosome

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.349
may have a protective effect, while some genes
on the X chromosome may cause the disease.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.840
With the benefits in mind, a year ago the
NIH mandated that all research grant proposals

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.150
submitted would either have to use both sexes
or justify why they used only one.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.569
It’s a pretty big deal considering the NIH
funds over 300,000 researchers.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.379
But are those initial worries that a hormone
cycle and behavioral differences would corrupt

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.870
data justified?

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.810
Jill Silverman of University of California,
Davis, has been using male and female mice

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.709
in her autism research for years.

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.900
When comparing how mice from six different
strains performed on various behavioral tests,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.080
there was no significant difference between
the sexes.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.200
That’s not to say they don’t exist, but
it’s more dependent on how the test is designed

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.099
and what the researchers are looking for.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.580
Really the biggest issue is cost.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.590
The number of mice used would need to double
in some experiments, and they would have to

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.599
be separated to make sure they don’t breed.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.650
Silverman says she needs to use at least 20
mice in each test group to make her findings

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.849
statistically significant, which usually means
at least 60 mice per experiment.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.739
If that number doubles for other studies,
taking care of twice as many mice over the

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.989
course of months can inflate costs dramatically.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.750
Still, the benefits of finding out how something
affects both sexes, or discovering a new path

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.580
for research to go down is probably going
to be worth it in the long run.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.190
During this whole thing you were probably
wondering, why do we even use mice???

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.389
Well Trace has that covered right here.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:47.020
I’m all for more females in STEM, even if
they’re fuzzy and tiny and white.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.780
Are you a woman in the STEM fields?

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.840
What do you do, and what’s your take on
mandatory female mice?

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.090
And even if you’re not, we want to hear
your opinion anyway.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.190
