00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's look at the solution to our
global and local miss rate quiz.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.620
For our Level 1 cash, when we say that
it has a 90% hit rate, we don't have

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.940
to specify whether it's a global or
local hit rate because it's the same.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.010
Its local miss rate is
the number of misses divided by

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.890
the number of accesses to this cache.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.950
Its global miss rate is the number of
misses divided by all the accesses that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.750
the processor makes, but because all
these accesses go to this cache,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.780
they are the same and they are both 10%.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.760
because that's what percentage
of all processor accesses

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.380
misses in this cache, and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.320
that is also the percentage of things
that reach this cache, that miss in it.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.470
For the Level 2 cache,
things are different.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.680
It hits for 50% of L1 misses.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.119
That means that it misses for
half of the L1 misses.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.590
So its local miss rate is 50%.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.030
Of all the things that reach this cache,
and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.550
those are only L1 misses,
half of them hit and half of them miss.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.550
But its global miss rate is only 5%,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.302
because only 10% of
the accesses get to this cache,

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:22.940
and half of that misses.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.880
So when we express the misses in terms
of all the accesses that the processor

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.410
made, only 5% of all processor accesses
end up missing in the L2 Cache.
