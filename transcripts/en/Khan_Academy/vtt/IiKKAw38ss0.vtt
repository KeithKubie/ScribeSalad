00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:01.818
Voiceover: After watching the last video

00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:03.961
on corporations and limited liability,

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:07.676
you might be asking yourself was that fair

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:12.040
if Bill had owned the
cab himself and got sued,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.964
the soccer player who's career was ruined

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:17.300
would have gotten his
actual million dollars.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.078
Because Bill set up this corporation

00:00:20.078 --> 00:00:23.150
and put the assets of the cab
company in this corporation,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.135
he was able to limit his liability.

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:28.952
The soccer player was only
able to get a $180,000,

00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:31.610
the corporation declared bankruptcy

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.586
but Bill's liability was limited

00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:36.061
to what he had contributed
to the corporation.

00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:38.429
He might say, "My God, this guy over here"

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.488
"his life was somewhat ruined"

00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:43.854
"and he's not able to
kind of get compensated"

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:46.193
"for I guess how bad his life was ruined."

00:00:46.193 --> 00:00:47.246
Bill is so rich,

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.053
he could probably still make money.

00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:50.727
He should give him the money,

00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:53.263
so he should say this
is kind of an unfair way

00:00:53.263 --> 00:00:56.230
that this corporations are
a way for well off people

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.341
or wealthy people to protect their assets.

00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:00.756
To some degree that's true.

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:04.202
I want to think about in
this video is the trade-offs

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:06.929
and really this is just a
balance that society has to pick.

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:08.745
That this really was on ...

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:11.220
At least the way I had set
it up in the last video

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.209
was kind of unfair to the soccer player.

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.490
I mean he was only getting a $180,000

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.375
for something that might
have ruined his career.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:20.152
If you had talked to Bill,

00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:23.733
Bill might have said well, "That's right,"

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.649
"corporations are kind
of limiting liability"

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:27.879
"for someone like me."

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.446
He'd say, "Look I
wouldn't have started ..."

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:33.314
or maybe he wouldn't have
started the cab company

00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:35.313
if he didn't have that limited liability.

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:36.771
He said, "Look if I had
all of these assets"

00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:38.382
"maybe he had a million dollars."

00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:41.594
Or actually he does
have a million dollars,

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:42.979
maybe he had a hundred million dollars.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.851
He said, "Look, if I had
a hundred million dollars"

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.513
"and I didn't have the option
of starting a corporation,"

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:50.178
"I would have not have
started the cab company"

00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:52.073
"because just for a little
bit of small profit"

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:54.773
"that I could have
gotten from $80,000 cab"

00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:55.959
"I wouldn't have wanted"

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.751
"to jeopardize the rest of my empire."

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.694
"If I didn't have limited liability,"

00:02:01.694 --> 00:02:04.169
"I wouldn't have started
the business to begin with"

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:06.922
"and that would not have
been good for society."

00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:09.173
Another argument Bill might make

00:02:09.173 --> 00:02:10.512
and I'm not going to take sides here,

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:12.572
I'm just saying these are the bounds,

00:02:12.572 --> 00:02:15.227
these are the things
that you have to weigh

00:02:15.227 --> 00:02:17.964
when you set up a legal
code in the society,

00:02:17.964 --> 00:02:22.707
is that Bill said, "Look,
whoever starts a cab business,"

00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:24.380
this cab business that roughly

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.494
you could start with 80, 90, or $100,000.

00:02:26.494 --> 00:02:27.844
They all have the same upside.

00:02:27.844 --> 00:02:29.166
They're taking a certain amount of risk,

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.055
they're providing a service to the city.

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:33.774
They'll probably make a
similar amount of money.

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:37.016
He would argue that it would be unfair

00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:38.699
that we have different downsides.

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.904
Maybe Sal right over here,

00:02:42.673 --> 00:02:47.360
maybe my only assets are
the cab plus licenses

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.866
and I have 80K over
there, and the insurance

00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:55.555
which is 1K.

00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:59.433
What Bill would say is, "Look, me and Sal"

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:02.681
"could both open the
exact same cab business"

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.139
"and if there were no corporations,"

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.808
"if I had to own ..."

00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:08.135
When I say I, I'm talking about Bill.

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:11.655
If Bill had to own the
assets of the cab company

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:13.254
or I should say the cab company,

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:16.072
I should say Bill had to
directly own the assets,

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:17.055
the cab and licences.

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:20.240
Even though Bill's and Sal's
upside from the business,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.211
the profit they could
make would be the same.

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.570
Bill's downside would be more

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.674
because he has ...

00:03:25.674 --> 00:03:27.172
If he didn't have the corporation,

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:31.071
he would have all of these
other assets at risk.

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:34.445
Maybe that would make
Bill get a bigger policy

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:36.075
so that a $100,000 policy,

00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:39.107
maybe he would want to get
a million dollar policy.

00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:40.581
Then a million dollar policy

00:03:40.581 --> 00:03:42.012
will probably cost 10 times more,

00:03:42.012 --> 00:03:44.361
it would cost $10,000 to have that policy.

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:46.412
If you view it from that way,

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:48.942
in order to protect his other assets,

00:03:48.942 --> 00:03:50.885
his cost of business would be higher

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:53.862
just because he happens
to have other things.

00:03:53.862 --> 00:03:56.249
Bill might argue, "Hey
that wouldn't be fair."

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:59.874
It would again be a reason
why someone with assets

00:03:59.874 --> 00:04:03.555
would be less inclined
to start another business

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:05.974
which may not be great for society.

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:08.500
Then the other thing that Bill might argue

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.183
is that look, in exchange
for limited liability

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:14.703
he might have to be double taxed

00:04:14.703 --> 00:04:16.395
and this is an interesting discussion here

00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:18.504
because you'll probably
hear this term a lot,

00:04:18.504 --> 00:04:19.535
double taxation.

00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:26.609
It's not necessarily going to happen

00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:27.920
but if it's a large corporation,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.511
the type of corporations
that are publicly traded

00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:31.807
this will happen.

00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:34.554
The idea behind double taxation,

00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:36.020
it's not true for all corporations.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.044
In fact, let me differentiate it,

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:42.076
double taxation happens with
a C corporation, a C corp.

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:44.740
It does not happen with
things called S corps

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.205
and I'm not going to go in detail here

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:47.051
in what this are.

00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:50.814
S corps, LLC which stands for
limited liability corporation,

00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:54.528
LP which stand for limited partnerships

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:58.559
or limited liability partnerships, LLPs.

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:00.774
It doesn't apply to any of these things

00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:03.305
but what happens in double taxation,

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:06.103
is let's say you have some
corporation, some C corp.

00:05:06.103 --> 00:05:13.181
Let's say that it makes $1,000 in profit.

00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:18.986
It makes $1,000 in profit in a given year.

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:22.677
Since this is being treated
as kind of a legal entity

00:05:22.677 --> 00:05:24.814
that's kind of like a
person by the government,

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:26.562
it gets taxed like a person.

00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:28.793
They're going to have to pay some tax.

00:05:28.793 --> 00:05:30.998
Maybe it's let's say 30% tax.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:35.895
They're going to have to pay 30% or 35%

00:05:35.895 --> 00:05:37.063
or whatever the corporate tax,

00:05:37.063 --> 00:05:38.422
the marginal corporate tax rate

00:05:38.422 --> 00:05:40.149
for this corporation is going to be.

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:45.110
They're going to have
to pay $300 in taxes.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.470
Then let's say this corporation,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.405
whatever it has left over after taxes

00:05:49.405 --> 00:05:51.898
so this is, let me make
it clear, this is pretax.

00:05:51.898 --> 00:05:56.280
Pretax profit it pays
30% to the government

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.299
and so it has $700 in net, net income.

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:05.089
This is net of taxes and everything.

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.219
Let's say it then dividends
that out to its shareholders,

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.650
so then it gives it to its shareholders.

00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:14.791
Let's just say for simplicity

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.015
there's one shareholder.

00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:21.732
This is true even if there were
more than one shareholders.

00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:24.842
That one shareholder, he's
getting $700 in income

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:27.283
based on the fact the he
owns this corporation.

00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:29.568
He is going to have to pay taxes again.

00:06:29.568 --> 00:06:33.906
That's $700, so he has to pay taxes.

00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:36.713
Let me do it this way, let me draw it.

00:06:36.713 --> 00:06:38.495
He has to pay taxes again,

00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:41.322
maybe his marginal tax
rate is another 30%.

00:06:41.322 --> 00:06:45.290
He'll have to pay 30%
to the government again.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.665
This is 30% on the $700,

00:06:47.665 --> 00:06:49.555
so he'll pay 210.

00:06:49.555 --> 00:06:52.858
$210 in taxes to the government

00:06:52.858 --> 00:06:55.637
based on this net income from his dividend

00:06:55.637 --> 00:06:58.381
that he's getting out
from the C corporation.

00:06:58.381 --> 00:07:00.422
Actually I want to be very careful here,

00:07:00.422 --> 00:07:01.756
I don't want to get into the details

00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:04.365
but dividends can sometimes
be taxed differently

00:07:04.365 --> 00:07:05.743
then straight up income.

00:07:05.743 --> 00:07:07.073
Just for the sake of simplicity

00:07:07.073 --> 00:07:08.388
let's say it's 30%,

00:07:08.388 --> 00:07:10.116
it might be a lower or higher amount.

00:07:10.116 --> 00:07:11.780
This is the idea of double taxation,

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.028
the corporation is used as legal entity,

00:07:14.028 --> 00:07:18.248
it pays taxes, and then after those taxes

00:07:18.248 --> 00:07:21.064
it's able to give its
money back to shareholders

00:07:21.064 --> 00:07:22.991
and then those shareholders
have to pay money

00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:24.360
on that income again.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.130
That's what the double taxation is.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.346
Some people say, "Hey
this is horribly unfair."

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:31.594
"Why should we have to pay taxes twice"

00:07:31.594 --> 00:07:33.305
"on the same money?"

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:34.709
Then someone would argue, "Well look,"

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:36.535
"your're getting all of
this limited liability."

00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:39.019
"If you don't like paying
those double taxes"

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:40.819
"don't set up a corporation"

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:43.725
"and then just accept the
full straight up liabilities."

00:07:43.725 --> 00:07:45.446
It's a trade off, you
pay the double taxes,

00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:47.588
you get the limited liability.

00:07:47.588 --> 00:07:49.118
Let me be clear here,

00:07:49.118 --> 00:07:51.429
This applies mainly
the large corporations,

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.311
if you want the limited liability

00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:56.135
but you don't want to have
to do this double taxation

00:07:56.135 --> 00:07:58.802
any of these other corporate
structures are available.

00:07:58.802 --> 00:08:00.599
These are usually available to smaller,

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:03.316
less complicated companies I should say

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.540
than what's going on with the C corp.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.716
An S corp, you have a limited
number of shareholders.

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:10.488
LLCs, they can't last forever.

00:08:10.488 --> 00:08:14.879
They stop lasting as soon
as one of the partners

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:15.869
of the corporation,

00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:17.742
one of the owners of the
corporation pass away

00:08:17.742 --> 00:08:19.080
or declare bankruptcy,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.350
so there are limitations here.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.606
These do get the benefits
of limited liability

00:08:27.128 --> 00:08:32.263
and the profits get pass
through to the owners

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:33.766
without getting taxed first.

00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:36.295
They also have single taxation.

00:08:38.864 --> 00:08:41.604
Going back to the fairness issue,

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.656
if Bill was smart when
he started this company

00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:46.158
he probably would set this up

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:48.434
as a limited liability corporation

00:08:48.434 --> 00:08:50.522
or as an S corporation

00:08:50.522 --> 00:08:52.555
or something where he doesn't
have to get double taxed

00:08:52.555 --> 00:08:55.399
and still he would avoid having to pay

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:57.333
the soccer player the
full million dollars.

00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.459
Just whatever the company has

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:01.743
that's all the soccer player would get.

00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:03.594
Let's say the car service becomes huge

00:09:03.594 --> 00:09:05.124
and he wants to make it public one day

00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:07.704
then he would have to
make it a C corporation

00:09:07.704 --> 00:09:10.539
and then he would have to do
the whole double taxation.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:11.909
It's something to think about,

00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:13.698
it's interesting to think about,

00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:15.857
is it fair to have something like this?

00:09:15.857 --> 00:09:19.582
The pro-corporation side is

00:09:19.582 --> 00:09:21.220
it encourages entrepreneurship.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.108
People won't worry about
the downside as much.

00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:27.281
It kind of levels the playing field

00:09:27.281 --> 00:09:30.639
regardless of however
many side assets you have,

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.538
you have the same liability

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:34.094
for a certain amount of business.

00:09:34.094 --> 00:09:35.561
There's usually certain rules

00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:37.514
that you have to have a
certain amount of money

00:09:37.514 --> 00:09:38.647
in the corporation,

00:09:38.647 --> 00:09:41.223
a certain amount of
insurance in the corporation

00:09:41.223 --> 00:09:43.310
If you don't then possibly

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.376
the court can go after the owner's assets.

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.467
As long as you maintain
it in a responsible,

00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:49.454
well capitalized way, probably won't.

00:09:49.454 --> 00:09:53.333
Then the other trade-off is
this double taxation thing.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:55.475
That at least for large corporations,

00:09:55.475 --> 00:10:00.806
the general electrics and the Google's

00:10:00.806 --> 00:10:02.679
and the Microsoft's of the [world]

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:05.571
they do pay a fee for
this limited liability

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:09.308
and that's in terms of
this double taxation.

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:10.593
Although smaller corporations

00:10:10.593 --> 00:10:11.836
right when they're getting started out

00:10:11.836 --> 00:10:13.463
or kind of partnerships,

00:10:13.463 --> 00:10:15.055
they don't have the double taxation

00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:16.991
but they do get the limited liability.
