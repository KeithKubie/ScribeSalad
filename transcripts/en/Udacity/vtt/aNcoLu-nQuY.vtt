00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, in summary, revenue streams

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
might take the form of a whole series of potential strategies.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But what's interesting is inside of each revenue stream,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
you may have different pricing tactics.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let me say that again.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We just talked about revenue streams.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If you think about it, we didn't talk about how much to charge.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We talked about the potential ways to charge—

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
licensing and intermediation and direct sales, etc.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But how do you think about pricing itself?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
How do you set prices?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's take a look.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Pricing is kind of the tactics.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The first thing you have to figure out is what's the revenue stream

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm going to use for the customer segment.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But there are two types of prices.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
One is fixed prices.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Fixed pricing is just like it sounds.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There's no haggling.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here's how it is. It's the fixed price.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now, fixed price you can decide, well, how do I set that price.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm going to take the cost of what it takes me to build the product,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and I'm going to add some fixed markup—whatever I think my profit should be.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's very simple. It's cost plus markup.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This gets me to the minimum price in the market.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But you know what? I might know something that my competitors don't know.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Because I've been out talking to these customers for weeks or months,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I know that they actually value my feature set, my value proposition,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
more than my competitor's.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In an existing market, I will likely know something no one knows.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I know exactly how much they value what I will offer.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Instead of pricing based on cost,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I could actually price on specific customer segments

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
or on features I know they need.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There's a third type of fixed pricing, and that's called "volume pricing."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It might be that you want to encourage high volume,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
because you have economies of scale.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, you might price the product if you buy in quantities of 1-10 it's $1000,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
but if you buy in quantities of 10-100 it's $900.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Therefore, you can keep stepping up the discount,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
but if you buy in hundreds of thousands or millions,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
instead of $1000 we'll charge $99.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Know who does that?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Go talk to Intel and the semiconductor manufacturers.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
They want to encourage high-volume purchases,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and so they have stepped pricing that is oriented to create volume.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Cost plus market, value pricing, and volume price

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
are all examples of fixed pricing tactics.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But there's another type of pricing.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That's dynamic pricing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Dynamic pricing is exactly what it sounds like.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Dynamic means it moves.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
How could you have prices that kind of move?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I thought all pricing is written down on a piece of paper and never changes.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If you ever think about it,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
pricing that you negotiate—yeah, we kind of have this price on paper,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
but that's just the starting point of the conversation.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Negotiated prices is a dynamic price.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But airlines are now a great example of another type of dynamic pricing,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and that's called "yield management."

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
If you think about it, once an airplane takes off they can no longer sell those seats.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So, a month before the flight, those seats might be $500.00.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
A week before, those seats might actually go up to $600.00.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
An hour before, those seats might drop down to $99.00,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because that plan is leaving, and if we have empty seats, we're not getting any revenue.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So, yield management is actually pretty interesting based on experience, on time, etc.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
There are software programs and industries like airlines and car rentals, etc,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that have perishable seats or time actually are quite good at doing this.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Another type of dynamic pricing is real-time markets.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
The stock market is a real-time market.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Then auctions like eBay are another example of dynamic pricing.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Again, two types of pricing models—fixed and dynamic.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
How do you know which one to use?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You've been out talking to customers.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
How do they currently buy and what's the revenue stream

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that's associated with these kind of pricing tactics?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
You need to be constantly thinking what's the right revenue stream

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
for the right segment and, within that, what's the right pricing model.

00:04:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is it fixed or is it dynamic, and which one are you going to pick?
