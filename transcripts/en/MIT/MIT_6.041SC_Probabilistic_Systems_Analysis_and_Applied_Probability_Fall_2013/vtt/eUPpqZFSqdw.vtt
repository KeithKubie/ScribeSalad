00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.130
 

00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.770
Hi, in this problem, we're going
to look at competing

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.080
exponential.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.500
So we have three exponential
random variables, X with

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.510
parameter lambda, Y with
parameters mu, and Z with

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.090
parameter nu.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.920
And we want to calculate
some probability.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.550
And the probability that we
want to calculate is the

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.150
probability that X is less
than Y is less than Z.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.630
Now we can reinterpret this as
3 plus Poisson processes.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.900
Because the link between
exponentials and Poisson

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.720
processes is that the
inter-arrival time of Poisson

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.080
processes are exponentially
distributed.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.200
So you can think of X being
the time until the first

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.760
arrival in a Poisson process
with parameter lambda.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.670
And same thing for Y is the
first arrival time of a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.420
Poisson process with
parameter mu.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.730
The same thing for Z and nu.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.530
And so in that interpretation, X
less than Y less than Z, you

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.380
could interpret as a race,
meaning that X finishes first

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.880
followed by Y and then
Z comes in last.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.370
So with that interpretation,
let's see if we can calculate

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.620
what this probability is.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.190
We can rewrite this probability
as a combination

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.410
of two things occurring.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:33.010
One is that X is less than the
minimum of Y and Z. And then

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.020
the other is that Y
is less than Z.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.850
So what is this first
event mean?

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.970
This first event means that
X comes in first.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.060
And it doesn't matter whether
Y comes in second

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.500
or Z comes in second.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.170
So we first say that X has to
come in first which means it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.130
has to beat the better of Y and
Z. And then that combined

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.350
with the fact that Y does better
than Z is the same

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350
thing as saying that
X is first, Y is

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.630
second, and Z is third.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.610
And now, let's try to argue
using Poisson processes, that

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.300
these two events are actually
independent.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.120
So this event occurring means
that X is smaller than Y and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.930
Z. So let's take these Poisson
processes, and because these

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.360
random variables are assumed to
be independent, these are

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.980
independent Poisson processes.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.560
So we can merge them.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.490
So let's merge these two.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.270
And we'll get a Poisson
process that has

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.640
rate mu plus nu.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.820
And we can also merge this
first one and that one.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.410
And we'll get another Poisson
process with predator lambda

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.220
plus mu plus nu.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.060
So in that context, what does
it mean that X is less than

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.590
the minimum Y and Z?

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.470
It just means that in this
merged process, the first

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.490
arrival came from
the X process.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.090
In that case, if that's true,
then X is less than minimum Y

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.270
and Z. Well, let's say that
event does occur that the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.430
first arrival is from
the X process.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.690
Now we're interested in what
the order of the second two

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.270
arrivals are.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.650
Is it Y first and then Z?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.070
Or Z first and then Y?

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.770
Well, it doesn't matter
because of

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.270
the fresh start property.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.040
Because after this arrival
comes, and say it is from the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.140
X process, the Poisson processes
start anew, and

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.330
they're still independent.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.670
And so what happens after that
is independent of what

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.560
happened here, when X arrived.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.160
And so whether Y came first
followed by Z, or Z came first

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.340
followed by Y is independent
of what happened here.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.710
And so because of that, these
two events are independent,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.830
and so when we have the
probability of the

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.980
intersection of two independent
events, we can

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.419
write that as the product of
those two probabilities.

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:29.870
 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.790
Now, what is the probability
of this first event?

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.220
The probability that X is less
than the minimum Y and Z?

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.440
Well, we just said that that
corresponds to the first

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.160
arrival of this merge process
being from the X process.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.950
Well, that probability
is lambda over lambda

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.650
plus mu plus nu.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.953
So it's equal to this ratio
where the process that you're

00:04:55.953 --> 00:04:58.530
interested in, its rate comes
in the numerator.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.010
And then the merged rate
is on the denominator,

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.300
And what about the second one?

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.780
What's the probability that
Y is less than Z?

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.300
Well, let's go now to this merge
process where we merged

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.140
just the Y and Z processes and
see which one comes first.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.170
Well, in that case what we want
to know is in this merge

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.830
process, what is the probability
that the first

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.030
arrival came from
the Y process?

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.880
Well, analogously, that
probability is going to mu

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.850
over mu plus nu.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.170
And that gives us our answer.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.120
And so we see that what looked
like a pretty complex

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.830
calculation when we
reinterpreted it in terms of

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.310
Poisson processes, it becomes
relatively easy to solve.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.290
But this still seems like a
complicated expression.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.820
So let's try to check
to see whether it

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.000
actually makes sense.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.260
So one way to do that is to look
at a specific example of

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.640
the choice of lambda, mu, and
nu, and see if it actually

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.190
makes sense.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.250
So one example is suppose that
all three of these parameters

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.650
are the same.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.070
Well, if they're all the same
then this probability, the

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.980
first part becomes
1 over 3, 1/3.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.230
And the second one
is 1 over 2.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.350
And so if all three parameters
are the same, probability

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.760
becomes 1/6.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.790
And let's see if that
makes sense.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.700
If all three parameters are
the same, that means that

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.340
these rates, these arrival
rates are all the same.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.690
And what that means is that any
three ordering of these

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.700
three arrivals is as likely
as any other ordering.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.840
And what we're interested in
is the probability of one's

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.630
particular ordering happening
which is X first then Y then

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.470
Z.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.180
But if everything is symmetric
then any of the orderings is

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.020
as likely as any other one.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.580
And how many orderings
are there?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.180
Well, there's three choices
for who comes in first.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.300
Two for who comes in second.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.760
And one for who comes in last.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.760
So there's a total of six
possible orders in which these

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.460
three contestants, if you think
of it that way, could

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.890
finish this race.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.480
And out of none of those, we
want the probability that one

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.230
of those outcomes happens.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.090
And so the probability
should be 1/6.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.210
And that's what our
formula tells us.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.720
So as I said, in this problem,
we saw how to reinterpret

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.020
exponentials in the context of
Poisson processes that helped

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.360
us solve a--

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.610
