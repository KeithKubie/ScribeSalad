00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.240
I have to say, when David called
us and asked us if he

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.140
could drop by today, excitement
doesn't even begin

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.700
He is one of the few truly
global sports stars.

He is one of the most searched
for athletes on Google, and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.360
it's amazing how his fans have
embraced him across Google

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.410

MARVIN CHOW: Have a seat.

Have a seat.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.030
Welcome.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.430
Welcome to Google.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.670
So let's kick off,
no pun intended,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.420
with a little soccer.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.750
Or, for our international
friends, football.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.610
You know, you David, you really
have had a global

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.350
soccer career.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.140
I mean, you joined Manchester
United at the young age of 17.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.770
You won 9 major trophies
in 11 years there.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.080
Very impressive.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.500
You then joined Real Madrid
where you won another trophy,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.820
and then since 2007, you've been
here in the U.S. playing

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.050
for the LA Galaxy, where
last year you

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.550
won yet another trophy.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.170
And I think that puts you in a
very rare group of trifecta

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.570
winners of three trophies on
three different countries.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.510
So congratulations.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.760
DAVID BECKHAM: Thank
you very much.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.320
MARVIN CHOW: And then obviously,
while preparing to

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.430
meet you last night, I read
even more news last night.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.650
The big news that you've decided
to stay here in the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.545
U.S. and continue to play for
the U.S., the LA Galaxy.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.070
Congratulations.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.610
And I think we're excited that
you chose Google as a place to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.620
come talk to your fans
and the rest of the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.700
world about that news.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.600
So why don't we start there?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.340
Why don't you tell us a little
bit about that decision to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.100
stay with the Galaxy.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.010
DAVID BECKHAM: Well, good
morning, first of all.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.180
I'm excited to be here.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.090
To be part of this is exciting
for me, and to be here with

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.270
you all and everyone else
watching around the world,

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.460
it's exciting.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.700
Google's one of the biggest
companies in the world.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.060
So I'm honored to
be here today.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.899
My decision, obviously,
throughout my career has

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:27.170
always been about my family,
about my career, about my

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.321
footballing career.

00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.420
And I've been lucky to have
played over the years with

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.570
some of the biggest clubs in
the world, some of the best

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.420
players in the world.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.890
And it's been exciting.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.870
I've been lucky enough to have
been successful in many

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.020
different clubs that
I've played for.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.900
And professionally, coming to
the U.S. was something that I

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.920
was excited about.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.535
It was a challenge.

00:04:51.535 --> 00:04:52.720
It was a new challenge.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.930
I played in Europe.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.370
I'd won everything that I
possibly could in Europe, and

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.526
I wanted a new challenge.

00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:01.630
MARVIN CHOW: When you
conquer Europe, it's

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.400
definitely the next--

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.430
DAVID BECKHAM: Like I said, I
was very lucky in my career.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.900
MARVIN CHOW: You are.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.520
DAVID BECKHAM: So then,
obviously, coming to America

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.830
was an exciting thing
for me, and I've had

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.460
a great five years.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.560
I met a lot of good people, a
lot of great fans around the

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.070
world, traveled around America,
played in different

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.380
parts of America, which I'd
never played in before, and

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.270
it's been exciting.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.840
So this championship at the end
of this year was one of

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.620
the most satisfying in my
career, I must admit.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.320
To have been here for the time
that I've been here, to reach

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.140
the goals that I'd reached off
the field, with raising the

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.450
popularity of the game.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.600
I'd reached those goals.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.680
The only goal that I hadn't
reached was a championship

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.150
with the Galaxy, which is the
main reason why I came to

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.780
America and came to the
Galaxy as a franchise.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.450
So that was missing,
but now it's not.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.840
MARVIN CHOW: Congratulations.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.540
DAVID BECKHAM: But obviously,
with the new contract now, it

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.860
was a decision that I didn't
take lightly because I

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.340
obviously had other
offers from other

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.420
clubs around the world.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.750
And at 36 years old you
don't expect to

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.742
still get these offers.

00:06:18.742 --> 00:06:20.280
So that was nice.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.670
But it was all about where I
felt the future was going for

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.060
the game here in the U.S., and
also where my family was

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.670
happiest. And my family is
happiest here at the moment.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.810
We love living in LA.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.690
We love living in America.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.320
We've adapted the culture, we've
adapted everything that

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.540
this country has, and
we enjoy that.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.050
So I'm going to continue to
enjoy playing soccer here, and

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.440
my family will continue
to enjoy it.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.400
MARVIN CHOW: Well, speaking
of, kind of

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.340
away from the Galaxy--

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.190
I saw when you came in 2007,
you made a very public

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.430
statement that you wanted to
help grow the game of soccer

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.320
in the U.S. Can you talk a
little bit about how that's

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.510
going and some areas around
growing the game here?

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.360
DAVID BECKHAM: Well
that's the thing.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.770
It's one of the reasons why
I came to this country.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.120
It's because, for me, soccer is
the number one sport around

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.540
the world apart from America.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.600
Don't get me wrong, the other
sports, American football,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.140
basketball, baseball, they're
all great sports and have

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.640
great athletes in
these sports.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.460
But the number one game in
the world is soccer.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.550
So I want to get soccer
to a different

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.420
level in this country.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.920
And I think that we've done
that in the last--

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.310
I've felt it change in the
last couple of years.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.060
And that's why I didn't want to
walk away from it because I

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.960
felt the change.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.120
And to walk away at this point
would be disappointing because

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.570
I've been part of that growth,
and I want to continue to be

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:47.370
part of that growth.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.610
So it's an exciting time.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.705
And it's great for the family as
well, great for the family

00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:56.330
to be here.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.710
MARVIN CHOW: Well, speaking of
the family, I think we've all

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.600
read how important
family is to you.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.970
So what role did Victoria and
the kids have in decision, in

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.960
making this decision?

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.610
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, they
have the final answer.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.960
It's as simple as that.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.416
That sounded wrong.

00:08:15.416 --> 00:08:18.420
No, obviously, when you're
married, when you have

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.660
children, your priorities
totally change.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.820
10 years ago, when I was playing
at Manchester United,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.200
at Real Madrid--

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.460
obviously, we were married, but
it was a lot easier for us

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.490
to make decisions based
on our careers.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.650
Whereas, we've got three amazing
boys now and a little

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.929
girl that we have to
look after, and

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:41.809
it's all about them.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.780
So our priorities are
about our children.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.530
But like I said, in the question
before, the growth of

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.370
the game is growing.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:57.030
And to see when I first arrived
there'd be 12 teams in

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.730
the league, now there's 19.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.070
There are stadiums being built
around America solely for

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.290
soccer, which is a big thing.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.810
And that's the exiting part of
why and one of the reasons why

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:12.670
I wanted to stay.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.100
MARVIN CHOW: Yeah, well I
think the impact of your

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.915
presence on the game has
been very clear over

00:09:15.915 --> 00:09:17.150
the last five years.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.152
I think one of the other
questions that I'm sure is on

00:09:19.152 --> 00:09:22.670
a lot of people's minds with
this decision is really, why

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.380
come to Google to tell the world
and talk to your fans?

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.700
DAVID BECKHAM: Why not?

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.320
Why not?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.070
MARVIN CHOW: So simple.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.780
DAVID BECKHAM: Like I said,
it's one of the biggest

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.667
companies in the world,
and it reaches so

00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:36.770
many millions of people.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.030
And I felt that it's something
that you always see when you

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.395
open your computer.

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:44.730
MARVIN CHOW: We like that.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.170
DAVID BECKHAM: And something
I was really excited about.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.310
So like I said, I'm honored to
be here with everyone, and

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.590
thanks for coming out because
there's a lot of you.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.960
Thank you.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.820
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.270
MARVIN CHOW: So in getting ready
for this visit we saw

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.860
that you posted a video callout
for questions on

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.260
YouTube, which is fantastic.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.890
And I'd say from that
video we've

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.170
collected tons of questions.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.740
We've gone through them and
we've curated them, and

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.700
obviously we'll go through
some of those today.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.520
I think, just also so you know,
your Google following is

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.390
also very strong.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.580
Obviously, you can see the
people here in Charlie's, but

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.900
in addition to this group
there are about 26 other

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.140
offices from around the world
dialed in to watch this and

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.190
ask you questions as well.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.140
And I think, if it weren't so
late in some of the other

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.220
parts of the world, we'd have
even more than that.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.460
So congratulations on building
a following here

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.380
at Google as well.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.330
So let's dig in to some of
the questions right away.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.060
We'll start with football.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.840
Tou Moo Yee from California
wants to know, what is the

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.350
biggest difference between
playing football in America

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.280
versus Europe?

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.600
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, there's
not a huge amount of

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.010
difference.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.800
One of the biggest differences
I'd say is just the travel.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.880
It's literally the travel.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.380
In Europe we only have to travel
about an hour to a

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.750
game, or two hours at the most.
Whereas, when we play

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.590
East Coast and we're playing in
New York, it's a 5, 5 and

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.460
1/2 hour journey.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.620
So that's a big difference but
on the field, the level of

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.050
play has definitely gone up in
the last three or four years.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.610
And I think that it's at a stage
now where this game is

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.970
starting to attract the interest
of some big names and

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.540
big players in Europe.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:30.110
And I think there has to be a
certain change with some of

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.950
the things that goes on
throughout the league.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.360
But I think it's a league now,
where European teams, big

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.210
European teams, are coming over
for their pre-seasons and

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.250
they're playing against us.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:49.220
So five years ago, the Galaxy
had been heard of but I think

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.690
now, with the interest of the
players that have come over,

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.310
such as Robbie Keane and
obviously London Donovan as a

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:03.300
U.S. star, we've had that
interest and it's exciting to

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.910
be part of.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.120
MARVIN CHOW: Yeah, I think it
must great to see the growth,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.806
see the change year over year,
and the speed and the power of

00:12:08.806 --> 00:12:08.880
the players.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.380
DAVID BECKHAM: I think that's
what you always want.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.520
You want to see something
grow.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.940
If you sit still so long-- you
know this better than anyone

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.930
with Google--

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.150
if you sit there too long then
things change around you.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.130
And to see the growth, to see
the change, I'm proud to be

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.670
part of that.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.810
MARVIN CHOW: That's great.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.770
Another question.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.840
Mahin Zarra asks, what is the
first thing you do, think, or

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.910
notice when you step onto
the field initially?

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.340
DAVID BECKHAM: I think
just the excitement.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.130
I'm still--

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.920
I'm 36 years old, and every time
I step on the field I'm

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.910
like a little kid.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:49.530
And I know once that changes
then that's when I'll feel

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.120
I'll have to stop playing.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.530
But until that changes, I'm
going to continue to play as

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.690
long as possible and as
long as teams keep

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.781
offering me new contracts.

00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:02.950
MARVIN CHOW: But it seems like
that love of the game, that

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.700
childhood joy of just playing
the game, is what drives you.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.490
DAVID BECKHAM: I've always
been driven.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.050
Even at a young age, all I ever
wanted to do was become a

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.360
footballer or soccer star.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.530
And that was my only ambition.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.750
I know it's different these
days with kids.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.290
There's obviously this
fame, this fortune.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.050
And it might be easy for me to
say that because, obviously,

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.070
I've done very well at the game,
but I'd still be playing

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.660
this game even if I wasn't
being paid for it.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:40.380
Not that I don't want to be paid
for it, but I still would

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.610
be playing this sport.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.970
MARVIN CHOW: Very good.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:44.890
Very good.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.560
Another question.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.780
Christina Greenwood asks, do
you ever listen to music

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.090
before a soccer game to kind
of get yourself pumped up?

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:51.455
DAVID BECKHAM: Always.

00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:51.910
MARVIN CHOW: Always?

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.050
The Spice Girls?

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.540
DAVID BECKHAM: Spice
Girls, of course.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.420
I mean, one of them always gets
me going before a game.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.180
MARVIN CHOW: Everybody.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.456
I think, who doesn't?

00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:02.360
DAVID BECKHAM: Always.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.750
Yeah, so no, Spice Girls is not
on the playlist. It's on

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.440
my iPod but it's not on the
playlist. That's for a

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.660
different time with the kids.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.510
But no, I always listen
to music.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.200
I'm a huge Jay-Z fan.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.690
MARVIN CHOW: Excellent.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.640
DAVID BECKHAM: Huge Stone Roses
fan, as well, who are

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.460
getting back together in June.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.470
Just plugging them.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.340
And no, at different
clubs it's strange.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.775
Before games we always listen
to music, but there are

00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:37.440
certain managers at certain
clubs that don't like music

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.250
before a game in the change room
which, in the end, most

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.260
players end up listening
with their headsets.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.030
MARVIN CHOW: That's good.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.440
Min Koh wants you to
give up the secret.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.020
How do you train for the
perfect Beckham kick?

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.380
We've seen it.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.950
How does it happen?

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.840
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, it's just
that people have asked me

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.710
that over the years.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.705
How do I curl the ball?

00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:01.200
Or how do I bend the ball?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.110
And it's something that
just happened.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.711
It's not something that I
thought, OK, I want to bend

00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:09.650
the ball better than anyone else
so I'm going to kick the

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.520
ball in this certain way.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.150
I just worked on my striking
of the ball.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.350
I just practiced every day.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.400
It's something that I've done
from a very young age.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.830
Even after every training
session, I'd take balls on my

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:29.360
own and just go and kick and
try and find new ways of

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.840
getting the ball in the net
without anyone touching it.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.380
I've been lucky enough to have
done that over the years with

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.980
the way I kick the ball, and I
know that it's a unique style.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.283
And I know it's a unique style
just because my back hurts a

00:15:44.283 --> 00:15:47.620
little bit more than it did
when I was 15 years old.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.720
But it's something that
I practice, of course.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.470
That's one thing I tell kids.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.790
Unless you practice you're
never going to

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.920
get better at something.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.240
MARVIN CHOW: Well I think
there's not a goal keeper in

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.310
the world who is not terrified
when you line up

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.140
for that free kick.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.800
So whatever you're doing,
keep doing it.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.120
DAVID BECKHAM: I'll try.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.650
MARVIN CHOW: And so we have a
couple questions live from

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.520
London, actually, from our
office in London, which we

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.720
wanted to have your
homeland people--

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:12.980
DAVID BECKHAM: Good evening.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.230
MARVIN CHOW: --ask you.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.871
Why don't you go ahead?

00:16:18.871 --> 00:16:20.160
MALE SPEAKER: Hi David.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.020
DAVID BECKHAM: How you doing?

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.345
MALE SPEAKER: My question is,
who's more likely to win a

00:16:24.345 --> 00:16:27.910
World Cup in the future,
England or the USA?

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.335
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND CLAPS]

00:16:29.335 --> 00:16:30.760
DAVID BECKHAM: Oh my God.

00:16:34.085 --> 00:16:39.110
That's a terrible question to
ask me while I'm set here.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.400
I'm going to have
to say England.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.510
I'm really sorry.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.760
I'm sorry.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.840
I've got a lot of respect for
the U.S. players and the U.S.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.400
team, and they've got some
very talented players.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.150
But I believe, at some point,
England are going

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.270
to win a World Cup.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.510
Because we have got a lot of
talented players in our

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.630
country, and we're very
passionate, and it's where the

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.750
game began.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.740
So for me, definitely, I think
England are going to win a

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.880
World Cup at some point.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.190
MARVIN CHOW: America's just
pacing themselves.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.990
DAVID BECKHAM: The U.S. is a few
years behind us, but a few

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.630
years after.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.040
MARVIN CHOW: Exactly.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.940

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.034
JT: Hi David.

00:17:22.034 --> 00:17:23.950
This is JT over in London.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:24.880
DAVID BECKHAM: Morning,
afternoon,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.680
evening whatever it is.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:25.950
JT: Morning.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.369
Well yeah, evening here.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.540
So I've seen you play
a couple of times.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.360
One of them was a tsunami
charity game you played in

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.615
Barcelona with loads
of superstars.

00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:38.900
And I just wanted to know who
was the greatest player you

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.880
played with or against?

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.930
DAVID BECKHAM: OK.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.560
Again, I've been lucky enough
over the years to have played

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.180
with some of the best players
in the world.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.740
Obviously, being at Manchester
United, being at Real Madrid,

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.350
being at AC Milan, these are
three of the biggest

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.320
clubs in the world.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.990
So, obviously, there's some
great players there.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.100
Being able to play with Eric
Cantona, I think, that was a

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.700
great thing.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.930
He's a Manchester
United player.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:11.020
Being able to play with a
player, Bryan Robson, that was

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.130
my hero and I wanted
to emulate.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.170
But I think the best
player I've ever

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.602
played with is Zidane.

00:18:18.602 --> 00:18:26.570
He's a player with a lot of
passion, a lot of skill, and

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.310
he's not just an amazing
player, he's a

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.290
great person as well.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.240
The hardest player to have
played against was Roberto

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.470
Carlos, who's now actually
one of my best friends.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:45.220
But even when I didn't know him
as well as I do now, he

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.010
used to kick the hell out
of me, the whole game.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.750
But he had this cheeky
smile which--

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.520
you couldn't hate him
in any way possible.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.440
But he's definitely the most,
the toughest, player I've

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.500
played against.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.290
MARVIN CHOW: Claudine.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:04.820
CLAUDINE: Hey David.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.130
So my question is, if LA Galaxy
were to play in the

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.105
English premiere league, how
would they stack up against

00:19:10.105 --> 00:19:12.110
the competition?

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.000
DAVID BECKHAM: We'd win it.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.890
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.480
was that.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.170
I think the Galaxy have been
great in the last two years.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:24.590
We've been really successful
with, obviously, being close

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.420
to winning the championship
over the last few years.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.160
But then, obviously this year
winning the championship,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.760
we've got a lot of good young
players coming through.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.730
Players that teams in Europe
are interested in.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.090
So I think we'd do well
in the premiership.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.290
It'd be interesting.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.350
MARVIN CHOW: I think
you never know.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.680
That's the beauty of the game.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.840
I mean, I think, you work
hard, you train hard.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.280
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, that's
what soccer's all about.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.560
It's all about upsets.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.550
It's all about teams that you
don't think are as good as

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.780
other teams going in
and beating them.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.720
That's what the FA Cup is
all about in England.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.960
Lower league teams go in and
they beat some of the best

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.180
premiership teams in England.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.870
So that's what it's all about.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.750
But I think we'd do
well over there.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.080
MARVIN CHOW: That's good.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.330
Maybe one day.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.090
DAVID BECKHAM: It's might be a
bit cold for a few players in

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.443
December but we'd do well.

00:20:18.443 --> 00:20:19.280
MARVIN CHOW: That's great.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.590
JT mentioned the charity game
that you played, and I think

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.980
we've seen you do a lot of
philanthropic work throughout

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:24.580
your career.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.350
I think we touched on it in
the UNICEF work in the

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.750
highlight video, and recently
we saw that you were in

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.700
Afghanistan visiting
some troops there.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.310
Can you tell us a little bit
about what that trip was and

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.490
what you did there?

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.200
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, I know
it sounds kind of a cliche,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.360
but charities are one of
my biggest passions.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.160
I've been lucky enough to be
involved with UNICEF as an

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.690
ambassador, and that's
something that

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.741
I'm very proud of.

00:20:48.741 --> 00:20:51.550
But I want to do more.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.480
Obviously, with my job, with my
travel it's very difficult

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.990
to go into the field and to do
different things, but I've

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:03.120
been able to go to places
like Sierra Leone.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.820
And going places like that,
and seeing the change that

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.110
UNICEF are making to so many
people around the world,

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.320
that's one of my biggest
passions.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.290
That's why when people say to
me, after my career am I going

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.080
to go into coaching?

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.000
I need to be passionate
about something that

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.440
I'm going to go into.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.960
And coaching, I love coaching
kids, but I'd prefer to go

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.470
into the field and see the kids
in Sierra Leone or in

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.900
different parts of Africa and
around the world and coach

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.610
them because it's making
a huge difference.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.630
Going to Afghanistan was
something that I'd always

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:44.890
wanted to do to see the
troops, of course.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.200
When I ruptured my Achilles two
years ago, I had some time

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:48.910
off, obviously.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:54.770
And I thought OK, I need to put
that to do something good,

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.490
and I had the chance to
go to Afghanistan.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.550
It was a secret at the time but
then, obviously, by the

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.040
time I got there it was out.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.390
But it was a huge thing.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.170
The job the troops do over there
in Afghanistan is really

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:14.640
incredible to see.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.270
The conditions that they work
under, they're putting their

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.290
lives at risk every
single day.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.640
And it must be gut-wrenching
for their families to see

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.590
their loved ones, brothers,
sisters, sons, daughters.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.660
It's so many different levels
that it's difficult.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.180
To go to Afghanistan was one of
the best things I've done

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.640
in my life.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.290
MARVIN CHOW: Well I
think it must be.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.990
I mean, with your work with
UNICEF since 2005, it must be

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:45.360
amazing to see, you as an
international football star,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.010
how the game can bring such joy
or change people's lives

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.920
in these kids all around
the world.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.450
DAVID BECKHAM: That's what's
great about soccer.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.000
I've said it so many times,
that when I was in Sierra

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.990
Leone, these kids are walking
about with literally no

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.160
clothes on.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.670
But you arrive, you put a soccer
ball in front of them,

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.520
they play like my kids play.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.910
And that's what soccer can do
for you and do for kids and do

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.180
for families.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.920
For that 90 minutes, you're
driving along the street and

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.140
like I said, there's kids with
no clothes on and running

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.300
around with no shoes on.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.990
And then you look over and
then kids are watching

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.650
premiership games on the
side of the street.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.400
It can change people's lives.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.020
It can, for that 90 minutes of
a game, it takes them away

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.800
from the life they've got
every single day.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.505
And that is the power
of soccer.

00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:46.410
It's the power of sports.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.970
It's something that's one of the
reasons why I love being

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.590
involved in sports.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.470
MARVIN CHOW: It is amazing.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.820
So moving on a little bit, as
we looked through all the

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.600
questions that we got coming
to you, I think

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.760
unsurprisingly, there were a lot
of questions from people

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.830
who are curious about
your personal life.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.110
I think, when you marry
a Spice Girl,

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.150
I guess that happens.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.710
DAVID BECKHAM: Yes, it does.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.750
MARVIN CHOW: But I think, before
we get to all of those,

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.850
one of the more overarching
questions that everyone had

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.670
and everyone wants to know, what
was it like to be at the

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.730
wedding of the decade?

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.920
The royal wedding last April,
what was it like to be there?

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.940
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, we had to
pinch ourselves when we got

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.940
the invite.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.220
I've become friends with
Prince William and

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.490
he's a great guy.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.730
And obviously, Harry as well.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.990
And I was brought up around the
royal family to love the

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.750
royal family.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.500
My grandparents were
big royalists.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.450
And so we were brought up to
love the royal family.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:52.730
And I think when, obviously,
Princess Di was around, the

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:58.330
love for her and for the royal
family was incredible.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.980
And she was loved by millions
and millions of people, not

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.830
just in our country.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.840
And then obviously, you watch
the lives of William and

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.650
Harry, and you see everything
about them, and it's kind of

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.100
like the Truman Show.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.190
They're growing and growing and
doing different things and

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.820
being part of different
charities, and growing up from

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.620
young boys to young men
and to grown men.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.200
And it makes you proud to be
English to see that happen.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.170
You watch their lives.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.100
You watch what they've been
through, and then you watch

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.020
them grow into the people
that they are today.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.080
And they're very
special people.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.390
The royal wedding was a huge
thing for our country.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:45.810
To have a celebration like that,
it was very special.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.240
It gave our country a huge lift
at the time, and it's

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.350
continued to do that.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.440
But being at the royal wedding
was incredible.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.570
MARVIN CHOW: Any stories?

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:57.800
Any favorite parts?

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.600
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, one of
the best things about it for

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.540
my wife, she was eight months
pregnant and she was worried

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.020
about where we were going to be
sitting, as she needed to

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.450
be as close to the restroom
as possible.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:16.090
And our seat was perfect
because we could see,

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:20.030
obviously, William
and Kate walk in.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.680
But then, obviously, Victoria
could then-- she was like five

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.590
steps away from the restroom,
which was perfect.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:31.610
So it was an amazing day, and
I'm proud to be a part of that

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.200
as an Englishman.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.130
MARVIN CHOW: That's great.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.410
Well, speaking of Victoria and
being pregnant, Nur Ikisi has

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.120
a question about Harper.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.940
The question is, has Harper
spoken her first word yet?

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.100
What was it?

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.830
And if not, are there any
playful competitions between

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.040
you and Victoria to
see if she'll say

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.520
mommy or daddy first?

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.380
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, I think
naturally the first word is

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.590
going to be mama.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.230
And she's close to it already.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:59.330
She's saying a few things, but
I've obviously got three

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.380
amazing boys.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.240
And with boys--

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.270
I'm sure people that have
children know, or people who

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.730
have been around
children know--

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.150
with boys you can
throw them up.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:14.250
They drop and they get up and
they just run around.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.110
And with boys it's like that.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:22.020
But it's obviously my
first experience of

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.380
having a little girl.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.530
And still, I'm changing her
diaper and I'm thinking, I

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.140
can't believe I've got a girl.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.950
So everything about
her is feminine.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.110
The way she moves, the way she
eats, the way she smiles, the

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.040
way she looks--

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.240
you know, everything about
her is feminine.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.220
And I know it sounds obvious,
but it's an amazing thing

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.970
having a little girl in
the family now after

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:49.930
having three boys.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.130
But the best thing
about it is she's

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.876
got three older brothers.

00:27:54.876 --> 00:27:56.070
MARVIN CHOW: Well I
have to say she--

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.160
DAVID BECKHAM: And a dad.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.150
MARVIN CHOW: --I have to say she
is an impeccable dresser

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.320
from what I've seen.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.340
DAVID BECKHAM: Her wardrobe
is ridiculous already.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.430
I'm glad I got a two-year
contract.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:14.090
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.840
MARVIN CHOW: Very good.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.580
Well, staying with that, I mean,
obviously, with three

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.980
boys and now a girl and
Victoria, Andreas Rubio

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.950
Barigga asks, how do you
keep the balance

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.340
between work and family?

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.650
Obviously, you've got a hectic
life around the world.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.500
What's that like?

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.590
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean,
obviously, as a

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:29.810
family we're very busy.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.210
As a couple we're very busy.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.190
Victoria's got a collection
that is, obviously, doing

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.980
unbelievably well.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.050
But there's a lot
of pressure that

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.050
comes with that, obviously.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:40.900
I'm working every day.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.700
I play and train every day,
so it's difficult.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:49.100
But like I said before, our
number one priority is our

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.990
children and our family.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.630
Nothing else gets in
the way of that.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.140
When I'm away, Victoria's at
home with the boys and Harper.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.240
When she's away, vice versa.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.790
So we're very hands-on
parents.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.420
I take the kids to
school every day.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.440
I pick them up every day.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.650
We go to Taekwondo.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:08.720
We go to soccer.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.150
We got so many things that
we do with the kids.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.050
And like I said, we're very
hands-on parents.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:18.730
So our lives, our busy lives
don't affect the

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:19.750
children in any way.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.970
But the children understand
that we work

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.830
very hard as well.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.660
We've got a very good
balance there.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.080
MARVIN CHOW: It's amazing to see
people as busy and hectic

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.855
as you and Victoria can still
take your kids to Taekwondo

00:29:31.855 --> 00:29:32.820
and be as hands-on.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.880
I think it's--

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.380
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, it sets
the kids up for life, I think,

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:43.280
the way you are with them at a
very young age, and we've got

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.980
very special kids.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.700
MARVIN CHOW: Earlier you were
talking about, obviously, the

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.360
travel with the Galaxy,
and you've lived in

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.110
Italy, Spain, the UK.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:56.290
Carolina Ramos asks, where
is your favorite

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.540
place in the world?

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.830
DAVID BECKHAM: Favorite
place in the world?

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:05.530
I would have to say--

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:10.090
funnily enough, I love Paris
as a city, funnily enough.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:14.016
And that was, obviously, one of
the offers that I got to go

00:30:14.016 --> 00:30:16.480
and play there.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.560
But I love Paris.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.040
As a city it's very romantic.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:26.050
It's this amazing culture,
amazing food and wine.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:30.630
But I'm very proud to be
English, and London--

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.810
there's not many better places
in the world than London.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.300
MARVIN CHOW: Very good.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.270
I'm sure our London Googlers
will be very

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.140
happy to hear that.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.880
DAVID BECKHAM: I hope so.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.780
MARVIN CHOW: So while we're on
the personal life topic stuff,

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.680
I have to say, I promised some
fellow coworkers I would ask

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.260
you this question.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.040
Please don't be embarrassed.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.600
But I think a lot of people are
interested in what's up

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.790
with the new underwear
campaign.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:52.850
DAVID BECKHAM: I knew
this was coming.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.027
MARVIN CHOW: You know, I
mean, how big is it?

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.125
I heard Superbowl ad.

00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:02.740
I mean, how big is this
thing going to get?

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.600
DAVID BECKHAM: Another pun.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:10.250
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.860
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, sorry.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.760
I need some water.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.270
Obviously, I was part of Armani,
a campaign for a

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.040
couple of years.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.850
And that was a huge success.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.110
And then, I was interested in
doing something along the

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:36.520
lines with my own range of
underwear and body wear.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:42.510
So I got together with a few
people and part of my team and

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.130
we designed and made
everything.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.680
And we had the product
already to go.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.290
And then, H&amp;M came in and they
said look, we can make this

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:56.440
better for you, and they did.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.430
They're taking it to 1,800
stores, 40 different

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:05.060
countries, and it's something
that I could've--

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.760
probably it would have taken a
few years, but it wouldn't

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.700
have reached that level
of distribution.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.010
So I'm very proud of it.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:20.180
The pictures are good, which
I'm happy about.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.090
The product looks great.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.280
MARVIN CHOW: That's the most
important, of course.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.190
DAVID BECKHAM: So
that's exciting.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.780
I'm launching on February 1st,
so it's going to be exciting.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.930
That's in London.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:33.775
MARVIN CHOW: So Superbowl ad?

00:32:33.775 --> 00:32:34.190
No?

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:35.150
Can you say?

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.590
DAVID BECKHAM: There's a
Superbowl ad, which is very

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.500
exciting because the amount
of people that watch the

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.080
Superbowl, actually, is going
to see the advert.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.610
MARVIN CHOW: The worlds
of football colliding.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:51.000
DAVID BECKHAM: Which I
just thought about.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.660
MARVIN CHOW: Very good.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.150
Very good.

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.410
A couple more questions
on the personal side.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.730
Ntiaz Adjaz asks, I was
wondering, are you considering

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.600
starring in a film
with Tom Cruise?

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.130
DAVID BECKHAM: I would
love to star in a

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.850
film with Tom Cruise.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.100
Who wouldn't?

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.190
People have asked me over the
years, especially when I first

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:15.560
moved to LA, they were like,
he's obviously going over to

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.190
become an actor.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.930
And I can't act.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:18.740
It's as simple as that.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.110
It's something that
I've never done.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.190
I've been involved with,
obviously, adverts and

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.010
different--

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:29.890
I was involved in a couple of
movies that were about soccer.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.560
But not major parts.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.230
Not much talking involved.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.270
So that was great.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:39.120
But who knows?

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.770
Something might happen in the
future that someone comes up

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:45.560
to me and says you know, we want
you to play this person

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.115
and maybe it will happen.

00:33:49.115 --> 00:33:50.600
But I don't think so.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.410
It's not something that's
an ambition of mine.

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.640
MARVIN CHOW: You heard it here
first. Something might happen

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.480
in the future.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.470
DAVID BECKHAM: Exactly.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:57.440
Never say never.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.020
MARVIN CHOW: Never say never.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.370
Because you guys are
neighbors, right?

00:33:59.370 --> 00:33:59.880
You live near.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.470
DAVID BECKHAM: Yeah, we live
five minutes away.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:02.060
MARVIN CHOW: Five
minutes away.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.190
So no banter around
the recycling bin?

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.300
DAVID BECKHAM: There's banter.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.500
But not banter that I could
say live on Google.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.670
MARVIN CHOW: Gotcha.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:12.159
Very good.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.320
Very good.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.610
One more question on this.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:17.179
Deena Koh asks, are you feeling
nervous about your

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.685
first Google+ hangout?

00:34:19.685 --> 00:34:20.420
DAVID BECKHAM: I'm
not nervous.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.190
I'm excited.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.380
being here today,
I was excited.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.969
I woke up at 6 o'clock
this morning.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:29.719
Gave the kids breakfast just
before I left and I was

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:30.989
excited about it.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:33.679
It's something that I was really
looking forward to.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:34.929
So not nervous.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:35.370
MARVIN CHOW: That's good.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:35.679
I think--

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:35.760
DAVID BECKHAM: Why?

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.810
Should I be?

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:36.949
MARVIN CHOW: No.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.429
I think--

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:39.639
I think you're doing fine.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.219
I think afterwards
it will be easy.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:44.000
I mean, it's just video
conferencing with a bunch of

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.460
your fans, talking
face to face.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.940
It seems like something
you'd really enjoy.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.139
DAVID BECKHAM: It should
be fun, then.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:50.670
MARVIN CHOW: And for those of
you who would like to watch

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.989
that afterwards, David will be
talking with some fans at

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:57.990
10:30 Pacific Time, right here
on his Google+ profile.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.430
So I think now, we're going to
take some questions from

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.500
Googlers around the world.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.270
I think we'll take a couple
questions live from here in

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.065
the audience, and some
preselected questions.

00:35:04.065 --> 00:35:05.720
So any Googler that has
a question, please

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.980
begin lining up.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.240
But we'll start with a
question from Michael

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.470
Complidger from London.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.310
And he wants to know, did you
have a role model as a child,

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:18.010
and who was it?

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.790
DAVID BECKHAM: I had a role
model in football.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.820
In soccer, sorry.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.870
That was Bryan Robson.

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.220
He used to play for
Manchester United.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.275
He was captain of Manchester
United.

00:35:29.275 --> 00:35:31.460
He was captain of England.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.010
He wore the number seven for
Manchester United and England,

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:39.620
and everything that he did I
wanted to do and become and do

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.170
exactly what he was
like as a player.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.110
And I was lucky because I wore
number seven for Manchester

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:49.060
United, wore number seven for
England, and captained England

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.260
and Manchester United.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.280
So I was very lucky
to have done that.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.650
So he was a role model
that I looked up to.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.300
MARVIN CHOW: Why don't we take
a live question over here?

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:00.640
AUDIENCE: Hi David.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.230
With everything that you've
accomplished in your career

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.060
and your life in general, what
would you say is the most

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.130
meaningful accomplishment
that you've had?

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.470
DAVID BECKHAM: My family.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.505
My family is--

00:36:10.505 --> 00:36:12.858
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:36:12.858 --> 00:36:14.108
DAVID BECKHAM: Aw.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.470
It really is.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.490
Obviously, I've done a lot in
my career and I've been able

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:25.190
to be successful in different
countries and different teams

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.795
and different leagues.

00:36:26.795 --> 00:36:30.040
And I'm very proud of that,
but my proudest

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:34.500
possession is my family.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.090
MARVIN CHOW: Why don't we
take one on this side?

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.830
AUDIENCE: Hi David.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.100
I wonder if you could talk a bit
about the London Olympics.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.190
Obviously, you were involved
in the bid at the time.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.800
So are you hoping for a place
in Team GB and what would it

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.650
mean to you to play
at the Olympics?

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.350
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, it's
exciting for our country to

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.050
host one of the biggest sporting
events in the world.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.110
I think it's really exciting.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.730
I think the buzz around England
and around London,

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:02.565
especially around East London,
where obviously, I was brought

00:37:02.565 --> 00:37:05.580
up, it's exciting.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.420
So yes, I would love to
be part of Team GB.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.030
I've never been involved in an
Olympics, and when the team

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.560
came to me and said, we want you
to be involved in the bid

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.520
to get the Olympics to
our country, into

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.280
London, I wasn't skeptical.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.990
But I was kind of nervous
because I'm not an athlete

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.680
that has performed
in the Olympics.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.050
So I was worried what I was
going to bring to the table,

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.950
and what I was going to do to
help bring it to our country.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:43.580
But to be there and to be part
of a successful bid to bring

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.700
it to London, I was
very proud.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.650
It's one of the proudest
moments that I've been

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:51.520
involved in.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.110
Especially, to be sat there one
side and then, the Paris

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.730
side was sat at the other
side, and all the media,

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:01.970
actually, had moved to in
front of the Paris team.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:04.440
So we all of a sudden got
worried, and then we expected

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.510
Paris to be called out.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:10.300
And then London came out, and
it was an exciting time.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.280
It's going to be an
amazing game.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.412
We're going to make it proud.

00:38:16.412 --> 00:38:17.680
MARVIN CHOW: That's great.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.730
We have a question from Anushe
Ganda from London.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.640
And going back to the
proudest moment--

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.310
in your footballing career
so far, what would be the

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.510
proudest moment?

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.220
DAVID BECKHAM: Proudest moment
in my footballing career?

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.500
It would have to be
winning The Treble

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.480
for Manchester United.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.510
The year '99 was a great year.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.550
I got married, I had my first
son, and we won The Treble.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.700
So it was a big year.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.596
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:38:47.596 --> 00:38:49.830
MARVIN CHOW: We'll take a
question on this side.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:50.750
AUDIENCE: Hi David.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.540
Since moving to California,
what's the funniest

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.080
misunderstanding you or Victoria
have had because of

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.330
your accent?

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.790
DAVID BECKHAM: I'm not sure
we've had a funnier one then

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:08.860
as our children had
the other day.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.560
We were sat there
in the kitchen.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:16.470
Well, in our first year, and
Brooklyn was writing on a

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.790
piece of paper or drawing or
doing some sketching, and he

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:23.105
said, Daddy, I need
some rubbers.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.850
And I started looking around and
I looked over and we had a

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:33.230
couple of friends there
from the U.S. and

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.310
they looked in shock.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:41.110
And I didn't understand it at
the time but he now calls them

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.940
erasers, anyway.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.190
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER
AND APPLAUSE]

00:39:47.523 --> 00:39:48.230
MARVIN CHOW: That is awesome.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.440
We'll take one on this side.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.070
AUDIENCE: Hi David.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:53.140
Thank you for coming.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.170
Actually I don't
have an accent.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.830
I just really like yours.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.857
DAVID BECKHAM: That's
a great accents.

00:39:58.857 --> 00:39:59.731
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:59.731 --> 00:40:01.560
Yeah, so thanks for coming.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.180
I'm wondering, after today's
hangout, do you have plans on

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.880
how you'd like to use hangouts
in the future, in terms of

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.590
engaging with your fans
all over the world?

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.200
DAVID BECKHAM: Well, I'm
hoping it goes well.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.060
Then, there will definitely
be more.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:20.220
I think-- this is the first
time I've done it, so it's

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:24.240
exciting to be able to hang
out with fans that have

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:27.280
supported me over the years
and throughout my career.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.820
It's special, and obviously it
gives them a chance to ask me

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.390
questions that they've,
obviously, never been able to.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.390
So I'm excited and hopefully
there'll be more.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.370
AUDIENCE: Can I get a quick
picture with you?

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.500
DAVID BECKHAM: Of
course, you can.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.912
MARVIN CHOW: Oh, it's
starting again.

00:40:48.532 --> 00:40:50.070
AUDIENCE: You look handsome
by the way.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:50.595
DAVID BECKHAM: Thank you.

00:40:50.595 --> 00:40:52.930
You look very lovely.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:53.640
MARVIN CHOW: All right, ready?

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.740
1, 2, 3, cheese.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.405
There you go.

00:40:57.405 --> 00:40:58.232
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:58.232 --> 00:40:58.724
DAVID BECKHAM: No problem.

00:40:58.724 --> 00:40:59.708
Nice to meet you.

00:40:59.708 --> 00:41:00.692
MARVIN CHOW: Thank
you for coming.

00:41:00.692 --> 00:41:01.942
Thank you David.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.370
Back to the questions.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.150
Darminder Singh from the San
Francisco office asks about,

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.920
throughout your career you
played against many teams.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.850
Which particular team
or set of players

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:18.830
has left you in awe?

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.120
I think you talked about
players, but maybe you could

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.537
talk a little bit more on the
team side that you've played

00:41:23.537 --> 00:41:24.240
against.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.950
DAVID BECKHAM: I think teams
that I've played against that

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.895
have left me in awe--

00:41:27.895 --> 00:41:29.950
I'd have to say the
Barcelona team.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.830
Every time you come up against
the Barcelona team, they play

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.366
the game in such a great way.

00:41:35.366 --> 00:41:41.380
But I think the one team that
I played against that were

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:46.500
amazing, it was where Ronaldo,
the Brazilian player, got a

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.310
standing ovation from the
Manchester United fans.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:54.860
And that team, watching that
team, the way they played, for

00:41:54.860 --> 00:42:02.170
me- it left you kind of in awe
of the players, of the setup,

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.710
of them as a club, and the
players that played there.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:10.690
They had Zidane, Raul, Roberto,
Carlos, Ronaldo.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:12.460
Little did I know I'd
be playing with

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.440
them the season after.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.950
So that was exciting.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.095
But they're definitely the
team I was in awe of.

00:42:19.095 --> 00:42:19.370
MARVIN CHOW: That's great.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.780
That's great.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.780
Why don't we take a question
on this side.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.710
AUDIENCE: Your wife's been
known to wear some pretty

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:25.100
ridiculously tall shoes.

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.560
I was wondering what
your opinion is

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.550
on your wife's footwear.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:33.220
DAVID BECKHAM: I think
taller the better.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.600
Put it this way, I've
not worn them.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.570
She said over the years that I
wore her underwear, for some

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.830
unknown reason.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:48.610
She said that live on TV, by
the way, which is not true.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.290
But the shoes are great.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:55.280
I love a pair of high
heels on a lady.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.022
I like them.

00:43:01.022 --> 00:43:02.810
MARVIN CHOW: Another high heel
question on this side or a

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.310
different question?

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.500
AUDIENCE: Hi David.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.780
I have a question.

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:12.220
So if you were to pick a team to
beat, let's say, Barcelona,

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.920
so which one do you
want to choose?

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.290
And do you already have some
ideas to beat them?

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:20.120
DAVID BECKHAM: I think
to come up against a

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.340
Barcelona team is exciting.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:27.360
You can never be worried about
playing against a team.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.910
As great as Barcelona are, as
great as Real Madrid and

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:34.600
Manchester United are, we're
a team that's growing.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.660
And we've got some very good
young players in our team.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:40.490
And we've been able, like
I said earlier about the

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:45.450
interest in this league and
our team around the world,

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.060
we've had some of the biggest
players in the biggest teams

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.200
come over and want to play
against us in preseason games.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:57.360
So we've come up against AC
Milan, Barcelona, Real Madrid.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.860
I was going to say Manchester
City but--

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:06.010
we've come up against some great
teams and it's great to

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:09.970
have that interest. So you
should never be worried about

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.720
who you're going to
play against.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.380
MARVIN CHOW: We'll take one
final question over here and

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.500
then I'll--

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.973
AUDIENCE: One more, please?

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.490
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming, David.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.610
I know you've been around
the league.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.720
You've been around various
different leagues.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.520
Where would you like to finish
your soccer career at?

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.550
Would you like to go back
to Manchester United?

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.030
Do you want to stay
in America?

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:33.870
Or, do you want to tackle
a league that

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.050
you've never been to?

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:41.050
DAVID BECKHAM: I mean, my next
birthday in May I'll be 37.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:42.020
AUDIENCE: Still really young.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.660
It's really young.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.796
DAVID BECKHAM: In soccer years
it's not so young.

00:44:45.796 --> 00:44:47.660
AUDIENCE: But in Beckham years
it's really young.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.590
DAVID BECKHAM: In
life it's young.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.280
And I still feel young.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.940
So I'll continue to play the
game as long as can.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:56.350
I love it.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:59.730
Every single day I enjoy
going to training.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.610
I enjoy playing in games.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.730
I enjoy being part of a team.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:07.790
And my contract's now for two
years, so it will take me up

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:14.710
to almost 39, almost.
And then, we'll see.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:20.670
I think people expected me to
move away from the Galaxy or

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:22.970
retire at the end
of this year.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:27.900
So I'm excited about these
next couple of years, but

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.210
we'll see what happens
in the future.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.390
MARVIN CHOW: We do actually
have a shirt for you.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.990
I'm not going to ask you to
autograph it, but we do have a

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.470
Google Beckham track jacket
which we would like

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:37.990
to present to you.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.760
Thank you very much.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.622
DAVID BECKHAM: Thank you.

00:45:41.622 --> 00:45:44.010
Thank you.

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.350
MARVIN CHOW: We definitely want
to thank you for coming.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:47.580
I think in addition to the track
jacket, all the Googlers

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.780
here in the audience, please
know that there's a Google+

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.940
David Beckham t-shirt
for everyone here.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:57.500
It will be available in Benghazi
in Building 43 from

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.570
now until 11:00 AM.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.440
I don't think David can
sign all of them.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.000
So please be understanding
around that.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.800
But please enjoy your
free t-shirt.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.600
For those of you on the live
stream and for those of you

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.010
that have more questions, please
feel free to join David

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.770
at 10:30 at a hangout on
his Google+ profile.

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:12.650
Thank you very much, David.

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:15.545
We really appreciate it.

00:46:15.545 --> 00:46:16.543
It was fantastic.

00:46:16.543 --> 00:46:18.540
It was really appreciated.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.050
DAVID BECKHAM: Thank you.
