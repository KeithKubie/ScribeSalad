equipment you know the second that the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580
equipment you know the second that the
 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.910
equipment you know the second that the
second policy you know I would have to

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920
second policy you know I would have to
 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.590
second policy you know I would have to
say and this gets somewhat political is

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600
say and this gets somewhat political is
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.950
say and this gets somewhat political is
that we have to understand the military

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960
that we have to understand the military
 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.709
that we have to understand the military
and the military industrial component

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719
and the military industrial component
 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.580
and the military industrial component
very very well before we get involved in

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
very very well before we get involved in
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.639
very very well before we get involved in
future conflicts and it's not to say

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649
future conflicts and it's not to say
 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.319
future conflicts and it's not to say
that we don't do the very best job we

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329
that we don't do the very best job we
 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.190
that we don't do the very best job we
can but obviously um you know we got

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200
can but obviously um you know we got
 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.590
can but obviously um you know we got
into a rock it's going to be hard to get

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600
into a rock it's going to be hard to get
 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.389
into a rock it's going to be hard to get
out of a rock both from a political

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399
out of a rock both from a political
 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.910
out of a rock both from a political
standpoint a sociological standpoint and

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920
standpoint a sociological standpoint and
 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.239
standpoint a sociological standpoint and
so understanding these components of the

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249
so understanding these components of the
 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.069
so understanding these components of the
the of the of the foreign policy

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
the of the of the foreign policy
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.809
the of the of the foreign policy
equation I think are very very important

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819
equation I think are very very important
 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.389
equation I think are very very important
the other thing I think we we we have to

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399
the other thing I think we we we have to
 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.399
the other thing I think we we we have to
learn as Americans and I on so i would

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409
learn as Americans and I on so i would
 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.319
learn as Americans and I on so i would
offer this advice to our administration

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329
offer this advice to our administration
 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.559
offer this advice to our administration
and that is we are a participant in a

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569
and that is we are a participant in a
 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.709
and that is we are a participant in a
broad global political network and i

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719
broad global political network and i
 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.959
broad global political network and i
think it's very very important for us to

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969
think it's very very important for us to
 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.179
think it's very very important for us to
make sure that we bring along the the

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189
make sure that we bring along the the
 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.789
make sure that we bring along the the
other key global constituents of that

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799
other key global constituents of that
 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.410
other key global constituents of that
network as we think about foreign policy

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420
network as we think about foreign policy
 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.660
network as we think about foreign policy
this is a change for the United States

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670
this is a change for the United States
 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.389
this is a change for the United States
it's obviously very complex to think

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399
it's obviously very complex to think
 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.400
it's obviously very complex to think
through but nonetheless I think if we

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410
through but nonetheless I think if we
 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.500
through but nonetheless I think if we
can advance together with our arm you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510
can advance together with our arm you
 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.170
can advance together with our arm you
know a lot arms locked together with

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180
know a lot arms locked together with
 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.030
know a lot arms locked together with
other global partners with respect to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040
other global partners with respect to
 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.250
other global partners with respect to
foreign policy that would ultimately be

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260
foreign policy that would ultimately be
 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.870
foreign policy that would ultimately be
beneficial

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880
beneficial
 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.020
beneficial
there were a few that there were a you

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030
there were a few that there were a you
 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.330
there were a few that there were a you
know some highlighted examples of

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340
know some highlighted examples of
 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.290
know some highlighted examples of
something like timecard charging or you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300
something like timecard charging or you
 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.900
something like timecard charging or you
know some events which occurred that I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910
know some events which occurred that I
 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.270
know some events which occurred that I
think were somewhat surgical in nature

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280
think were somewhat surgical in nature
 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.070
think were somewhat surgical in nature
and in the grand scheme of things were

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080
and in the grand scheme of things were
 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.070
and in the grand scheme of things were
relatively small and unfortunately I

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080
relatively small and unfortunately I
 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.620

believe that the defense industry was

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630
believe that the defense industry was
 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.800
believe that the defense industry was
painted unfairly with respect to what

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810
painted unfairly with respect to what
 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.560
painted unfairly with respect to what
you refer to as a disequilibrium I think

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570
you refer to as a disequilibrium I think
 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.180
you refer to as a disequilibrium I think
it's important to recognize that the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190
it's important to recognize that the
 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.300
it's important to recognize that the
defense industry is comprised of a very

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310
defense industry is comprised of a very
 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.720
defense industry is comprised of a very
very strongly dedicated patriotic group

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730
very strongly dedicated patriotic group
 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.880
very strongly dedicated patriotic group
of people many of our companies thirty
