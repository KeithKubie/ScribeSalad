00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.435
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:03.409
ROB DELANEY: Thank you.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.100
Hi.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.260
Hello, everyone.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.120
Actually, this is what picks
me up, so this is just a prop.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.130
It doesn't even matter.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.120
I can do that.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.986
Get away from me.

00:00:15.986 --> 00:00:17.440
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.730
I don't know why
you're here, meaning,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.219
like, do you work here, and
you were forced to attend?

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:25.260
Somebody shook your head.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.350
You don't work here?

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.892
AUDIENCE: No.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:27.683
ROB DELANEY: Great.

00:00:27.683 --> 00:00:28.440
OK, that's good.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.020
Then that means at least he
wasn't forced to come here.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.530
You have a Google shirt on.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.770
You don't know who I am.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.220
You wish you were somewhere
else, but you're smiling.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.860
That's OK.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.420
Thank you.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.100
You have the book.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.219
Maybe you paid for it,
maybe it was a gift.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.760
I don't know.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.920
In any case, thank you for
coming to see me here now.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.835
I appreciate that.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:51.660
And thank you, Jason.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.290
You could have dressed up.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.220
You kind of dressed like
a slob to introduce me.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.650
The joke there is that I'm
wearing the exact same thing.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.287
ROB DELANEY: The
Mitt Romney thing.

00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:06.870
Yeah, I played him
for "Funny or Die."

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.700
So what?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.830
But then I got invited to
the Obama headquarters.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.530
That's true, and I'll just
talk about that for a second

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.200
before I read the book.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.990
What's funny is I had written
I think that it's probably

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.925
a good idea to make access
to health care easier

00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:22.040
in the United States.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.080
That's a radical
position that I hold,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.530
and I've written
about that a lot.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.970
And I didn't really care--
like I'm not a Democrat.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.040
I'm not a Republican.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.290
I just vote like on the issues.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.090
And health care I liked a
lot, so I wrote a lot of stuff

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.690
about that.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.590
And then the Obama
administration

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.540
contacted me and said,
it seems like you

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.660
care about health care.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.460
Would you want to
maybe do ba liddle da?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.444
And I was like, well, let
me tell you how I feel,

00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:50.860
and you can tell
me, because I bet

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.380
I can tell you some things
that'll make you not

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.879
want to have anything
to do with me.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.230
And I told them,
I was like, I want

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.500
Barack Obama to be reelected
as much as Michelle wants him

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.290
to be reelected, but not
because I care about him.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.410
I mean he's some
insane millionaire

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.970
with the mental
problems that you

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.490
need to want to be president.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.850
So I didn't ever wear a
Hope t-shirt or anything

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.160
crazy like that, you
weird sloganeers.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.900
So I was like, but
that said, I'm insane,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.460
so I'll happily go around the
country talking about health

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.890
care policy and all
that, why it's important,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.120
but I might not even
say the name Obama.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.650
And they were like, it's
been great speaking with you.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.260
But then as it got closer, and
I started to talk more fervently

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.460
and began to just like brutalize
Mitt Romney in a real--

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.250
you know, I studied Karl
Rove and his scummery,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.670
and it seemed like a great way.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.270
So I just went after him just
because it was funny to me.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.800
I remember he personally
like outlawed forever assault

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.925
weapons in Massachusetts,
which is where I grew up,

00:02:56.925 --> 00:02:59.299
so I'd followed him for a lot
longer than a lot of people

00:02:59.299 --> 00:02:59.830
had.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.130
And then three years later,
in 2007, he joined the NRA.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.700
So just watching him, I was
like-- and the health care

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.200
thing.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.980
Anyway, even Google now is like,
why did we invite him to talk?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.740
So I just was nuts about
the Affordable Care

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.070
Act and its awesome
website, right Google?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.635
And it's OK to admit that that
is garbage and embarrassing.

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:31.510
So then, finally, they
did invite me, though,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.970
because I did work so hard
to help Obama get reelected.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.440
And I was there election
night, and it was pretty fun.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.250
It was pretty fun.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.680
My wife was pregnant
with our second kid.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.920
And she's a woman, so she
has a uterus and a vagina.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.130
And so there are
people who like,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.800
well, women should pay a million
dollars to get a pap smear,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.690
and men should get free,
blow-up "Penthouse" blah, blah.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.190
Anyway, drives me crazy.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.690
So anyway, that was just a way
to kill some time because I'm

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.950
secretly afraid
to speak in public

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.350
and read from my own book.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.182
No.

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:11.890
So I'll tell you.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.370
Why the hell did I write a book?

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.300
A lot of people know me from
Twitter, which is great,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.390
and I had been doing stand-up
for a long time before that.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.800
And then in 2010, Julie Grau
from Spiegel and Grau, who

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.400
published this book, wrote me
on Twitter and she just like,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.140
at replied me, like the
way you would say, hey,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.190
want to grab a club
sandwich, Rick?

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.250
Like to your friend?

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.330
And she said, hey, would
you write a book for me?

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.144
And I wrote, OK, and
then forgot about it

00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:47.560
because I didn't
know who she was.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.090
I'm sorry, I didn't
know who she was.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.090
And then Matt Johnson, an
amazing, real author and guy

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.600
that I know wrote me, and
he said, hey, asshole,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.220
you need to pay
attention to that.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.630
She's like legitimately
a towering figure

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.310
in the publishing world, and
you're an asshole, again.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.330
He said it twice.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.360
And so I wrote her
back, and I was like,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.690
yeah, remember when I was like,
yeah, that was just joking.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.570
I mean, I want to,
but I didn't mean

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.570
to so cavalierly,
what do I-- how?

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.732
And so we started talking, and
I said to her, I was like, well,

00:05:22.732 --> 00:05:24.940
you know-- I live in Los
Angeles-- and I said to her,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.260
I was like, it so happens
I've got a show next month

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.170
in New York, just
trying to be so casual,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.840
and maybe you could come.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.942
And then she was like, OK.

00:05:33.942 --> 00:05:36.400
And so then I immediately called
every theater in New York,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.200
I have to do a show
next month in New York.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.575
Because I didn't
really have one.

00:05:39.575 --> 00:05:43.180
And [MOCK YELLING]
and I found one.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.470
And then I was like, yeah,
oh, I forgot the information

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.690
because I have so
many shows, I forgot.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.350
And here it is, and
told her where it was.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.080
I'm going to try to
just gradually move

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.620
this throughout the thing.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.760
And so we started talking,
and she came to my show

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.659
with her team.

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.950
And they read all the stuff
that I'd written for "Vice"

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.257
and saw my stand-up, which is
very-- if you did find me first

00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:12.090
on Twitter, you'd be
forgiven if you thought

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.830
that my stand-up was like Steven
Wrighty or Mitch Hedbergy,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.725
like short joke.

00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:16.600
But it totally isn't.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.290
It's like super long,
autobiographical, meandering

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:26.190
just shit, really awful, which
is to say it's longer stuff.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.250
So this wasn't a crazy
departure for me,

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.790
even though some people
would be forgiven

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.250
for thinking that it is.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.420
So I started to
write the book, and I

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.960
wanted it to be
a-- I love memoirs,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.140
and I love autobiographies.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.960
But my favorite ones aren't
ones where it was like, well,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.150
my parents met at
blah, blah, and then

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
I was born at X hospital.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.840
Who cares?

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.470
We all have our own
version of that,

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.250
and I'm not interested in yours,
so why would I be in mine?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.300
So I wanted it to be true.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.210
First of all, err towards
the side of humor,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.990
and then deal with
some of the things.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.140
Because yes, I'm
very, very lucky

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.230
to be able to make a
living doing comedy,

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.560
but I've been through
some darker stuff,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.800
like anybody who survives
to adulthood has.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.050
But some of my stuff was
just a little more dramatic,

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.070
I mean, the thing that sort of
divides my life into two halves

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.800
was 11 years ago.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.010
In a blackout, I drove a
car into the Department

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.720
of Water and Power
in Los Angeles,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.496
and I broke both
my arms very badly.

00:07:32.496 --> 00:07:33.620
This bone was sticking out.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.820
It was a compound fracture.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.403
I had to have surgery
on both of them.

00:07:36.403 --> 00:07:40.240
So I was in jail in a
wheelchair in a bloody hospital

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.230
gown from face blood.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.670
And my legs were also in
these leg stabilizer things

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.820
because my knees had been
ripped open to the bone.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.792
So my legs couldn't bend,
and my arms didn't work,

00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:54.000
and I was in a hospital gown.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.430
Sometimes in jail I'd just
slide out of the wheelchair,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.888
and my hospital
gown would come up,

00:07:57.888 --> 00:08:00.810
exposing everything
to everybody in jail.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.990
And if you've been
in jail, you know

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.650
that you're supposed to
keep that stuff to yourself.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.260
And so that's when
I was like, oh, I

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.780
should live my life in a
different manner from now on,

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.400
or I'll definitely
die or kill people.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.970
For me, it was kind of
like, I didn't care,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.850
like a lot of drug
addicts and alcoholics,

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.940
I was like I could have
died at any moment,

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.100
and I was totally
at peace with that.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.735
But once the cops
were like, you know,

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:30.070
it's pretty amazing you
didn't kill 30 people tonight.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.090
And I was like, you're correct.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.850
And so once that was
driven home for me,

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.919
that's when I decided to put
the plug in the proverbial jug.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.034
And so that's sort of
divides my life in half.

00:08:41.034 --> 00:08:42.950
And it was only after
that, it was some months

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.310
after that when I got my first
cast off or my last cast off

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.330
and was halfway through all
the occupational therapy

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.700
I needed that I first
did my first open mic

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.120
and did stand-up and stuff.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.050
So that sort of very
neatly divides my life

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.000
into two halves.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.590
And then after that, I met
a woman and we got married,

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.027
and we have two kids
and all this stuff

00:09:08.027 --> 00:09:09.610
and began to make
my living in comedy.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.620
So that's all
dealt with in here.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.980
But now I'm going to read
a little of it for you,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.640
and if you fucking interrupt
me-- no, I'm just kidding.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.690
They didn't tell if I shouldn't
swear or not, but I did.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.460
ROB DELANEY: So this
section is called

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.620
La Mer, which is
French for the sea.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.610
All the chapter
titles are in French

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.530
because I thought that would
be a funny, pretentious asshole

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.200
thing to do, and I did.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.350
So here we go.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.160
La Mer.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.880
For two summers during
college, 1997 and 1998,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.840
I quit New York for
Marblehead and drove

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.640
a boat called a launch
on Marblehead Harbor.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.130
A launch is a glorified water
taxi that takes rich people out

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.780
to the middle of the harbor
where their boats are moored.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.260
Marblehead, a town of 20,000
souls, has five yacht clubs.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.050
I'd be very surprised if there
were another town on our planet

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.885
that had a higher number
of yacht clubs per capita.

00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:13.320
The Eastern Boston, Dolphin,
and Marblehead Yacht Clubs

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.060
had their own launch services.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.120
The Crescent Yacht
Club employed me,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.650
and I drove its members
exclusively from the dock

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.800
to their various opulent
sailboats and power boats.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.000
Our busiest day and
night of the summer

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.830
was always the 4th of July.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.740
A wealthy community,
Marblehead could

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.970
afford to mount a high-quality
fireworks display.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.010
Also, since Marblehead is a
peninsula with a large island

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.120
that's attached by
a thin causeway,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.080
its natural harbor is both
protected from the open sea

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.860
and surrounded by
land on three sides.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.690
So the harbor is
several square miles

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.510
of water filled with
around 2,000 boats ringed

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.920
by beaches and docks and parks.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.180
You'd be hard pressed to find a
better place to drink 14 beers

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.120
and watch fireworks.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.170
Though my earliest
4th of July's found

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.950
me sitting on my dad's
shoulders and watching fireworks

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.580
from the beach, after
puberty I saw the holiday

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.320
as one of the few
days of the year

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.050
when it was perfectly acceptable
to drink into unconsciousness.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.250
The launch would operate nonstop
on the 4th, ferrying people

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.800
to and from their boats.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.000
Then, after the fireworks, my
fellow launch operators and I

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.170
would respond to radio calls
and pick up families with kids,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.740
old couples, and
dangerously-crowded motorboats

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.140
filled with drunk
people in their 20s.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.060
Our staff consisted of our boss,
Dockmaster Bill, my high school

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.180
friend and band mate Michael.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.100
Our band was called
Scaramanga, and it

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.970
was named after
Francisco Scaramanga

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.750
from "The Man with the Golden
Gun," the James Bond movie.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.820
In that movie,
Francisco Scaramanga--

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.320
they've never seen
a picture of him,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.390
but they know that he has
the identifying feature

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.170
of having a third nipple.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.675
So Sean Connery
as James Bond has

00:11:47.675 --> 00:11:50.800
to pose as him at one point,
and the way that he does it,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.020
he just puts on a
prosthetic third nipple.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.145
And the occassionally would
be like, yeah, I'm him.

00:11:55.145 --> 00:11:57.510
And they're like, oh, OK,
come on in and play baccarat

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.080
with us.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.040
ROB DELANEY: So Bill was
a salty dog in his 40s

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.740
who'd grown up on
the water and worked

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.574
at the Crescent for
at least 10 years.

00:12:06.574 --> 00:12:07.990
Michael and I had
known each other

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.230
since we were about seven,
and then became very close

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.890
in high school when we both
were heavily involved in theater

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.740
as well as drinking and
talking about boobs.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.297
Our work day finished
up at 11:00 PM,

00:12:18.297 --> 00:12:20.380
and then we were free to
get into whatever trouble

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.680
we felt like getting into.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.960
For Michael and me,
in the summer of 1998,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.380
that meant getting drunk,
appropriating a little dinghy

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.820
that belonged to the yacht
club, and using it to cruise

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.220
around the harbor to see
who was out and about.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.760
It wasn't rare for us to take
the 12-foot motorboat out

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.160
for a drunken cruise in
the middle of the night.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.010
We'd do this a few
times every summer

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.440
with no real fear of getting
in trouble, since drunken

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.710
shenanigans on the high
seas of Massachusetts

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.270
are as run of the mill
as moustaches on cops.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.300
Being filled with
beer and on the water

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.716
is something people have been
doing since they figured out

00:12:50.716 --> 00:12:53.180
how to ferment hops, and
it's easy to understand why.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.679
It's fun, and it feels good.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:56.720
You've thinned your blood
with the alcohol that's

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.380
sloshing around in your
belly, complementing the rise

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.670
and fall of the sea
you're floating upon.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.710
It just feels right to
have booze in your guts

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.770
as you float around mother
ocean like a dumb, fat buoy

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.860
at the mercy of the sea
and filled with spirits.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.250
Sailors refer to the
ocean as "the drink"

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.050
too, as in, I slipped and
grabbed for a halyard,

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.660
and my wrench fell in the drink.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.150
So there's clearly something
substantial and enduring

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.690
to this alcohol/sea connection.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.890
Sometimes Michael and I would
putt out to Children's Island,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.510
an island about a mile beyond
the the mouth of the harbor,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.160
and go for a stroll.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.460
Growing up, I'd gone to day camp
on Children's Island for years,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.820
and it felt entirely
naughty to trespass on it

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.280
as a drunken adult.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.010
Like most islands
around New England,

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.740
it smelled like seagull
shit and wild grass.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.130
I'm sure if I caught a whiff of
it right now, I'd start crying.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.040
When I was a counselor
on the island,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.510
I'd had to become a
certified life guard.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.370
Part of the training consisted
of an overnight springtime

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.280
visit to the island,
where we were supposed

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.800
to practice different
rescue techniques.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.560
Upon arrival, we discovered
that the Marblehead cop

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.900
who taught the
course was insane.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.980
He must have been
certified 40 years ago

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.710
over the telephone or something.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.490
Clearly, no one was
checking up on him

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.490
because he had
gone entirely rogue

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.780
and used educational techniques
that were, I now realize,

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.120
abusive.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.850
The most memorable
thing he did was

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.980
show us a slideshow of
actual dead drowning

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.770
victims from Marblehead
Police files.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.640
He began the
slideshow by asking,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.540
what's the difference
between a saltwater

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.470
drowning and a
freshwater drowning?

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.080
I'll tell you.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.800
Saltwater animals eat people.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.394
Freshwater animals don't.

00:14:30.394 --> 00:14:32.560
So when you find someone
who's drowned in saltwater,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.030
they'll have been
eaten somewhat.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.280
And when you find someone
who's drowned in freshwater,

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.390
they'll be all bloated up.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.764
So what you find is horrible,
just in two different ways.

00:14:39.764 --> 00:14:41.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.550
ROB DELANEY: He then
got a slide projector,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.090
positioned it in front of a
white sheet that was suspended

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.250
in front of a fireplace,
and started showing us

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.190
pictures of a variety of
corpses that had been pulled out

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.620
of the water a few miles
in various directions

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.140
from where we sat
in our sleeping

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.510
bags in a lodge on a
small island in the middle

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.730
of the dark, terrifying night.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.350
My friend Ellen was there.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.760
We were adhered to
each other in fear

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.730
as he clicked from
corpse to corpse.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.890
The island didn't
have electricity,

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.650
so the slide projector was
powered by a portable gas

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.110
generator that hummed
outside the building,

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.590
efficiently masking the
sounds of any approaching

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.210
ghosts or child murderers.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.690
ROB DELANEY: One particularly
ghastly saltwater

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.340
drowning victim was
a skeleton whose meat

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.090
had been almost entirely
removed from it.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:27.970
Almost.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.290
The gut contents
within the ribcage

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.485
had proven difficult
to access for the fish

00:15:32.485 --> 00:15:35.540
and bottom feeders, so the
ribs rather effectively

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.200
caged a rotten buffet of guts
that poked out the bottom

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.930
and protruded between the ribs.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.160
The slide that
followed, that was

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.140
of a dead baby, a
fucking dead baby.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.720
And since this baby had
drowned in freshwater,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.720
it was bloated and huge.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.720
Next photo was a close up of
the dead baby's bloated face.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.940
We cringed, and then the
screen immediately went black,

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.590
and the generator went out.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.200
Then it came back on.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.320
Then off again.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:04.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.570
ROB DELANEY: The
generator sputtered.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.570
The dead baby's face
strobed on and off

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.580
as the generator outside choked
and a room full of 16-year-olds

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.720
screamed.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.270
What in Christ's fuck did this
have to do with life guarding?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.700
20 years later, my best
guess remains, not a thing.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.370
ROB DELANEY: Officer
Soul Murder went out

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.050
to check on the generator.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.890
And when he returned,
he said, bad news.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.170
The generator broke.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.690
We shuddered in relief,
and then went outside

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.140
to practice moving people
with spine injuries

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.290
from one end of the
island to another.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.410
OK.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.520
ROB DELANEY: I'm going
to leave it there.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.870
And here's another one, another
semi-nautically themed one.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.810
Man, even reading that.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:56.749
That fucking happened.

00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:57.415
What an asshole.

00:16:57.415 --> 00:17:02.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.329
ROB DELANEY: This one's
called Le Courage.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.760
One night in the
summer of 1999 I

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.940
jumped off the Manhattan Bridge.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.710
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.200
I had a bungee cord
attached to my ankles.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.804
But it was still illegal and
not part of any tour package

00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:19.150
or team-building exercise.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.329
I'd just graduated
from NYU and was

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.290
working as a waiter
at the Atlantic Grill

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.099
on the Upper East Side.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.140
Right before I graduated, I
booked the role of Sir Lancelot

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.450
in a touring company
of "Camelot."

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.900
But the tour didn't begin
rehearsals until fall,

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.140
so I spent the summer
waiting tables.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.850
The night in question
I ate probably

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.000
25 pieces of exotic sushi
that patrons had left

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.932
untouched on their plates.

00:17:42.932 --> 00:17:45.140
Rich people ate at the
restaurant and thought nothing

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.160
of ordering $200 worth of
sushi and eating half of it.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.170
What was I supposed
to do, not eat it?

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.920
At around 11, I split up
my tips with the busboys,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.770
then headed out and took the
6 train back to Alphabet City,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.180
planning to drink a 12-pack of
Lowenbrau without assistance.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.630
When I got back to my
apartment, my roommate Kish

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.352
was pacing around and smiling.

00:18:04.352 --> 00:18:06.310
"Guess what I'm going to
do tonight?" he asked.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.840
"What?" "I'm going to bungee
jump off the Manhattan Bridge."

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.817
I'd met Kish during my
junior year in Paris.

00:18:12.817 --> 00:18:14.650
I'd been drawn to him
immediately because he

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.480
was a smart, fun,
well-read guy who

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.200
was always up for adventure.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.020
He was named for an island in
the Persian Gulf off of Iran,

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.770
which is where his
father Menushar was born.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.570
Menushar had an archetypal
entrance to the United States

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.900
in 1963, when the boat that
took him across the Atlantic

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.590
encountered fog as
it approached land.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.150
After a period of
very low visibility,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.840
the Statue of Liberty
herself emerged from the fog,

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.460
looming over the boat, welcoming
them to the United States.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.660
Rather than ask Kish any
questions like, why are you

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.580
jumping off the
Manhattan Bridge?,

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.090
I told him I was
coming with him.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.530
And we headed out the door
to meet "some guy" who

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.950
has a bungee cord near
the Brooklyn on-ramp

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.530
to the Manhattan Bridge.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.410
Kish didn't know the
cord owner, but he

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.560
did know a Polish
guy who knew him,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.720
so we went to meet his
friend Dariosh at a bar.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.210
I didn't know Dariosh, but
he endeared himself to me

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.090
by immediately launching
into a story about how he'd

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.600
learned the hard way earlier
that day that wearing

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.730
a tiny Speedo bathing
suit to the beach

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.180
draws a lot of
attention in the US.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.580
He presented Kish and me
with a cogent argument

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.670
as to why Speedo
suits are superior

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.340
and why American men were
silly for not wearing them.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.300
We told him that he
made a great case,

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.950
but that American women tended
to prefer a little mystery

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.370
where a man's junk
dimensions were concerned,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.920
even though solving
such a mystery

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.450
might involve facing down
a disappointing penis

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.400
lurking in the
shadow of a fat gut

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.310
after drinking a
bucket of wine coolers

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.540
at a rented beach house.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.950
ROB DELANEY: Dariosh
was pretty fit,

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.070
though, so I'm sure his
ensemble made some people happy.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.930
After bonding with
Dariosh we headed out

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.050
to meet the guy who'd show
us how to jump off a bridge.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.650
About 15 people were
gathered on a busy corner

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.790
of Flatbush Avenue waiting
for the guy with the rope.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.720
For something wholly illegal
and intrinsically dangerous,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.530
it was a rather
well-advertised operation.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.570
After a few minutes,
Tony arrived and led us

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.930
along Flatbush Avenue toward
the on-ramp to the bridge.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.660
As we traveled, Tony gave
us instructions, including

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.350
the order to lie down if the
subway passed us on the bridge

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.460
so that conductors
wouldn't see us.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.110
Tony had me carry
the bungee cord

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.820
up the bridge in a big bag.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.140
It weighed maybe 50
pounds, and I told myself

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.540
its substantial weight meant
that it must be really safe.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.060
When we'd covered
some distance, he

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.170
handed out walkie talkies
set to the police frequency

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.960
to a few of the customers.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.790
He'd asked us to
give him $20 apiece.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.360
He told us to listen for any
discussion among the cops

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.620
about a large group of people
sneaking out onto the Manhattan

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.730
Bridge with crazy gear.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.500
He said that it'd
be hard to get away

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.150
if they wanted to arrest us, so
what we were really listening

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.610
to was for any mention
of Truck 2 or Truck 6.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.030
He said that those
names referred

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.150
to tactical
anti-terrorist units that

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.452
would kill us first and
then figure out who we were.

00:20:59.452 --> 00:21:01.660
He said if we heard that
those groups were being sent

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.140
to the bridge, we should
just drop everything, run,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.600
and not stop until we
were in New Jersey.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.130
I listened very carefully
for Trucks 2 and 6

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.620
for the next few hours.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.960
We walked out over the East
River, hitting the deck

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.520
whenever a train came by,
and made it about one eighth

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.260
of a mile from
the Brooklyn shore

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.150
and then set up our station.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.010
Our first instructions
from Tony were

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.690
to climb down a
level on the bridge

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.900
and-- I swear to god--
disable the red lights

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.170
that hang from the bridge
to alert airplanes, hello, I

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:29.920
am a bridge.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:31.895 --> 00:21:33.270
ROB DELANEY: I'm
sure that today,

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.600
after 9/11, New York law
enforcement would Truck 6

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.870
your ass off for that stunt.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.532
But our adventure took place
two years prior to the attack,

00:21:41.532 --> 00:21:43.990
so we didn't imagine anyone
would be too upset that we were

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.200
turning a piece of vital
metropolitan infrastructure

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.690
into an amusement park ride
and making it partially

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.870
invisible to air traffic.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.370
Then Tony, who claimed to
be a theatrical rigger,

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.050
took out the bungee cord
and secured it to something.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:58.900
To what?

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.350
To a piece of bridge, I guess.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.190
I have no idea.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.100
Then Tony asked who
wanted to go first,

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.170
and a short guy with a
buzz cut volunteered.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.180
Before he let the
test subject jump,

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.210
Tony thrust a tape
recorder in the guy's face.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.510
"What is your name?" "Dave."
"What are you about to do?"

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.320
"Jump off the
Manhattan Bridge." "Are

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.160
you doing this of your own
volition?" "Yes." "Jump."

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.250
The guy jumped, screaming.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.550
It was loud for a fraction of
a second, then immediately much

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.190
quieter, as though someone had
very quickly turned a volume

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.260
knob down.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.530
The reason his screaming
got quieter to us

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.710
is that he had just
jumped off a bridge.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.840
I looked over the edge, and he
had disappeared into the black.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.450
Disabling the bridge's lights
had effectively shrouded us

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.910
in inky darkness.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.490
I very sincerely believed
the rope had broken,

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.930
and he had gone into the river.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.780
I was certain I'd
helped facilitate

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.970
the death of someone,
someone stupid like me.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.660
But then Tony yelled, "You
all right down there?"

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.990
And the test subject
meowed a weak, "Yes."

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.350
Then a cop car pulled up at
the water's edge in Brooklyn.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.950
There was no activity
on the scanners,

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.630
but Tony yell-whispered
down to jumper one,

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.860
"Just chill out for a second.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.465
Don't move."

00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:11.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.740
ROB DELANEY: Kish and I looked
at each other, incredulous.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.300
Don't move?

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.140
What if his head filled
with blood and exploded?

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.120
How long can a person
hang upside down

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.990
without passing out or
becoming permanently stupid?

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.150
What if Truck 6 fired a missile
up his defenseless asshole?

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.150
After a few terrifying
minutes, the cop

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.700
left not having seen us.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.750
We threw another
rope with a carabiner

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.480
down to dangling Dave.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.470
He hooked it on to his
waist, and we manually

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.270
pulled him back
up to the bridge.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.770
I calculated that he probably
weighed 75% of what I weighed,

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.650
so there was probably a three
out of four chance I'd survive.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.210
He said whoa a
bunch, in a manner

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.870
that suggested he was properly
odd, but not necessarily

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.390
retarded after the rush
of blood to his head.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:57.920
Good enough for me.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.440
Then it was my turn.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.200
Though I counted maybe 11
reasons as to why I shouldn't

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.840
jump, several of them
potentially fatal or crippling,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.950
and all of them criminal,
I was determined

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.300
to have a stranger tie
a rope around my ankles

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.990
and leap off that bridge at
3:00 in the morning as planned.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.150
Tony stuck his tape
recorder in my face.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.515
"What is your name?"
"Rob Delaney."

00:24:17.515 --> 00:24:19.790
I must point out that
Kish made fun of me

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.300
without interruption for
several years at how much

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.250
naked fear was audible in
my shaky, high-pitched voice

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.236
as I answered Tony's questions.

00:24:27.236 --> 00:24:28.610
"What are you
about to do?" "Jump

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.420
off the Manhattan
Bridge." "Are you

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.680
doing this of your own
volition?" "Yes." "Jump."

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.890
I jumped.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.390
I looked out over a
sleepy, twinkling Manhattan

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.130
as I plummeted into the night.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.960
It was wonderful and visceral,
like my mind and body

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.170
were violently wiped
clean and rebooted

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.640
to take in the majesty
of the experience.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.440
It felt like a
reverse birth as I

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.560
flew into and through the
darkness toward the river.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.430
Then the slack in the cord
tightened as my rocketing mass

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.880
stretched it to its limit, and
I shot skyward and bridgeward

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.990
almost as fast as I'd descended.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.320
I made it almost to the
bridge, then fell again,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.020
and began a series of bounces.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.560
It was like being
in a giant glitter

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.960
globe as the city's
lights shock around me.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.430
I felt entirely buoyed
and supported and loved

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.730
by the dirty river, the ugly
bridge, the beautiful city,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.340
and the questionable rope.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.180
Then Tony threw down
the yank-him-up rope.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.070
And after it swung
past me a few times,

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.160
I was able to grab it,
hook it to my waist,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.590
and get pulled back up to the
bridge by my fellow jumpers.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.390
Then Kish and the others
jumped, one by one,

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.970
and we pulled them back up.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.940
We packed up as the sun rose and
took the train home to Alphabet

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.340
City to sleep, arriving
in full daylight.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.330
It had been entirely
magnificent to watch

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.760
about 20 people in a row
have an experience you knew

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.870
they'd talk about for
the rest of their lives

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.759
and participate in it as well.

00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:46.050
It was interesting to see
the few people who backed out

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.680
so totally at peace
with their decision too.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.680
Nobody gave them a
hard time either.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.200
I know I thought,
well, of course

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.940
you didn't want to
jump off a bridge.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.300
Why would anyone do that?

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.620
That would be crazy.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.020
Those of us who had jumped
were pretty much aglow.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.410
As my reflections began
to gather and coalesce

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.860
in my brain, I was absolutely
glad I had done it.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.740
But I knew I would
never do it again,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.320
nor would I allow a loved
one or really anyone

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.860
to do it since I'd seen how
ramshackle an operation it was.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.880
It was a singular rush and an
extraordinarily terrible idea

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.220
all at once.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.970
And while I have difficulty
imagining a scenario where I do

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.180
something that reckless again,
I'm very happy I can say I

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:27.075
jumped off the Manhattan Bridge,
and you, statistically, cannot.

00:26:27.075 --> 00:26:32.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.170
ROB DELANEY: So if you
have questions or anything,

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.890
now would be the time for that.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:37.835
Thank you very much.

00:26:37.835 --> 00:26:40.210
This is the first I've ever
read that out loud to people,

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.210
so thanks for listening.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.970
You do the Q's,
and I do the A's.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:55.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.030
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rob.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:56.779
Thanks for coming.

00:26:56.779 --> 00:26:58.374
ROB DELANEY: Thanks
for having me.

00:26:58.374 --> 00:27:00.540
AUDIENCE: You're probably
the most prominent example

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.920
of someone, of a comedian,
especially, now, who

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.040
has made their name almost
exclusively through the web.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.360
Do you think that model
is kind of here to stay,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.140
or do you think that
there will always

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.620
be a place for comedians to
kind of just go on the road

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.360
and work the clubs and do it the
way it's been done for years?

00:27:20.742 --> 00:27:22.700
ROB DELANEY: I'm going
to repeat that question.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.480
So I know you guys all heard
it, but they told me to,

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.250
so I'm going to.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.560
Do I think that the
web is here to stay?

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:39.210
Can you still achieve notoriety
slash fame slash a career

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.930
through touring and the
old-fashioned methods

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.820
of getting your name out there?

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:51.460
I sort of think that it is
here to stay, of course,

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.860
or it'll morph into
whatever the next thing is.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.552
But a variation
on what we see now

00:27:58.552 --> 00:28:05.810
will endure, assuming there
isn't a singularity T2

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.835
situation where
electricity stops existing

00:28:08.835 --> 00:28:13.752
or there's a nuclear
winter, which is, also, we

00:28:13.752 --> 00:28:14.960
have to be prepared for that.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.640
But it would be,
in my opinion, it

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.580
would be silly to not
avail yourself of the tools

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.990
that are here now.

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.950
For example, to
give you a timeline

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:33.180
and explain it explicitly, I
did stand-up for the first time

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.470
in 2002.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:39.850
Then in 2007, I
lost another day job

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.350
and thought, OK,
now I'm going to be

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.460
a comedian full time in 2007.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.110
In 2009, I joined Twitter.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:52.730
And then in 2010
was the last time

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.379
I collected a paycheck for
anything other than comedy.

00:28:55.379 --> 00:28:56.795
So it's been about
3 and 1/2 years

00:28:56.795 --> 00:28:58.470
that I've made my
living through comedy.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.860
I pursued a career through
all the traditional channels,

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:07.050
but then the internet
helped me, certainly,

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:12.350
catapult a few strata.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:20.900
So I think that it's almost like
once public transportation came

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.550
into play.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:26.480
It's like, would you take the
subway to get to gigs in 1956

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.170
or whatever?

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:33.250
Yeah, because if you
don't, then Dave will,

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.160
and you'll get to the club
on your horse and buggy

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.690
like way after his
people are clapping,

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.920
and women are just
throwing their clothing,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.580
and people are bringing
buffets of hot, assorted meat.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.990
You know what I mean?

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.530
So it's here.

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:49.920
It's not good.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.020
It's not bad.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.205
It's just what's happening.

00:29:52.205 --> 00:29:53.080
You know what I mean?

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.950
Like my head might explode
from a sniper's bullet.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:00.310
But the internet, I don't
think, has improved lives.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.530
You can just do more faster,
but you're still doing more.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.180
Like so that sucks.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.350
But you can do it
faster, and that's cool.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.615
So I think it's sort of
like a net zero thing.

00:30:13.192 --> 00:30:14.650
AUDIENCE: Maybe a
spin-off question

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.880
is, as someone who has sort
of made their name on the web,

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.310
do you run into resistance
from established industry types

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.810
who kind of resent
the fact that you

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.320
didn't go through the
traditional route?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.720
ROB DELANEY: Only from
small-minded people

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.886
who aren't good
at what they do--

00:30:31.886 --> 00:30:33.510
and that's not even
a joke-- and aren't

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.550
good in that traditional realm.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.260
Somebody who's sincerely
funny, why would they care?

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.350
You know what I mean?

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.632
So no.

00:30:42.632 --> 00:30:50.420
And also it's so hard to
make it as a comedian.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.540
Twitter gets me in the
door, but of a club?

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.710
People don't care.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.180
Like I would be bodily
thrown out of a club

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.450
if I didn't deliver
once I got in there.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:03.460
So thank god I had been
sharpening my sword

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.210
before Twitter ever
came on the scene.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:07.920
So not really.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.842
And nor do I care
that there are people

00:31:09.842 --> 00:31:11.550
who find out about me
from Twitter first.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.365
Great.

00:31:12.365 --> 00:31:14.490
I mean, as recently as
3 and 1/2 years ago,

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:18.210
I worked telemarketing in
a dirty basement boiler

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.234
room near the airport selling
a garbage financial newspaper

00:31:22.234 --> 00:31:23.650
and would call
people and be like,

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.659
do you want this
terrible newspaper?

00:31:25.659 --> 00:31:27.700
And they'd be like, no,
why are you bothering me?

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.380
And I'd be like, I am so sorry.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.042
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:30.042 --> 00:31:32.250
ROB DELANEY: You know, making
less than minimum wage.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.940
So I'm not going
to be like, yeah, I

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.290
wish that it was 15 years
in the Comedy Cellar

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:38.580
that got me to where I am now.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.479
I can perform at the
Comedy Cellar now.

00:31:40.479 --> 00:31:42.270
And if it didn't work
out when I was there,

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.720
then they would say, get out
of here and don't come back.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:52.310
So it's sort of like
it's here, so use it.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.040
And that's my answer to that.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.748
ROB DELANEY: I hope
it answered it.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.160
AUDIENCE: Hey, Rob.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.516
You sound like you had
some interesting jobs

00:32:09.516 --> 00:32:11.140
before you became a
full-time comedian.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.090
Can you talk about
those, and how

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.960
they influenced
your comedy today?

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.657
ROB DELANEY: Yeah.

00:32:17.657 --> 00:32:20.240
Yeah, other jobs that I've had
that have influenced my comedy.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.680
I mean, I worked in a
factory for a couple of years

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:28.110
where we made snow plows
for Chicago subway trains.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.730
And we made conveyor-- this
is terrible-- we made conveyor

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:34.400
belts for tobacco
companies that they could

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.850
sort their tobacco on and
kill our grandparents with.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.276
But working in a factory
is very applicable

00:32:41.276 --> 00:32:42.900
because the thing
about-- like the best

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.280
comedians, like a Jerry
Seinfeld, or a Louis

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.020
CK, or a Chris Rock, or a Sarah
Silverman, or a Maria Bamford,

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.880
or a Joan Rivers, one thing
that unites all of them,

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.200
that might not be the first
thing that a layman would

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.600
think of, is work ethic.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.760
Those people work, and
that's so sexy to me.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.816
They go to the factory every
day, and they do the deal,

00:33:07.816 --> 00:33:08.940
and they always get better.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.770
Like Sarah Silverman, I see
her do a lot of shows in LA.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:15.035
She's been famous for a long
time, still getting better.

00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:15.910
You know what I mean?

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.260
Still improving.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:23.530
Watching her hone jokes
is so inspiring and cool.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.597
Or Louis CK, an amazing
touring schedule

00:33:26.597 --> 00:33:28.430
while making his own
TV show that he writes,

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.570
produces, directs,
edits, and stars in.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.620
So factory work, like
it's an honorable thing

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.330
to punch in every day, do
your work and whatever.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.460
It might not be
glamorous, but so what?

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.520
You can definitely
apply that elbow grease

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.970
to your glamorous career as
a whatever in entertainment,

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:51.660
and then your
career will endure.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.340
So yeah, there isn't
a career that I've

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.440
had that doesn't translate into.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:03.625
Oh, and I worked at a company
called Intermix Media in 2004.

00:34:03.625 --> 00:34:05.540
Was it 2003 or 2004?

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.290
And this company
bought a company

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.650
called Response
Base in California.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.090
Response Base
"invented" Myspace, OK,

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:18.620
and so I was one of the first
people to work at Myspace.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.580
I sold the first ads
on Myspace, and I

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.630
wrote like email subject
lines and stuff like that.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.659
I would test subject
lines against each other.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.550
And that only hit me
like a few months ago.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.489
I was like, maybe that's why
I can write a tweet because I

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:39.340
scientifically tested
horrible spam email things

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.300
and used math to determine how
to burrow into people's brains

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.455
like a horrible criminal.

00:34:45.455 --> 00:34:46.429
You know what I mean?

00:34:50.646 --> 00:34:53.210
So if what you're doing right
now is what you want to do,

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:54.190
that's awesome.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.830
If it isn't?

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:55.989
The thing that
you do want to do,

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.072
you'll be able to use what
you're doing right now.

00:34:58.072 --> 00:34:59.330
So it's all interdisciplinary.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:02.490
It all informs each other.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.030
That's my answer
to your question.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.658
ROB DELANEY: Thank you.

00:35:08.634 --> 00:35:12.280
Like a question from a woman?

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.680
Oh, thank you.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.009
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:15.009 --> 00:35:16.800
AUDIENCE: It's like
I'm being interrogated.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.395
Hi.

00:35:17.395 --> 00:35:18.895
ROB DELANEY: Hi,
being interrogated.

00:35:18.895 --> 00:35:21.610
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious about how

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.400
you feel about all these
things from your life

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.060
that you've now written
about and kind of enshrined

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.750
in this book.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.520
I mean, it just came
out, and maybe you're

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.430
not used to reading from it
or talking about it as much.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.630
But perhaps you've used it
in your stand-up as well.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.930
How do you feel about
these pieces of your life

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:43.500
that are now becoming
kind of something else?

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.250
ROB DELANEY: Yeah.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.860
How do I feel about
personal things

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.610
that I've experienced,
aspects of my life,

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:54.354
becoming more public and,
in fact, being frozen--

00:35:54.354 --> 00:35:55.020
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.340
ROB DELANEY: --as they are?

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.798
AUDIENCE: And do
they kind of still

00:35:56.798 --> 00:35:59.832
exist in some real
way in your brain,

00:35:59.832 --> 00:36:01.560
and what is your
relationship to them now

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.643
that they're on the page,
or they're on the stage,

00:36:03.643 --> 00:36:05.490
or wherever they are?

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.830
ROB DELANEY: I do
like seeing something

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.165
that I can't monkey
with anymore.

00:36:12.165 --> 00:36:13.040
You know what I mean?

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.080
This book, these stories
are these stories.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.680
I can't really
revise them anymore.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.100
And that's kind of cool
because with stand-up you're

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.300
always doing that.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.560
And I enjoy that too,
but it's nice to have

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.670
to put something down.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.800
I read something that
Joyce Carol Oates

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.710
tweeted the other
day about how it

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:37.390
was cool to have finality with
a typewriter and ink and paper.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.130
Like when something
was done, it was done.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:42.840
And that's really
cool, and that's

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.610
a form of confinement,
stricture, finishing.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:50.670
Like I like the 140
characters of a tweet.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:52.570
Like Picasso had
his Blue Period.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.570
So it is cool.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.271
I heard a kindergarten teacher
saying-- it's like apocryphal,

00:36:56.271 --> 00:36:58.270
you've probably heard
it-- where they were like,

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.660
oh, your kids make
the best drawings.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.410
How do you do it?

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.826
And the teachers
like, I just know

00:37:01.826 --> 00:37:03.540
when to take it
away from the kids,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.748
so they don't make it a
crowded piece of kid garbage.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.390
So I do like things like
restrictions and things

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.640
being like, nope, that's done.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.880
Take it away.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.500
So just from like an artistic
perspective, I like that.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.500
But then as far as people
seeing stuff about me,

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.830
I sort of have had practice
with that, with like magazine

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.590
articles that I've
written, doing stand-up,

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.830
so having done stuff
in the public eye.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:34.050
So yeah, I'm
proprietary about it.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:34.970
That happened to me.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:35.790
That's my story.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.290
It's not anybody else's
unless they're in it.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:41.770
And I don't know.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:43.650
It made me happy just
reading these just now,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.650
and this is my first
reading since the book just

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.540
came out yesterday.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:53.420
So I just tried to approach
it all sort of compassionately

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.440
and be nice but thorough
with my history.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.410
So I don't feel
revealed or anything.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.710
Also, since a lot of stuff
is of a sensitive nature,

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.130
writing the book wasn't
really therapeutic for me

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.400
because I had waited so
long to write about things

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.650
like alcoholism,
sobriety, depression,

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.460
when I had really gone
through formal therapy

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.980
and healed to some degree
with the deadlier things.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.830
So now I don't read this
and think like, ooh, ooh.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:30.270
Whereas had I written it,
I think, irresponsibly,

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.710
which is to say maybe
seven or eight years ago,

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.760
then maybe it might have
been a little scarier

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.593
to put it out there.

00:38:35.593 --> 00:38:37.660
But I'm sort of at
peace with everything,

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.440
and this book was written
from a place of, I feel,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.760
mental health or the best
version of mental health

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.980
that I can approximate.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.090
So I don't know if I
answered your question,

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:51.260
but I did talk for a while.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.487
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:52.487 --> 00:38:53.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.300
ROB DELANEY: Thank you.

00:39:02.622 --> 00:39:03.205
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:39:03.205 --> 00:39:05.600
On Pete Holmes' "You
Made It Weird" podcast,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.764
you talked about like
this black hole of death

00:39:07.764 --> 00:39:10.180
while you were singing the
national anthem the first time,

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.160
I think.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.660
And I'm just curious,
does that keep

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.780
coming up every--
because you've done it

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.080
multiple times, from
what I understand?

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.985
ROB DELANEY: Ah, yes.

00:39:15.985 --> 00:39:16.532
Yeah.

00:39:16.532 --> 00:39:17.740
And the answer to that is no.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.620
I have sung the national anthem
at five or so Red Sox games

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.500
at Fenway Park in
five or so games.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.830
And what he's talking about,
I sang the national anthem

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.370
for the first time at
Fenway Park in 2004,

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:31.210
the year the Red Sox won the
World Series for the first time

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:32.640
in 86 years.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.860
And do I take credit for that?

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.610
A little bit.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.677
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:37.677 --> 00:39:39.260
ROB DELANEY: And the
way that happened

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.000
is I studied musical
theater in college at NYU,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.980
and I had a friend who
worked for the Red Sox.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.800
And she said, hey,
there's 180 games a year,

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.710
we can't always
get someone good.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:50.830
Could you do it one time?

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:56.510
And so I was like,
yes, and so I did it.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:40:03.160
And the public address system
at Fenway Park is 700 years old,

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.990
and so when you sing, you
hear an echo of yourself

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:12.550
because you're in a very large
place, but there's a delay.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:16.500
So you say, oh say, and then
like a second and a half

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.430
later, you hear back to
you, thundering much louder

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.980
than it came out
your body, oh say.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.557
But that's when you're
already a little bit

00:40:24.557 --> 00:40:25.640
ahead into the next thing.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.560
So you're like you're
doing a duet with yourself

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:34.420
from the past, out of rhythm,
in this like syncopated singing

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.530
what is known to be the
hardest song there is.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:41.850
Like the national anthem,
cool song, spans octaves.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.780
The reason people
screw it up, and they

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.520
pass around YouTube
videos of it,

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.410
is because it's a
hard song to sing.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.210
It's not because
they're bad or an idiot.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.510
The words don't make sense.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.710
It's just like a list of stuff--

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.729
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:54.770
ROB DELANEY: --literally.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.900
Like it's not a ballad,
where it's like, and then

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:01.610
a thing naturally happened
that makes sense from the.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.780
Literally, it's like "The
Joker" by Steve Miller

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.040
might as well be
our national anthem.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.050
So you're singing
the hardest song

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:12.630
in the world in the
most hallowed baseball

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:14.630
park in America.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.120
It's the town that I grew up in.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.890
Fully sold out, with
an echo from-- I mean,

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:21.550
it's like imagine if
somebody was like,

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:24.260
I dare you to do good
at this hard thing

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.300
while you're doing it.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.510
And so I was so nervous that
literally my vision went

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:34.100
like ppvvvvvvvvvvvvvv,
and I could see this,

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.720
and I literally disconnected.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:42.222
I totally had like a
Sufi mystical experience,

00:41:42.222 --> 00:41:44.430
where I was like-- literally,
this is what I thought.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:47.210
I was like the anthem
needs to be sung.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:50.730
I am the vessel through
which it must come to Earth.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.230
So I was like, get your ego--
I'm not singing the anthem.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.830
The anthem must be sung.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:57.410
All these people
need to hear it.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.700
So my fears mean nothing.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:03.260
I literally was like,
be a diaphanous fabric

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.090
that God can dance about.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.840
I literally was like oodolodolo.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.920
So I sang it.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.550
Don't remember it at all.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.780
And then when they cut-- OK.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.900
So I go like, and the
home of the brave,

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.740
and I went braaave, llaaarrghh.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:23.800
ROB DELANEY: But that
happens so often,

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.800
that people deflate
and like blluurgh,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.390
that they know to cut the sound.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.390
So I was like, oh, my
god, everybody heard that.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:32.086
And they were like,
nobody heard it

00:42:32.086 --> 00:42:33.960
except the sound engineer,
who was like, yep,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.890
here's the uurrrgh.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:35.675
OK, turn it off.

00:42:35.675 --> 00:42:37.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.130
ROB DELANEY: So yes, I've never.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:40.880
Oh, but now?

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.026
I can't get nervous.

00:42:43.026 --> 00:42:44.400
I could perform
it-- like I could

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.890
be being shot at in front
of a million people.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.060
I'd be like, it's
not a big deal.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.660
Like so that was good.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:55.180
That was good for my
comedy that I did that.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:55.920
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.753
ROB DELANEY: Thanks.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.030
ROB DELANEY: Well,
I guess-- hello.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:11.039
Hi.

00:43:11.039 --> 00:43:12.080
AUDIENCE: Does this work?

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.579
Yeah.

00:43:12.579 --> 00:43:14.532
Thank you for coming in
You're a great reader.

00:43:14.532 --> 00:43:15.490
ROB DELANEY: Thank you.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:16.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.630
ROB DELANEY: He said
I'm a great reader,

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.690
if you didn't hear that.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.010
AUDIENCE: I'm
wondering if you've

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.710
seen kind of the
evolution of Twitter

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.060
and all the other technology
that's coming out?

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.910
Have there been shortcomings
in those platforms

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:35.740
that you've kind of
seen that haven't

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.930
let you emphasize
your comedy enough?

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.790
You're using YouTube,
but then Vine came out,

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.490
other things like
that, that you wish

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:46.640
was an easier platform to use
to get your comedy out there?

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.390
ROB DELANEY: That's
an excellent question.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:52.560
Have I seen shortcomings in
other emerging technologies

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:58.480
that I wish I could use better,
or could just be used better,

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.130
could be implemented?

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.970
I think they're trying to do it.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.850
And this is kind of nerdy, but
I might be in the right place

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.150
to talk about that.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:09.620
From just like an
e-commerce perspective,

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.540
it might be cool for people
like me and other people

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.730
to be able-- if you could
like buy stuff within Twitter.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.562
If there was like
a shopping cart

00:44:18.562 --> 00:44:20.770
in there, that would kind
of be cool because then you

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:25.835
could be like, oh, I don't
have to go three websites away.

00:44:25.835 --> 00:44:28.500
Now that everybody
knows everything

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.380
to the point of
insanity about us,

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.572
and it's plenty easy
to share information

00:44:32.572 --> 00:44:34.280
across different
things, it would kind of

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.970
be cool if you could
be like, blooh,

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.230
now I own that thing
he was talking about

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.120
and can consume it on my
larger screen at home tonight

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.270
with my family.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.240
Of course, that'll
definitely be happening,

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.900
but that's one thing
that would be cool.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.780
Vine didn't really call to me.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:55.970
The thing I like about Twitter
is that the best tweets

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.800
are the ones that don't
have links in them

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.100
and the ones where-- because you
have to use your imagination.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.600
Like I've found that when
I would ever meet people

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.460
in real life that I knew on like
Friendster, or then Myspace,

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.290
or then Facebook,
the people that I've

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:12.140
met from social networks
before and enjoyed the most

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.722
being around are usually
people from Twitter

00:45:14.722 --> 00:45:16.180
because I think
you have to distill

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:20.630
your purist essence of who you
are into the 140 characters.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.000
So it's just sort of weird
how somebody on Facebook

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.630
can have 800 pictures
and blah, and be

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.130
like, this is the self
I wish to present.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:30.040
And it's not as
clear as somebody

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.010
who you get a sense
of from really reading

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.700
the thing that they had to
squeeze and distill and diamond

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:38.310
compress into their
little tweet box.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:39.730
So other technologies.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.070
And also, I've totally put my
eggs in the Twitter basket.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.097
So people would say to
me when Vine came out,

00:45:45.097 --> 00:45:46.180
why don't you have a Vine?

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.370
I'd be like, oh, you
know, because there's

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.510
24 hours in a day, that's
why I don't have a Vine,

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:51.885
and I would like
to pay attention

00:45:51.885 --> 00:45:53.370
to my family for
a couple of them.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:58.590
And so shortcomings?

00:45:58.590 --> 00:45:59.770
Twitter's pretty cool.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.950
Every new thing they add,
I typically don't really

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:07.740
need it because I sort of use
it in like the purest way,

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:11.190
like not linking, not whatever.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.290
But I've been pretty
satisfied with it.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.510
There are certain things.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:21.760
Like sometimes I wish there
was a built-in or natural way

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.500
for me to like figure out
who's-- I would love to have

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.190
a super "Minority Report"
dashboard for the people who

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.840
follow me so that I could be
like, so maybe these people,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.450
because why do people in
Albuquerque need to know that

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.640
I'm going to be playing
in Cincinnati that night?

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.515
You know what I mean?

00:46:35.515 --> 00:46:38.220
So geo-targeting crap
like that would be fun.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.540
But Twitter, it does
what I need it to do.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.970
Would I refine
that a little bit?

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:42.730
Yes.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:48.590
But no other website things
tickle my fancy too much.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.520
I don't feel that there's
anything that I can identify

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.040
like, oh, I wish this
existed and doesn't.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.930
Like I'm not going to invent
anything any time soon

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.360
because I'm secretly very
old fashioned, and boring,

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:05.512
and a Luddite, and don't know
how to even do what I do.

00:47:05.512 --> 00:47:06.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.230
ROB DELANEY: Thank you.

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:15.260
When I started working at the
company that invented Myspace,

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.800
like not even 18
months before that,

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.130
when I started working
there as a temp,

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.790
I had to ask somebody how to
turn my computer on for me.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.980
And they were like, and you can
just drag and drop that into.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.063
I remember after they
showed me how to turn it on,

00:47:29.063 --> 00:47:31.706
I was like, what, drag?

00:47:31.706 --> 00:47:34.110
I remember trying to not
cry, I was so nervous

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:38.300
about basic use of a computer.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.930
Yeah.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:42.590
So I think that might have
brought us full circle,

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:43.710
that one right there.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:44.270
Thank you.

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:47.082
ROB DELANEY: Well, thank
you so much, everybody.

00:47:47.082 --> 00:47:48.990
You're very kind
to come and listen.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.770
I appreciate it.

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:50.350
Thank you.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:58.367
[APPLAUSE]
