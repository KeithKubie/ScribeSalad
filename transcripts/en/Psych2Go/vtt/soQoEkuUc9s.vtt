00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.140
Suicide; the act of taking your own life.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.300
A horrific act but sadly a common occurrence.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.480
Every forty seconds, someone dies from suicide.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.600
That's one million people per year.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.500
Maybe you've never dealt with suicide directly.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.520
Maybe someone you know has attempted or committed suicide.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.760
Perhaps you have attempted suicide.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.580
whatever your experience with suicide is, it's very important to understand the signs of suicidal behavior.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.060
But please keep in mind that not every suicidal person will show these signs.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.660
In addition, seeing a single sign does not mean that the person is suicidal.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.840
The point of this video is for you to understand these signs, and work out whether the person needs a friend or professional help.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.040
Sign number one: suicidal talk.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.880
'What do you think about suicide?'

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.380
'Have you ever thought about killing yourself?'

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.960
'How would you kill yourself?'

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.680
'What do you think is the best way to commit suicide?'

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.940
Questions or phrases like these may suggest that the person is considering it.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.800
They talk about it because they want your opinion.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.860
In a way, they're asking for advise on committing suicide, while not openly admitting to it.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.440
This may also be a way they're screaming for help.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.400
Sign number two: giving away prized posessions.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.840
It's an odd occurrence when someone gives away expensive items or items they may need.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.440
In their mind, where their going they don't need material things.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.140
Giving away material possessions to loved ones

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.840
may be a way they think they're helping friends and family after their death.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.520
Sign number three: changes to their will.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.440
There are usually a number of triggering events that cause someone to write their will.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.580
These events include:

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.360
marriage, having kids, older age, starting a business, or a close loved one dying.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.320
If a person seems to want to write a will out of the blue,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.360
try asking them why they have decided to write one.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.480
Sign number four: obtaining a weapon.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.080
Of course the mere act of obtaining a weapon doesn't mean someone is suicidal,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.720
but paired with the previous signs mentioned, should serve as a warning.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.020
Especially if they don't show any signs of taking up things like:

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.920
shooting as a sport, shooting as a hobby, or gun collecting.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.780
Sign number five: strange sleeping patterns.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.840
Those strange sleeping patterns are often seen in suicidal people.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.640
It isn't the sleeping disorder that causes this.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.760
It is actually the stress or restless thoughts from personal problems that cause the person to have trouble sleeping at night.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.240
Because of that, the inability to sleep that last a long period of time

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.060
may be a clue that someone is suffering from depresion or suicidal thoughts.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.140
Sign number six: low energy.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.480
Low energy levels are often seen in people with depression,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.740
which is some times coupled with suicidal thoughts.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.240
This low energy levels happen as a result of lack of sleep

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.200
and little motivation to do activities that would actually help them feel better.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.460
Sign number seven: abusing drugs or alcohol.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.680
A study by Bruce Alexander examined the theory of drug addiction on rats.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.220
Previous studies had concluded rats to be highly motivated for addictive drugs,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.820
despite the obvious risks of begin electrocuted or the deprivation of food.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.840
Alexander challenged that notion by conducting a study of his own.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.600
He would put the rats on cages where they were free to do activities and interact with other rats.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.520
In past studies the rats were in cages alone, often with nothing to do but the addictive drug.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.960
In Alexander's study, he found the rats to rarely take the drug.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.080
The same implications can be made for humans.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.840
When humans don't feel connected to anyone, they may turn to drugs and alcohol as a form of escape.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.200
Another reason may be because they think the drug might give them enough willpower to commit suicide.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.880
Sign number eight: low motivation for social life.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.600
People who want to commit suicide often drop out of their social lives.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.060
Depressed and suicidal people often don't feel connected to others around them.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.480
As a result, they may end dropping existing friends or family, because they don't feel good enough for them.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.440
They may also see socializing as a distant unimportant thing.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.280
Sign number nine: not participating in activities they love.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.680
Seen in depression as well, suicidal people find no interest in activities they love anymore.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.800
Nothing seems to matter and their interest is diminished.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.360
Sign number ten: self-harm.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.460
Self-harm is one of the biggest signs that someone might be suicidal.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.940
Examples of this include cutting, burning, and poisoning oneself.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.400
In a sense, it's a way that suicidal people test the waters to see if they actually have what it takes to commit suicide.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.560
Former self-harmers often say that the physical pain helps them escape the emotional one.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.440
Sign number ten: risky behaviour.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.360
Studies have shown that suicidal people tend to take more risks.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.080
Look out for signs such as driving recklessly or picking fights.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.200
Sign number eleven: emotional outbursts.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.240
Look for unexplained emotional reactions to certain things people have said in their presence.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.960
It might make no sense to you why this words are triggering such an emotional response,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.020
but it could be words that remind them of a traumatic event in their life.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.400
Sign number twelve: body language.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.160
This is a very general sign,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.980
but paired with the previous signs could be a good clue of depression and suicidal thoughts.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.000
Look for body language such as: slump shoulders, staring at the floor, and unwillingness to make eye contact

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.120
Sign number thirteen: past suicide attempts.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.480
The number one and most obvious sign that someone might be suicidal, is if they have a history of attempting it in the past.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.760
This is called suicidal tendencies.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.780
One thing people don't understand about depression  is that it's not easily cured by a pill.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.480
A sudden stop of medication may trigger a worse wave of depression, that will lead to another suicide attempt.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.520
Sign number fourteen: happiness and calmness.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.480
This sign is hard to spot, because you might be under the impression that the person is doing better.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.400
A misconception about depression is that the lowest point,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.340
you know, when they're really sad and in bed in ones life, is what causes this person to commit suicide.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.660
What actually happens at this point is that the person is unwilling to do anything.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.760
They are at such a low point that they are unwilling to eat, watch TV or partake in their favorite activities

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.000
Their days are spent mostly in bed.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.060
Committing suicide actually takes energy and planning, so this happens just above the lowest point.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.520
When they have the energy to think clearly and execute it.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:14.320
Just before the suicide, family members or closed friends who where in contact with the victim, have even reported seeing them happy and calm.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.040
This is because the suicidal person has finalized their plan, and thinks they can finally escape the pain of this world.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.880
So those were the fourteen signs someone may be suicidal.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.480
Now again, keep in mind that a single sign doesn't necessarily means someone thinks about hurting themselves.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.280
In the comments below, I wanna know what other signs you think we missed.
