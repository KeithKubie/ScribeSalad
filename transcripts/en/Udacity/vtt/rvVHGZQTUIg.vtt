00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.390
Did you write down the truth values for
these two formulas, David?

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.130
&gt;&gt; I did.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.494
And on the one on the left,

00:00:05.494 --> 00:00:08.656
we find it's little bit easier
because it starts with A and,

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:13.460
which means anytime A is false, we can
go ahead and write that this is false.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.990
When A is true, that means we can ignore
it and evaluate solely based on B or C.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.960
Whenever either of them is true,
the result is true.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.540
And only when both of them are false,
is the result false.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.690
So the one on the right is a little
bit more complicated because for

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.350
each of them we need to look
at both A and B and A and C.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.030
But because there's an or in the middle,
that means that once we discover that

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.600
one of them is true, we don't need
to really worry about the other one.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.880
A and B is true whenever both A and
B are true, and so A and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.970
B are true here and here, meaning we can
go ahead and say that those are true.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.310
We don't need to look at A and C here.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.430
Similarly, A and C are true here.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.860
So we can go ahead and
say that this one is true as well.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.500
For all the ones at the bottom,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.515
A is false which means it's going to
go ahead and render both of them false.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.525
And for the fourth one,
B and C are both false,

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:03.205
meaning each individually
is going to become false.

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:06.465
So what we see here is that the truth
values for these two formulas actually

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.815
end up the same, so
I guess they're equivalent as well.

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:09.325
&gt;&gt; Good, David.

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:12.275
So this property's called
the distributive property.

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.750
The distributive property says that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.830
these two formulas have
the same truth values.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.850
And in particular, if there is B and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.450
C inside the parentheses with
a disjunction between them, and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.960
A is outside the parentheses
with a conjunction between them,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.490
then we can move A inside
the parentheses by first writing A and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.730
B and then writing A and C and
taking the disjunction of the two.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.770
&gt;&gt; We can also think of this as
distributing the part outside

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.940
of both the predicate and the operator
into both the ones on the inside.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.490
We take the A and
apply it to B, so A and B.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.315
We take the A and
apply it to C, so A and C.

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:50.900
And we preserve the operator
in between B and

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.950
C in between the two new parenthesis.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.670
So if this had been A or B or C,
this would become A or B, or B or C.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.480
This would become A and B and C and
would be all the operators here.
