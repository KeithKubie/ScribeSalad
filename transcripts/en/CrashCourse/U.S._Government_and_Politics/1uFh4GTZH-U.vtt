00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.600
Hi, I’m Craig, and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics and today I am going

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.139
to talk to you about something the affects
almost everybody, jobs. Unless you are very

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.789
lucky or very unlucky, at some point in your
life, you will probably have a job and more

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.700
likely than not, you will be employed by someone
else. The big boss. The person who tells you

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.180
what to do. Stan, are you my boss? I’m more
of a contractor.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.590
The rules about what employers can and can’t
do are very complicated and changing all the

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.310
time, but one thing they are not allowed to do is
discriminate against certain groups of people. Probably

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.310
the largest group protected from discrimination
is the one we are going to talk about today, women.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:43.080
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.399
So, before we get into the nitty gritty of
the employment discrimination against women,

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.130
we need to go back a little and explain the
middle level of Supreme Court Review. Helpfully

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.760
called intermediate scrutiny, not Mitzy scrutiny,
as I would like to call it. It’s kind of

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.110
hard to define, but as the name suggests intermediate
scrutiny is more stringent than rational basis

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.539
review, where the government usually wins
and its actions are allowed to stand, and

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.570
strict scrutiny where the government usually
loses.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.320
So that’s about as helpful as I can get
in terms of letting you know what the outcome

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.080
of a case will be when courts apply intermediate
scrutiny. It’s more useful for you to know

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.820
when intermediate scrutiny applies and that’s
mainly in cases involving women. Now, hold

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.630
on. I know many of you are saying “I know
that women are often discriminated again for

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.930
being women so what makes them different from
other groups that face discrimination like

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.500
black people or Jewish people or at least
in the past, Irish people.” All of the groups

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.920
I just mentioned have one common characteristic,
at least where the courts are concerned. And

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.010
this is that the thing that makes them a discrete
group is something that they can’t change.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.670
Now, current ideas about sex and gender make
this characterization more problematic than

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.520
the Supreme Court likes to think, but Supreme
Court justices weren’t always the most progressive.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.330
Also problematic is religion, since we are
free to adopt or discard religion as we want.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.729
But, I guess that since religion is specifically
mentioned in the first amendment and that

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.119
when the court decided on its categories,
religious discrimination was more prevalent

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.619
than it is now. That’s why religion is included as a
category that will trigger the court to take a closer look.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.780
But, given the way that the court tends to look at these things, you’d think that sex, by which I mean male

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.760
and female, would be the kind of thing that would
put you in a specific group that might be subject

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.460
to discrimination based on that group identity, right?

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.250
Well, probably, but the court’s key reasoning
here has to do with the fact that racial,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.560
religious and ethnic groups are almost always
minorities. And women statistically, at least, are not.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.580
For the courts, majority groups have
a good chance of winning in the legislative

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.360
process and therefore they don’t need the same
level of judicial protection as minority groups.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.459
Still, there’s been some recognition,
that despite there non-minority numbers, women

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.069
have still historically been treated unequally
to men. Let’s just come right out and say

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.889
that they have been given inferior status.
And because of this a law or government action

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.459
that specifically mentions or is aimed at
women will cause the court to look more carefully

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.980
than when women aren’t mentioned but less
carefully than when religious, ethnic, or

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.769
racial minorities are mentioned and that’s
intermediate scrutiny.

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.129
So, the 14th amendment guarantees equal protection
of the laws but most of the actual rules against

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.299
discrimination come out of the federal civil
rights act of 1964 and various state anti-discrimination

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.699
statutes. This is one of the most far reaching
and important pieces of federal legislation

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.379
ever and its history is fascinating, but we’re
not going to get too much into it here, because

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.409
this isn’t a History class, this is Government.
Sometimes, we talk about history, but not

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.230
now, ok? The important thing is that it outlawed
discrimination against race, religion, ethnicity,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.760
or sex in a whole bunch of situations, including
public accommodations and transportation and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.299
most important employment. The key section
of the civil rights act dealing with employment

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.949
is title 7, if you’ll excuse the legal language,
the most relevant part of the statute is this:

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.319
[A] EMPLOYER PRACTICES. It shall be an unlawful
employment practice for an employer [1] To

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.489
fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any
individual, or otherwise to discriminate against

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.069
any individual with respect to his compensation,
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.529
because of such individual's race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin; or [2]

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.650
To limit, segregate, or classify his employees
or applicants for employment in any way which

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.219
would deprive or tend to deprive any individual
of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.059
affect his status as an employee, because
of such individual’s race, color, religion,

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:51.599
sex, or national origin.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.909
Despite all the legal language, that seems
pretty straight forward. Unfortunately, it’s

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.319
a lot easier to say what an unlawful employment
practice is than it is to prove that your

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.519
employer is doing it. This is where we again
have to get legalistic and explain how discrimination

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.400
claims work their way through the courts.
Let’s also get Thought Bubbleistic.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.249
So, let’s say you feel you’ve been discriminated
against at work by your employer. What can

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.819
you do? At least under federal law. First,
you have to be in a protected class as defined

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.549
by the law, which means that you’ll need
to show that the discrimination was based

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.209
on your race, color, religion, sex, or national
origin. Now, sometimes this’ll be easy to

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.530
prove. Like in a case where you’re employer
says, I’d give you a promotion if you weren’t

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.639
black, or gee, I’m sorry to let you go,
but you know you’re a woman and we can’t

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.720
have too many women working here. This happens
almost never because most people aren’t

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.080
that bigoted or that stupid, but it does happen
and if you have this kind of statement and

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.370
witnesses to back it up, you have a pretty
good chance of winning. The more common cases

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.930
are those where nobody who is a member of
a minority group or a woman gets promoted or

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.220
members of those groups are disproportionately fired.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.620
Say if the company has 90 white employees
and 10 black employees, and when they lay

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.830
off 10% of the work force, 9 black workers
are fired and only 1 white one is. This is

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.720
called a disparate impact and if this happens,
new court procedures kick in. If you are in

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.220
a protected class and feel that you are a
victim of disparate impact discrimination

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.710
and you can show that your employer’s action
has the effect of exclusion, then the burden

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.680
of proof, which normally is with the party
making the complaint, you, in this case, shifts

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.310
to your employer, who then has to prove that
his actions were caused by a business necessity.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.280
I can’t imagine there would be a business
necessity for firing 90% of your black work

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.599
force. If the employer is able to show that
he was forced by business necessity to fire

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.919
most of his black employees, then burden shifts
again back to the plaintiff to show that the

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.080
employer’s reasons are untrue. That they
are just pretext and the action was really

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.469
taken because the employees were in the
protected group.

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.000
Much of the evidence to show this will probably
be statistical and it may be hard to get,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.020
which points out a crucial thing about discrimination
claims. They are hard to prove. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.820
By now, I’ll bet many of you are 
Craig! I thought you said you were going to

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.340
focus mainly on women, but the discrimination you’ve
been describing applies to all sorts of protected groups!

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.740
Eagles are a protected species, but that’s
different. So, women are protected against

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.419
adverse employment actions by federal and
state legislation, but they are also protected

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.030
against sexual harassment in the work place,
this might not seem like discrimination right

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.270
away, but if you think of discrimination as
negative treatment based on one’s membership

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.680
in a specific group, then it starts to make
sense. It makes even more sense when you read

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.300
about some of the things that women have had to go
through at work that have led to discrimination cases.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.260
I’m not going to go into graphic
detail, but it’s pretty horrible.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.490
You should that there are two types of sexual
harassment,  quid pro quo and hostile workplace

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.759
environment. Quid pro quo harassment is when
an employer or withholds workplace benefits

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.579
like promotions in exchange for sexual favors.
This is obviously wrong and terrible.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.320
Hostile Work Environment is a bit trickier because
it can be the result of other employees and

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.110
not necessarily an employer, but courts have
ruled that it is an employer’s responsibility

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.719
to ensure that the workplace is friendly to
all employees.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.069
I said I wasn’t going to get graphic, but
I think one example might help to understand

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.759
what sorts of things constitute workplace
sexual harassment. In the case of Burlington

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:38.199
vs. Ellerth, Kim Ellerth was subject numerous
unwanted advances from her supervisor.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.280
In one of her conversations with the supervisor,
he denied her request on a relatively inconsequential

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.909
business matter, but added, “are you wearing
shorter skirts yet Kim, because it would make

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:48.999
your job a whole heck of a lot easier.”
That’s just disgusting and no one should

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.729
have to endure those kinds of remarks at work.
Ellerth won her suit against Burlington and

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.249
I’m going to stop on that relatively cheerful
note. It’s important that we have an understanding

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.909
of workplace discrimination, because most
of us will spend time working and since some

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:03.810
of us will be employers, we should have an
idea of how to behave and what is that about.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.539
Women do get some special treatment under
the law, a reflection of the fact that they

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:10.219
have historically been, and continue to be
singled out for mistreatment. The laws and

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.719
courts have recognized this which is why women
receive legal protections from discrimination.

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:17.259
But women have made some gains which is probably
a result of their increasing presence in the

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.069
workplace and power as voters. And if their
strides for greater equality on the job and

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.259
elsewhere continue, I’d say that’s a very
good thing.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:25.810
It’d be nice if someday there was no need
for a heightened level of scrutiny when it

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.479
comes to laws concerning women, but we’re
not there yet, so the fact that anti-discrimination

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:34.019
laws and intermediate scrutiny exist is also a good
thing. Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next week.
