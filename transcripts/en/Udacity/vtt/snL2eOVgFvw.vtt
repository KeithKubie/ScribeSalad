In the Bismark Project at Georgia Tech, which you can go check

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.300
out at http://projectbismark.net, we've done some

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.930
measurements of Comcast PowerBoosts in different

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.740
home networks. Here are some real world examples of PowerBoost's traffic shaping

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.730
profile in four different home networks, each with a different cable modem

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.260
as shown in the caption. You can see that different homes

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.420
exhibit different shaping profiles. Some have

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.150
a very steady pattern whereas others

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.110
have a more erratic pattern. Interestingly you can see in some cases

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.389
that there appear to be two different tiers of higher throughput rates.
