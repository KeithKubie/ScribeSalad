When Triple 8 first started in 2004, we had fewer than 20 dancers, but this year we have 47 dancers,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.380 position:98%
Rui Cheng:
so Triple 8 has really grown as a group, and we've grown in so many other ways as well.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.000 position:59%

Rui Cheng:
Our theme, "Phases," is more than just a sum of our pieces. The theme represents the changing

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.159 position:98%
Rui Cheng:
nature of our company itself, and it's also a tribute to those who helped our dance company

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.000 position:97%
Rui Cheng:
grow into the group we are today. We hope you'll join us in experiencing phases.
