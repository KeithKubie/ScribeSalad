Intro
These days, every movie fan knows the one

00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:13.880
word that can spell disaster, or pull of a
miracle:&nbsp;reshoots. But reshoots are a lot

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.730
more common than you might think. And even
if some tend to be exaggerated, there are

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.450
plenty of hit movies that really WERE drastically
changed due to studio concerns, or saved by

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.509
a director's second pass. Here are 10 Movies
Completely Transformed By Reshoots.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.320
Thor: The Dark World
It may not be Marvel's biggest hit, but ask

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.260
fans of the second Thor movie what saved the
day, and they'll probably agree it had a lot

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.559
to do with Tom Hiddleston's Loki playing a
major role. From the opening scenes that pick

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.129
up right after Avengers, to Loki's impression
of Captain America, he made sure to deliver

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.899
the best laughs, and help set off the ultra-stoic
Thor. But nearly all of those scenes were

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.149
added for fear it was getting a bit dry - and
were just a few of the many action scenes

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.929
heightened to keep things moving.
I Am Legend

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.219
It might be the most famous example of a re-shot
ending that actually got things completely

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.000
wrong. The original ending for this tale of
a vampie-zombie apocalypse was a shocker,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.370
revealing that the monsters weren't just intelligent,
but willing to let the hero live if he returned

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.730
the leader's mate. But that ending - which
saw mankind basically drop down the food chain

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.780
- got the studio nervous. Instead, an ending
was reshot to have the hero find a cure, then

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.120
blow everyone up. Basically, the opposite
message - and an ending few fans would actually

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.580
have chosen.
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.450
George Miller relied on action and landscapes,
more than dialogue to build his post-apocalyptic

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.340
world, and - no surprise - the studio had
a hard time seeing what he did. Once he turned

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.920
in his first cut, Warner Bros. was blown away.
So impressed, they agreed to give Miller the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.670
extra money needed to film the scenes from
the script that they had forced him to cut:

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.380
the opening and closing sequences set in Immortan
Joe's massive Citadel. It's hard to imagine

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.270
the film without those landmarks, which is
probably a sign that the studio made the right

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.210
call, giving Miller the reshoots needed to
bring his ENTIRE vision to life.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.680
World War Z
There was a time when the Brad Pitt zombie

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.030
thriller was marketed as the first of a franchise...
but all that changed when the movie started

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.850
nearing its big conclusion. While most of
the movie was a character drama, the original

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.970
ending would have sent Pitt's character into
a massive zombie battle in Russia, before

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.210
he made it to the Siberian coast, and set
out with medieval weaponry to rescue his family

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.099
in America. The studio got cold feet, and
shut down production completely. In the end,

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.769
a completely different, smaller, and&nbsp;cheaper&nbsp;third
act was written and shot.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.609
Superman 2
Director Richard Donner's Superman is hailed

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.700
by many as the best film version the world
has seen, so it was no surprise the studio

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.420
chose to film its sequel back-to-back to cut
costs. But the legendary director was at odds

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.519
with the producers from the start. So when
Superman became a hit, they cut him loose,

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.069
figuring he was no longer needed. Richard
Lester was brought in to replace him, and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.230
began re-shooting nearly the entire movie
to remove Donner's directing credit. The dumb

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.099
jokes are a sign of the humor Lester went
for, but fans still wonder what could have

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.040
been...
Back to the Future

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.900
There's a difference between reshooting scenes
and reshooting a&nbsp;movie&nbsp;- and Back to the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.050
Future was practically the latter. Director
Robert Zemeckis knew as soon as the cameras

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.499
started rolling that Eric Stoltz, cast as
Marty McFly, wasn't the right kind of funny

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.730
for the movie's tone. But knowing Michael
J. Fox's schedule wouldn't be open for weeks,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.980
they kept on rolling - doing their best to
shoot around Stoltz so Fox's shots could be

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.829
inserted later. When he became available,
the switch was made - along with movie history.

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.810
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
The modern reboot of the classic comic mutants

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.310
took a crazy twist on the villain Shredder,
but would you believe that he almost wasn't

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.700
included in the movie? The original version
of the movie used business mogul Eric Sacks

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.930
as the Shredder hiding in plain sight, but
when fans flipped over Iron Man 3 revealing

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.390
a fake Mandarin, the producers realized they
were basically pulling the same twist. Reacting

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.480
fast, the new Shredder was added, and fans
were none the wiser.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.760
Fantastic Four
There are times when reshoots can hurt a movie,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.129
and times when they just plain ruin it. That's
probably the case with Josh Trank's "Fantastic

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.879
Four" reboot, with the first trailer promising
a blend of sci-fi and horror in a genre filled

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.640
with popcorn action. The first act of the
movie follows through, but soon after, the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.050
changes and reshoots reported to be demanded
by Fox start to show. It's hard to know if

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.499
Trank gave star Kate Mara the fakest wig we've
ever seen for her reshoots so fans could tell

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.269
how far the film strayed (you can use all
kinds of clips from the third act, because

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.349
it's all wig). Trank and the cast have all
claimed the original cut was the better one,

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.970
which means we'll probably never get to see
it.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.950
Finding Nemo
Okay, so you can't technically reshoot a CG

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.550
animated film, but Pixar's insane hit Finding
Nemo could have turned out completely different,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.490
since the role of Marlin - Nemo's dad, and
the movie's star - was originally completely

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.320
voiced by actor William H. Macy. Pixar's bosses
sensed it wasn't quite working, and Albert

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.110
Brooks was brought in instead. Since Brooks'
performance is a major reason the film works

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.569
as well as it does, Macy's role, no matter
how good, would have resulted in a different

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.910
star, and a different movie.
Men in Black

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.199
Everyone knows the movie's story, but it changed
even after key scenes had been filmed. For

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.320
starters, the two aliens who meet on Earth
to make sure the "galaxy on Orion's belt"

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.210
is safe? They were originally enemy races,
trading the galaxy to end an ancient war between

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.190
them - with the movie's villain wanting it
to continue. When the story changed, the entire

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.080
scene - performed in English - was dubbed
over in alien, with completely different subtitles.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.320
It's also a talking pug who lays out the plot
- the new one, since his lines were completely

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.870
re-written after the scenes had been shot.
BONUS:

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.379
Suicide Squad/Rogue One
Just because a movie has yet to be released,

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.090
that doesn't mean fans aren't ready to shout
disaster or just celebrate. When DC's Batman

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.069
V Superman took hits from critics over its
dark, not-so-fun story, one word of reshoots

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.340
on Suicide Squad was all some needed to call
it damage control, claiming new scenes were

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.919
being filmed to lighten the mood and add humor.
The cast and director laughed off that story,

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.050
claiming the studio was so impressed, they'd
been given the chance to add even more action

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.860
- meaning the bad news was... good, actually.
The same happened when Star Wars: Rogue One

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.349
added reshoots, with claims that half the
movie was being remade and rewritten, and

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.991
director Gareth Edwards replaced - all shot
down just as soon as they were made. We'll

00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:57.960
just have to wait and see...
Those are just a handful of movies that prove

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.720
a director's second shot at delivering a hit
can be exactly what's needed, or all it takes

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.669
to kill any chance it ever had. The producers
and directors behind the decision seem to

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.400
be right as often as they're wrong, but can
you think of some examples that we've overlooked?
