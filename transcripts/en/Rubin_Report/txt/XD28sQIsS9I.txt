Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04          joining me today is the editor of human progress dot Oregon, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Global Liberty and prosperity. Marion Tupe. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me. I am very excited to have you on. Uh, we've met once before, uh, for, uh, dinner. Uh, but what you're doing with human progress I think is just spectacular. You guys are actually promoting good news. There is actual good news and good things happening in the world and it seemingly a is something that people don't often talk about. So I think you're doing great work and we're going to spend an hour talking about a lot of the good stuff that is happening. Uh, but I always like to start with a little bio on people. So, uh, tell me a little bit about yourself. How'd you end up working for human progress?

Speaker 3:          00:53          Well, I was bullying, uh, behind the iron curtain and what it was then a communist Czechoslovakia. And so, uh, from early age I started to understand the importance of political and economic freedom. Oh, we hit neither, um, in regular and it pretty quick, Huh? That's right. And then, uh, when the wall came down in 1999, uh, me and my parents, uh, went for Christmas in Vienna. That was the first time that you could actually leave your country and you could travel abroad, uh, as a family. Uh, how old were you at the time? I was 13. Um, uh, because before then, uh, people still could travel to the west, but they would keep the, the, the, the children behind as far as stitches. But now that the wall came down and comes in, collapsed, you could travel anywhere he wanted. So we decided to go to Vienna. And the moment that we crossed the border into a Western capitalist liberal democracy, uh, it was like stepping out of a black and white movie into a, a color film. Uh, everything was just so much beautiful, so much more beautiful. Um, the shops were full, people were smiling, that was color everywhere. And, uh, so I think that even at that early stage of my life, I started to think about what makes countries rich, what makes countries poor. And that's, I think where my interest in, uh, in, in all of that started. Really.

Speaker 2:          02:24          Yeah. Tell me a little bit about your, your education.

Speaker 3:          02:27          Well, I, uh, went to high school and a undergraduate in Johannesburg, South Africa of all places, uh, because, uh, when the wall came down and my parents emigrated to, to South Africa, they are medical doctors. And so with our expertise was, was needed. Um, so as a kid I got to see both the fall of communism and also the fall of apartheid, which is kind of a unique experience. And, um, I'm very glad I had the kind of childhood or upbringing I had. Um, and uh, so I, so I finished my undergraduate at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and then I went to do my master's and my phd at Saint Andrews in Scotland. Um, yeah. Well, what's it like being in these places when something is falling like communism or apartheid? Because we seem to live in a time right now where a lot of people think that we're watching parts of the west kind of fall.

Speaker 3:          03:23          And you, you've seen some stuff fall. Yes, I think that, uh, for the vast, vast majority of the population in Czechoslovakia, clearly the fall of communism was a tremendous blessing. There was immense amount of optimism, um, about the future and also unavoidable disappointment with some aspects of the Utopian future that people have imagined. Nonetheless. Um, just about anybody who analyzes economics and politics in central and eastern Europe over the last 25 years concludes that people are much, much better off than they used to be. And I think the similar thing was happening for a vast majority of South Africans, especially black South Africans who never had a vote, who never had political rights or most political rights and are partied. And of course, in 1994, um, so Africa held its first multiracial democratic elections. And as a consequence, there was also a tremendous amount of optimism, again, followed by the inevitable disappointments as reality set in.

Speaker 3:          04:26          And nonetheless, it's an extraordinary time of enthusiasm and optimism and tremendous, I think, um, sense of brotherhood between people. Yeah. Do you think that's necessary? That sort of Utopian vision of when things are changing that everything is going to be magically fixed and better. And then as you're saying, then there's that period where you go, oh, it didn't, everything didn't magically get fixed at once, but you sort of need that vision to get there. You sort of need that to kind of see in the distance. I think you appeal to a Utopian vision of the future as you consolidate, uh, democracy, uh, in, in, in the case of, um, in the case of Eastern Europe and as you consolidate multiracial democracy in the case of, uh, in the case of South Africa, but ultimately utopianism is the great enemy of, uh, of, of human progress. Uh, because I think that human progress needs to be, needs to be measured in terms of the past rather than some sort of a utopian future. Human progress is an incremental, uh, process, um, where you are trying to decide, okay, is today better than yesterday? And if so, that is progress. Um, but the problems are going to be with us forever. The question is, are we actually improving incrementally in important areas of human wellbeing on daily basis? Is that one of the, with how we

Speaker 2:          05:58          ingest news? Because I was telling you before we started, like I went on human progress this morning and it feels good to me. I mean, the layout of the site is great and you and the images and the colors and all that, but like seeing so many consistently good things trending that you don't see anywhere else. And we're going to, we're going to get into many of them. Is that just, is it hard to get clicks because people don't like the, Oh, things are a little better than yesterday and a little and the long trends when they just want the day to day craziness and headlines and all that.

Speaker 3:          06:32          Yes. Uh, I, I wouldn't be the first one to point to the nature of news. Uh, the fact that news is about things that happen as Steven pinker who always likes to say, you know, there is no journalist standing in the middle of a city that he's at peace saying, you know, I'm here in a Luanda the capital of, um, whatever it is a on goal, I think. Um, and there is no civil war. Uh, you know, journalists go to places where terrible things happen and they report on those things. And so that gives a secured image of what is happening in the world. If it bleeds, it leads. I mean, that is, that is a well known phenomenon combined with the nature of the social media. Certainly I think that, um, uh, Twitter and uh, and, and smartphones, uh, make terrible things immediate and intimate. So, uh, you know, we were able to watch tsunami in Japan in real time. We saw destruction and death of thousands of people in real time, whereas, you know, a couple of decades, a few decades ago, and certainly few centuries ago, you would never have known that a terrible thing has happened on the other side of the world.

Speaker 2:          07:55          Does that complicate your work? Do you think that that people get information so quickly that then maybe are making misjudgments because they're not looking at the sort of long view of history?

Speaker 3:          08:05          I'm not sure if it complicates things because pessimism is part of human nature. Um, it's, uh, it also enables us to, to, to respond, uh, to these stories in a quicker time, uh, to be able to say, uh, on our website at least. Look, it is true that there was, in this particular case, um, tsunami and people have died. But look at the longterm trends in terms of, uh, people dying and property being damaged due to extreme weather events or natural catastrophes. And the train is, the trend is declining. So we are also able to use the social media to, to respond to it. Um, the, the, the problem is that good news doesn't get picked up, uh, as often as the bad news because the bad news leads, uh, the, the good news doesn't, yeah. And there's just a psychological component. There might be an evolutionary reason we focus on the bad things maybe for survival or something to that effect.

Speaker 3:          09:13          Yes. I'm John tooby and [inaudible] cousin. He dies from University of, uh, is it southern California? At Santa Barbara? Yeah. Um, they are, uh, they are the pioneers of, uh, of evolutionary biology. Uh, they believe that our brains have evolved, um, in, uh, at a time in tens of thousands of years ago when the world was just a much more inhospitable place than what it is today. Um, the world where there was omnipresent danger from, uh, other tribes from wild animals, from poisonings, um, and, um, um, at a time when life expectancy was very low. And, uh, they like to say that our modern skulls house and shunned minds and we, and, and the kind of psychological responses that we have evolved for tens a thousands of years ago, um, are difficult to apply to modernity, which is just so fundamentally different than what it was until relatively recently. The, the, the key period here in time history is the last 200 to 250 years when the world really has changed beyond all recognition.

Speaker 3:          10:36          So in a weird way, are we almost, we as humans, are we almost victims of our own success? I mean, that's sort of what it sounds like. Like we've, we've done so much good. We have advanced so far that now were we mitt picco about little things constantly and think they're massive when, yeah, we're not dying of mass. We're, we're doing a lot with disease, which we're going to get two and, and a whole bunch of other things. We've made our lives way safer and extended our lives and all of these things. So we're almost a victim of all of that. Goodness. Yes. So from an evolutionary perspective, again, the research of others, not my own overreaction to a potentially bad thing happening head, a lower cost to the organism, in this case, a human being than under reaction. Um, if you overreacted, uh, saw something that may have been potentially harmful, you all reacted to it, but, but you survived.

Speaker 3:          11:36          Whereas if you under reacted to something that was potentially harmful, then, uh, your gene pool ended right there and then, yeah. So those genes that didn't get passed on, so yeah. So, so yes. Um, um, the complexity of the modern economy, um, the complexity of the social interactions, um, global trading system for example, is, uh, certainly, um, uh, much greater than what our ancestors were exposed to. And so it is, um, perhaps not surprising that a lot of people are, um, uh, little be a little bit uneasy or continue to be uneasy. Then again, the website is there to show people precisely how bad things were before and how good things are now. So don't get depressed, um, too much. Um, there is a good story to be told about humanity. Yeah, it's interesting when I go speak at colleges, one of the lines that I think does actually work with young people who are, you know, if they're protesting and they're screaming about the patriarchy and evils of capitalism and all of this stuff, I'll always say to them, you know, does anyone in this room not have it better than their grandparents?

Speaker 3:          12:50          And certainly in the United States, but if you live in the western world, basically everybody does pretty much. I've yet to find someone that doesn't. And I always think that's really effective way of getting people who, who are so focused on the negative to go, oh, something good must have happened. Because, you know, even though I like to, to scream about my victim hood, it's a lot better than what my grandparents had. Yes. I mean take, uh, something like, uh, like a women's equality or gay quality or even caring about the environment and uh, and um, uh, and animal rights or animal welfare, I should say. Um, Jonathan Heit from, uh, um, New York University says that capitalism actually fundamentally transforms, uh, our, uh, sense of values. Um, um, because or priorities I should maybe say, because when we are extremely poor, uh, which is to say the first 99.9% of Homo sapiens on earth, right?

Speaker 3:          13:57          Um, uh, the, the, the primary objective of any individual human being was, was to survive. You had to somehow get hold of enough calories to make it to the next day. You had to somehow avoid being murdered by somebody who wanted your stuff. Yeah. Um, uh, you had to somehow protect your family. You had to keep away from cold, from heat, et cetera. But in the last 200 years or so, our incomes have skyrocketed. Uh, the world is roughly speaking, adjusted for inflation. I can't say this often enough because we'll always have that, oh God, you're not adjusting for that course. We are adjusting for inflation adjusted for inflation. The World Everage is roughly 12 times better off than what it was in, uh, in 1820. So we have become much richer. And when you no longer have to worry about things like survival, you start caring about things, uh, like, um, the nature of the society that you live in.

Speaker 3:          15:01          Uh, the fairness of treatment of your fellow human beings. Uh, you start caring about women equality, as I said, you'll start caring about gay rights. You start caring about animal protection and environmental protection. So, um, uh, so in that sense, um, the, the, the tremendous increase in incomes and, and general wealth of this society has also contributed to creating and much fairer and much more egalitarian society. So capitalism isn't all evil is now what you're telling me. People who think Adelson, Sh, uh, is evil. I, I highly recommend that they visit Cuba. They visit Venezuela, either visited North Korea in countries which have, which have taken deliberately a step in the opposite direction. Um, capitalism has its problems. Uh, liberal democracy has his problems and it is our task to try to fix these problems on the margins. Uh, but to throw out the economic and social underpinnings of modernity, of this, of this extraordinary age of abundance, uh, would be a mistake.

Speaker 3:          16:15          Are you shocked at the amount of people in the West that seemingly want to do just that? Um, no. Uh, I'm much, I'm not in a shocked by the fact that in eastern Europe where I'm from, um, uh, people who are in their early teens and into the late teens, p people who have never experienced communists and people who are born after the fall of the Berlin Wall are now embracing socialist ideas, or at least those socialist ideas are now increasingly popular amongst young people. Which day, which is certainly our, and amongst people of my generation. What do you chalk that up to you? Cause I don't think it's just that they didn't experience is it, is it, is it, is it just that Utopian dream that we all have or is it just that it all sounds good? The endless cry of equality, which of course it never turns out to be equality.

Speaker 3:          17:09          It all is just, if you don't want to really deeply think about a system or then communism or socialism is, is pretty good. Well, not to say that, uh, that every generation needs to be educated in the benefits of freedom. And I think that even filing fighters, we're talking about something about, uh, you know, uh, we are always one generation away from, from tyranny. Now what that meant was to say that there is something perhaps in human nature, um, that drags us back into that, um, into that tribal socialistic mindset. Now, there are a lot of theories about that. One possible theory is that actually as we grow up, we grow up in a, uh, in the only functioning communist, a communist society or communist institution, which is the family. Hmm. Um, in a family, especially a nuclear family, uh, people share wildly. Um, children are not expected to, uh, earn a, their breakfast, uh, by, uh, um, um, I dunno, bringing home the Bacon or whatever, you know, things get chair very, very equally and so forth.

Speaker 3:          18:28          And, and that can work, um, on a, on a sort of nuclear family level, the further you go, the less it works. I mean, what you are prepared to do for your children is not the same, which you are prepared to do for your cousins. It's not the same what you are prepared to do for your second cousins, for your fellow citizens and for that matter, for people on the opposite side of the world. And so, uh, the, the, the fact that we are able to conduct our affairs, um, uh, on, on a, uh, along these, along these socialist lines, uh, in, in nuclear family, um, doesn't then translate into, into the society as a whole. So that may be one reason. Another reason may be that, that, um, um, there is some within human beings within human psychology, a tendency to want to bring down people who have gotten too far up.

Speaker 3:          19:26          If you're thinking about tribal society, uh, or, or these roaming groups of hunter gatherers of say, between 50 and 150 people, um, where everybody, uh, you didn't want all the women and all the food to be monopolized by the one alpha male. So the, usually there was some sort of a combination of, of an alliance made by other males to bring this up on the hill down. So there would be a greater sharing. And, and that was good for the Alpha male too, right? I mean, he wanted to survive himself and if he survived it, it's all right. I mean, I mean in, in, uh, amongst the chimps and, uh, uh, so forth. The, the Alpha male that's usually and very poorly. Um, so that may be another reason and other reasons maybe that, uh, in the hunter gathering society, some of the food would be shared equally.

Speaker 3:          20:23          There was, for example, if you killed an animal, uh, there was no refrigeration. You couldn't store it. There wasn't no accumulation of wealth in that sense. Uh, and so things did get shared amongst the members of the group. Uh, plus there wasn't no accumulation of wealth because, um, because you are constantly moving, so whatever your acquired was limited to whatever you were able to carry on the back, on your back. Yeah. Um, so yes, the differences between people, um, at least to the extent that we are experiencing now, uh, is something that is probably quite new from an evolutionary standpoint. So all of these reasons, um, ensure that, um, and, and many more ensure that young people or rather every generation needs to be explicitly educated in why, uh, the economy that we have today, which is so different from what our ancestors have experienced is actually good for us.

Speaker 3:          21:22          Free trade is a very good example. Um, uh, free trade contributes to economic growth, and yet, uh, um, every generation you have a new push for protectionism. Again, the complexity of the economy has outpaced our ability to understand it without explicit learning. Yeah. All right. So let's talk about a whole bunch of these trends that are happening right in front of our eyes, but as you said, they're happening incrementally, so people don't necessarily focus on them enough. Uh, well, I'll let you kick off the person. What do you, what do you think is the most encouraging worldwide trend at the moment? Or what's exciting you the most proud? Well, so the human progress is unabashedly unabashedly about, uh, it's a huge human centric, uh, which is to say that would be considered the welfare and the flourishing of a human being. All human beings, uh, to be, uh, to be a really important of primary importance.

Speaker 3:          22:16          That's an interesting distinction because you didn't call it earth progress dot or a great, I mean, the idea was that this is so that humans can figure out the best place, the best way to live here, and hopefully that's good for the earth too. But that humans actually our number one here, yes, we can certainly talk, um, late and to show about, uh, is it possible for humans to coexist with the earth and the animals and, and what can we do to make sure that that actually happens? But human progress is a humanistic project and, um, uh, clearly there is no more fundamental aspect of human flourishing than staying alive. And, uh, here, uh, we have seen tremendous improvement. Um, prior to 18 hundreds, uh, life expectancy around the world was anywhere between 25 and 30 years. Since time in memorial, uh, as late as 1950, sorry, as late as 1900 in the richest countries of the world, life expectancy was only 50 years.

Speaker 3:          23:22          Today, globally, it's 70 years in do United States is 78 years. And in places like Japan, it's 88 years. So wait, let's, let's not gloss over that. Cause those were some powerful numbers. So in 1900 the average life expectancy was 50 years. So been in rich countries, in rich countries enrich galleries, that's even more impressive, so to speak. How we've advanced it. So you're, you're saying basically in the hundred 20 years since then or so we've extended it by 20 years of being slain by, so two years in, in the west, in rich countries, and by about, and, and, and, and every person today say somebody living in Malaysia lives 20 years longer than rich people did in 1900. Yeah, that's incredible. So in 120 years in, in rich western countries, we extended life 30 years in 120 days. I mean, that's, that's, that's almost unfathomable actually.

Speaker 3:          24:18          Uh, it's, it's, it's wonderful. And so that's the first thing is that people want to stay alive. Um, because they, they, they enjoy it. Yeah. Can you give me some of the markers of how we actually did that? Well, uh, one thing is decline in violence, which again, Steven pinker has. I switched on the whole book about, um, um, uh, you know, um, rates of people dying in wars. I have a have declined certainly since the end of the Second World War. Um, today for the first time in human history, uh, there is no hot conflict between two states that have declared war on each other. So we still have a frozen conflict between North Korea and the United States. Uh, we have, uh, we have the Russian invasion of the eastern Ukraine, but even then, Russia and Ukraine are not officially at war. So there's this old concept of two countries, you know, declaring war on each other and then going towards this actually has actually, well at this stage it has disappeared.

Speaker 3:          25:24          Yeah. Um, but almost be unfathomable these days were two warring countries with full on wars were invading each other in the traditional sense. It would almost be hard to imagine what that would look like. Now. That is very awkward cause that, yeah. Um, hopefully it stays that way. One thing to remember about, about, about human progress is that there is nothing predetermined about it. It is not linear. There are obviously things which can go terribly wrong. Uh, the 20th century, you have the first world war and possibly the most unnecessary major conflict, uh, in, in recent centuries, uh, followed by, uh, the Second World War and the Holocaust, the Gulag and what have you. But the remarkable thing about human progress and humanity as a whole, it's, is that at this quite robust, at the end of the 20th century, life expectancy are still longer than what it was at the beginning of the 20th century.

Speaker 3:          26:21          We are still consuming more calories, more people went to school and so on and so forth. In spite of the 20th century of being actually quite violent anyhow, since the, since the end of the Second World War, a world has gotten progressively more peaceful. Then of course, you have medical breakthroughs. Um, let's pause on the violence part for just a second because I think it's one of those things where you can say that to people and you can talk all about the wars that don't exist anymore and that there are, you know, genocides the way they were in on all of those things. It thus though admitting that some bad things are still happening, I think people just don't buy it. They, they see school shootings or they see, you know, a riot here or something happening all over the place and they just automatically believe things are getting worse.

Speaker 3:          27:04          That sort of gets us to where we started about how technology is a part of this. But how difficult is that for you just to get the truth across to people and have them actually accept it while at the same time they are looking at, you know, a shooting or this or that, that they can just quickly see online. Yeah. You've got to look at the longterm trends and try to figure out whether things in fact are getting worse or whether this is a blip. Um, you know, the line of progress, again, it's not linear, it his jacket and um, and there is no, uh, uh, once again, there's no guarantee that, uh, that, that things will continue to improve. So you have to look at long term trends. I think the Atlantic around a story a few months ago after the latest a school shooting showing that actually the number of kids dying at schools horrible as it is.

Speaker 3:          27:56          Yeah. Um, have been on a decline. Um, so yeah, so longterm trends. Um, and then having journalists actually reported those long term trends that, that that would be key. Yeah. So, so violence is one thing we'll live in less violent times. The second thing is that the medical breakthroughs were absolutely fundamental. Uh, and here I would point simply to two things. One was vaccination. Um, a guy called Jenner and Mitt, I believe mid 18th century England north that milkmaids didn't get, uh, didn't get a small box of smallpox was absolutely horrifying disease. I mean your body would be covered with these, um, with these youth hostels and, and you know, 80% of kids who got it dyed a up to 60% of adults who got it, who died, you know, died, uh, in, in the 18th century, France, it was estimated 95% of the population got smallpox at one point of their lives or another, and gender notice that milkmaids didn't get smallpox.

Speaker 3:          29:05          That's because they got a milder version of the POCs from cars. And so he started inoculating people with the POCs from the cow. And because the Latin word for cow is a vodka, our word vaccination come some from that. And that was a major improvement. The other thing that happened was, um, uh, was at humanity discovered the germ theory of disease. Um, we didn't know that disease will spread via germs. People had all sorts of weird ideas about humors in the body and mia somatic theories and what have you. And it was all nonsense. Uh, but the upshot of as being so ignorant about how disease spreads or is that people, for example, didn't wash their hands. Uh, you can imagine, right? Farmer is using human excrement in order to Fel, fertilize his fields and comes home and sits down to dinner. And you can imagine what sort of diseases literally now, um, Jews, funny enough who washed their hands, uh, as part of their religious rituals at penny to fall, uh, less sick and die at a lower rate than the rest of the, of the European population.

Speaker 3:          30:29          But once again, because people are so ignorant about how these easy spread, they assumed it wasn't magic, which again led to pogroms and discrimination against the Jews. But, um, even doctors, uh, didn't, um, doctors also didn't change their clothes, uh, because the more blood and Gore you head on your clothes, uh, the more it's signified to the potential patient that you are a doctor in great demand. Right? So, so, so doctorates, we're actually a massive, a reason or on one of the major reasons why disease spread. They went from their second corpses to delivering babies, introducing pathogen into, into, into the body of a, uh, of a mother and a, and all that stopped basically after, uh, a discovery of the germ theory of disease. Uh, and, and, uh, uh, child mortality, maternal mortality started to decline and life expectancy showed up as a result.

Speaker 3:          31:31          Yeah. What else is going on with the diseases of today that we're, we're getting close to eradicating some things that still exist, right. Well, we are very close to eradicating polio. Uh, there are some what's called wild cases of polio in, uh, in, uh, places like the Congo. Um, uh, of course we have, we have, uh, made HIV aids, uh, or rather we have, we have, uh, created drugs that no longer make HIV AIDS death sentence. Um, which, you know, considering it only took a from 1981 when we first started talking about HIV age to about 1994, 1995, when the first antiretroviral drugs came along, uh, only 14 or 15 years, uh, that, that sort of marketable accomplishment. I mean, people have lived with small bugs for a millennia. Um, so we have, we have, we were able to do that. Now the other thing which is quite extraordinary is that cancer rates are declining.

Speaker 3:          32:33          Now, the reason why that's so interesting is that incidentally of cancer increased with age. So as people grow older and on average we continue to to increase our life expectancy, the chances of you contracting or developing cancer, not contracting, but developing cancer get much higher. Cancer is basically just, um, cells dividing, uh, during a normal process, um, of, of human body, um, uh, existing. Uh, but, uh, the more subdivision of cells you get, the more likely it is that one of them is going to go crazy and start subdividing without control and cause cancer and you're going to die. And the fact that cancer rates for men and women are declining certainly in rich countries, even though life expectancy shooting up, that's again an extraordinary, um, an extraordinary achievement. Um, because of early detection, because of better drugs. Now with Crispr cas nine, the um, the gene editing, uh, system, uh, we are probably going to be able to focus on personalized medicines.

Speaker 3:          33:41          So we are going to be able to create drugs specifically for one individual or group of individuals who share. Um, can, can you explain CRISPR a little bit just for those that are, you know, you don't have to give you a major equation, but like the sort of the most simple explanation of it. I was reading something on the side of the today about CRISPR. Yeah. Well it's, it's, it's a gene editing technique, uh, which is to say that, uh, hypothetically, and hopefully we're not very far from, from that. Uh, from that time you'll be able to splice out of the genome, uh, to cut out from the genome, uh, genes which are responsible for a congenital diseases, uh, which would be, uh, which would be a very nice, uh, it would be very nice to know that if a child gets born, it will develop multiple sclerosis, uh, 20 years down the line and die in, in terrible pain.

Speaker 3:          34:35          So these are the sorts of things that we could do it with CRISPR. Yeah. Uh, I want to move on to the environment, but is there anything else on the mathematical data? I mean, education is the obvious, uh, example. Uh, obviously, uh, 80% of the world is literate. What is most of the time people were not literate on those? Now a gender parity between boys and girls? Pretty much, uh, on average in the world. Uh, again, something to be happy about because historically, uh, girls were kept from education at a higher rate than boys. I mean, even in Afghanistan and now, uh, girls are allowed to go to school, which again, is a wonderful thing. And nutrition, I would, I would really like to end with nutrition, which is to say that, um, famine has disappeared from the world outside of war zones. We all remember those images of starving children, um, with inflated Belize in Ethiopia, the early 1980s.

Speaker 3:          35:38          Yeah. And, um, uh, that's, that's pretty much uh, disappeared and, um, um, uh, hunger was basically a normal human condition throughout our history and, uh, today, um, and every African consumes as many calories as the Portuguese did in the early 1960s. Just about everywhere in the world, people are consuming more calories than, uh, than what the USDA recommends, should be the average intake. And in, in Africa, they are certainly reaching that threshold. And Africa is important because that's really where absolute poverty, um, continues to be a major problem. Um, I, I think it's fair to say that absolute poverty is going to, is ending as a global problem. It is now going to remain as a, as a, as a, uh, as an African problem. Um, that is concentrated in a couple of African country in, in, in a few African countries, including places like the Congo. All right, so let's shift to the environment.

Speaker 2:          36:45          You listened to the news. It's getting hotter. Everybody's freaking out about everything. We don't have clean water. All of these things

Speaker 3:          36:51          calm me down. Well, I don't want to get into a debate. It's a debate over, over the signs of, of global warming. I'll leave it to the specialist. Um, certainly I do acknowledge that there is a consensus that the world is warming. Uh, whether it is warming at a, at a too high a rate or a lukewarming rate and where it is heading. Obviously prediction of the future is that that's the most difficult thing. I'm going to leave that to, to a specialty center scientists. Yeah. Just very quickly on that though, is it possible that in some of the places that it's warming, it's actually good that it's warming? Well, a, suddenly this, this, uh, this one scientist from Holland called a professor tall, has a calculated, uh, the, the likely costs and benefits of global warming until 2080 or so. And he thought that, uh, um, because of the growing, uh, because of the longer growing season, we'll be able to actually bring in, uh, more, uh, more and more food grow, grow more food. We also thought that, uh, there is also some evidence that the world is greening as a result of more a CEO two in the atmosphere. But I do acknowledge I want to make it very,

Speaker 2:          38:02          yeah. Any hate mail to you or to me, I want to go into get hate mail either way. Right. Acknowledge way acknowledged

Speaker 3:          38:10          that, uh, uh, there are serious concerns. Um, uh, and, and I'm, I'm basically a guy who is a techno optimist. I want to look for solutions to these problems, uh, rather than what I don't want to do is to stop economic development. I don't want to stop economic development in developing countries because it's extremely important that, that people who are very, very poor should not be very, very poor. It's very important that if a woman in Angola or in Zambia has a premature birth, she should be able to have an access to a, uh, to an incubator that is a run on a, on a, uh, on an electricity grid that is not going to collapse, for example, okay. That, uh, that people can air condition their homes, let's say in Africa or that they can, they can keep themselves warm in a, in Argentina basically, that, that is my, my goal not to stop economic development, um, those particularly of true of, um, of, of poor countries.

Speaker 3:          39:18          Uh, but I also think that it applies to rich countries. Um, if, if we can make life more comfortable for people. I, I see, no, I think it would be very difficult, especially within the democratic context context to stop that. Now look at what's happening in, uh, in macrons Paris. We've seen riots, yeah. That country has and hasn't seen since the 1960s. Why is that? That's because the environmental concerns of the French elite micron included are bumping against, uh, the, uh, living standards and limitations on the living standards of ordinary French men and women. If you increase the price of electricity, uh, dramatically in order to make people cut down on electricity, it's also going to reduce their, their, both their comfort, but also their standard of living. If you're going to put additional taxes on this, that, and the other cars, uh, gasoline, what have you, uh, eventually people are going to get upset and are going to start voting for some very unpleasant people.

Speaker 3:          40:25          And this is something that we see happening throughout Europe. Now. There are many different reasons why people vote for, um, uh, for unpleasant, uh, of political parties. But, uh, a, a fundamental feeling that that standards of living in Europe, art stagnating and that they are being taxed to a point where they actually have to go out and protest in the streets, burn, uh, hundreds of cars and basically vandalized the Arc de Triomphe. Okay. So, so these things are happening. So what I want to do is to sort of navigate a middle course between, uh, between concerns over the environment, uh, and uh, and uh, and continued economic development and continued prosperity. And I think that the answer could potentially be found in, um, techno optimism, as I would call it. So I would consider a fracking to be a good example of taking our optimism. Okay. Uh, burning of one unit of natural gas produces half as much co two emissions as burning of coal [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          41:34          So I think it would make a lot of sense to burn more natural gas than coal. But a friend's on the environmental side hate that because it's still fossil fuels. Okay. So let's forget about fossil fuels. Let's have nuclear energy. Okay. Last time anybody has died from a nuclear accident, it was ensure no bill. Um, because the communist leadership, uh, cut corners when it came to the safety and, uh, there was a breakdown of, of um, chain of command and whatever. And there wasn't this, this accident where a, where dozens of people died, but since then, not a single person has died as a result of nuclear accidents, including in Fukushima, which is the most recent one. Um, so nuclear energy is a perfect example of producing a lot of energy, uh, without any CEO. Two emissions. Are Our friends in the environmentalist movement please?

Speaker 3:          42:33          No, they are not. Let's take another example. Um, uh, say a photo Leiser. Let's say that we can genetically engineer crops to need less fertilizer and less pesticides. Why do we want a less fertilizer and less pesticides? Because when those flow into rivers and then into oceans, they can have a negative consequence for wildlife. So ideally we would like to use less fertilizer, less pesticide. So imagine that through Gmos, uh, through genetic engineering, we could produce crops that, uh, that, that don't require pesticides and fertilizer are our friends in the environmental, I'll be happy. No, they hate, they hate those three letters. In the time that we offer as techno optimists, we offer a gradual move in the right direction, which cumulatively could have a massive impact on quality of life, on the environmental protection and so forth. Um, you know, the, the, the answer is always no.

Speaker 3:          43:43          So what, so it's interesting because when you started talking about this, there's this immediate hesitancy because I think everyone, if you talk about climate at all, people think you're going to get slammed. And I can tell you the most hate that I ever got on the show was when I had Alex Epstein on wrote a book called the moral case for fossil fuels in there. He wasn't denying climate science. He was, you're saying that fossil fuels, in his estimation, are still the best way to advance human prosperity going forward. So it's interesting you, you immediately said you didn't want to go too far down that road because it just opens up the the hate and all that, but, but in essence, what you're saying is that we're having to fight the environmentalist's on what you would prescribe as the best ways to move the environment forward.

Speaker 3:          44:27          That that's pretty fascinating. So how do you get through to these people then? I, well, I don't know. I'm trying, what are the things I'm trying to explain to a lot of my friends is that actually prosperity and economic development can be a friend of the environment. That's because of this concept of environmental Kuznets curve. Now that's just a fancy way of saying that when people grow richer, they are willing to spend more money on clean environment and protection of animals. How do I know that? Because in in, well it's not just stats which show it, but also look at the real life examples. When do you kind of me collapsed in Zimbabwe? The first thing that people did in order to survive was to start slaughtering animals in the wild, shooting zebras for meat, shooting elephants for tusks. Um, and, and the environment took a huge knock in Venezuela when the economy collapsed.

Speaker 3:          45:26          Both socialist countries by the way, but you never mind in Venezuela when the economy collapsed, uh, people started slaughtering animals in the zoo. The only way you can survive if it's a choice between the life of an antelope and the survival of your child, you know exactly what to do. And so economic development, making people richer, it's actually, um, a very good way of accomplishing this environmental co Kuznets curve. When people grow rich, they start caring about the air they breathe, they start caring about a welfare of animals and so on and so forth. Because those are from the perspective of the survival of the human being. Luxury goods. And we are already seeing some very interesting things happening around the world. For example, the forest coverage of, uh, of, of, of the Oris is still declining by about 0.08% per year, but it is declining primarily, if not exclusively in poor countries and especially in Africa and also like an American, but it is increasing in a rich countries, uh, for a station is they can place their more forest being grown.

Speaker 3:          46:46          And in China, uh, we are seeing huge amount of our, for a station because the country is now Richard than what did you used to be. So through economic development, we can do that through economic development. We can also, um, uh, we can also start protecting more of our marine life, um, by creating exclusion zones, uh, against fishing and so forth. How can we do that? Why is that connected to economic development? Well, because if you're, for example, you can, well, not only do you have more technological, um, uh, ways of monitoring who is breaking the rules, but also you can still get access to the food you want through aquaculture. Okay. So countries which are richer, uh, are able to, uh, are able to get their food from, uh, from aquaculture rather than from, uh, from ordinary, uh, shore fishing. So when, when it comes to these solutions, which, by the way, I mean, what you just said there, it's pretty mind blowing that in much of the world it's getting greener.

Speaker 3:          47:51          You know, I mean, that's, people just don't think about that. We just sorted, just don't accept that. That's real. Most of this. Do you see that we have to have a, a sort of, uh, public and private partnership on how we move forward on these things? Should most of this come from governments? Should it come from private corporations? Should it come from individual people? I mean, that seems to be what a lot of the debate is also about. Well, uh, I think that the research that the, um, uh, evidence, uh, for the efficacy of a government spending when it comes to a science, um, w when it comes to scientific research, for example, is it's not all that persuasive. I don't think that governments are particularly good at spending money on scientific research. Um, meaning that the researcher shoddy or just that they throw money at things and then just nothing comes of it.

Speaker 3:          48:46          Um, yeah, that, that, that would be, that will be part of reason. Um, I am a believer in, uh, in, uh, in, uh, private companies doing their own research, um, driven by the profit motive, for example. Um, energy inputs into production of anything from a can of coke, two bottle of water. Uh, our costs money. A companies actually do have a, an incentive at profit incentive to try to limit the amount of resources they use in order to produce any type of good. Um, in the 1970s, uh, between 1970s and today, the number of cans of coke that you could get from a pound of aluminum has actually increased by something like 40%. That's because companies don't want to spend money. They don't have to spend on electricity, uh, on, uh, uh, spending money on natural resources and will and raw materials and wood heavy.

Speaker 3:          49:51          And so what we are actually seeing is that, uh, the number of dark dollars, um, uh, per, um, uh, what the, the amount of the amount of energy we need in order to produce a dollar of output is actually declining. And that that's happening naturally through the process of profit maximization on the parts of, of corporations. Now that doesn't mean that there is absolutely no need for any kind of regulations. We don't want corporations to be, to be dumping toxic materials in our pristine rivers and what have you. But, uh, uh, but what I am saying is that, uh, is that uh, corporations in search for profit, um, are actually very good at coming up with innovative solutions to environmental problems. Yeah. It's part of the problem here also that different countries that are at different stages of their evolution of their economies and everything else need different things, need wildly different things.

Speaker 3:          50:52          What's happening in China now with growth is very different than what's happening in the United States or, or India or any of these countries that now half, half to, that are often putting out more co two and emissions and things like that. They're going through their industrial revolutions. We already did it so that we have an unequal playing field when it comes to some of them. Yes. Um, so that is a well known, uh, notion within economic development that, uh, as a country, uh, starts on a pass to industrialization. It's a them should environment increases. But once again, it reaches that, uh, that inflection point and then it starts to decrease as people become rich enough to start to appreciate, um, nice environment. Um, 90% of the plastics that are entering our oceans come from eight rivers are all in the developing world, in Africa and in Asia.

Speaker 3:          51:46          Uh, the contribution of western advanced economies to plastic pollution of the oceans is negligible, um, precisely because we are able to spend more money and effort and thought on how not to do it. What would you say to the people that would say, uh, our time is up here? Or the evolution of humanity is that we've got to go to the stars, that eventually we'll have to get off this mortal coil and do it again somewhere else. Well, uh, first of all, it is very important to remember that a pessimism about humanity's future, uh, has been with us since the, since the dawn of writing, um, um, from, from antiquity and ancient poems and epics. You know, the, the afternoon, the flood, what is it about the flood is about closing. The world's depressing, the relation that, that, uh, that went, uh, all right. Um, the Cato, the elder, uh, writing second century BC thoughts that Rome was finished because, um, you know, uh, the, the, the young were corrupted and, uh, um, women had loose morals and men were to feminists to fight wars.

Speaker 3:          53:09          And this is when Rome was just a small town in, you know, with fewer, uh, with a few provinces in Italy. Rome continue to expand for the next three to 400 years. Um, but he was just very early. He was just very early. Uh, but you can see every generation thinks that, that, that we are, especially as we grow older, we think that, uh, the world is entering a period of decline. Whereas in fact what we are doing, we are projecting our own physical decline, uh, onto the world. But so far those, uh, those warnings about the imminent collapse of humanity have always been proven wrong. As, um, uh, Thomas Babington Macaulay, uh, in 19th century British politician and the writer has written on, on what basis is it without having seen all this progress that we have made behind us. We see nothing but misery in front of us. I'm paraphrasing, but that's the essence of what he said and I think he's absolutely right. Yeah. So we've,

Speaker 2:          54:09          we've done the diseases, we're eradicating, we're doing a lot of good on the environment or at least have, have some options now.

Speaker 3:          54:16          Yes. Yeah. Uh, what else, what else should we be hitting on to give people some, some positivity to think about? Well, I think, um, my pet peeve is a, that I think that, uh, people don't read enough history, aren't enough versed in, uh, in, in history how life really used to be like, uh, before. Um, and I wish that people would spend more time thinking about what they are doing on their base daily basis and asking themselves, uh, would I be able to do this in the past? Um, I just had a crown, uh, have put in or a root canal operation with anesthetic. And it was, it was not something and there wasn't a particularly pleasant, but, but,

Speaker 2:          55:02          but it was better than it would have been a hundred years ago. A hundred or 200 years ago. You would have it, you know, um, somebody would have to pull it out of your, out of your mouth.

Speaker 3:          55:12          Um, and, um, um, so, so, so that's the one thing. Uh, I think that people, uh, and I think that if people understand history better and how life truly was quite horrific until very recent times, again, we are 300,000 years old, but at the time of abundance, it's roughly 200 years old, 250 years old. Maybe there will be more grateful and um, uh, for the things that we have and hopefully they will be more appreciative and more supporting of the institutions which underpin a modernity, liberal democracy with all of its warts, with all of its imperfections. It is still functioning better than a Putin is Russia or, or the Turkey. A free market. Capitalism does have its problems. Yes. Um, we shouldn't socialize costs of banking for example, and prioritized and privatized gains from Wall Street banking. Um, but again, it is the best. It is the best creative known to humankind. And so throwing it out because there are imperfections on the margins that we should be working on to, to, to improve would be a great mistake. Um, so yes, appreciation of the past, gratitude for the present, hopefulness for the future. Um, those are the steps in, I think, in the right direction that my friend is an a plus ending to an interview and for more on Marriott and the incredible work that think progress is doing.
