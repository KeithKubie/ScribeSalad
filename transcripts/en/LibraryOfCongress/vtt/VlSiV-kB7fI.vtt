00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.580
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Good afternoon.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.760
I'm Karen Lloyd, Director of
the Veterans History Project.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.090
And it is my pleasure to welcome
you to the Library of Congress

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.390
and our behind the
mic panel discussion

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.850
to examine the interviewer's
role

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.360
and experience with
oral history.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.460
Oral history is a principal
conduit for folklore.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.360
It is through oral history
that we're able to learn

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.450
about the life experiences and
perspectives of individuals

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.470
who might not otherwise
appear in historical records.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.170
Recorded interviews provide
uniqueness to the qualities

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.160
of human voice that is its
expression like inflections,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.690
hesitation, dialect
and emotional range.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.070
The content of these
interviews also provide a rich

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.420
human interaction.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.290
As I watch and listen to
the stories in our archive,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.440
as well as meet the veterans and
their loved ones face-to-face,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.550
I am more and more grateful

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.050
for our veterans'
service and sacrifice.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.990
I am thankful that
Congress understood

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.730
that oral history
aspect of folklore

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.480
when it established the Veterans
History Project in year 2000.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.420
Congress established
VHP as a project

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.630
within the American Folklife
Center of the Library

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.420
of Congress, because it was seen
as an appropriate repository

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.950
to collect, preserve,
and make available

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.030
to the public an archive
of oral histories.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.240
In two days, we will celebrate
our 17th anniversary and I am

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.050
so proud to report that
we currently hold more

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.720
than 104,000 collections
of selfless service

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.600
of our brave men and women
who served in the US military

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.680
from World War I through
the current conflicts.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.050
It would have been
impossible for our staff

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.910
to archive this much history
without the direct involvement

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.830
of organizations like Witness to
War, Vietnam War Commemoration,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.360
Members of Congress
and volunteers

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.730
from across the country,
who interviewed veterans

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.800
in their lives and
in their communities.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.350
In addition to the interviews,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.070
they also donate other
historic materials

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.700
such as original photographs,
letters, diaries, journals,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.640
two-dimensional artwork and
official military documents,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.420
at a rate of about
a hundred per week.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.970
The Veterans History
Project engages veterans

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.210
from every branch of
service and their loved ones

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.230
and our content is used
by researchers, educators,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.340
students, authors, filmmakers,
and the general public.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.420
We are deeply honored to
host this panel where we get

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420
to take a peek behind
the curtain

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.900
of the interviewer experience.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.090
It is now my pleasure
to introduce

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.010
to you our distinguished panel.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.080
I'd like to start with Joe
Galloway, a native Texan.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.880
Joe joined the United
Press International

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.680
as a reporter in 1961.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.920
During his 22 years with UPI,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.190
Joe served in nearly
a dozen news bureaus

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.070
in the American Midwest
and also Asia.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.610
Joe began a 16-month
tour of Vietnam

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.050
as a war correspondent
beginning in April 1965,

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.310
shortly after the first
American combat troops arrived

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.960
in Vietnam.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.710
He did three other tours in
Vietnam, one in 1971, one in '73

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.350
and his last in 1975
covering the fall of Saigon.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.070
Joe spent 20 years as a senior
editor and senior writer

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.150
for the US News &amp;
World Report magazine

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.100
and just recently retired as a
senior military correspondent

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.270
for Knight Ridder newspapers.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.640
Joe served as special consultant
to General Colin Powell

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.060
at the State Department.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.400
That had been amazing and
co-authored several books.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.060
He is most often
recognized as the co-author

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.300
of the national bestselling
book, "We Were Soldiers Once...

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.460
and Young" with General
Hal Moore.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.140
The book was later turned
into a feature film in 2002,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.540
starring Mel Gibson
as General Moore.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.300
More recently, Joe has been
portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.130
in a film "Shock and Awe", a
reflection of his reputation

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.470
for journalistic integrity.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.060
He has received numerous
awards for his writing,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.840
but I think he would tell you,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.610
his most significant
recognition came in 1998,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.960
when the army awarded
him a bronze star

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.440
for rescuing a wounded soldier
under fire in November 1965.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.960
This was the only such medal
for valor awarded to a civilian

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.830
by the army for actions
undertaken during the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.160
Vietnam War.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.300
Next, we have Emily Carley with
the Witness to War Foundation.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.740
Thank you Emily, a nonprofit
501c3 founded in 2001

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.090
and dedicated to
capturing the stories

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.190
of individual combat
veterans, honoring them

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.070
and educating future generations
about the price of freedom

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.270
and extraordinary valor
for our forbearers.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.920
The Witness to War Foundation
is dedicated to understanding

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.770
as much as possible, what
it was like to be there.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.370
Emily is an Atlanta native and a
2006 graduate of the University

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.010
of Tennessee with a
BA/BS in Marketing.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.460
Her grandfather was a World
War II and Korean War veteran

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.490
and is featured on the
Witness to War website.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.470
He is Tank Commander Andrew
Carpenter, in case you're going

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.370
to check it out later.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.050
Emily originally
assisted with interviewing

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.290
and website content
selection prior to moving

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.090
into the director position.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.760
Emily has been working with
the foundation since 2006,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.100
where today she is responsible
for the day-to-day running

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.790
of the Foundation including
partnership and media contacts

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.190
and website management.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.600
Next to Emily is Guha
Shankar, a folklife specialist

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.730
at the American Folklife Center.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.340
Guha is involved in a range

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.910
of public outreach programs
including the Civil Rights

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.850
Project, a national
initiative to conduct surveys

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.120
of existing oral history
collections with relevance

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.450
to the Civil Rights Movements
and to record new interviews

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.340
with people who participated
in the movement.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.640
The recollections

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.740
of interviewees cover a
wide variety of topics

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.520
about the freedom struggle
such as the Influence

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.750
of Organized Labor,
Nonviolence and Self Defense,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.190
and the Importance of Faith,
Music, Family and Friendships,

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.900
and that last piece as a veteran
really resonates with me.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.780
Like many of our veterans,
the individuals involved

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.200
in Civil Rights Movement
fought bravely

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.780
for what they believed in.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.910
They often experienced
intense traumatic events

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.500
that have ultimately
defined their life.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.490
Their actions and moments
in time are meaningful,

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.660
not just to the individuals,
but also for larger history.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.400
Events discussed in these
interviews include the murder

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.260
of 14-year-old Emmett Till in
1955, the Freedom Rights in '61,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.920
the March on Washington for
Jobs and Freedom in '63,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.580
the Selma to Montgomery
Rights March in '65.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.680
The 130 plus interviews
are a permanent part

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.410
of the recently opened
national museum.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.000
Guha earned his PhD in 2003 from
the Department of Anthropology,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.530
University of Texas Austin
with the concentration

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.800
in folklore and public culture.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.080
Prior to undertaking
his graduate studies,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.260
he was a media production
specialist

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.810
and documentary film producer at
the Center for Folklife Programs

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.050
at the Smithsonian Institution's
Center for Folklife

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.830
and Cultural Heritage.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.110
As an army colonel,
I am thrilled

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.790
to welcome our next panel
member and my compatriot, Mark--

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.910
Colonel Mark Franklin.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.910
Through Colonel Franklin
served 30 years of service,

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.730
he held a variety of positions,

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.920
starting as a weapons
platoon leader and culminating

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.280
as a political military adviser
as the Okinawa area coordinator

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.640
and senior country

of Defense for policy,
where he was responsible

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.250
for developing military

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.090
to military relationship
with China.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.150
Mark currently serves as the
chief history and legacy branch

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.050
for the Vietnam War
Commemoration.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.230
Vietnam War Commemoration
was created in 2008 by act

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.200
of Congress and will last
until Veterans Day 2025.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.950
The mission of the commemoration
is to assist our nation

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.050
in thanking and honoring Vietnam
veterans, their families,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.900
the fallen, those who are
held prisoner of war and those

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.550
that are still unaccounted for.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.490
In support of that
mission, the history

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.180
and legacy branch strives to
provide the American public

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.910
with a clear understanding and
appreciation of the service,

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.710
sacrifice of our veterans
and ensure the legacy

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.930
of their service endures
for future generations.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.200
Lastly, our moderator,
thank you Andrew.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.550

DC and several other cities.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.470
Andrew received numerous
academic awards including a

in Russia in 2013.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.190
I will now turn the
microphone over to Andrew

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.280
who will explain the
format of today's panel.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.580
Thank you, Andrew.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.140
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: I would

and I also want to thank
Kerry Ward for her help

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.550
in bringing this
panel into being.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.000
First of all, I will-- I answer

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.390
or ask the panelists several
questions, both panels,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.500
general questions the entire
panel and a couple specific

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.050

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.850
Then afterwards, I would
like to open the discussion

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.350
to the audience and I would

for panelist either
for the entire panel

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.240
or for individuals on the panel.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.280
Oral history is important for
its critical ability to fill

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.850
in the gaps in our historical
records, enables us to capture

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.260
and preserve accounts that
we would otherwise lose,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.730
be they subaltern voices or even
people who are very important

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:18.530
who choose not to commit their
thoughts to written prose.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.310
In introduction question for
everyone on these panelists,

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.300
can you describe a moment when
you realize in an interview

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.420
that what the interviewee
was saying had changed your

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.550
understanding of an
historical event or process?

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.160
And perhaps we can
start with Guha.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.730
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thanks.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:46.000
I think I go back to one of
the very first interviews

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.750
that I was a part of
here at the Library.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.990
I've done several on my own.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.960
But I was acting as a sound
recorder for an interview

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.300
that we did during the opening

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.950
of the World War II
Memorial here in the mall

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.910
and memory escapes me.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.480
It was at least-- it
was a long time ago.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.710
It was about at least 10
years ago if I'm not mistaken.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.730
And one of the people whom
we were interviewing was this

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.820
elderly gentleman who
had been brought here

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.070
by his congressman
from Michigan.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.730
And at the course of the
interview, I want to cut

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.710
to the point, he had never, as
I found out, as I was talking

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.620
to his two adult daughters,
they said, "He has never talked

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.770
about his war experiences
to us ever."

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.620
And so for them it was a
moment to listen and understand

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.720
from their father's own words
what his experiences were.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.500
And at the course of the
interview, he starts talking

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.220
about essentially being
transported at the end

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.570
of the war having been
shot down, 19-year-old,

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:49.490
sent across the border
and into Germany,

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.700
somewhere in the
Polish border, I think.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.480
And he says at that moment, and
this is a capstone argument,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.780
he says, "I didn't realize until
they told me where we were going

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.730
to be barracked, that it was the
birthplace of my grandparents.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.980
And yes, I heard the, ahh.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.280
[laughter] I did that.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.030
The interviewer did
that and behind me,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.030
who's two grown daughters
did that.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.560
And the trauma that he
is talking about perhaps

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.890
of not the reason he just kept
quiet for all those years.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.280
And he said, "I never told
anybody in my unit where I was

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.520
or who my grandparents were."

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.210
So that kind of erasure of his
own family history in the middle

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.900
of this trauma, which is already

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.560
for a 19-year-old being
transported 40 men

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.870
to a boxed car across
enemy lines,

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.770
had to be doubly and triply so.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.830
And that adds to a
dimension of understanding,

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.130
which I think going
back to your point,

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.590
which you just would not
get just reading the text

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.930
of that account alone.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.730
And to hear from his own
voice and then the other shock

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.110
of that is amplified by the fact

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.150
that his two daughters
coming towards the end

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.260
of their father's life who
is an elderly man after all,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.740
close to his 80s, that is also
that kind of intensification

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.100
of what happens when you're
listening to an oral history.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.950
That profoundly changed
my perception

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.630
of what I thought I knew about
the war, which is obviously,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.230
you know, a lot of John
Wayne stuff going on.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.130
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: So my answer is
going to be a little bit broader

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.540
because my evolution

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.300
into interviewing was a little
bit different probably than some

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.960
of the other people
on the panel.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.230
I actually started out doing
World War II interviews

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.240
for the Witness to
War Foundation.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.050
When I started with the group,
that was our main focus,

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.850
because we were trying
to capture

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.200
as many World War II interviews

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.180
as we could while these
veterans were still with us

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.060
and are still with us.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.500
And in our more recent years,

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.230
our focus has shifted
towards the Vietnam veteran,

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.980
which I personally did not have
a lot of experience with just

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.000
by the nature of the
work I was doing.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.250
And it had always been
kind of my understanding

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:55.190
that Vietnam veterans may not be
incredibly comfortable talking

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.490
about their experiences.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.440
Obviously, the coming
home process

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.230
for them was a little
bit different.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.140
And they-- I've always had
the impression that maybe not

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.250
to ask the questions,
maybe not to try to talk

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.550
about the Vietnam War.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.000
So when we started to get
into these interviews,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.290
it was a little bit of a
different arena for me.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.910
And what I realize was
that it wasn't so much

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.450
that they didn't want
to talk about it,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.620
it was that we weren't
asking them.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.550
We weren't asking them
to share these stories.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.680
We were not opening up
this outlet for them.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.730
And so it was a unique
experience for me

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.770
to see these interviews
starting to come out,

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.470
see these gentlemen starting to
open up about their experiences

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.870
and the cathartic
process for them.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.390
One in particular that stands
out to me was a gentleman

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.210
that I did an interview with in
a small town outside of Atlanta.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:47.220
And I can't even remember
how we came together anymore.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.090
But it was clear to me that
he had not shared his story

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.390
very much.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.440
I think I just happened to
come along at the right time.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.910
He actually was a very soft
spoken southern gentleman

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.660
who kind of, I feel like
was looking for an outlet

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.850
to finally share
these experiences.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.800
And so when we sat down,
I didn't know a lot

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.190
about what he was going
to share, but it turned

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.860
out to be one of
the most profound

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.860
and poignant interviews
I've ever done.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.950
He sits down and he
starts talking about being

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.440
in a mountain yard
village in Vietnam

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.390
as it was overrun
by the Vietcong.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:24.110
And his severe wounds and
basically sitting in a tunnel

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.720
with a grenade in his
hand deciding if he wanted

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.560
to be captured or if he
wanted to pull the pin

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.170
on the grenade himself.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.750
And I'm sitting there as
he's telling this just in awe

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.070
because these were
the types of stories

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.510
that I had not heard before.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.510
I didn't know much about Vietnam
and here he was sharing it

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.780
with me as an interviewer,
who he had just met.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.760
And I think that's what so
vastly important for us is

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.570
that we're the keepers of
these memories for them

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.420
that we show our interest in
what they're talking about.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.870
We're asking the right questions
and that we can be there

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.640
for them to share the experience
and that to me was kind

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.760
of this turning point in
switching from World War II

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.480
to Vietnam that I reflect
back on that interview often

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.170
and I share it often because
I think he was looking

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.320
for an outlet and I
was more than thrill

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.620
to provide that for him.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.700
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: I'm not
sure I can put my finger

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:27.350
on an aha moment in the 300
plus interviews I've done

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:33.050
over the last four years
with the Vietnam veterans.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:38.660
But what I would say is
that I learned something new

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:45.550
about that war from every single
veteran that I interviewed.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:52.850
They opened up to me
perhaps in a special way

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:58.030
if for no other reason than
I've been there where they were

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:02.740
for four tours in Vietnam
as a war correspondent.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.510
And never written books
and worked as a journalist

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:12.150
for 55 years and built
almost unprecedented level

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.650
of trust among military people.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:19.580
I learned as a young reporter

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:27.730
that the military is a very
small tightly contained world,

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.560
especially professional
military officers.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:40.660
And the communication among them
is swift and if you deal fairly

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:46.000
with one, all of them hear
about it and controversially

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.280
if you screw one of them,
you've done them all

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.240
and you will never
get cooperation.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.840
You will never set foot
on a military base again,

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.160
with except as a
hostile so identified.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:07.710
So I sit down and talk to
them and I find they open

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:17.850
up very easily and tell stories
they've told no one else.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.620
&gt;&gt; Retired Col. Mar R. Franklin:
You know, you can get a sense

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.400
of what combat is like
by watching it on TV,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.950
seeing Hollywood portrayals,
even reading really,

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:31.240
really good books by
very, very good authors.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.450
But it's when you hear it
from the veterans on mouth

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.830
that it really kind of brings it
home and our very, very first--

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:42.560
in fact, Joe's very, very first
interview was Gen. Tom Hill,

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.100
San Antonio.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.390
And I thought I knew
something about war and combat.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.630
I've been fortunate with a
few close calls in Pakistan,

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.350
I've never really had a
shot fired at me in anger,

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.700
but I thought I knew
something about it

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.390
until I heard Tom Hill
explained in a firefight

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.790
when he was platoon
leader having one

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.580
of his young soldiers
die on his lips

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.310
as he was giving him
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.920
Now that really brings it home.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.700
And I think, for me, that
was probably and was a very,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.540
very first interview
and I thought, wow,

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.120
we are really in
for quite a ride.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.950
So I think the perspectives
that you get

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.430
from combat veterans really
is what brings it home

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:30.810
and that is probably the first
profound effect it had for me.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.630
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Emily, as
an interviewer, you often have

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.570
to listen between the lines.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:40.050
How do you think an
interviewee's responses shape

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.850
your subsequent questions?

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.330
Do they and what
ways, like that?

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.630
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: Absolutely.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.270
Our questions are
vitally important

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.860
to the content of the interview.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.170
And I've seen this across
a spectrum by starting

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.920
out with interviewing
Word War II veterans

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.770
and then now interviewing
people coming back from Iraq

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.410
and Afghanistan and obviously,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.260
the storytelling
styles are different,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.770
the memories are
fresher or more distant.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:09.260
And so it's imperative that as
an interviewer, you do know what

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.890
to look for and not stick
to a set list of questions.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.360
We have a list of questions that
we kind of use for reference

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.670
but as we're going
through an interview,

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.120
we're always jotting down notes.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.580
Things to come back to,
it's important for us not

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.180
to interrupt an interview
because we don't want

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.590
to get them off track from a
story that they're telling.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.790
But it's always picking
up on those little nuggets

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.850
of information, you know, maybe
a village that they pass through

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.330
or something that they saw

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.050
as they're describing
a larger story

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.290
and being able to
come back to that.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.890
Because sometimes those
turn into fantastic stories,

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.340
fantastic insights, things
that we can draw back

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.100
on in other parts
of the interview.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.530
And then also if
you have somebody

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.200
who isn't quite comfortable
telling their story,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.740
it's incredibly important
that you can help guide them.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.450
So help draw up things that
they might not remember

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.770
or that they might not be
thinking about at the time.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.170
So if you have somebody
that's more reluctant,

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.980
you can use those things
that you pick up on

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.810
to help further them
in their stories

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.040
and develop those
memories for videotape.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.240
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Mark,
as a veteran yourself,

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.850
you have the ability to
establish a special rapport

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.070
with veterans when they're
conducting oral history

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.420
interviews, what are the--

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.600
both the opportunities and the
challenges that your status

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.360
as a former professional
soldier present

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.780
when you're interviewing
a veteran?

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.080
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Yeah.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.380
I think that's true.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.920
Regardless of the
service that you serve in,

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.470
all military members share
one common experience,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.020
that would be their
initial entry training,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.670
which is its own form
of shock and awe.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.580
And then of course understanding
military chain of command

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.830
and some of the vernacular,
but then when you get

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.310
down of the separate
services and for me being army

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.440
when you talk to the guys that
serve on the ground both marines

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.430
and army, you also share
a common experience

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.970
and so they do tend to take
some things for granted.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.440
So when you take-- talk about
challenges, one of the things

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.990
that we-- the first thing we
tell a veteran when we sit

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.030
down is we explain, you know,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.750
you and I understand
a certain language.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.470
We use certain acronyms
and terms and--

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.770
but remember your audience.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.950
The audience may not
remember or not know what

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.250
that acronym or term is.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.870
So when you see it or use it,
try to remember to spell it out

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.290
or explain it and if you don't,

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.690
we'll try to remind
you to do so.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.840
So, they get it right away.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.860
And there's this
understanding that, yeah,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.470
we speak the same language, not
everybody may understand it.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.100
In terms of a combat
veteran, nobody--

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.410
just like I said
earlier where I don't--

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.780
you really can't understand
combat unless you've

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.180
experienced it.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.300
A combat veteran can't
really explain it

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.150
to someone who's
never been there.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.330
They get the sense that
maybe they don't understand

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.780
and we're finding now finally
these Vietnam veterans are

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.960
willing to open up
in a kind of express,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.210
some of those experiences,
but the guy they really open

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.890
up to is someone
who's been there

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.860
and that's the gentleman
on my right.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.300
So that would be
probably be a good segue

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.600
to your next question.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.900
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee:
That's an excellent segue

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.200
to the next question.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.410
Joe, as a reporter who worked
in Vietnam and then published

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.410
about Vietnam, many of your
interview subjects know

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.710
who you are.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.270
Some of them have even come
down and sat for the interview

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.860
because they know you're going
to be there and they have

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.350
that opportunity to meet you.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:29.040
How do you think that your--
or the interviewee's knowledge

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.470
of you, your biography,

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.690
how do you think it
affects the interview?

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.800
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: I don't
certainly don't think it gets

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.240
on the way.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.350
I think they open up
to me far more readily

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:49.820
because they know I know
where of they speak.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.170
I've stood there
while they were dying

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.590
and bleeding all around me.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.320
I've carried the wounded,
I've carried the dead.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:06.640
I've carried them water and
ammunition and on occasion,

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.850
un-slung my rifle and put
it to use because otherwise,

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.530
maybe we were all
going to die there.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:22.950
It's absolutely true you cannot
explain combat thoroughly

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:26.040
to someone who has never seen

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.130
or more importantly
heard and smelled it.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:39.810
Even, you know, even a skilled
writer can't put down words

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:49.220
on paper to explain what 2000
dead bodies in a circle less

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.710
than 200 meters around
who have been rotting

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.900
in the hot tropical
sun for three days,

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.230
what that smell is like.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.280
I can't explain it to you,
but I can never get it

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:08.130
out of my nose and
out of my mind.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.000
They're just plain going
to open up and talk to me

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.350
because they know I
understand where of they speak.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:25.600
And as a kid, my father and
six of his brothers and four

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.460
of my mother's brothers all
wear the uniform in World War II

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.100
and when we were little
kids, when they came home,

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.630
we wanted war stories
and we've pestered them.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:44.160
And all we got from them were
the lighthearted stories,

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.420
the jokes, the funny stuff,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.070
never what we really
we're looking for.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:55.450
And I never heard that from any
of these uncles that I loved

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.250
and respected until
I came home on leave

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.310
from my first tour in Vietnam.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:07.870
And one of my favorite uncles,
who was a bomber and pilot

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:14.600
in the Pacific, and I noticed
that at family reunions,

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.290
he couldn't take the crowd.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:23.000
He would disappear out the back
door and walk out in the woods

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.730
and just kind of wander around.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.310
And when I came home on leave,

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:36.210
I found that I had the same
disposal toward no crowds

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.640
at all.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.220
And I wandered out behind
him and we stood out there

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.270
in the woods and he
told me his stories.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:52.700
He could share now, he
couldn't share before.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:28:02.040
So it's both of blessing
and a curse.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.340
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Guha,

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:08.400
your experience doing interviews
is unique because many--

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.220
the three of us or four of us
actually, particularly worked

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.390
with veterans and we're
asking them questions

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.250
about their military service.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:20.080
Many of your subjects while they
served in war, they then went

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:26.810
on to do also-- perform also
sort of great accomplishments.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:33.300
And how does the trauma and the
experience of serving in a war

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.540
and going through the military
experience then inform their

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.690
later actions in the way they
think about those actions?

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.990
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Right.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.150
And I suppose I should this as
a specific regard to the fact

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.010
that many of the
people that we interview

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.240
for the Civil Rights History
Project are African-Americans

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.150
and not just African-Americans.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:56.210
But going back to your question,
the way in which the war,

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.510
the experiences

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:01.240
of war influenced how
they then perform later

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.580
in civilian life was that it
brought home to them I think

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.090
in a very real and
visceral way the idea

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.830
of two separate nations
in this country.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.330
And the trauma I think
that they experienced

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:14.790
and you can hear
these, it's replete

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.910
in the accounts going back to
World War I, if anybody who was

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.670
in service who happened to be a
person of color, was that notion

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.520
of going abroad to fight for
freedom when you're denied very

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.160
of those-- many of those
same freedoms at home.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.210
You know, there's World
War I veterans who talk

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.280
about coming off the
victory ships landing at port

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.010
and the white officer says,

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.810
whites to the left,
color to the right.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.490
So on the frontlines, while you
were busy serving and fighting

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.470
for freedom and waving flags

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.960
and taking the notions American
democracy and American project

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.440
into Europe and to other
theaters, you're plunged back

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.710
into a situation which you are
again a second class citizen.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.150
And you know, men and women,
and men especially who served

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.660
on the frontlines bravely
are again relegated

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.080
to the status of
boy, back at home.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.560
And that threat carries
itself through, I think,

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.230
any one of interviews in either
the major theaters of war,

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.490
the Korean War and
the Vietnam War

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.280
if you haven't read it
already and I'm not sure,

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.020
Joe's accounts deal with those,

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:17.060
but certainly the most
traumatic experiences

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.730
of African-American soldiers
in Vietnam can be found

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.050
in Wallace Terry's
amazing oral histories

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.260
with 20 African-American
veterans called Bloods.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.560
I highly recommend it.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.690
It changed my experiences
of my--

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.610
it amplified my understanding
of what war must have been like.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.720
And I'm not going to sit here
and pretend I know what war is

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.100
like just because I heard
somebody talk about it.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.750
But you get that intensification
of experience as told

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.790
to them by those folks.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.940
And again going back
to your question,

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.610
the way in which many people

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.710
who introduce Civil Rights
History Project who had served

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.230
in Korea, I would
say, who then became--

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.050
who came fully grown into
the civil rights era, again,

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.960
it intensified their notion
that there was an injustice

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.360
which was replete at all
levels of American society

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.950
and they needed to change it.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.390
And that's where they
devoted much of their life to.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.930
And many of them did
so in the sidelines

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.060
but several significant people,
several significant members

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.900
like James Forman
went on to work

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.560
with the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee,

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.470
led access in the
frontlines of the south.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.530
And there's another
interesting connection.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:21.770
I've only had heard the notion
of trauma and PTSD with regard

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.030
to veterans and then having
embarked this project five years

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.540
ago, the Civil Rights
History Project, the same set

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:32.380
of phrases, trauma,
shock, terror, alienation,

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.900
being out of place, PTSD, all
came up in the words of people

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.210
who had never served in
war but who had served

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.040
in the front lines, in the
danger zones of the US south

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.560
when they were taking
actions for civil rights

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.710
and freedom for the
black people.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.480
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee:
And it's actually--

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.560
you know, strange way I
think piggyback of this,

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.260
but when we talk about
oral history, we are often

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.030
by collecting stories we are
commemorating our subject lives

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.590
too and their contributions
that they've made to history.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.230
And Mark, could you
talk a little bit

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.450
of how the oral history
project conducted

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.920
by the Vietnam War Commemoration
achieves the objectives

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.690
of the commemoration and how it
commemorates these historical

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.150
figures more properly?

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:15.450
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Absolutely.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.530
Congress gave us
five objectives.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.320
When they authorized
Department of Defense

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.440
to begin this commemoration
project,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.340
they gave us five objectives.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.890
The very first one and it's the
one that we're all focused on,

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.940
is to thank and honor
the Vietnam veterans

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.800
and their families, as well as
those who are held as prisoners

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.110
of war, those who paid
the ultimate sacrifice

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.280
and whose names are on the wall
and those who are still waiting

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.010
to be accounted for, that
is our number one objective.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:45.180
The mission of our branch
history and legacy is

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.420
to help the public better
understand that service

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.190
and sacrifice and ensure the
legacy that service endures

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.090
for future generations.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:55.890
So by doing these
oral histories,

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.370
we are in fact achieving
that mission in support

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.060
of that first objective.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.740
We hope to help the public
better understand what it meant

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.950
to serve in Vietnam as a
veteran from all services,

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.880
all racial backgrounds,
both enlisted and officers,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.700
to get a wide range of
experiences of what it meant

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.660
to serve during that time.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.020
And because of the Library

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.000
of Congress' Veterans
History Project

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.920
and sharing those oral
histories with them,

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.180
we want to share the legacy
of that service endures

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.480
for future generations.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.830
So in that way, that's how we
are honoring those objectives.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.690
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee:
And then to piggyback

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:35.490
over that question further,
Emily, your organization,

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:39.380
Witness to War, host integrate
videos in pedagogical materials

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:46.060
for classroom use, can you
share some stories in ways

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.360
that you've done this, in
projects you've undertaken

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.220
or ways that you have
engaged the public

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.070
and particularly school
children or teachers

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:59.360
in sharing veterans'
testimonies in the classroom?

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.660
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: OK.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.650
Yes. One of our-- One part
of our three-part mission,

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:05.950
which is preserve, honor,

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.480
and educate is obviously
this educational component,

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.450
which we have not fully
developed up until now.

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:12.810
And it's always been
kind of in the back

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.180
of our minds how do we get this
content into the classroom,

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.210
because we feel that
it's so vitally important

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.120
to understanding
war and war history

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.160
as having these first-hand
accounts.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.670
So, I have phenomenal
history teachers.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.600
I learned a lot about
the different wars,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.380
but I had no sense of
the soldier perspective,

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.650
the human aspect of what it was
like to be in war and obviously

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:38.090
to speak to Joe's point, I
can never fully understand

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.650
because I have not
been in combat myself.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:41.950
But how do we get them

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:43.820
to understand better
what we're asking

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.940
when we send soldiers
into combat.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.380
One of the things that
was very poignant for me

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.690
in this career was my
grandfather's interview.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.390
As mentioned earlier,
he was a II war vet,

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:57.760
World War II tank commander
and then served in Korea

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.400
and actually, my mother was
born while he was overseas.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.940
And as much as I knew about
his involvement in war,

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.510
I didn't know the
personal stories.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:11.980
I didn't know what kind of
heavy combat he was involved in.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.690
And until we did the
interview with him,

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.950
I didn't know what went
into being a veteran.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.910
For me, it was him going to
VFW meeting and him marching

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.790
in parades and getting together
with those other veterans,

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:28.580
but not this first hand boots
on the ground, the sights,

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.500
the sounds, the smells of war.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.390
And so when we did that
interview with him,

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.810
it opened my eyes to
this whole new idea

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.200
of collecting this
information from veterans

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.780
and I got more involved
in the Witness

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.080
to War Foundation at that point.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.400
And I just think it's
so important for people

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.120
to better understand
what goes into combat,

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.730
to have these first-hand
accounts.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.870
And so one of the things
that we're doing to get back

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.870
to the original question,

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.480
is launching educational
component to our website.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.080
And so essentially what we
did was we took some interns,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.910
some high school interns
this summer and have them go

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.500
through all of the content
on our site, over 5000 clips

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.920
from the nearly 2300
interviews that we've done.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.640
And pull out vignettes
from these major battles,

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.600
Battle of the Bulge, Ia Drang
Valley, across World War II,

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.000
Vietnam and Korea and come
out what we called modules.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.720
So five clips from
particular battles,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.380
particular types of experiences.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.900
So if you are a teacher in a
classroom and you're teaching

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.290
about the Battle of the Bulge,
trying to bring the dry pages

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.020
of history to life for students,
so they can come to the site

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:36.050
and you can see five clips
from guys who were there,

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.740
who felt the cold, who knew the
frightening experience of being

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.030
under artillery fire and trying
to bring that to life as much

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.710
as possible to create a
better sense of understanding.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.900
So that's one of the things that
we're doing and hoping to launch

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.980
that actually in
the next few months,

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.740
but we're working
on that currently.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.790
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Guha,
during some of your interviews,

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.820
you undoubtedly know details
of your subjects' lives.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.550
And when you know
information, when we know it

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.040
as an oral history,
when we know information

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.000
about our subject's
lives, how do we let

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.770
that information
shape the interview?

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.330
Are there any methodological
tricks

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.510
or procedures we should follow?

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.450
Should we let that
shape the interview

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:20.350
or should we just proceed
with the normal questions?

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:21.650
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yeah.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.950
That's an excellent question.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.960
A, we do have to know something
about the subject and we have

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.130
to know something about
topics that we're going

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.040
to be asking questions about
and we have to know something

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.630
about the interviewee
themselves,

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.070
simply because it's respect.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.710
You have to understand
who they are

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.910
and how they are
situated historically

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.500
because that informs the
questions that you asked.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.150
And perhaps the methodology

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.660
that I employ might be a little
different from oral historians

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.990
in that I'm not really all
that interested in the answers

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.400
that people have to my
questions, I'm interested

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.480
in the stories that my
questions elicit from them.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.180
And the story shape further
stories and further questions.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.600
So in point of fact
when, you know,

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.000
it's methodological principle
we say, well, you may have 10

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.300
to 15 questions in your packet,
if you go beyond question five

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.140
and just start asking your own
question seven, eight, nine,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.760
and 10, then you really not
have a very good interview

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.350
because the point is to let the
interviewee shape the direction

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.760
of the interview as
much as possible.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.570
And then the balancing act is to
say how do you rein them back in

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.430
and actually get to some of the
points that you want to cover

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:26.210
because I think Mark alluded
to earlier, you want something

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.610
on the historical record that
is in that person's voice.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.640
It's not just mediated,
interpreted and analyzed

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.160
and filtered through
all of the knowledge

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.860
that you have purportedly
about that topic.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.530
You want to let the fullness of
that person's experience be part

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.160
of the historical record.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.990
And that really is the way

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:47.700
in which the interviewee
coauthors in that interview.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.880
That's really the
guiding principle,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.190
I would say if there
is such a thing.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.170
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Then three
final questions for the group.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.460
What are or are there some lines

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.910
that the interviewer
should never cross?

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.830
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin:
The first I would--

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.940
you know, we've interviewed
quite a few Vietnam veterans

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.440
and overwhelmingly, they
perform well and honorably.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.620
Some made some mistakes
that they have talked about.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.230
And the most important
thing you can do

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.390
as an interviewer is
not make judgments.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.710
They are going to be very, very
honest and it is that candor

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.570
and honesty that you
want in the interview.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:28.480
And so, they may say things that
may surprise you or shock you

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.540
and it's your job to
maintain your own objectivity

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.290
and not make judgments on
what they might tell you.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.790
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee:
Anything to add Joe?

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.860
OK. Do you?

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.160
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Lines--

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.260
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Lines
you should never cross.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.950
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: If you know
something about the subject

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:51.510
and you know something about
the person you're interviewing

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:54.290
and there's a particular
traumatic event, you may want

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:57.370
to broach it with the greatest
of care and consideration

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.240
and not avoid bringing
up something

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.040
which traumatizes the person.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.620
On the other hand, there has
been-- there are ample moments

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:05.930
and I think all of
us here would agree

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.890
that when somebody
broaches a topic

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.730
which you think is shocking,
but which they really want

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.990
to get out, you know, out
of their own consciousness

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.980
and into public view because
it's the first time they've told

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.710
it or it's the first time
that they've ever been able

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:19.930
to speak-- articulate it in
a way that's safe for them

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:23.020
and that's part of it is that
you have to at all times,

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.660
I think, try and ensure
that their safety,

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.130
and that's psychological
well-being and all of that,

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:31.010
is paramount in the way in which
you conduct the conversation

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.310
that you're having.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.060
And that's just something which
comes up in a situational basis.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.360
There's no template for it.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.270
You can't write it
down in guidebooks

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.570
and you can't teach it.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.590
You won't know it until
you encounter that moment

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:45.790
of where is that tipping point.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.580
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley:
To build on that,

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.340
that's kind of how we
view things as well.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.790
And we will broach subjects with
the interviewees to get a feel

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.980
for what they're comfortable
with and the second

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.340
that they are uncomfortable
or they don't want

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.710
to go further, we stop.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.840
We are not there to interrogate.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.260
We are there to provide an
outlet for them to share

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:12.220
and to feel comfortable and to
feel welcomed to open up to us.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.690
For me, it's just ethically
wrong to push somebody

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.040
on a subject that they don't
want to discuss and especially

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.180
if they have told us beforehand,
you know, here's some things

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.880
that I don't feel
comfortable talking about,

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.180
we will never go into those.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.980
And if somebody does get
emotional, we pull back

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.800
and we give them a moment
to compose themselves,

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.400
let them guide us at that point.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.360
And if it's something that
they want to go further into,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.680
we're happy to be
that outlet for them.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.360
But if they decide that they
need to make a turn and go

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.130
in a different direction, we
are always respectful of that

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.170
because we want to
provide the best experience

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:46.000
for them in opening up to us.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.660
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Can I just
maybe ask you a question or--

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.960
and Mark also a question?

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.140
So somebody says
something on a camera

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.730
and then they later decide that
they have perhaps revealed more

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.670
than they wanted to know,
what is your approach

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.440
to those kinds of situations.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:03.740
Any of my colleagues here.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.040
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley:
I can take that.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.340
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Sure.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.640
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: We-- Well,

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.000
I always call us the
keepers of these memories.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.250
We are not the owners
of these memories.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.960
So we have had and
it has been very rare

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.900
that somebody will come
back and say, you know,

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.870
I know I shared this,
but it's for my family.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.540
We'll have people go on
to emotional, you know,

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.600
outpourings that they
wanted for their families

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.590
that they don't want
necessarily online or something

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:27.890
that is uncomfortable for them.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.780
I actually had a gentleman
who had an entire tape

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.120
that he decided he
wasn't comfortable putting

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.420
out in the public.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.490
And we give them that right
because we're asking so much

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.920
of them already in
opening up to us.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.170
For a lot of these gentlemen and
women sometimes we're strangers,

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.730
and so we understand
that we're asking a lot.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.360
And so if they come
back and they don't want

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.440
to share something, we mark it
as something not to be shared.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.960
Or I'll tell our editors not to
share it, but we are respectful

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.940
of that because we're asking
so much of them to begin with.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.240
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin:
And we do the same,

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.010
we actually had a veteran
come back and said, you know,

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.790
I called the person
out by name--

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.090
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Right.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:04.390
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: -- person
they were complaining about,

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.850
they call them out by name,
I shouldn't have done that,

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.620
can you edit that
out and absolutely.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.840
As then we said,
we don't own these.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.490
It's there-- Those are there
experiences, so we honor that.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:13.790
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Right.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.090
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: And to
follow up real quick if I can,

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.670
even after editing if
somebody wants to pull it

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.090
from the website, we
give them that option too

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.640
because we are here
to be respectful--

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.940
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Right.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.240
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley:-- of
what they're sharing.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.540
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Right.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.840
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: So then
on the flip side though,

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.590
are there some-- are there any
lines that we must always cross?

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.400
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: See, I'm not
sure I understood the question,

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.970
but I'm going to reinterpret

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:41.330
that as how far do we push
things maybe and I'll tell you,

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.200
I don't think there's
any question

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.880
that should off the table
but going to Guha's point,

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.960
you have to recognize that some
of these questions are going

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.670
to require-- they're going
to require an awful lot

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.810
of sensitivity because
they are difficult.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.260
One of the questions we
asked about Vietnam veterans,

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.990
what was your worst day?

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:03.640
Well, there are a lot of worst
days in Vietnam and we know

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.710
that that is a very,
very difficult question

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.070
for some of our veterans.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.750
But I think that if the
question is asked with respect

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:14.310
and a certain amount of
sensitivity, I guess I would say

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.320
that probably all
questions are on the table

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.040
and not necessarily
off the table.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.300
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: And
we balance the question,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.230
what is the worst day
of your year in Vietnam

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:36.550
by immediately asking what was
your best day in that tour.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:44.010
And we find those two questions
elicit some very good responses.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:47.710
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: I'd
like to actually expand

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.010
on what Joe just said.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.420
You know, we talked a
lot about the combat

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.720
and the war experience
and we kind of go

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.190
in a different direction as
well in some of our interviews,

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.940
what was something
humorous you saw.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.430
We're talking about 17, 18,
19, 20-year-old kids away

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:05.130
from home overseas with a
bunch of other 17, 18, 19,

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.750
20-year-old kids, for the
first time some of them.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.530
So we ask about the
humorous experience,

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.260
it's not all the bad stuff.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.430
We want to know what you ate,
what you think of the food,

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.140
what was the funniest
thing you saw,

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.360
what was something
interesting that you did know

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.370
about another culture,
things like that.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.120
So we try to get the full story.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.370
And I kind of interpreted
this question a little bit

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:27.860
differently as well in terms
of lines to always cross

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:31.390
which is kind of going back to
one of my earlier responses,

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:34.120
which is picking up
on the little things.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.950
It's something that,
as an interviewer,

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:40.590
so vitally important to push
them, to think of things

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:44.610
that they might not have pulled
out of there memories in 20, 30,

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.200
50, 70 years sometimes.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:51.080
So, it's being able to recognize
those little tidbits and expand

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.970
on those further and push them

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:56.490
to explore their
memories further.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.630
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: So
lastly, as an interviewer,

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:04.090
what role should we have
in a difficult balance

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.320
between objectivity and memory?

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.280
Are these two incompatible,
objectivity and memory?

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.540
And do we-- should we take on
the role where we are trying

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:21.060
to guide the interviewee toward
a more objective interview?

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.150
&gt;&gt; Guha Shanar: So the people

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.960
with whom we've been
conducting interviews,

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.190
and I assume this also
the case for folks here,

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:31.080
is that we're asking
60, 70-year-olds

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.600
to recall what was like,
I think as Emily's point,

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.950
when they were 18, 19, and 20.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.420
So not only has time passed

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.630
but they themselves have had
a chance to reflect on it

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:44.240
in many occasions and
reconsider what their actions

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.050
and what their feelings were.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.020
The subject-- The objectivity
question, I'm not even sure

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.880
that I use that word because
all of our relationships,

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.680
all of our memories
are intersubjective.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.560
We're always balancing
them and filtering them

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.110
to the experiences we've
had since the moment

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:00.810
that they occurred and
something has happened.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.970
We've always accrued
all of these memories

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.400
and especially the case
with people who have--

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.400
who are looking back in
the long, in a duration

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.500
of their lives and looking
through a time tunnel back

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.920
when they were like--
when they are,

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.340
as they were 50 and
60 years ago.

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:18.680
So memory is always fragmentary.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:22.750
Memory is always
inflected by other memories

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:24.090
and memory is always partial.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.340
And partial in both
senses of the term.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.480
It's partial because it is
fragmented and it is partial

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.600
because you have a particular
way in which you wish

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.590
to view your actions or the
actions of those around you.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:36.600
So I don't really worry
too much about the memory

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.240
and objectivity question.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.550
What is the story that
they want to tell,

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.000
it just comes back to that.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.980
And how you balance that out
against the historical fact

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.280
after you get to the interview,

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.120
that's your own business
as an interviewer.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.420
This sort of goes back
to the question of,

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.590
do you correct people in
the middle of interview.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:55.420
I take grave exception to my
colleagues who, and I insist

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.540
on saying things at
well, you said 63

00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.390
but I think I actually meant 64.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.000
Well, does it really matter?

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.360
I mean, at that moment
of the interview,

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.980
you can always correct
that after the fact

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.290
but all you do is just introduce
more doubts into somebody's

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.420
in a historical perspective
and memorialization

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.750
of an event that happened.

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:13.050
That takes people off track.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:16.710
It just doesn't really serve
the purpose in that sense.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:19.500
That's-- So that's where I
stand I think in that question.

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:23.720
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: And I
would throw in that, you know,

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:30.070
I am an old Texas
storyteller and I love stories

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:35.760
and really see-- my job
as an interviewer is

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:42.030
to make them feel
comfortable enough

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:47.850
to begin telling their
stories and telling them--

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:51.490
and let them go with it
where they want to go.

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:56.990
If they want to go for two
hours, we're quite fine.

00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:02.410
We can change the chip in those
cameras and let them roll.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:10.290
And I find that the truth and
objectivity is less important

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:14.860
than getting them to open
that vein and let it flow.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.770
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: I guess the
only thing that I would add is

00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:21.070
that as the interviewer,

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.320
you have to make sure you
don't ask leading questions.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:28.070
So if a veteran comes back
and expresses an experience,

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:30.650
we've had some-- tell us
about some horrible combat

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:33.350
that they had and they were
told to do it on a mission

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.890
and you got a sense that
they blamed their leadership

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:39.200
and so a question you
wouldn't want to ask, I guess,

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.300
is well you probably
get really angry

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.600
at your leadership over that.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.690
Well, that's kind of obvious,
you don't need to ask them

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.030
that they probably will
tell you or they will not

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.330
but that's not your job.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:52.030
So, in terms of objectivity,
you do have to be careful not

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.190
to ask those kinds of leading
questions that go to an answer

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.980
that you're expecting rather
than this Guha and Joe said,

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:02.180
just let the veteran take
the interview where he wants.

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.580
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: And if I
may add on that a little bit,

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.250
the way we look at witness
stories, we're not trying

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:12.690
to be the historical record,
we're trying to complement it,

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:16.450
to supplement with the human
aspect of what you find

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:18.770
in the history book, what
the media has covered.

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:21.440
There's no amount of
writing that can be done

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.440
that can tell you what a soldier
saw in combat, the sights,

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.260
the sounds, the smells and the
emotions that they were feeling.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.140
So, the way I look at it
is you give me a battle

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.900
and I'll give you
somebody who was there

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.910
who could tell you what
it really felt like.

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:39.700
Not the movements of the units,
not the overarching aspect

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.050
of the war, the political
viewpoint,

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.460
that's not what we're
looking for.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.790
We're looking to supplement
that historical record

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.620
with the people who were there
and even in a, I know a lot

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.530
of these-- all these guys
can probably speak to this,

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:53.910
you get guys who are in
the same, exact unit,

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.720
in the same combat
situation, two feet apart

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.360
and saw a different things.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.540
It's impossible to cover all
that in a written record.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:04.920
And so, what we're trying to
do is give that human aspect,

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.220
the soldier perspective.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.960
And what we in a lot of
times do and just speak

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.040
to Mark's point is,
we won't lead them

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.390
by asking particular questions,
but we can help guide them.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.900
So, if they're having trouble
coming up with the name

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:23.200
of an island, we can
help bring that to them.

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.450
And then that's why it's
important as interviewer

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:27.230
to know your historical context.

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:31.300
Then we're all, you know,
students of military history,

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:34.030
whether it's something that
we did professionally or kind

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:35.670
of just came organically.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:37.930
And it's important
for us to be able

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:40.700
to help guide them especially
with the older veterans.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.120
For example for us,
for the Witness--

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:46.240
excuse me World War II veterans
being able to help guide them.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.540
And so, it's important also

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.890
to know your subject before
you dive in to an interview

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.390
so that you can help them

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:54.370
through that process
as much as possible.

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:57.010
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Thanks and
I'd like to open the floor

00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.910
to questions from the audience.

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.190
Yes please.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.490
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.790
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: We have--

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:09.480
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry I have
a microphone for you.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.780
&gt;&gt; OK. Thank you.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.880
I was going to ask
Emily in particular.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.390
Thank you for telling me
about your foundation.

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:17.900
I didn't know about it,

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.780
first thing about the
Veterans History Project

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.600
because I work here and
I've actually interviewed

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.900
some people.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.760
Apparently, there are
other organizations

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.110
that also do something similar.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:33.770
So, is the role of your
foundation to be complementary,

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:36.720
not competitive Veterans
History Project,

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.090
I was just wondering if--

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:42.220
I know school children
are certainly encouraged

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:45.280
around the country to work
with Veterans History Project,

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.770
but what if a veteran
is approached and says,

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:50.720
"I already gave an interview
to another organization."

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.390
Apparently, the state
of Texas has one too,

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:56.880
Voices of Veterans in Texas.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:02.170
So, is it helpful for a veteran
to give more than one interview.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.360
I know not to the
same organization

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.660
but to other organizations.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.240
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: That's a
really interesting question.

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.760
And actually, we do some work

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.060
with the Veterans
History Project

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.740
and also the Vietnam
War Commemoration.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.630
We've actually been
collaborating with Joe and Mark

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:18.310
to interview Vietnam veterans

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:20.760
around the country using our
interviewer and videographer

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.960
to help supplement their work.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.950
So, there is some
overlap as you mentioned

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:26.650
between our organizations
and we donate

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:28.100
to the Veterans History Project

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.310
and they come to
us for things too.

00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:34.150
So, we do run across people
who have had interviews done

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:35.960
by multiple organizations.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.900
I think the thing I
would say about that is,

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.570
it depends on the
veteran if they are open

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:44.480
to doing multiple interviews,
we'll certainly do that.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.330
And every interviewer
has a different style.

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.910
People are looking
for different things.

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.640
Some people are looking
for different aspects.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.590
You know, if it was
a three war vet,

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.480
somebody may only be
looking towards them

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.640
for Vietnam content.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.940
And we maybe wanted to
cover the whole spectrum.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.750
So, it kind of, you know, goes
in a lot of different ways.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:04.620
One thing that differentiates
Witness to War

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.840
with some others groups that
we are not specifically focused

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.800
on one geographical location.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.460
So, we travel across
the country.

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:16.220
We've been all the way
to Oregon and California,

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.550
all the way up to New York.

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:21.760
So, we cover a wide
range of people.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.400
We also go to a lot of reunions
where we get veterans together

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.690
from the same units,
from the same wars.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:29.410
So, we're not focused
on one particular area.

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.430
We don't just stay in Atlanta
and do interviews there.

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:35.850
We're actually going to
Arizona with Mark in a few weeks

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.200
to do some interviews out there.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.210
So, there are a lot of
people doing things similar,

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:42.520
there are a lot of vets.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.390
And there are a lot of
vets in obscure areas.

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:47.640
And I always say that's kind
of my sweet spot is finding

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.180
that vet in a rural area
who never had an outlet

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.570
to share their story and
doesn't live in a big city

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:54.610
where there are these
organizations.

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:57.550
And those are the type of people
that we're fortunate to get to.

00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:01.330
Did that answer well?

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:02.630
OK.

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:06.500
&gt;&gt; So, I have a question
about-- my name is Ken.

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.060
I wrote the letter so it's
not a planet question.

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:16.230
OK. I believe that you're
[inaudible] you talk to veterans

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.970
about their war time experience.

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:23.520
And the question I have
is, in these interviews,

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:28.120
do veterans come to you or
do you ask the questions

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.390
of how their war
time experiences

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:35.150
and stories affected them
as a person, at the war,

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:37.080
realizing many years had passed.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.380
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Yes.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.770
&gt;&gt; Do they give you a good and
bad in different, say topic.

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:44.740
I think that's important to
talk with veterans about that.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.660
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: Toward
the end of the interview,

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:50.740
we always ask that question.

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:56.230
Did your experiences in
combat affect your life

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.970
after you got out of the army?

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:01.920
How did it affect your life?

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.290
And they're very
open and honest.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:10.460
Some will say they fought their
demons with alcohol and drugs.

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:13.470
And thank God, they survive that

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:19.860
and have gotten along
to a better place.

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:26.380
We ask them, have you visited
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial?

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.790
And what are your
thoughts when you go there?

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:36.620
And I've seen men just
absolutely breakdown and weep,

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:39.100
trying to answer that question.

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:41.740
But we do go into that.

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.570
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: There's a
whole section at the very end.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:45.470
We have a section
called reflections

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:48.140
where we ask those kinds of
questions, what did the war mean

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:49.720
to you in your generation?

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.790
How did it affect
your life afterwards?

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:53.650
Some did have trouble adjusting.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:55.570
Some went on to become
attorney's general

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:57.400
for the States of
Hawaii and other states.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.430
I mean, so there
are success stories

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.270
and there are less
successful stories.

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:05.370
But ultimately, they all come
back and they figure it out.

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:07.720
But, yes, great question
and, yeah,

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.140
that's one of things
we address them.

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.440
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: OK.

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.740
Do you want to add in?

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.040
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yeah.

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.340
And I suppose to mean,
if you want to look

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.020
at the freedom struggle as war
by another name in this country

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.630
and the people who are
there in the frontline

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:24.590
as I mentioned before, those
were formative moments for them.

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:25.890
And some of them carried it

00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:27.220
through with them
all their lives.

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.960
And some of them still
carry through with all the--

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.050
carry through the experience
of those events in Mississippi

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:36.370
and Georgia and North
Carolina to this day.

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.790
And it shaped who they were
and it shaped them as people

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:40.240
and it shaped the
kinds of projects

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.710
that they were involved in.

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:44.340
And they will tell you that it
gave them the sense of identity

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.230
in ways that they didn't
even can see those before.

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.670
And that's always the question,

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:52.380
is it's not just what did you
do during the war slash civil

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:55.510
rights movement, slash
this event, that it's--

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:58.760
how did that, you know, make
you the person you are today.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.850
And how does that influence the
decisions, the choices you make.

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:04.420
And more importantly,
how do your--

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:08.160
what would you say your
experiences are and how--

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.220
what kind of advice would
you give other people want

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.370
to follow along in
your footsteps.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:15.810
So, these notions of shaping in
which these events do for you.

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.680
And we try to get that--
get at that, I think,

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.340
is a lot of historians
do in every interview

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:23.550
that we do whether it's the
American Folk Life Center

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:26.080
Civilized History
Project or any project

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.730
that folks here have
done perhaps.

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:33.460
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Oops,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.270
You'll be next.

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:37.460
Please go ahead.

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:39.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you for being here
and thank you very much

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:41.870
for what you do and
in particular,

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.840
thank you veterans for serving.

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.050
I am a sister of a
fallen Vietnam vet.

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:50.060
What I would like
to know though is,

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:55.440
how can the family help
the veteran prepare

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.830
for an interview?

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:01.950
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:03.250
Well--

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:06.520
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: Go ahead.

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.820
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: OK.

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.510
I mentioned one of our
first interviews was

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:12.610
with General Tom
Hill in San Antonio.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:16.450
Then we had another interview
with General Cavazos,

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:18.110
who was both a Korean
War veteran

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:19.530
and a Vietnam War veteran.

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:23.270
And General Cavazos was
in the beginning stages

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:26.720
of cognitive decline,
if you will.

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.610
And his wife worked
very, very hard with him.

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:31.230
We gave them the
questions in advance.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:33.400
And this is-- not
everybody does it this way.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:36.310
For us, we always give
the veterans the questions

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:39.380
in advance to kind of help
them prepare, to start thinking

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.790
about that time that
happened 50 years ago.

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:45.290
And she worked very, very
hard with him to prepare him

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:46.590
for that interview knowing

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:49.510
that some things would be
difficult for him to remember.

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:51.860
And he did well.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.960
He didn't do as well
as he would have liked.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.580
A couple of times, he
apologized, but you know,

00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.880
Joe was great with him.

00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.590
He actually-- We thought
give him, you know,

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:03.320
his state of decline,
he did extremely well.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.490
And I would credit her for
helping prepare him for that.

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:10.120
In terms of how other
family members might help,

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.660
some of the veterans,
they're right on the line,

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.460
right up until the day of.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:18.100
And we have heard, you know,
particularly the spouse say,

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.510
I really wanted him to do this.

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:21.880
I really thought it was
important that he do it.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.820
And they kind of push them along
right up to the time they sit

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.900
in that chair and some
of these folks are right

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.490
on the edge right
to the very end.

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:29.790
So.

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:33.830
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: And some of
the spouses sit there and listen

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:38.400
because they are hearing
answers and stories

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.920
that they had never heard
in 40 years of marriage,

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.900
coming out of that veteran.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.920
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: Our process
is very similar to Mark's.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.740
We actually provide an
information packet prior

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.090
to the interview as
long as it's somebody

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:56.400
that we have scheduled
ahead of time.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.420
If it's somebody that comes
to us in a reunion situation,

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:01.710
obviously we don't have
as much prep with them.

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:03.820
But it's a packet that
asks them to kind of walk

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.120
through their service.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.060
And they a lot of times will
use children and spouses

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.070
to help bring those
memories back,

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:12.070
go through their
paperwork, their photos

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.250
to help refresh them
a little bit.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.290
So, that's hugely
important for the families

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:18.710
that are helping these
veterans prepare.

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:22.190
And to Joe's point, we do have
a lot of spouses and children

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:24.340
that sit down on the interviews
and help kind of guide them

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:28.110
and remind them because, perhaps
the spouse heard the story 40

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:32.020
years ago and they can help
that veteran recall that.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.970
And I know that in the moment,
it's nerve-racking to be sitting

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:37.830
in front of a camera and
sharing these experiences.

01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:40.940
So, it may just help to
prompt them on this stories

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.160
that they might otherwise
loss over.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.460
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Ma'am, if I--

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:46.760
and this has noting to
do with oral histories.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.830
But ma'am, if I understand you,
then you are a gold star sister?

01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:52.530
&gt;&gt; I'm a gold star sister.

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:54.560
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: We have-- If
you would talk to me afterwards,

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.250
if you stay we have a
certificate of honor program

01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.550
for families of fallen
Vietnam Veterans I'd

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:00.850
like to talk to you about.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.450
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Sure.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.140
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: We
have a question over here.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.440
[Inaudible]

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.740
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: That was next.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:10.100
&gt;&gt; Have you ever had
the opportunity or goal

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.550
of interviewing any of our
past adversaries or allies

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:18.530
with the irony being our
past-- some of our past allies,

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:21.780
some of our worst enemies,
potentially and vice versa,

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.470
some of our enemies are now
some of our best allies.

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:27.950
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: We have
interviewed the enemies

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:30.780
of Americans who came
here as refugees.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.360
We have not interviewed
any of the five allies

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.300
that provided combat forces.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.900
Remember in terms of-- I mean,
the Koreans, the Australians,

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.200
the [inaudible],
Philippines, and Thai,

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.500
we have not interviewed
them yet.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:47.010
Right now we're focused on those
US service members that served

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:48.570
in Vietnam, but we
have interviewed some

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:49.930
Vietnamese-American refugees.

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.550
And we have interviewed
some gold star families.

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:56.170
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: And I would
say that in doing the research

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:59.980
for writing the book,
"We Were Soldiers Once...

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:05.980
and Young", General Moore and I
returned to Vietnam two times,

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:11.580
to Hanoi and sat and
did recorded interviews

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:17.740
with General Vo Nguyen Giap, the
commander of the enemy forces

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:23.740
with General Nguyen Huu An Wen,
who was Moore's opposite member

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:28.260
in the battles of the la Drang
and with General [inaudible],

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:33.390
who was a central
committee member

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:37.290
and was the political officer

01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:40.480
of the entire North
Vietnamese army.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:48.420
And we found the more we talk,
the more truthful they became.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:54.930
And we could not have
had the same book

01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:57.630
without having heard
their voices

01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:00.870
and reflected them in the story.

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:04.610
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: And I will say

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:07.790
that are many historical
accounts of the freedom struggle

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:11.420
which actually focus on the
responses and the reactions

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.350
of people who were
segregationist,

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:17.530
why segregationists, who's
failed to this day, spouse,

01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:20.960
principles and the patterns
of thought which never changed

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.740
over the course of
50 or 60 years.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.030
So, those kind of stories
are also available for--

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:28.140
in many other venues, I think.

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.600
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: They should
be interviewed from prison.

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.320
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: We've
also interviewed people

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.620
on the other side.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.430
We actually have interviewed
other allies as well,

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:42.020
British royal, marine
to get that perspective.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.340
And we've interviewed
a German soldier.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.890
I interviewed personally
a young man

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.520
who was a Hitler
youth in World War II.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.380
And I find this perspective
interesting

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:55.220
because they were no
older than our young men

01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.520
that we were sending off to war.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.840
And it's interesting
to see what they knew,

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.910
what they had been told,
how they had been formed

01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:01.520
to have these opinions.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.960
And the Hitler Youth for
example, he was a kid.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.520
And, you know, and I find

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.050
that perspective
incredibly interesting

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:09.580
because he was going based off

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:12.350
of what propaganda he had
been fed his whole life.

01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:14.930
And so, I think it makes
sense more well rounded

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:17.720
as interviewers to understand
the other side of the fence

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.630
and to know where
the enemy was coming

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.490
from in their mindset as well.

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:25.780
And it helps form questions
for our veterans when going

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.540
into that process as well, to
talk to them about the enemy

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.910
and what they knew about them.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:33.750
So, I find those interviews
incredibly important.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.200
We don't seek them out.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.250
But when they come to us, we
certainly take that opportunity.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.550
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Yeah.

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:41.200
And I think Ken Burns
latest series has a number

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.340
of interviews with members
of Viet Cong and NVA

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.390
who are talking about
there misperceptions

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:47.970
of what America was
about just in the way

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:49.370
that Americans have
misperceptions

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:50.670
about what Vietnam was about.

01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:55.600
I found that completely
revealing still to this day.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.980
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: Sir.

01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.280
&gt;&gt; Joe Davis: Hi.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.580
I'm Joe Davis, and I'm the
public affairs director

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.880
for the National Veterans of
Foreign Wars Organization.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.310
And I want to thank Emily
for the shout out there.

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:06.360
I want to tell a quick
story about Joe Galloway

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:09.980
and then ask a question.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.660
My introduction to Joe
Galloway, a younger--

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.410
a much younger captain
back there

01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:16.350
in the dessert shield storm.

01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:19.920
We had a list of I want
to say about 125 reporters

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.420
to interview General
Schwarzkopf, one-on-one.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.720
Huge list.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.750
He shows up in theater
like three days

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.450
after the air war started.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.680
He goes right to the top of
the list, just like that.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.780
I asked my colonel, who
was that, who was that?

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.410
They told me a story.

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:37.730
Young Joe Galloway interviewed
a young Major Norman Schwarzkopf

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:39.030
in Vietnam.

01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:40.530
Basically asked him, Major,

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:43.040
what's the definition
of close air support?

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.770
Major Schwarzkopf says
a hundred B52 circle

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:48.920
and overhead waiting
for my call.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.220
That made it into print.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.540
They were lifelong friends.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.030
He made it in the
theater and boom,

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:54.330
right to the top of the list.

01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:56.170
It's all about relationships
right there.

01:06:56.170 --> 01:07:00.240
My question is, as you're
interviewing your people during

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.640
that go, no-go time,
what do you do

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.130
when you absolutely know your
interviewee as blowing smoke?

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:14.320
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: You let him
talk and you deal with it later.

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:17.280
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley:
I'd say exactly.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.580
Yeah.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:24.080
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: I would call
back one interview that I did

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.070
and I would only say as
brown watered navy guy.

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:38.000
And I asked the lead question
in our list of many questions

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.560
and this guy was a motor mouth
and he just went into a stream

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:50.130
of consciousness roll out
of utter BS and it went

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:52.780
on for probably an
hour and a half.

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.990
I never got another question in.

01:07:55.990 --> 01:08:00.690
And before it was done,
I was nodding off.

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:03.660
You know, there's nothing
you can do except throw

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.960
that film away.

01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:09.260
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: Yeah,
exactly how we approach it.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.790
And I think I can beat that Joe.

01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:13.420
I think I sat through about a
three-hour interview one time

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.530
where I knew in the
first 10 minutes

01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:19.160
that this was not
a truthful telling.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.350
And I let him go and as soon
as I walked out of there,

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:24.330
I marked the interview as
something that we couldn't use.

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:27.660
I think it's very rare for us
to come across people like that.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.410
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway:
It is very rare.

01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:31.650
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: People that
want to share their stories it's

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:33.720
because they want to
get this out there not

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.220
because they are trying
to gain fame or glory.

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:40.460
And if we ever have any
doubts I send it to somebody

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:43.680
who knows more about a
particular situation than I do.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.400
That's the beauty of being
in a situation that we're all

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.030
in is we have lots of contacts
with people who, you know,

01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:53.220
maybe better experts on
particular subjects than we are

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.520
and who can do research.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.170
Actually I have a guy,
kind of my back pocket

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:59.130
that if I have any
question I go to him

01:08:59.130 --> 01:09:01.650
and give him the information,
he can pull their records

01:09:01.650 --> 01:09:03.440
and we can make sure
that everything,

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.120
you know, matches up correctly.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.420
But it's rare.

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.100
I don't come across
that very often.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.230
And if somebody ever comes
onto the site and says, eh,

01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:12.630
this doesn't sound quite
right to me, we'll pull it

01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:13.980
until we can figure it out.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.020
So, we always air on
the side of caution.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:19.020
Fortunately, we haven't
had to do that very often.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.460
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.760
Thank you very much being here.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.060
This is really wonderful.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.570
I have a question about records
preservation and how each

01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:28.640
of you, through your respective
institutions, are ensuring

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.940
that these vital stories

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.500
that you're being told
will be available?

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.800
Are they being transcribed?

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.570
And with changing technology,
how do you address that?

01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:38.000
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: I
can take that one.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.530
That's actually a
fantastic question

01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:42.350
and I have actually bounced this
off of a lot of other people

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:45.970
in the same arena as
myself because as you noted,

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:47.770
technology is constantly
changing.

01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:49.070
We are in an environment

01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:51.330
where there's always
something new coming out.

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:53.350
Somebody recently said
to me, are you going

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:55.050
to start interviewing in 4k?

01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:57.670
And I said, no.

01:09:57.670 --> 01:10:01.640
Because this preservation
piece is something we're always

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.940
running into.

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.150
So, we've got a lot
of processes in place

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:07.370
and I'm constantly
researching how to do this.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:10.130
We back up and back
up and back up.

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:13.310
So, we have original tapes
from our first interviews

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:15.860
that were done on
little mini DVDs.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.900
We got DVD backups of those.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.630
And now we're digitizing
all of those.

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:23.430
So, I use a service in Atlanta
that goes through all that tape

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:24.730
and makes digital copies.

01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:26.270
And then we back all that up.

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:29.010
And now we're starting
to store things offsite

01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:30.930
because this is such an issue.

01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:34.100
And as we get further
into technology,

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.900
the files sizes become larger.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.190
So, then that, you know,
compounds the issue.

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:39.990
So, it's something we're
always kind of thinking

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:42.600
about because I never want
to look back in 20 years

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.360
and think we had the only
interview done with a guy

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.810
who landed on Omaha
Beach and it's gone.

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:52.190
I mean, that would be a
kick in the gut for me.

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:54.660
So, it's something we're
always kind of thinking about

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.960
and it's always evolving.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.110
So, always keeping ahead
of that and making sure

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:01.640
that things are backed up
and constantly checking that.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.170
But it's a learning curve
and it never seems to stop.

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:07.020
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: And I guess
maybe from the perspective

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:09.270
of the Library of Congress,
the American Folklife Center,

01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:12.340
I would point out my colleague
Rachel Mears in the audience

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.640
who has been dealing
with the shock and trauma

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.810
of changing technology over
the course of the last 10 years

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:21.240
of obsolete formats,
data migration,

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.050
digitization and so on.

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:27.310
And we did, I think, the smart,
if not the cautious thing

01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:29.070
by saying we're not going
to go to tape anymore,

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.450
we're going directly
to born digital

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:32.760
for the Civil Rights
History Project interviews.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.780
And all of those are
backed up on our servers,

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.380
which I've been told
reliably are suppose to exist

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.420
for the life of the
republic plus 500 years.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:45.250
So, when the roaches are all
finally in place at the Library

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:47.950
of Congress and nobody else
holds sway except them,

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:49.300
they will let us know
whether those bits

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.990
and bytes are all in place.

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:53.630
With regard to transcriptions,
we--

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:55.140
it's an enormous
undertaking as you know

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.440
to transcribe materials.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.760
We built it in to our
contracts and our project plan

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.440
that every interview
that we have was going

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.740
to be transcribed fully.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.050
We use transcription service.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:08.370
We would love to say that,
you know, as we move further

01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.220
down the line, the
crowdsourcing and this sort

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:13.830
of digital technologies
like immediate voice

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:16.140
to text transcription
tools are going

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.440
to solve the problem for us.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.420
And I'm here to bare witness

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.210
that that is absolutely
not the case.

01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:24.890
And so, I think that's
still laborious process of--

01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:27.750
and doing this by hand,
of careful listening,

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:30.220
those are all going to be
with us for a very long time.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:33.910
So, I think, back to Emily's
point, our technology is

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:36.540
in betwixt and between
the old and the new.

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.630
And we're always trying
to find ways to, you know,

01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:40.940
fit in maximizes efficiencies.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.710
But we are-- you know,
technology is not our friend.

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:46.370
It doesn't have to kill us,
but it's not our friend.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:48.880
&gt;&gt; Joseph Galloway: And the
government doesn't handle

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.710
that terribly well.

01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:52.010
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Thank you.

01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:53.310
[laughter]

01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:54.610
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin:
We will be very,

01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:56.970
very happy when we can
transfer everything we have

01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:59.390
to the Library of Congress,
the Veterans History Project

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:00.890
to ensure it lives on.

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:04.110
But we have redundant processes
in place now where we back them

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:05.940
up on a shared server.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.980
We have one person who
is transcribing these

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.810
and as Guha mentioned, it is
incredibly labor intensive

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:13.660
and he is very, very thorough.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:16.140
So that's taking some
time, but the goal is

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.960
to also transcribe these
interviews as well.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.260
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: All right.

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.610
I just saw Karen, Lloyd
and Rachel Mears break

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:24.340
on the cold sweat at that.

01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:26.410
But the thought of this
coming over to trans,

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:30.820
but I'll let them
deal with that one.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:34.390
&gt;&gt; I also come from an archival
background, and I'm wondering

01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:36.600
when you're talking about
correcting information

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.580
or editing after the fact,
if you have any process

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.650
for documenting that or kind

01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:47.110
of respectfully acknowledging
any misremembered information,

01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:49.070
things that could be
factually checked,

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:52.400
especially when you're
selecting clips to send

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.850
out for education purposes
or highlighting them

01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:57.460
in your collections
for research.

01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.010
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So, I'll take
over the very specific interview

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:01.470
from the Civil Rights
History Project

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:04.210
in which we interview
the family down south.

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:09.110
And they were prominent in their
hometowns, in the deep south,

01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:11.720
in the civil rights struggle.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.720
Along the way, they
told a story,

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.710
one of the incidents they
told was about having

01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:20.550
to transport guns in the back--

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:22.980
this is an African-American
family,

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.090
who are basically subject
to daily persecution.

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:28.270
And as a matter of
self-defense, they had guns

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:29.570
in their car that
they transport.

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.200
Now, mind you, this instance--

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.650
this incident took
place at the time

01:14:32.650 --> 01:14:35.620
of the interview 50 years prior.

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:38.960
After they told that story and
rather I would say, you know,

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.680
intense story about
them fleeing in cars

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.220
with a 16-year-old driver in a
car transporting these weapons,

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.660
they came back to us
about a year later

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:49.670
when we're getting ready to
post the materials online.

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:53.730
And they said, we believe
that we made a mistake

01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:55.030
in sharing that story.

01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:56.970
What can you do about it?

01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:58.960
We talked to our General
Counsel's Office here

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.250
at the Library and our
partner organization,

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:03.100
the National Museum of
African-American History

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.360
and Culture who had actually
initially approached us

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.660
about this.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:10.850
And we decided we were going to
redact that particular story.

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:13.890
Now, 50 years, I think is
probably-- I'm not a lawyer,

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:16.270
but I think it's well passed
the statute of limitations when,

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:18.760
you know, transporting
guns can be a problem.

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.160
But we did it as a matter of,
you know, I mean, that's just--

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.530
that's ancient history,
you would think.

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:28.350
We redacted that story,
or that piece of story.

01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:31.040
I edited out on the
online presentation.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.530
Two weeks later, the house of
that family was firebombed.

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.290
Because people have long
memories, and it's not

01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:40.040
that they heard story,
it's just that they knew

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.340
that they were telling
their story

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:43.700
to the national library,
the national museum.

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:47.580
So, the point there was, we did
it not as a matter of legality

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.770
or because we just
felt good about it,

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:52.090
but we understood
the ramifications

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:55.700
for people are far beyond our
ability to handle in terms

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:58.410
of what we do as, you know, in
terms collecting their stories

01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:00.550
and preserving for posterity.

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:02.280
There's another responsibility
that obtains

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.020
and they essentially
hint to that and said,

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.070
we could have some problems.

01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:08.980
Regardless of what we did,

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.260
the problem still
manifested themselves.

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:14.790
So, that's an extreme
example of it.

01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:16.270
And occasionally,
we make corrections

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:18.390
of the transcript more and
sort of the mundane things.

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:20.700
It's like saying the 1964,
we just say parenthetically,

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.120
in 1965 was the actual
interview.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.110
We don't go back and
edit it out, the voice

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:26.410
or something like that.

01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:29.240
And I'm not sure if
that's in your experience.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.770
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: Yeah,
we-- I mean, as for us,

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:34.590
it's such a case by case basis.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.810
A lot of our veterans,
especially World War II,

01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:38.130
they're not talking a lot

01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:40.910
about dates specifically
and things like that.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:43.950
So, that's less of
a focus for us.

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:48.740
If something were totally out of
left field, we might just leave

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.870
that out because it could
potentially ruin the credibility

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:54.690
of the rest of their interview,
which we know to be true, right.

01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:57.700
So, it's really-- it's
the subjective things.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.160
We have three editors that
go through our content.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.690
And so, they kind of go things--

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:04.640
go through things on
a case by case basis.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.180
So, it's an interesting
question.

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:09.990
I don't have a super direct
answer because it varies.

01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:14.050
We also do descriptions on each
of the clips that we post online

01:17:14.050 --> 01:17:18.350
so we can provide better context
around things if necessary.

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:21.660
And sometimes an interview clip
can't stand on its own anyways.

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.490
So, we'll use a description
to kind of lead up to

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:27.480
that particular story so we can
add notes in there and things

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.490
like that if necessary.

01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:34.110
But it really just depends.

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:36.950
It varies a lot.

01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:38.250
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Pretty
much I echo what they said.

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:42.520
We've had one example of someone
who has this to redact a name,

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.270
simply because they
called out a name.

01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:46.320
And to me that's an easy fix

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.030
and probably doesn't require
any disclaimer or caveat.

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:51.560
If we did run across that,

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.010
there's couple ways we
could probably deal with it.

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:57.690
We will-- When we start editing
these to put both on our website

01:17:57.690 --> 01:18:01.030
and share elsewhere,
we can use title cards

01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:04.690
or we can use little notes
that might amplify the content.

01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:07.860
And the guy that does
the transcribing for us,

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:10.430
he also does his own notes
with the transcription

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:14.470
and so we can call things
out there to indicate

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:17.290
that the viewer or the reader
might want to do more research

01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:19.650
or look this up somewhere
else as well.

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:22.710
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Along those
lines, on a perhaps not

01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:25.550
so intense note, there was
one interview in particular

01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:28.970
which went for four hours in the
Civil Rights History Project.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:33.650
And in it, the interviewee
who's rather salty and a veteran

01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:39.240
of the civil rights movement
dropped the word and I will--

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:43.740
it begins with an M, ends
with an R, about 20 times

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.250
over the course of
the interview.

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:47.930
And I heard it and
I was like, it's OK.

01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:51.420
Then somebody who was more prone
to like looking at these things

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.200
as though they were
in light of the fact

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.880
that they were education
materials being seen

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.940
by small children said, "Can
we do something about that?"

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:01.650
So, I spent a lot of time
bleeping out that word.

01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:03.950
That took me six hours to
get to that interview trying

01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:05.250
to like make sure that I got all

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:08.140
of those words out
off the record.

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.820
And then I left it out of the--
I edited the transcript so that

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.810
that no longer shows
up there either.

01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:14.440
You want the original interview,

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.690
come listen to it
if you want to.

01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:18.000
We have it still, so.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.750
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: That's
actually a great point.

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:22.350
And to kind of build on that.

01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:25.360
We will tag interviews.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.130
So, we want the raw emotion
and the raw language.

01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:32.260
And what they were thinking
in the moment may have been,

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:35.110
you know, with the explicit
language if they are being,

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:37.770
you know, an artillery
coming down on them.

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:42.440
So, we will mark those as, you
know, something you may want

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.330
to review before you show it to
children and things like that.

01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:47.930
So, that people can use
their own discretion,

01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:50.050
but we don't particularly
edit things like that

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:53.850
out because it's not true to
the story that they're telling.

01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:55.470
But we at least live
it up to the viewers

01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:56.770
so that they don't
pop something on.

01:19:56.770 --> 01:19:58.900
And hopefully-- I would
hope in a classroom setting,

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.140
a teacher would review
material before they show it.

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:04.100
But we try to make sure
that that doesn't happen.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.850
And then the stuff
that I mentioned

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:09.450
about our educational
component, we've actually--

01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:12.720
those clips, have tried to
pull ones that could be showed

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.020
in a general audience.

01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:17.230
And of course, if there were
anything questionable we would

01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:18.530
mark it as such.

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:21.230
But I think that's
a great point of how

01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:23.020
to handle this kind
of situations.

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.320
And you know, we just try

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.210
to make sure the viewer knows
what they're getting into.

01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:29.510
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankaer: Right.

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:30.810
I guess it's just that,
if I started noticing

01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:33.540
that word kept propping up like
every other breath, I was like,

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:36.060
OK, I think maybe we need
to do something about this.

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:41.440
But it's not-- I prefer Emily's
and let the viewer beware

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.750
or listener beware of what's
coming up in this interview.

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:50.260
&gt;&gt; Hi. Question I have is, at
the beginning of all of this,

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:54.640
you mentioned that
because the two

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:58.030
of you have military
experience, have been in combat,

01:20:58.030 --> 01:21:00.040
have been at Vietnam, you tend

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:06.860
to draw more honest,
open, real answers.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:11.150
What about those of us
who have not served,

01:21:11.150 --> 01:21:14.240
who would like to do
oral histories and would

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.060
like to be able to
get those stories

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:20.800
and that complete background.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:23.060
How do you do that?

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.360
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Well I don't--

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.750
Yeah, if implied that I do a
better job than someone else

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:31.470
who wasn't in military, that
wasn't what I was trying to say.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:35.330
We do share a common
military cultural experience.

01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:38.850
And so, you have a common
language right off the bat,

01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:40.780
that both of us are very,
very comfortable with.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:43.640
But what we're fighting
is that more and more now,

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.830
particularly Vietnam War
veterans, they're willing

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:47.350
to share their experiences.

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:50.680
Emily's videographer that
I am borrowing next week

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.960
in Arizona is also a very,
very good interviewer.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.840
He is a young man, hasn't served
in the military, and he manages

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.760
to get some very,
very good stories.

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.270
Don't mean to steal your
thunder their Emily,

01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:02.440
but he does a great job.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.150
So, I certainly wouldn't
want to discourage anyone.

01:22:05.150 --> 01:22:07.690
My only point was there
are some experiences

01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:10.470
that you simply won't
be able to relate to.

01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:12.910
That doesn't mean they're
not willing to share them.

01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:15.450
They maybe have a little
bit more difficulty.

01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:18.570
But with someone like
Joe, who was there,

01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:21.310
there's that immediate
connection that you--

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:25.540
he doesn't necessarily have to
work as hard as someone else.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.500
But I certainly wouldn't
want to discourage anyone

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.250
from doing these interviews.

01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:32.350
&gt;&gt; Emily Carley: If I may.

01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:35.260
To build on that,
obviously, I stated,

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:37.900
I don't have a military
background myself.

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:42.870
And I have interviewed, gosh,
around 6 or 700 veterans myself.

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:45.780
And now we have our interviewer
that, Mark referenced,

01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.080
who is doing interviews for us.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:50.480
He's gotten us up to
2300 or around 2300.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:56.660
And I think a lot of it
is knowing your subject,

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.660
letting them understand that
you know what they're going

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:00.960
to talk about.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.620
That you've studied the subject.

01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.310
Don't go in there
and have no idea

01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:05.610
of what they're going to cover.

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:07.290
Don't know-- you know, if
you don't know anything

01:23:07.290 --> 01:23:09.150
about what branch of
service they were in

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:12.620
or where they served, your
credibility is completely shut.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.850
So-- And also letting them
understand how interested

01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:17.150
you are.

01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:18.530
You know, it's not
about your ego,

01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:21.260
it's about helping
them find their voice.

01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:24.410
So, going in there and
humbly asking them questions

01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:29.740
in an interested manner and
not trying to, you know,

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.950
present yourself
as the know-it-all

01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:34.860
of the interview process.

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:37.270
Just letting them
open up and share,

01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:40.760
disarming yourself kind of.

01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:44.070
&gt;&gt; Andrew Ringlee: All right.

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:47.300
We would like to thank everyone
for coming to our presentation

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.220
on ongoing oral history projects
and all the interviewer.

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:54.060
We've learned a lot today
about two different veterans

01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:57.850
or history projects and
one involving civil rights

01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:00.380
participants, participants
in the civil rights movement.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.680
Thank you very much and I'm
going to give the microphone

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.510
over to Karen Lloyd for
a brief presentation.

01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:15.170
[ Applause ]

01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:17.690
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: I
think I can be heard,

01:24:17.690 --> 01:24:18.990
I'm used to projecting.

01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:21.240
But as I mentioned,
we have several--

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.390
we had couple hundred
different oral histories

01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:24.910
so we now have them
in a new format.

01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:27.330
We would like to
present the Library

01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:30.880
of Congress Veterans History
Project with 104 of these.

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.320
There are more coming.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.720
This isn't the end.

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:37.670
And we could not accomplish our
mission of ensuring the legacy

01:24:37.670 --> 01:24:40.340
of the Vietnam Veterans
Service [inaudible]

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.030
without the Veterans
History Project.

01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:43.710
So, we are very,
very, very grateful

01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:45.130
that you guys have this.

01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:48.890
And so, it is with a lot of
gratitude that we present that.

01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:50.300
And really appreciate
all you've done.

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.100
Thank you.

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:56.040
[ Applause ]

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.600
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: On behalf of a
grateful nation, we accept these

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.490
and we appreciate the work that
all of you folks are doing.

01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:06.510
And on behalf of the Library, I
would like to thank each of you

01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:08.990
for making the trip and
be willing to talk with us

01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:12.270
and with this group
about what it's like on

01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:13.570
that other side of the line.

01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:14.870
I know I have [inaudible]
a lot today.

01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:16.170
And I hope that you
all did as well.

01:25:16.170 --> 01:25:17.470
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Thank you.

01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:18.770
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: So,
again, thank you.

01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:20.550
&gt;&gt; Mark Franklin: Thank you.
