TODD KERPELMAN: Hello, and
welcome to Google Games

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.750
Chat, Episode 9.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.140
I'm glad we could get started.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.290
Sorry we missed you last week.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.870
We were eating turkey.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.490
So let's start by introducing
our panelists.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.550
Today, to my left, playing
the role of Colt

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.240
McCanless is a puppet.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.330
WOLFF DOBSON: Hello, I am
international superstar and

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.260
HTML5 advocate, Colt
McCanless.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.030
I can't be with you because
I'm recording an Udacity

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.870
course on HTML5 Game
Development.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.596
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, I'm glad
we have the puppet, because--

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:54.942
yes?

00:00:54.942 --> 00:00:58.762
DAN GALPIN: I must know, Colt,
what big teeth you have.

00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:00.882
WOLFF DOBSON: All the better
to eat you with.

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:01.806
[ROAR]

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:04.900
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, and
so to my right, wearing the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.090
panda hat, our special guest
star from the Android Friday

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.325
Game Review, Daniel.

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:12.845
Hello, Daniel.

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:13.340
DAN GALPIN: Hello.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.110
Thank you for having me on.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.480
I hear that we're not actually
going to be reviewing Android

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.590
games today, so I'm not
sure why I'm here.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.250
But I did bring a hat,
which is more than I

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.110
have done in a while.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.720
So, it's good to be here.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.830
TODD KERPELMAN: None of us
really know why we're here.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.970
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
that's right.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.230
TODD KERPELMAN: It' a
time-filler, really.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.030
I'm sorry, I should clarify--

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.085
Dan Galpin, in case you're
not familiar with him.

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:33.895
I just call him Dan.

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:34.445
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:37.680
TODD KERPELMAN: And to my far
right, our not-so-special

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.855
guest, John McCutchan.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:40.150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The
boring one.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.562
TODD KERPELMAN: The boring--
kind of the--

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:43.075
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:44.810
DAN GALPIN: This is actually
the facial hair

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.590
table, on this side.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.490
TODD KERPELMAN: Are
we kind of going--

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.270
WOLFF DOBSON: What are
you talking about?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's
the body hair table.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.935
WOLFF DOBSON: What are
you talking about?

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:52.500
I'm all facial hair.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350
TODD KERPELMAN: That is true,
but you don't count.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.950
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm not very good
at math, but you don't

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.770
have to say that.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.030
TODD KERPELMAN: And to my far
left, we have the non-puppet

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.800
version of Wolff.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.740
WOLFF DOBSON: Exactly.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.735
TODD KERPELMAN: So, welcome.

00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:04.480
WOLFF DOBSON: Thank you, sir.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We got the
Wolffs all around this side.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.020
TODD KERPELMAN: We do.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.860
WOLFF DOBSON: [LAUGHTER]

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.005
TODD KERPELMAN: So, we don't
have a demo for this episode,

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.970
I'm sort of sad to say.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.320
But maybe instead, I'll just
start by asking you guys--

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.710
what did you eat for
Thanksgiving?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.690
Did you make anything?

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.775
That's the big question.

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:21.540
So we'll start with Wolff.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.720
WOLFF DOBSON: I made
Nutella-stuffed chocolate chip

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.320
cookies, which were hilariously
awesome.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.700
TODD KERPELMAN: Those sound--
you really can't

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.190
go wrong with Nutella.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.310
WOLFF DOBSON: No, you
really can't.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.010
And you brown the butter,
and it's ridiculous.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.290
TODD KERPELMAN: That
sounds excellent.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.510
Dan?

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.030
DAN GALPIN: So, the only thing
that was pretty interesting at

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.500
the Thanksgiving table was a
pumpkin sage soup, which

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.360
tasted a lot like a butternut
squash soup, but was slightly

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.670
more orange.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.580
So not that exciting.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.434
TODD KERPELMAN: John?

00:02:50.434 --> 00:02:53.105
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No, I don't
make anything for

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:53.430
Thanksgiving.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.140
TODD KERPELMAN: Did
you eat plaid?

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.010
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes,
of course.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.260
It's a plaid pie.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.255
DAN GALPIN: A plaid
pie-- the whole--

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:02.710
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No, I enjoyed
a nice meal, though.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.300
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.440
DAN GALPIN: It is weird, because
we're here at Google,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.640
and my cooking muscles are
completely unused.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.140
TODD KERPELMAN: Atrophied?

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.780
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, they're
atrophied.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.490
I don't even know what to do
around the kitchen anymore,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.630
it's been so long.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.700
but yeah, Thanksgiving
is a good chance to

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.640
break them out again.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.030
And they're all sore
now, though.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.150
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, I feel
like at Google we get a lot of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.700
special guests that have written
cookbooks that have

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.760
great stuff.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.820
And we end up buying all of
these cookbooks, and at least

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.420
for me, I end up not really
cooking much.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.490
DAN GALPIN: But it does
decorate your

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.330
shelves in your kitchen.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.030
It makes you look like you
know what you're doing.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.640
TODD KERPELMAN: That's true,
and that's half the battle.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.575
DAN GALPIN: That's
the best part.

00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:40.060
TODD KERPELMAN: So with that
said, I think we can go right

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.660
into our Five For Five.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.066
WOLFF DOBSON: OK.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.640
TODD KERPELMAN: We don't have
a fancy graphic, so puppet--

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.700
DAN GALPIN: Do we get puppet
Colt responses?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.805
WOLFF DOBSON: Five for five--

00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:50.570
TODD KERPELMAN: I don't know.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.880
We'll have to have to ask
the puppet if he's

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.885
got anything to add.

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:55.410
DAN GALPIN: I'm sure
the puppet will.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.915
TODD KERPELMAN: Probably.

00:03:55.915 --> 00:03:57.680
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, since
the Colt is playing Colt

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.150
McCanless, clearly it's
going to say things

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.030
like, I love HTML.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.010
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.465
TODD KERPELMAN: Probably,
and report on--

00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:08.230
DAN GALPIN: That can just be
the answer to all of the

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.796
questions, really.

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:11.880
TODD KERPELMAN: Clearly
the answer is HTML5.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.760
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.645
WOLFF DOBSON: Clearly.

00:04:13.645 --> 00:04:15.240
TODD KERPELMAN: And report on
whatever he read, and--

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.070
WOLFF DOBSON: Have
you tried Chrome?

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.370
It's excellent.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.219
TODD KERPELMAN: Purple Cow.

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:19.620
DAN GALPIN: No, I've
never used Chrome.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.360
Oh wait-- sorry, go on.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.090
TODD KERPELMAN: Actually, so
side note, these Chromebooks--

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.410
really cool.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.280
DAN GALPIN: Thumbs up.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.750
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
they're really nice.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.445
If you don't have a
Chromebook, you

00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:30.070
should look into one.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Are these
the new ones?

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.270
DAN GALPIN: These are
the new ones--

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.990
they finally got the track
pad right, actually.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.750
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, the
track pad's nice.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.330
I feel like if those of you who
have parents that might be

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.170
asking for new computers for
Christmas or something, this

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.660
is a great notebook for your
parents, particularly if you

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.900
plan on spending the holidays
not doing tech support.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.445
DAN GALPIN: I was going to say,
it's the most amazing

00:04:53.445 --> 00:04:55.820
thing to actually give a parent
a computer and not

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.540
expect to spend years doing
tech support on it.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.290
It's incredible.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.580
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.490
DAN GALPIN: What?

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.140
How did you end up sending
email to all

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.550
of our friends again?

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.730
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
so product plug aside--

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.520
but I'm serious.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.040
WOLFF DOBSON: That was a
spontaneous product plug.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.330
DAN GALPIN: It is not planned.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.010
We were just using these,
and we were like,

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.210
these are really nice.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.080
WOLFF DOBSON: Chrome
is so cool.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.100
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
so our first question--

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.150
DAN GALPIN: Speaking of product
plug, suppose we live

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.340
in a world of Google Fiber,
where everybody has access to

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.600
uber-fast internet everywhere,
how does this affect gaming?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600
TODD KERPELMAN: How does
this affect gaming?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.520
And I'm going to press the Start
button to countdown.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.400
And we'll start with
non-puppet Wolff.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.490
WOLFF DOBSON: Non-puppet
Wolff thinks that

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.880
distribution is just over.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.130
You distribute digitally.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.150
And there's been a lot of
controversy about always-on

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.720
DRM, things like that.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.820
I'm not sure how I feel
about always-on DRM.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.410
But if you live in a world of
Google Fiber, it's not going

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.800
to be laggy, it's not going to
be terrible, it's going to be

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.070
just the way you interact with
the internet-- just like you

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.900
go to Chrome, just like you go
to any internet service.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.250
Am I wrong, or is local
instillation of things going

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.800
to be different?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.770
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I would take
it a step further.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.470
It's not just digital
distribution.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.330
It's going to be something
like OnLive.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.020
When you have that kind of
bandwidth and that kind of

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.000
latency, why would I ever care
to store anything locally?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.362
I would rather just
have it stream.

00:06:29.362 --> 00:06:31.620
TODD KERPELMAN: So I guess--

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.290
and I don't know all
of the technical

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.260
details behind OnLive.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.840
But it seems like one issue that
even with a super-fast

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.560
internet connection you're
never really going to be

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.670
addressing is the speed
of light problem.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.460
As far as I know, you can't
increase the speed of light

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.170
without messing up time.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.990
WOLFF DOBSON: i was going
to say, that's not true.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.430
You can slow light down by
sending it through water.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.810
TODD KERPELMAN: That is true.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.030
But you can't speed it up.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.260
Maybe if you send it
through a vacuum.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.470
But the problem is yeah, you can
get a whole bunch of data

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.280
really fast.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.360
But if you need that less than
100 millisecond delay between

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.215
when I press the fire button and
my character fires, how do

00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:08.330
you deal with that?

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.575
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I already get
much more lower ping times

00:07:10.575 --> 00:07:13.440
than 100 milliseconds today.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.900
I get ping times of 10
milliseconds, easily.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.820
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.380
To be honest, I think it's
somewhere in between.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.210
I really think that the
concept of installing

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.480
software goes away.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.680
Whether that software is
physically running on your

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.450
machine, or whether it's
actually running on some Cloud

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.675
system is really going to depend
on what makes sense for

00:07:29.675 --> 00:07:30.580
that piece of software.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.790
But I think there's a lot of
things that are going to be

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.720
able to run in the browser just
because you're not going

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.330
to have to worry about
actually going off--

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.802
it's not going to be slow,
particularly, to

00:07:38.802 --> 00:07:39.800
go and fetch textures.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.900
And all you're going to have
is a cache, basically, for

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.540
anything you're running.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.230
So I think for distribution
it does eliminate that.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.650
For me, the exciting thing is
that it enables all of these

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.550
services which have a high
bandwidth return connection.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.950
If I want to jam with people
or create live videos with

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.090
people or do that kind of stuff,
all of those gaming

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.800
experiences all of a sudden
become really possible.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.120
There's Jam With Chrome,
but, like, times 100--

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.050
that kind of stuff.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.310
Or the YouTube orchestra,
where everyone is really

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.360
sitting in a different place
in the world, that kind of

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.420
stuff becomes really possible.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.210
WOLFF DOBSON: I mean, really,
real-time sharing of the

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.035
stream on your screen to
somebody else is--

00:08:17.035 --> 00:08:17.680
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.110
WOLFF DOBSON: One of the things
that we found with

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.230
Hangout Games is that when
people are explaining rules to

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.950
each other--

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.055
like, oh, we're playing this
board game together, we're

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:28.280
playing "WarLight," we're
playing whatever.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280
You're like, oh let
me show you.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.210
And you share your screen.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.190
And you're pointing, pointing,
go here, whatever.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:38.630
And having that be as crystal
clear and as uncompressed as

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.260
the thing you're seeing there
is going to make a huge

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.250
difference in how people
interact with each

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.220
other, how they plan.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.460
If you think about "Call of
Duty" where I can have a

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.230
little pop up window that is
what the other guy is seeing,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.530
including his voice stream,
including his face, including

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:58.340
all those things, it's like
"Aliens," where they're all

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.560
sitting there looking at the
bank of screens that represent

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.730
all the people.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.220
You can do that, and it's not
a hardware headache for your

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.205
home machine.

00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:07.740
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So Todd, coming
back to your point

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.170
about latency--

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.320
the interesting thing, if you
have an online multiplayer

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.060
game and the video is being
streamed to you, then you can

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.530
actually co-locate--

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.800
all of the people that you're
playing the game with can

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.170
possibly be on the same
physical machine.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.810
So the latency, in terms of

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.640
client-to-client latency is erased.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.930
And then you only have the
latency of your input control

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.660
and the video stream
coming back.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.630
And so that's just one way.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.570
There's no interdependencies
between me and any of the

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.880
other players in terms
of getting the video.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.750
But in terms of like, hey, I
think the player is going to

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.750
be over here in 10 milliseconds,
if we're all on

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.880
the same machine, we could even
be on the same instance

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.320
of the game.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.410
DAN GALPIN: Well, you can take
that even back, though.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.140
And If you're running a server,
with this kind of

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.530
connection, you can actually
have the server really doing

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.380
everything.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:02.980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes, exactly.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:08.060
DAN GALPIN: And even if it's not
actually streaming video

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.360
in both directions, even if
all it's doing is sending

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.680
polygon data across, there's a
whole bunch of ways you can

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.210
split that.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.820
But I think you're right.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.630
I think it just makes the
whole interactive game--

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.480
WOLFF DOBSON: That's a really
interesting thought, where you

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.560
actually stream the display list
for your graphics card

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.270
over your internet connection.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.920
So it renders really fast and

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.010
beautifully on your own machine.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.940
I don't know that that would be
bigger or smaller than just

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.036
sending the--

00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:31.915
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
I don't know.

00:10:31.915 --> 00:10:33.010
WOLFF DOBSON: Except that
you're outsourcing.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.440
You don't have to have four
video cards for players on

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.620
your server, you just have to
send the display data, and

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.850
then the video card will--

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.670
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You would have
to cache things like the text

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.560
buffers and textures.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I think
caching is going to be a huge

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.750
part of that, anyway.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.300
Except that you don't have to
sit there and think, oh, I

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.310
only have eight gigabytes or ten
gigabytes of space on the

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.960
machine, and I want
to play this game.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.500
You're just going to dynamically
stream those

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:53.950
things out.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:57.420
And if Colt were here, he'd be
all about instant-- oh wait,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.260
Colt is here.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:58.680
What do you want?

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.350
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, we
need to ask Colt.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.380
We were actually going
to have six.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.780
WOLFF DOBSON: More Chrome.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.205
Excellent.

00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:04.455
Yes.

00:11:06.486 --> 00:11:09.480
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, I'm
going to stop us there.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.210
WOLFF DOBSON: Curses.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.450
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm sorry.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.415
The countdown timer
has spoken.

00:11:13.415 --> 00:11:13.770
WOLFF DOBSON: [GROWL]

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.480
TODD KERPELMAN: And I'm going to
move to our next question,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.350
which is, so I feel like lately
game releases have

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.410
become cultural events.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.770
And they are considered
normal.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.540
It's not like, oh man, look at
all these freaks hanging out

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.330
in line for "Call of Duty." It's
like, oh, "Call of Duty

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.540
Modern Warfare 2" is out--

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.240
wait, sorry, "Black
Ops 2" is out.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.290
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, I
was going to say.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.040
TODD KERPELMAN: "Call of Duty
2," that was a while ago.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.162
WOLFF DOBSON: '02.

00:11:38.162 --> 00:11:39.820
TODD KERPELMAN: And it's kind
of considered normal.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.550
And people make jokes about
people are going to call in

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.800
sick the next day.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.410
WOLFF DOBSON: "Super Mario
World 4" is coming out.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:43.520
Sorry.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.020
Yeah, I know what you're
talking about.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.750
TODD KERPELMAN: So yeah,
like that part--

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.320
DAN GALPIN: "League
of Legends."

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.440
TODD KERPELMAN: Games have
essentially, I think, in many

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.470
ways entered the mainstream.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:57.100
But I still feel like
competitive gaming, gaming as

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.780
a spectator sport has not yet
entered the mainstream the way

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.850
current sports have.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.690
What do you think the games
industry needs to do to make

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.552
gaming as a spectator sport
more mainstream?

00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:13.530
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, clearly my
answer is more Hangouts.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.816
TODD KERPELMAN: OK.

00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:17.020
WOLFF DOBSON: But I think there
are a lot of interesting

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.670
possibilities for Hangouts
there, where you

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.670
can actually have--

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.810
if you think of poker.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.205
When you're watching poker on
TV, sometimes they show you

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.100
the cards of the guy.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.340
This guy's got these cards, this
guy's got these cards,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.140
and what is he seeing.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.190
If everybody's sitting there
with the camera over their

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:41.960
shoulder, wearing some sort of
thing, or you're seeing their

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.010
face from behind the thing, and
you're able to actually

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.260
select between all those things
that are around, for

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.675
games it's the same thing--

00:12:47.675 --> 00:12:50.760
I mean, poker is a game.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.260
For these sorts of things,
I think it's the

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.070
same sort of thing.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.900
You're going to be
able to have this

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.550
personal connection with--

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.120
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: it's very
interesting as the audience if

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.120
you get to see what the state
of every player's

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.440
game view is, right?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.060
And you have that extra bit of
information that the players

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.620
competing don't have.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.940
Like, hey, I know that the guy
is actually right around the

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.870
corner, and he's going
to fragged.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.080
But he doesn't know this.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.980
So it's very exciting.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.640
DAN GALPIN: I think, definitely,
the key thing

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.960
that's missing, honestly, is how
if you look at any sports

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.730
cast today, it is so
heavily produced.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.130
You have 10 people that are
all sitting in a room.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.980
You have people that
are grabbing shots.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.840
You have people that are moving
cameras around, all

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.920
trying to get you the absolute
best view of what's going on,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.760
including replays and everything
like that.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.240
So to me, it's just honestly
getting the

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.950
production values up.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.700
There should be stats coming
up on the screen for every

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.200
player, where they've been,
how they've done in these

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.890
various matches.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.910
Some of this is already there.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.480
I mean if you actually watch--

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.030
WOLFF DOBSON: I was going
to say, if you watched--

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.500
when I was in Singapore watching
"StarCraft" on TV, it

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.610
was like, holy cow.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.960
I mean, I didn't play a lot of
"StarCraft," but I was glued

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.742
to the TV going like,
Zerg rush, Zerg

00:13:59.742 --> 00:14:01.045
rush, don't you know?

00:14:01.045 --> 00:14:03.180
DAN GALPIN: But I think the
thing that's missing is

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.450
actually designing the game so
that it's ready from out of

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.780
the box to be used as
a spectator sport.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.220
So all of those controls and
hooks and everything like that

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:18.080
is there, so that it actually is
ready to have that kind of

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.980
production in it.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.332
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, "League of
Legends" is an example of a

00:14:20.332 --> 00:14:22.310
game where they've really got
that going, because their

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.385
camera is at the 3/4 view--

00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:26.000
I'll use my wolf here
as a thing.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.180
It uses a 3/4 view, where it's
like, oh, you can see

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.560
everybody, you can see what's
going on. "StarCraft" works in

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.340
the same way.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.670
If you've ever watched really
awesome people play

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.480
"Counter-Strike," you
don't see anything.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.060
You see just like a
blur of polygons

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.730
and occasional gunfire.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.200
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, basically
everything is replays in that.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.800
You want to be able to
catch how it's--

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.925
TODD KERPELMAN: Do you think
first person shooters just

00:14:50.925 --> 00:14:53.145
can't work as a spectator
sport, because the

00:14:53.145 --> 00:14:53.485
people that play it--

00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:55.550
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, no.
"Halo" has got the new

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.530
cinema mode, right?

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.130
TODD KERPELMAN: That is true.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.710
WOLFF DOBSON: And one of the--

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.330
I think it was Activision "Call
of Duty," one of those

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.950
guys had a way you could
upload videos

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.960
and reproduce them.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.100
TODD KERPELMAN: The latest "Call
of Duty," I think, let

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.660
you instantly upload your stuff
to YouTube, as I recall.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.800
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.680
And I think that's another
thing that's

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.450
going on here, too.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.870
Football games are really big,
but they're really expensive.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.560
And they're hard to produce,
because you've got to get

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.235
60,000 people all in the same
place to watch this, and

00:15:27.235 --> 00:15:30.130
you've got to fly 200
people around.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.280
An online game that we're
playing competitively doesn't

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.360
require that much effort, which
means, I think, you're

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.770
going to need a way--

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.640
like a cinema mode, or something
like that-- to

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.360
assemble highlights and make
it into something.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.460
And then there's got to be
community that cares enough

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.240
that they're going to want to
export those to everything.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.300
And I think "League of Legends"
is at that point now

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:49.700
where they have that.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.510
DAN GALPIN: Watching "League of
Legends" [INAUDIBLE], I got

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.700
to watch it when I was
at PAX this year.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.320
And it's phenomenal.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.680
It absolutely is an event, the
way they put it together.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.210
I mean, it certainly isn't
lacking production values.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.785
I felt that one of the things
that's problematic with

00:16:04.785 --> 00:16:06.770
"League of Legends," even the
way they had it set up, and

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.460
that was certainly the best
video gaming watching

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.670
experience I've ever had-- is
that I still wanted more

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.420
connection with the people who
were actually playing the

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.740
game, versus their character
avatars.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.880
When people die, it's got
to be a human thing.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.190
It should be like you're dealing
with a reality show

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.570
kind of thing, where you
actually see the superimposed

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.650
actual person who's controlling
the player

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.310
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.440
And one thing that would be even
fun as you get further

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.900
along is to actually think about
how you map the emotions

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.410
of the person who's playing on
to the avatar that they're

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.150
controlling.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.170
You actually get some
potentially

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.430
interesting things there.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.760
You basically have real-time
versions of "The Polar

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.520
Express" or something like that,
where you actually are--

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.980
WOLFF DOBSON: You actually see
people's arm gestures and

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.520
things like that.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.760
Like, I think that's
the thing--

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.290
DAN GALPIN: Ooh, can't
show that on TV.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.600
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, well I was
going to say, I mean sort

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.350
of along with--

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.420
WOLFF DOBSON: Go there
first, huh?

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.496
AUDIENCE: You know, we've
got a question.

00:17:03.496 --> 00:17:04.920
Now, what about alternate
reality gaming?

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.579
Andre's asking about that
from the YouTube side.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:08.643
TODD KERPELMAN: What
is he asking?

00:17:08.643 --> 00:17:12.601
AUDIENCE: Alternate Reality
Gaming, it's called ARG.

00:17:12.601 --> 00:17:13.619
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, he's
talking about--

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.250
I mean "Ingress"
is an examples.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.099
TODD KERPELMAN: OK, like
augmented reality.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.349
WOLFF DOBSON: Or "I Love Bees,"
or something like that,

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:20.910
augmented reality games.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.600
DAN GALPIN: I was thinking
alternate

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.780
reality gaming, that's--

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.260
TODD KERPELMAN: That's
like "Second Life,"

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.670
we're going to have--

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.040
WOLFF DOBSON: Pretty
alternate--

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.860
no, I think yeah, that's
interesting.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.030
Because I know when "I Love
Bees" was huge, and for those

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.570
of you who aren't following the
bee references, that's the

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.480
ARG that they made for
"Halo" to try to

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.870
get everybody centered.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.410
I forget which "Halo"
release it was.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:45.995
TODD KERPELMAN: "Halo
2," maybe.

00:17:45.995 --> 00:17:48.080
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, something
like that, where they were

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.270
trying to get everybody into the
backstory of the game, so

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.160
that when it came out-- and I
think going to your thing

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.100
about these are cultural events,
games that have huge

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.110
marketing budgets, their goal is
to make it a giant cultural

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.595
event, versus an indie sleeper
hit that's going to--

00:18:00.595 --> 00:18:04.070
I'm going to sell this
for seven years.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.720
But yeah, they ended up
assembling a whole website

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.710
with everybody, and they had
people reporting back on the

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.610
phone calls that were going
out to all weird numbers

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.220
around the country.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.680
It was really neat.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.250
I have to admit, I was sort of
overwhelmed by trying to join

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.110
that community.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.380
I didn't even know
where to start.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.660
But that was definitely a
place where people were

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.490
showing their stuff online.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.340
And I think now that we have
much more complicated social

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.680
networks that have farther
reach, I think an

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.910
ARG could be neat.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.990
To be following in real time,
it's not really a spectator

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.980
sport like what you're talking
about, but it is a place where

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.850
it sort of explodes online.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.320
TODD KERPELMAN: So we're out of
time, but I'm going to add

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.390
my final thought, because I'm
the emcee and I get to do

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.100
that, which is that I feel like,
with the exception of

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.370
maybe world championships--

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.790
I can watch a "League of
Legends" game; I don't really

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.920
know who to root for-- it's
a group of three guys.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.130
It's along with making
connections with the players,

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.890
but I also think these guys need
to just start creating

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.070
regional affiliations.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.650
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Totally.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.620
TODD KERPELMAN: I can go
to any baseball game--

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.300
if I didn't know baseball, I
could still go to a baseball

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.420
game and know, well, I'm going
to root for the team that

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.630
represents my city.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.780
Like, you can just do that.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.280
DAN GALPIN: Like, you're going
to wear an orange panda hat.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.150
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm going to
wear an orange panda hat, and

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.140
look ridiculous.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.430
And it's going to be OK,
because I'm from San

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.340
Francisco, and that's
the team I know I am

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.200
supposed to root for.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.260
I feel like there's nothing
right now that connects me to

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.510
a particular "League of Legends"
team, unless, you

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.530
know, maybe it's the world
championships, and there

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.470
representing America.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.440
DAN GALPIN: That's right.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.410
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I
agree with you.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I do think
this comes to avatar

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.890
customization, too, which is
like if people are carrying

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.570
banners behind them, that really
tell these guys are on

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.120
your side, and these guys are on
the other side, I think all

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.610
of this stuff is about
signalling to the player

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.770
what's going on.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.890
And anytime you're dealing with
cameras, anytime you're

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.330
dealing with spectators,
what's going on is

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.010
really hard to tell.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.190
Only games that are analogs of
actual sports have already

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.080
figured that out.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.260
Basketball games and football
games really have

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.570
that figured out.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:04.330
Can you imagine--

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.070
it would be really cool to
watch a spectator game of

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.820
"Splintercell," maybe.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.010
Or maybe it would
just be a lot of

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.560
watching people not moving.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.757
TODD KERPELMAN: A lot of people
watching people wait.

00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:13.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes, exactly.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.960
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
let's move on.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.600
WOLFF DOBSON: Sorry, it's
fun talking about that.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.370
DAN GALPIN: Speaking
of length--

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.760
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes,
we were kind of--

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.990
so this was a question
that Colt proposed.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.560
WOLFF DOBSON: Ah, yes,
that question.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.420
TODD KERPELMAN: And he proposed
the question, and

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.280
then he didn't show
up for this.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.910
WOLFF DOBSON: At last
minute, I might add.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.540
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, so--

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.355
DAN GALPIN: The audacity
of that person--

00:20:32.355 --> 00:20:33.715
WOLFF DOBSON: The Udac-- zing!

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.820
TODD KERPELMAN: So, the question
he was asking is, in

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.570
the modern gaming era, when
is a game too long?

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.410
I think the point he's trying
to make is maybe now that

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.370
we're all kind of playing on
phones and tablets and that

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.970
sort of thing, gaming sessions
should be shorter.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.070
Or that would be
the more ideal.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.900
And I guess because John is
adjusting his mic, we'll start

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.515
again with--

00:20:57.515 --> 00:21:00.960
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All right,
hey, here we go.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.340
It's not the length of the
game that matters.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.120
It's how long it takes you
to get in and out.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.670
I would love to play a very
long game that takes--

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.500
WOLFF DOBSON: Sorry.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: --that I could
play on my phone, but if it

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.466
takes a minute to launch
the game--

00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:15.810
that in something like a
10 minute time window

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.010
of playing the game--

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.920
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I think
this is a huge deal with

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.680
mobile gaming.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.960
I always thought this was an
incredible weakness of the

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.110
PSP, was waiting for that
disc to spin up.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.560
The joke was always that my DS
is a great thing to do while

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.690
I'm waiting for my
PSP to boot.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.055
TODD KERPELMAN: I've never
heard that joke.

00:21:31.055 --> 00:21:31.965
That's funny.

00:21:31.965 --> 00:21:32.840
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it's true.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.185
WOLFF DOBSON: It was
true for me, too.

00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:35.410
TODD KERPELMAN: But we
still like you, Sony.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.840
WOLFF DOBSON: I love you.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.760
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You know,
I've been playing

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.290
"X-Com" a lot lately.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.300
And sometimes I have 30 minutes
to play this game.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.080
And that's enough to play
a short mission.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.070
But five minutes of that is
spent booting into the game.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.730
It's turning the PS3 on and then
seeing all of the logos

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:53.740
for all of the middleware.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.507
WOLFF DOBSON: I was going to
say, you know what we need?

00:21:54.507 --> 00:21:57.090
More animated logos
at the beginning.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.890
Especially games that are
licensed, so you have to have

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.600
like three licensees, and then
the-- ah, it's awesome.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:01.870
I love that.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.030
DAN GALPIN: One of my greatest
pet peeves are people who do

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.100
mobile games, and the mobile
game insists on playing at

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.450
least two or three videos.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.030
And in some gaming worlds, they
might actually be doing

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.080
something, like loading things
during the videos.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.480
But invariably, they're doing
nothing while those videos are

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.630
playing, and the user is just
saying, I just want to get

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.233
into the game, so I can have my
five minutes of gameplay.

00:22:21.233 --> 00:22:23.240
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, show me as
many of your animated logos

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.610
as you want, so long as you're
actually loading my saved game

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.330
while you're doing it.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.850
DAN GALPIN: And the worst
thing-- and the other thing is

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.110
that, in terms of mobile gaming,
you just want to be

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.740
exactly where you left off
as quickly as possible.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.215
WOLFF DOBSON: Colt says games
should be links, links.

00:22:39.215 --> 00:22:42.390
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I like this
cartoonization of Colt.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.690
WOLFF DOBSON: It's very easy.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.010
TODD KERPELMAN: i feel like
the puppet's had more

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.550
insightful comments
so far then--

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.583
DAN GALPIN: I was going
to say, Colt, what

00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:48.960
big glasses you have.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.890
TODD KERPELMAN: You're
invited back.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:50.630
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh boy,
oh boy, oh boy.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.620
DAN GALPIN: OK, so
where was I?

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.460
So to me, I like the genius of
something like "Angry Birds."

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.910
And I went back and
took a long look.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.720
Why was this game such a crazy,
breakout success?

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.550
I had played games with
almost the exact

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.120
same gameplay before.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.790
But it was you get in fast,
you get out fast.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.830
The levels--

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.250
you feel a sense of
accomplishment quickly.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.410
Like a level in "Angry Birds," a
lot of them take 30 seconds,

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.370
a minute to complete.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.770
Boom, I've accomplished
something.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.640
I've made some progression.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.320
But yet, to actually get through
the entire thing is a

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.700
long slog of an experience.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.610
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, it's
a relationship.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.740
And there's good data that the
longer people interact with

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.450
your game--

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.740
I mean, it's sort of obvious,
but you can actually see it.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.640
The longer people interact with
your game, the more they

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.210
talk about it, the more they
share it with their friends,

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.450
the bigger the viral hit of
your game is going to be.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.500
This is why "Dark Souls"
takes a long time

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.450
to get through that.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.270
Games that you fire and forget,
and you're over with

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.730
in three minutes make a
big splash for a week.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.560
And then everyone's playing
them, and it's over.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.430
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, it's
a slow burn of a game.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.740
TODD KERPELMAN: So Daniel, as
our Android expert, do you

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.000
actually have data on the
average play session time that

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.852
people typically spend
with games?

00:24:00.852 --> 00:24:02.590
DAN GALPIN: It's funny
that you--

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.120
we don't.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.620
And that's partially because
on Android we don't

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.120
track what people do.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.320
That's just that simple.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.420
We don't have any hooks in to
see what people are doing.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.620
I'd love to know that, though.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.110
TODD KERPELMAN: Could you guys
email us and just let us know

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.380
constantly?

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.530
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We
don't spy on you.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.400
DAN GALPIN: If some
developer wants to

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.200
tell me, that's great.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.450
But we actually don't track any
usage on Android, so we

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.150
don't really know.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.910
We only know when someone
installs something and when

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.455
someone uninstalls something,
essentially.

00:24:28.455 --> 00:24:32.830
WOLFF DOBSON: I mean, the game
developers themselves are

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.850
annotating the game with
analytics all over the place,

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.320
you'd hope.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.200
And If you aren't,
please do so.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:37.920
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.110
Help us.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.860
TODD KERPELMAN: And if you
are a game developer, put

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.200
something in the comments right
now, and maybe Lewis

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.860
will tell us.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.590
DAN GALPIN: And from what
I gather from the game

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.010
companies, though, it really
depends on the game.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.090
There are games that appeal to
a really hardcore gamer.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.440
The sessions are longer.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.490
By definition they're longer,
especially since a lot of them

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.420
don't have a good way of pausing
in the middle of the

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.730
action, necessarily.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.400
So obviously those game times
are going to be very long.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.950
Something like "Angry Birds,"
it's very short.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.870
I think that Rovio has actually
released data about

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.800
how long the average "Angry
Birds" session is.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.260
And actually, it was longer
than I expected.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.160
But I think that's simply
because the game is so

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.560
ridiculously addictive.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.950
But yeah, I think there's no
limit to the length of a game.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.480
In fact, what we've seen is that
the games that are most

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.680
successful are the games that
build a franchise, the games

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.870
that continue to add and
add and add content.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.550
As long as the content has value
and the consumer feels

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.010
like they're not just rolling
through the same mechanics

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.190
over and over and over again,
they'll play out a long way in

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:37.000
terms of content.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.380
So I don't think there's any
such thing as a game that's

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.630
too long, certainly.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.510
There is a game that's too large
in terms of how much

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.890
space it takes up
on the device.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.740
WOLFF DOBSON: There are games
that are too long, though.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.580
There are definitely games that
overstay their welcome,

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.910
but that's much more about the
artistic side, where it's

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.590
like, you know I haven't done
anything new in a while.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:57.825
This plot went off the rails.

00:25:57.825 --> 00:25:59.370
TODD KERPELMAN: This level
feels like padding.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:00.760
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think Dan
was getting at that.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.770
Oftentimes I'll play game.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.190
And the first half an
hour, I'm loving it.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.840
And then I'm like, hey, you know
what, this half hour just

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.740
feels like I'm doing the
same thing again

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.080
and again and again.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.075
TODD KERPELMAN: We're going to
move on, but we do have a-- is

00:26:13.075 --> 00:26:13.480
there a question?

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.473
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you guys were
talking about platforms and

00:26:14.473 --> 00:26:16.210
you brought up PSP and all
these different things.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.130
WOLFF DOBSON: Chrome.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.250
AUDIENCE: And there's the new
Wii U. We haven't talked about

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:19.845
the Wii U, yet.

00:26:19.845 --> 00:26:20.550
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, yeah.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.270
AUDIENCE: So, Pedro was asking,
do you find that

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.620
today's platforms, Xbox, PSP,
all of the ones that are out

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.450
there-- are they sufficient
for today's market?

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.560
Will the Wii U do something
brand new?

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.240
And what's missing?

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.780
I just want to get your take on
the console market today.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.565
TODD KERPELMAN: Good
question, Pedro.

00:26:36.565 --> 00:26:37.610
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All
right, Pedro.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.550
So I have a Wii U, and--

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh,
wow, how is it?

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.180
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's great.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.440
I have "Nintendo Land" and
"Mario." And so "Mario,"

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.250
everyone knows what you're
getting when you buy "Mario."

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.360
But "Nintendo Land" actually
has some really interesting

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.760
gameplay ideas.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.390
And I would consider that it's
not technically new in that

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.810
it's groundbreaking, but it's
never been attempted to be

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:02.080
done on this scale and to this
mainstream audience, which is

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.730
asymmetrical gaming.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.760
One of the games that we keep
playing over and over and over

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.300
again is "Luigi's Mansion,"
or something like that.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.410
And it's not the old "Luigi's
Mansion." It's essentially a

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:18.820
mini game where the player with
the tablet is a ghost and

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.650
is trying to take down everyone

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.830
who's looking for them.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.830
The other players are using the
old Wii-mote controllers.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.530
DAN GALPIN: So it's
"Splinter Cell."

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I don't know.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.100
Not exactly.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.665
WOLFF DOBSON: Mario
"Splinter Cell."

00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:32.560
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So the other
players have the flashlight,

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.170
and if they point it at the
ghost, which they can't see on

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.980
the television, the ghost lights
up and takes damage.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.720
And then when the ghost
gets down to zero

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.910
health, game over.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.043
WOLFF DOBSON: But the flashlight
has some timer on

00:27:42.043 --> 00:27:42.560
it, or something.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.240
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The flashlight
has batteries which will

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.250
appear randomly.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.530
But that's a great trap
for the ghost.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:49.990
WOLFF DOBSON: They're like
"X-Files" flashlights that are

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.100
only this wide, no matter how
dangerous the thing is.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:53.670
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes, yes.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:53.985
It doesn't matter.

00:27:53.985 --> 00:27:55.590
It's very targeted.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.340
But that game is ridiculously
fun because of the extra

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.440
information that the ghost
player has, which is you can

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.170
see everything.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.490
You can see where every player
is, what's going on, do they

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.800
need batteries, where the
battery is going to be.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.670
And so you can be kind of
lurking around a corner.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.480
And they're flashing around
and shaking everywhere.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.760
It's like, they go for the
battery, you take them down.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.346
WOLFF DOBSON: You're
like, I like games

00:28:20.346 --> 00:28:21.800
where I get to lurk.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.620
Lurking is good.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.790
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And then the
other players try and

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.470
resuscitate them, so it's
this weird dynamic.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.370
WOLFF DOBSON: I like games where
there's a ditch, where

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.780
my friends are trying to pull
themselves back to life.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's this week
dynamic where whoever is the

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.890
most powerful in the game is
always going back and forth.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.620
And it's all built around this
idea that one person who's

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.460
playing the game has extra
information, extra knowledge

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.445
which gives them an edge, but
still the game is balanced.

00:28:49.445 --> 00:28:50.700
WOLFF DOBSON: I've seen--

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:55.950
there have been like source
engine mods that had games

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.470
like that, where one guy can
run up walls and everybody

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.520
else can't, and things
like that.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.270
I think that kind of game
is pretty cool.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.210
DAN GALPIN: I think the great
thing about that kind of

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.010
device is really just the
ability to do a lot of things.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.150
You can do a lot of the same
thing with any computer and

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.750
any kind of second screen
device, whether that's an

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:20.410
Android device or a Chromebook,
or whatever you

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.060
might have.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.610
But what's great about that
is that it makes it

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.030
absolutely real time.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:29.620
I mean the technology there is
that your display is coming

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:35.460
off of the Wii U, and so it is
as fast as it can transmit the

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.470
bits over the air.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.930
And that, to me, is really the
only difference between that

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.170
and actually just having a
tablet sitting next to your

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.420
console, is just how real
time you can do it.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.750
WOLFF DOBSON: So this goes
back to our latency

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.305
conversation.

00:29:47.305 --> 00:29:51.650
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's not only
latency, because it's keeping

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.810
the two in sync.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.370
Like, hey, I've got a tablet,
and I can have a second screen

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:58.430
experience, but how do they
synchronize with each other?

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.730
How does the game actually
initiate where-- since it's

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.020
all running on the Wii U,
they're just in sync

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:03.580
automatically.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.770
DAN GALPIN: One of the things
that I'm really excited about

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.200
with the latest version of
Android is we actually finally

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.170
enabled something that I've
wanted for a long time, which

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:12.670
is true multi display.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:18.470
So today, in theory, you could
actually hook up true multiple

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.360
displays coming off of a
single Android device.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.930
WOLFF DOBSON: So are you
chaining it with cables?

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:23.980
Or how does that work?

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.700
DAN GALPIN: Well, on something
like the Nexus 4, you actually

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.990
can do it over Mirror Cast.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.010
You can do it over
Wi-Fi Direct.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.190
And that display is completely
driven by that device.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.575
It's just a stream that
comes off of it.

00:30:38.575 --> 00:30:39.710
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think that's
how the Wii U operates.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:40.935
DAN GALPIN: That actually is.

00:30:40.935 --> 00:30:42.310
It's very similar.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.960
The only thing about the Wii U
is that they've customized it

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.990
so that they have minimal
latency and all of that.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.720
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Its crazy
how low latency is.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.170
I've held it and been watching
the game on the TV and on the

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:53.985
tablet, and they're
just mirrored.

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:55.390
It's imperceivable to me.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.330
WOLFF DOBSON: Going back
to latency-- oh sorry.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Going back, I
was going to tie it back to

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.840
our original question of what
are consoles missing.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.980
That seems like a
nice feature.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.210
I don't know if that's the--

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.160
WOLFF DOBSON: I will say on
the Dreamcast, we had the

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.980
second screen right
there, my friend.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.030
DAN GALPIN: I remember back when
the Dreamcast was around.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:14.990
WOLFF DOBSON: Back in my day.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.800
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It was 16
columns by 16 columns.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.280
DAN GALPIN: I was amazed at how
many different gameplay

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.770
experiences that enabled,
though.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.610
Like, the little Dreamcast,
everything from little

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.280
mini-games that you would
do on those things.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.980
Sometimes you would even take
it away from the console.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.900
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, yeah.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.450
The little Chaos things from
"Sonic Adventure."

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.900
TODD KERPELMAN: They were great,
except the battery

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.260
lasted about, like--

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:37.850
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:40.330
WOLFF DOBSON: That, and then
they added that huge noise

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.940
whenever it turns on, saying
my battery is dead.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.490
And of course, I still
have my Dreamcast.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.260
You plug it in 12 years later,
and it's like, I don't even

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.460
know if I can buy a
battery for this.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.320
And it's going, beep, save me.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.280
No, but it is interesting.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:56.960
And I think--

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.090
I mean, going forward in time
a little bit, from when

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.830
dinosaurs roamed the earth--

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.900
there was also "Four Swords,"
"Zelda, Four Swords," where

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.420
you plugged in.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.450
It was such an expensive
thing to set up.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:09.850
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.720
WOLFF DOBSON: But when you
did, it was so cool.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.210
We played a ton of that,
where you have a

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.980
GameCube and then four--

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.030
TODD KERPELMAN: Four GBAs.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.540
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, Game Boy
Advances hooked up to it.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.620
And I think, actually, when you
think about where we came

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.280
from, like--

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:24.950
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.730
WOLFF DOBSON: They have
absolutely been interested in

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:27.890
this for a long time.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.680
TODD KERPELMAN: All right, I'm
going to stop us and move on

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.090
to, I guess, what will be our
last question, which is--

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:33.610
WOLFF DOBSON: Chrome.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.760
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.750
WOLFF DOBSON: Chrome
is the answer.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.740
TODD KERPELMAN: So
I'm pretty sure.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.510
Actually, Dan, I don't know if
you've actually worked in the

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.890
games industry.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:39.090
DAN GALPIN: No.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:39.390
TODD KERPELMAN: No.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.050
DAN GALPIN: No.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.840
I have no good answer
to this question.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.200
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.290
All right, so you're not
allowed to answer.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.380
WOLFF DOBSON: Ah, ah,
I worked for years.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.450
TODD KERPELMAN: I know everyone

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.350
else, and Puppet Colt--

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.740
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.920
TODD KERPELMAN: --has worked
in the games industry.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.840
We might have people who
are the industry--

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.160
WOLFF DOBSON: I worked
my paws to the bone.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.970
TODD KERPELMAN: But we might
also have people who are

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.330
wondering, hey, how do I get
into the games industry?

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.730
WOLFF DOBSON: I worked
on the "paws" menu.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.380
Ah.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.180
Oh, no.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.222
Ah.

00:33:06.222 --> 00:33:06.614
DAN GALPIN: Colt--

00:33:06.614 --> 00:33:07.400
WOLFF DOBSON: It
had to happen.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.880
DAN GALPIN: --what big
eyes you have.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.600
TODD KERPELMAN: That
was funny.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.550
DAN GALPIN: Sorry, go on.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.817
WOLFF DOBSON: Sorry.

00:33:12.817 --> 00:33:14.523
TODD KERPELMAN: That was
funny, the "paws" menu.

00:33:17.944 --> 00:33:19.830
All right, so how
did you get your

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.690
jobs in the game industry?

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.420
What advice do you have for
people today that are looking

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.740
to get into the industry?

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.260
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I went about
it in, I think, the most

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.340
difficult way possible, because
I got a PhD in AI and

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.270
then worked on weird
post-doc stuff.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.700
And then I was like, you
know what, I'm tired

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.730
of the public sector.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.990
Let's try the private sector.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.750
And I sent my resume in
to a recruiter that I

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.120
found on the internet.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.610
I did it about as badly as
you could possibly do it.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:54.140
However, then working with the
recruiter, I think the main

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:59.970
thing that especially AAA
developers are looking for are

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.740
people who can code.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.000
I mean, if you want to be an
artist, there's a whole other

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.600
conversation.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.770
And actually, we should put that
on our Five For Five at

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:12.389
some point, too, paths in that
aren't just developer, like

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:13.440
straight coder.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.389
But you need to be
able to code.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:17.500
You're going to be tested.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.949
You're going to be
given a test.

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:20.880
You gotta know this stuff, just
because there's so many

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.219
people who want to develop
games, because it's fun and

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.489
it's neat, and it's got
a lot of glamour.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:29.900
Sort of.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:30.850
DAN GALPIN: Perceived glamour.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.360
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.114
TODD KERPELMAN: Remember all
those red carpet parties we

00:34:34.114 --> 00:34:34.960
used to go to?

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.909
WOLFF DOBSON: Actually,
I went to one.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:37.489
I went to an actual
red carpet.

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:38.630
TODD KERPELMAN: Really?

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, when we
launched the Dreamcast-- once.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.139
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: E3 used
to be pretty--

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:42.620
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, and
E3 is like fun.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.227
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
all right, yeah.

00:34:44.227 --> 00:34:44.850
E3's--

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.800
WOLFF DOBSON: But yeah, if you
want to go to parties, you

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.969
should pick a different
industry.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.020
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So totally to
your point, how I got into the

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.070
games industry was, in grad
school I wrote a real-time 3D

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.060
collision detection and physics
engine that was

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.230
comparable to Bullet
and Havoc.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.120
And then Erwin Coumans hired me
to work at PlayStation to

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.750
optimize Bullet for the PS3.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:06.480
And that was exactly it.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.880
Like, I just wrote an actual
physics engine from nuts to

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.210
bolts, soups to nuts,
or whatever.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.310
WOLFF DOBSON: This
is a big deal.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.910
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And
that was it.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.600
It was like, here's
my portfolio.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.880
It's a fully working engine.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.120
WOLFF DOBSON: And if you're
looking for engine work--

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.230
I mean, you should build
the things that you

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.850
want to work on.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:24.130
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:24.410
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.570
WOLFF DOBSON: Although I will
say, you may end up working on

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:27.440
things that you didn't know--

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.125
I mean, my first
job was sports.

00:35:29.125 --> 00:35:30.000
TODD KERPELMAN: You will
end up working on

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.710
things almost certainly.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.250
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, almost
certainly you're going to end

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.920
up not really doing
what you want.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.425
But the advice that I give--

00:35:36.425 --> 00:35:38.130
WOLFF DOBSON: Welcome
to life, kids.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.330
You're not gonna do
what you want.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.995
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Get ready
for disappointment.

00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:44.310
WOLFF DOBSON: Life from here
is nothing but pain.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: The advice I
give to everyone who asks this

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.810
question is write the engine.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.630
Like, if you want
to be an engine

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.060
engineer, write an engine.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.110
In your own time, by yourself,
do the hard work, and you'll

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.845
get a job so easily.

00:35:57.845 --> 00:36:00.780
If you just show up with a
resume like, hey, I graduated

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.610
with a computer science degree
and I want to write a game

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:03.640
engine, good luck.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.910
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, the thing
is, in the game industry,

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:06.990
you're looking for builders.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.770
You're looking for people who,
if you leave them alone in a

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:14.790
room with a laptop, they will
start building a game.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:15.510
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Exactly.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.700
WOLFF DOBSON: When I was
interviewing other developers,

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.890
this is what I looked at,
like are you builder?

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.200
Are you the kind
of person who--

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I would always
ask, what software have you

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.750
written in your spare time?

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.178
It's the biggest indicator.

00:36:28.178 --> 00:36:29.130
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.860
I mean, some people have got
really, really interesting and

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.810
active outside-of-work lives,
which generally aren't game

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.430
developers.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.130
But sometimes there's
some slack there.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:45.540
It's like, oh yeah, I do like
free climbing up Half Dome

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.100
every weekend.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.500
It's like, OK, fine,
that's pretty cool.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.060
But otherwise it's like, yeah,
you should be building.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.810
You're not just like a huge
player, you're a builder.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.040
Gametribe games are a great
way to get into

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:58.840
the groove of that.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.180
But long-term projects
are also really good.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.660
Also, looking for ideas.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.765
If you built--

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:08.050
I built "Space Invaders," and
you're like, well, "Space

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.060
Invaders" is cool, but we've
all kind of played it.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.560
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: See, but
that's not on the

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.910
scale that's required.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:15.360
Like, high-end--

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:15.720
WOLFF DOBSON: Depending on
what you want to do.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.200
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: --console gaming
requires programmers of

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.370
a very high skill level.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.380
And they have to be
able to build.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.560
It's not enough to be like, oh,
in my spare time I built

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.680
"Space Invaders." You have to
build a real-time 3D engine

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.760
with the latest algorithms.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.520
And then you're going
to get a job.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.860
WOLFF DOBSON: You disagree
a little there.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:35.970
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:36.340
I mean, a little.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.990
Because there's very clearly
jobs in the industry that

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.440
don't require writing game
engines from scratch.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.980
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I was gonna
say that the hardest thing

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.930
about game engines is that it's
very hard to find people

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.230
who've actually worked on the
core of them, because the vast

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:54.000
majority of people who work on
games never touch the engine.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.230
They're working on all of the
stuff around it, whether it's

00:37:56.230 --> 00:38:00.440
tools, or whether it is simply
on creating content.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.810
I mean, there are some people
who have gotten jobs in the

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.660
game industry just because
they've created the most

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.560
awesome mod for some engine,
for example.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.530
WOLFF DOBSON: Mods are an
interesting way in.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.440
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
mods are actually--

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.670
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Was it
"Counter-Strike?" Didn't they

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.540
get hired by--

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:15.680
WOLFF DOBSON: Gooseman?

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.240
Is that his name?

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:17.930
Something like that.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:18.290
Yeah.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: They got
bought by Valve, right?

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.130
WOLFF DOBSON: Well--

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:20.620
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Way
back in the day.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.650
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.920
And there are other people who
build really great mods.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:28.690
I remember hiring people,
especially people who were

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.800
coming from less traditional
CS backgrounds.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.060
It's like, oh, but you were huge
into the modding scene.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.680
It's clear what work
you're doing.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.810
If you want to be a level
designer, making mods is

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.530
absolutely the way to go.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.780
Because I mean, that's basically
your job when you're

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.660
a level designer, is take some
guy's engine and change it so

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.630
it does the thing that
you want to do.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.890
So yeah, learn to code, kids.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.060
No.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:51.470
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Build.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.130
WOLFF DOBSON: But more than
learning to code--

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.600
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think
the best way to

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.310
put it is to build.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
learn to build.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.860
Learn to build things
that are-- and also

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.530
things that are finished.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.600
I mean, it's a terrible thing
to say because it's really

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.830
easy to make a bunch of things
that aren't finished.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:05.210
Or at least get to the
point at which they

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.460
make a clear demo.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.360
And I think that's also--

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.500
and there's a maturity to
setting out to building

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.020
projects that requires you to
have that kind of, like, the

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.990
demo looks like this and I'm
going to get there in three

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.840
weeks kind of thing, versus, I'm
just gonna build an engine

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.080
and see what comes out.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.230
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, I mean,
building an engine is a trap.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.200
And it's a huge time sink.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:25.950
WOLFF DOBSON: It is
a huge time sink.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:29.510
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Because you
could just keep iterating on

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.135
different engine subsystems over
and over and over again--

00:39:32.135 --> 00:39:34.530
and improving them, but
what's to show, right?

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:35.980
It's a lot of fun, but
you have to have

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.700
a compelling demo.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.040
You want to have the demo drive
the engine, not the

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:40.870
other way around.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.260
WOLFF DOBSON: I worked on an
indie game for a while, and I

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.940
got way into the hat maker.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.420
And it wasn't a 3D game.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.280
It was a 2D game.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.060
But I had these little anime
guys, and they all wore hats.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.410
And then I had to attach the
hat, and I had all these

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:57.060
attachment points in an XML
format and a tool where you

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.600
could lay out all
the hat points.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.650
And then the hats themselves
could rock back and forth as

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.270
they walked.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.070
And then I eventually added
particle emitter

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:04.940
points on the hats.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.620
I was, like, two months
into this.

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.000
And I was like, wait a
minute, this adds no

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.376
value to this game.

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:14.130
DAN GALPIN: But the excitement
about that kind of feature,

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.780
though, is exactly why--

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.058
TODD KERPELMAN: That's why
you need a producer.

00:40:19.058 --> 00:40:20.810
So if you want to
be a producer--

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:21.455
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes.

00:40:21.455 --> 00:40:23.850
Yeah, you go find people like
Wolff and tell him to stop

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.010
working on damn hats.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.460
TODD KERPELMAN: I mean, and
that's a good skill.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.260
It's like, you can keep working
on a game forever.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:31.780
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, yeah.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:35.140
TODD KERPELMAN: And sort of
knowing where to get the most

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.680
bang for your buck, knowing how
to prioritize, knowing,

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.090
hey, this is actually a point
where you can release it on

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.700
Kongregate as our finished game
or something like that.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.770
WOLFF DOBSON: Or unfinished
game, but get it out there.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.830
I mean, the other habit--

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:50.210
and it is an absolutely natural
thing to do, and it's

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.850
true of every kind of art,
including games-- is not

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.240
releasing it because
it isn't perfect.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.170
Ain't going to happen.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:01.970
I can tell you from shipping
AAA games, they're

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:05.400
chock-a-block with things that
you wish you could fix.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.920
And you just ship them, because
the money's over.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.750
You gotta get out of there.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.153
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, after
being in the games industry

00:41:11.153 --> 00:41:15.750
for a while, I was kind of
disturbed by how shoddy these

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:19.352
games actually are, but how
well they come off in the

00:41:19.352 --> 00:41:19.870
final form.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.740
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, you spend
your time on the things people

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.330
do, and just don't look
behind that thing.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:24.700
Don't try to balance--

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.200
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I would spend
time with the games a month

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.453
before they come out and I'd
be like, holy crap, this--

00:41:28.453 --> 00:41:31.240
and then it's just in that
final month, it's

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:31.950
just, uh, we got it.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.480
WOLFF DOBSON: That's because
you don't sleep during that

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.120
entire month.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:34.820
And all you do is you
crank [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:35.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
that's true.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.243
DAN GALPIN: And I think,
actually, it depends on the

00:41:37.243 --> 00:41:38.100
kind of game, too.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.390
I think some of the most
polished games out there are

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:44.550
some of these puzzle games,
where that initial experience,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.270
because that puzzle experience
doesn't necessarily change all

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:49.850
that much, it's very, very
focused [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.430
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and that's
a good producer and level

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.240
design thing, too.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.120
You know, come up with a puzzle
structure and then

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.660
build and build amazing
levels out of that.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:56.990
That's gonna get attention.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.820
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: You build
your tools that

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.140
allow you to very quickly--

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:00.250
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes, tools.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.660
And of course, every hour you're
spending on tools to

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.020
build the level, you're
thinking, I'm not

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:04.750
shipping this game.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.375
But of course, there's some--

00:42:06.375 --> 00:42:07.530
DAN GALPIN: And you can
go too far that way.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:08.780
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.440
DAN GALPIN: And then you're
selling Unity.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.740
That's what happens.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.070
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, and that
happens to game companies,

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.730
where they turn into tools
companies, because it turns

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.430
out they're really good at
making tools and they're not

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.280
so good at shipping
things on time.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.746
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
so we are way over--

00:42:22.746 --> 00:42:24.570
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm not saying
that about any particular

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:25.580
thing, just to be sure.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.330
TODD KERPELMAN: --on
that subject.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.710
And we've actually
used up our time.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.950
So we're going to finish
with a quick round of

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:33.910
what are you playing.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.660
So I feel like I've
been starting with

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.120
Wolff most of the time.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.770
WOLFF DOBSON: No, you gotta
start over there.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.330
TODD KERPELMAN: So I gotta start
with John, who's gonna

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.103
say "X-Com."

00:42:39.103 --> 00:42:42.080
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No, I've been
playing the Wii U. But in

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.710
particular, my obsession with
"Scramble with Friends" has

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.400
kicked back up.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.060
I'm now top 3% globally.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:50.290
DAN GALPIN: Wow.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:51.282
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow.

00:42:51.282 --> 00:42:54.060
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I like
that game too much.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.770
DAN GALPIN: Are you using--

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:56.660
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: What's
great about it is

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.870
that it's three minutes.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:01.110
For one round is
three minutes.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:05.890
So I can very easily sneak
it in anywhere.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:06.300
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.180
WOLFF DOBSON: What
about you, Dan?

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:07.730
TODD KERPELMAN: Mr. Galpin?

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.995
DAN GALPIN: Huh.

00:43:07.995 --> 00:43:11.000
That's a good question.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.730
Actually, the last
thing I played an

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:14.540
incredible amount of--

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.640
I'll say right now, "Expendable
Rearmed." I was

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.930
actually really thrilled
that that came

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:18.830
out on Android again.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:19.380
WOLFF DOBSON: Say that again.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.370
DAN GALPIN: "Expendable
Rearmed."

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.390
WOLFF DOBSON: "Expendable
Rearmed."

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.100
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.450
It just came out again.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.210
It was a Dreamcast game.

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:26.020
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh my god.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:26.450
"Expendable."

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:27.670
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
and it's now--

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.270
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, wow.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.820
DAN GALPIN: And it's now--

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.730
WOLFF DOBSON: Back when
dinosaurs roamed the earth.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:31.096
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:43:31.096 --> 00:43:32.590
Freaking Dreamcast.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.260
Developers just recently brought
it to Android, and I'm

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:35.960
really happy with it.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.450
WOLFF DOBSON: I think that's
an incredible trend, by the

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.850
way, of bringing
some of these--

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.390
especially lesser-known
titles.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.380
"Expendable" was fun, as
it actually turns out.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.180
I mean, there were things you
would do to it, and of course

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.200
they've had time to
do that to it.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.840
And then, yeah, I've seen a
bunch of PlayStation 2 ports

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.620
appear on Android and been like,
oh wow, oh yeah, that

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.110
was awesome.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:57.520
People should totally
play that.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.620
DAN GALPIN: I was excited. "Jet
Set Radio" just came out

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.270
for Android, speaking
of blasts from

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:03.550
the Dreamcast past.

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:04.836
But yeah, "Expendable" is
probably the one I'm playing

00:44:04.836 --> 00:44:06.550
the most now.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:09.230
TODD KERPELMAN: So let's see,
obviously "Skyrim." Although I

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.025
reached a point yesterday--

00:44:10.025 --> 00:44:10.300
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Still?

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.195
TODD KERPELMAN: --where
I was like--

00:44:11.195 --> 00:44:11.450
WOLFF DOBSON: "Skyrim."

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:12.123
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Still
"Skyrim?"

00:44:12.123 --> 00:44:12.890
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, still.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.215
Well, it's a long game, and I
don't really have a lot of

00:44:16.215 --> 00:44:16.965
hours in the day.

00:44:16.965 --> 00:44:17.810
WOLFF DOBSON: Baby.

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.150
TODD KERPELMAN: But I reached
a point yesterday where I'm

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.250
like, you know, I think I can
probably take a break and play

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.150
something else and come
back to it later.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.320
WOLFF DOBSON: I am tired of
talking to these people.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.460
I would like to do
something else.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.220
TODD KERPELMAN: A little
bit of that.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.370
I'm really tired
of the guards.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.620
I hate the guards.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.710
So I actually have sort of been
playing a whole slew of

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.140
mobile games, just
trying them out.

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:46.480
I don't always play on iOS
devices, but when I do, I

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.995
enjoy "Letterpress." That's
actually a fun game.

00:44:49.995 --> 00:44:51.790
It's kind of a word
competitive game.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:53.670
It's a little stressful,
because it is awfully

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.290
competitive.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:57.900
WOLFF DOBSON: That's because
John's playing it.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.880
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.080
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Not yet.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.790
TODD KERPELMAN: And
surprisingly, I have found

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.470
that out of the decorator games,
like build-up-your-city

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.860
ones, the licensed ones--

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.950
normally you say licensed game,
oh, maybe stay away.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.490
I feel like the licensed
ones have all

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.390
been better than average.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:19.415
Like, "Simpsons, Tapped
Out" is quite good.

00:45:19.415 --> 00:45:23.020
The "My Little Pony" game is
much better than it has any

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:23.360
right to be.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:23.980
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Oh, really?

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.010
TODD KERPELMAN: "The Littlest
Pet Shop" game,

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.480
very nice 3D models.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:30.270
I was very impressed
with all of those.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm
curious why you--

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.340
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
I was gonna say--

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.585
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: --decided to
buy "My Little Ponies."

00:45:33.585 --> 00:45:34.455
WOLFF DOBSON: --you have
a long list of

00:45:34.455 --> 00:45:35.550
these sorts of games.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:35.890
Are you--

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:36.380
TODD KERPELMAN: I am not.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:36.980
No, really.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.980
I realized I haven't played
mobile games in a while.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.600
I'm just gonna through
the top 20 list and

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.883
give them all a try.

00:45:42.883 --> 00:45:43.890
So that's kind of what
I've been doing.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.600
AUDIENCE: Todd, when you
mentioned "My Little Pony,"

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.230
all of our viewers
dropped off.

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:48.800
So nobody--

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.640
TODD KERPELMAN: I want to make
it clear, I'm not a brony.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.320
WOLFF DOBSON: Brony.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.510
TODD KERPELMAN: I am not.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:53.590
I've never seen the show.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Wait, brony?

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Brony.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.400
DAN GALPIN: So I will say, you
don't know about bronies?

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:57.690
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: No.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.880
DAN GALPIN: The other game that
I got completely wrapped

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.810
into this last week was
"Dominion" online.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.060
I actually--

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:04.970
WOLFF DOBSON: Which
version of it?

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.730
DAN GALPIN: It's the Goko.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:07.880
WOLFF DOBSON: It's tight.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.320
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
fantastic.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.640
DAN GALPIN: It's so,
so well done.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.070
TODD KERPELMAN: And I believe
it is in HTML, isn't it?

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:13.890
WOLFF DOBSON: Chrome.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.800
DAN GALPIN: It runs
fine on Chrome.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.840
I've got it right here
on my Chromebook.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.190
WOLFF DOBSON: I picked
up the--

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:27.590
I picked up the Humble Bundle
for Android, and I started

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:32.840
playing "Missionarium," which
is an older model, but it

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.020
checks out.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.090
It's a Flash game.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.350
It's a point-and-click
adventure.

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:41.370
I had poked at it back when
it was in Flash in

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:42.220
the browser, I think.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.520
And I was like, oh,
this is neat.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.690
I don't have time to do this.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:45.570
Wander away.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.830
And then I put it on my Nexus
7, and I was playing it.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.790
And I started playing it at
midnight, thinking, well,

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:51.170
these point-and-click adventures
are sure gonna put

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.700
me to sleep.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.910
Then, like, an hour and 15
minutes later, I'm like, I

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.570
have to stop clicking.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:59.730
But it's clever in 100
ways, beautiful art.

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:02.670
One interesting thing about
it, especially when you

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.650
compare it to another thing
that came in the Humble

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:10.620
Bundle, which was the "Sword and
Sworcery," the #sworcery.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.110
Clever naming, by the way,
putting the hash at the

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:12.670
beginning--

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:15.050
alphabetization, excellent
choice.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.160
Good work.

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.940
But the "Sword and Sworcery"
was designed around touch

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.710
interfaces, so everything's
kind of big.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.640
When you click on something, you
get the little ring around

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.240
it, and you do the stuff.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.590
It's like, oh, I know
what I'm doing.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.790
But "Missionarium," since it
wasn't designed around touch

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.290
interfaces at first--

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.950
although it plays just fine,
and you should try it--

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.780
there are moments where you're
like, I can't see what I'm

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.980
doing, because everything's
too small, and

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.540
my finger's so big.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.680
I need one of those-- like, in
Korea, there's that particular

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.410
brand of sausage you use as a
stylus because it has the

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.630
right capacitance for
a capacitive stream.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:52.590
This is a real thing.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:56.020
I'm not making this up.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.110
Yeah, I need a stylus or
something to play it just

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.810
right, although I'm totally
getting through it.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:00.230
It's fine.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:01.300
But it's an interesting thing.

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.840
I didn't realize that was a
design consideration when

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.790
porting things from mouse
pointer to touch.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:10.510
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.800
And--

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.410
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm playing
Chrome games.

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:14.305
TODD KERPELMAN: Thank
you, Wolff puppet.

00:48:14.305 --> 00:48:15.610
WOLFF DOBSON: No problem.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.860
TODD KERPELMAN: And I believe
with that, we are done.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.950
We're wrapped up.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.325
So thank you very much for
watching, those of you that

00:48:22.325 --> 00:48:23.000
are still watching.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.800
WOLFF DOBSON: Bye.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.130
TODD KERPELMAN: Maybe
next week--

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:28.550
well, let's take a vote and
decide whether you prefer the

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.190
puppet Colt or the
actual Colt.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.670
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.840
WOLFF DOBSON: Puppet
Colt, Puppet Colt.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.770
DAN GALPIN: I think we should
all have puppets next week.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.290
TODD KERPELMAN: And whoever
wins, that's who we'll invite

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.808
back next time.

00:48:36.808 --> 00:48:38.950
So thank you very much.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:40.950
And we will see you
in a couple weeks.

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:41.250
WOLFF DOBSON: Bye.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:41.550
DAN GALPIN: Bye.

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:42.150
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Bye.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.400
DAN GALPIN: Ciao.
