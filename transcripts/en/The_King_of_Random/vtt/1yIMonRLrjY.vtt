00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.520
We have just an awful lot of corn starch,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.880
some containers to mix stuff up

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.940
and a bunch of orange glow sticks.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.860
We're going to find out if we can make 
oobleck that glows like lava.

TKOR THE KING OF RANDOM

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.860
Hey guys, not too long ago,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.660
we had a video showing you 
how to make glowing ooze

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.480
using borax, glue and some glow sticks.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.000
On that video, user Copper Corsair 
commented asking if we could mix

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.380
the glow fluid with 
corn flour and make Oobleck.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.980
Assuming he meant cornstarch,
we're going to try that out.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.480
As a first experiment, 
let's see what happens if we

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.900
just drain all the fluid
out of a glow stick,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.220
mix in some cornstarch

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.800
and see if that turns into the non-Newtonian 
fluid we're used to playing with.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.320
[music]

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.060
We are going to mix 
both of these fluids together

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.680
before adding the corn starch.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.360
So let's turn down the lights 
so we can see the glow effect.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.960
I'll crack the glass tubes,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.220
pour them off into this cup,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.600
and then pour them from the cup
into the other container.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.220
[music]

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.220
That is beautiful.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.540
Liquid fire in a container.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.860
Let's start adding cornstarch 
into this mixture and see

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.600
if we can get that really 
weird texture we're looking for.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.680
[music]

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.220
All right.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.200
Now we've got it to a point 
where it's turning into

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.020
sort of a goopy mess.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.340
But, normally when you have Oobleck,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.160
it's actually very hard to stir

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.180
because trying to push it with 
the spoon just makes it get firm.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.880
And then when you let it sit,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.660
it settles down into more of a liquid.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.680
This stuff, however, is just...

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.640
sort of...

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.420
goopy.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.020
It's just kind of like a pudding.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.340
Squishing it doesn't make it firm up.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.620
It just stays semi-liquid.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.480
So while it is glowing,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.620
I wouldn't call it Oobleck at this point.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.740
Let's mix up a batch with normal
water and cornstarch to see a comparison.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.660
[music]

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.020
Oh I'm starting to run into
the problem I was talking about.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.680
I'm having a hard time stirring it,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.780
Because as I put pressure 
on it to stir,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.860
It all firms up.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.400
You just have to stir very
slowly and calmly.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.560
Go quick,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.120
it can even peel it
off of the bottom.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.140
This stuff is so weird.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.400
All right.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.380
At this point, I think we
have successfully created Oobleck.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.760
In that it's a liquid while it's in the container.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.380
We can sort of scoop it up and it can 
even crumble if we're quick enough.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.880
There we go, I've got a ball of it
that I'm able to just

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.880
hold and pass between my hands, 
as long as I keep it rolling.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.560
Once I stop,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.420
it just puddles everywhere.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.940
Let's see what happens 
if we mix one into the other.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.780
[music]

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.340
The oil-like substance 
that's in the glowsticks,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.840
does not do a good job of mixing with water,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.540
when there's no cornstarch involved.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.020
At this point, we're getting 
sort of a crumbly mess.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.280
I think we may need more
water to combine with the cornstarch

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.420
that was mixed with the glowstick fluid.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.560
That looks like radioactive 
cottage cheese or something.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.700
[music]

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.560
I'm kinda liking how
this is looking now.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.400
I'm now able to handle this
Oobleck and if I stop...

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.620
it puddles off just like normal Oobleck.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.220
So we're pretty much
where we want to be on consistency.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.700
But, it doesn't have as much 
glow as I would like.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.540
So I'm going to try cracking open a
couple more glow sticks,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.200
and adding those in as well.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.340
Some activator fluid and it's
already reacting

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.140
with what was already in the Oobleck.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:04:21.060
[music]

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.400
Well, our glowing Oobleck
wasn't really glowing too much.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.920
Then, I remembered, we've used soap 
to bring out the glow...

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.740
extra bright in the past.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.080
And soap might be able  to make 
the two liquids, water and the glow fluid,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.700
bond together a little bit and holy cow!

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.580
That seems to be the key.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.780
We now have an Oobleck substance 
that is glowing very brightly.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.780
[music]

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.700
I should point out that this is
not the exact same texture

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.960
as normal Oobleck.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.560
It has a little bit of just a putty texture
even when you let it sit.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.660
It does stay firm if you handle it,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.180
and it does start 
to liquefy if you let it sit.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.680
But, it doesn't get as liquid or as firm,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.980
as Oobleck without glow fluid in it.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.660
Well, you know what, 
this worked pretty well.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.680
And I just got to keep going.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.260
I want to try this with another color.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.120
Let's see if we can make blue.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:33.940
[music]

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.240
There's a little bit of contamination
because I'm using the same cup,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.400
to hold the dye that was
for the other experiments.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.220
But...

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.860
That is such a cool color.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.720
I actually like that contamination,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.480
It gave a little
tiny tint of greenish white.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.760
We've got sort of an aqua glow going on.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.260
Start by adding some of our corn starch.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.560
See if we can mix up that gooey substance.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.640
That isn't Oobleck. 
It's just sort of...

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.740
glowing pudding.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.060
It's slimy and it's gooey 
and it's glowing,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.740
but it's definitely not Oobleck.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.800
Same as before, let's mix up a
batch of Oobleck that doesn't glow.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.300
and then mix the two together

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:31.060
[music]

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.920
Add in a little bit of water
and try and smooth it out.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:43.680
[music]

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.520
Immediately starts reacting.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.460
As we mix,
it starts reacting even more.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:07:13.500
[music]

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.260
I've got a new batch of 
green glowing Oobleck or,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.720
think I'll call it Goobleck.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.640
Glowing Oobleck.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.440
I have a new batch of green
Goobleck mixed up.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.520
And I want to try something 
that I've seen some other people do.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.920
This is a subwoofer speaker,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.600
that's attached to an 
amplifier going into my phone...

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.060
which is playing a tone generator.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.880
Meaning if I press play on my phone,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.380
this will start playing one precise frequency.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.720
It can even go louder than that, 
but that's not necessary yet.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.940
What we want to try is putting our
non-Newtonian fluid in the speaker.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.140
When a speaker is turned on,

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.580
it's actually moving back and forth 
at a very precise frequency.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.960
The frequency is determined by
the tone that I choose

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.620
to play out of the tone generator.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.780
A higher pitched noise
means a higher frequency.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.860
A lower pitched
noise is a lower frequency.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.420
I really want to see how this looks 
with our non-Newtonian fluid

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.480
sitting right on top of the cone
where the sound comes from.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:15.940
[music]

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.100
Little growths.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.860
[music]

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.480
On screen, this actually kind of 
looks out of focus,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.600
but it's because it's vibrating

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.640
at a frequency
that looks blurry on camera.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.480
It actually looks 
a little blurry in person even.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.840
It's kind of funny when I poke it.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.460
It feels rigid not like a liquid.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.140
I want to see what happens 
if I shine a black light on this.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.780
[music]

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.040
Mmm... it looks alive.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:26.460
[music]

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.620
Guys, if you think Oobleck 
is fun to play with,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.560
you really should try Goobleck.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.220
The Glowing Oobleck.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.040
It's slimy, it's soft,
and it's durable.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.480
Not very good at
writing commercial slogans.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.740
