00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.800
Questions of media literacy – what it means,
who should have it, and how they should get it –
are as old as media itself.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.720
Technologies like smartphones and the internet
have made media literacy more important than ever.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.740
But concerns about media and their effects
have been around a long, long time.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.960
Many of the arguments for and against media
have shaped how new technologies, industries, and
cultures have developed throughout history.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.060
Media literacy as a term or a field didn’t
become “a thing” until around the 1960’s.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.600
Before it became the work of communications
scholars and media professionals, thinking about
communication was (and often still is) led by

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.050
philosophers, psychologists, sociologists,
linguists, and critical theorists.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.920
It’s an ancient problem that even Plato,
the classical Greek philosopher, thought a
lot about.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:01.100
[Theme Music]

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:11.020
In the Phaedrus, a dialogue he wrote around 370
BCE, Plato imagines a conversation between his teacher,
Socrates, and one of their friends, Phaedrus.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.600
Socrates and Phaedrus start off talking about love
and end up debating the best way to give a speech.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.800
But you know what was really bugging Socrates, what
he thought was the biggest problem in Greek society?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.460
Writing things down.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.980
He writes, “If men learn this,
it will implant forgetfulness in their souls;

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.860
they will cease to exercise memory
because they rely on that which is written,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.880
calling things to remembrance no longer from
within themselves, but by means of external marks.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.400
What you have discovered is a recipe not for
memory, but for reminder.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.860
That’s right.
Plato was dark.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.240
He thought leaving your words on paper, just
lying around, would encourage others to use
them out of context.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.060
If you were there in person, though, you
could defend your thoughts and talk them out
with the listener.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.820
And if you’ve ever said something dumb on
the internet, you know the man’s got a point.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.200
So the root of media literacy concerns is really
just straight up literacy, learning to read and write.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.989
In Plato’s day, and for centuries after, information
was often shared by word of mouth and, for most
people, education was informal.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:18.700
If you were lucky and rich, you might’ve
shared info through hand-written media like letters
and codices (a type of pre-book book).

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.040
Or you might’ve studied alongside a master or
scholar and learned from handmade manuscripts.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.060
These were very expensive and time
consuming to make, so very few people had the
means to become educated and literate.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.980
But all that changed when Johannes Gutenberg
invented the movable type printing press in 1452.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.220
Suddenly, print media was easier to produce, and
books and pamphlets could be shared crazy fast –

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.600
well, as fast as your fastest horse could go,
this was the 15th century.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.580
As media became cheaper, more people had the
means to become literate.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.300
For people in power, this was a huge problem.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.560
It’s much easier for a government to control
or persuade their subjects with the word of
law when most of them can’t read.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.860
Organized religion had a similar problem.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.260
Before the printing press was invented, most of
the church-going public couldn’t even read the Bible;
they relied on the clergy to interpret it.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.790
In 1517, German theologian Martin Luther started
pushing the buttons of the Roman Catholic Church
by publishing his 95 Theses.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.820
He claimed the church didn’t and shouldn’t
have the only power to interpret scripture.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.360
He even translated the Bible from Latin to
German to grant access to everyday people.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.120
The idea that suddenly parishioners could interpret
the Bible for themselves was a major shake-up.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.280
His revelations eventually led to the Protestant
Reformation and a democratization of religion
in the West.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.140
(Though, Luther’s impact wasn’t all roses
– today his more antisemitic views are pretty
hard to stomach.)

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:47.460
The history of media literacy closely follows
the history of media technology – with each
new invention, discussions and fears follow.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.160
Just as Plato was wary of the written word,
government and religious leaders were very
wary of the printed word.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.580
Those in power wanted to be gatekeepers for
information – and prohibiting access to media,
of course, makes media literacy impossible.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.020
Media literacy really becomes important three
centuries later, with a new medium – the world’s
first MASS media: the newspaper.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.260
Publications of local news date back to Plato’s
era.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.520
But the type we think of today – a regularly published
document quickly and cheaply covering major events for
the masses – didn’t really form until the 17th century.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.680
And at first, no surprise, most of them were
government-controlled.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.120
But as the print media industry began to take
shape, people fought for a free press.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.500
This was especially true in the American colonies,
where the struggle for an independent press was tied
up with their struggle for freedom from British control.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.099
By the early 1800’s the newspaper begins
to become a democratizing force.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.060
This is the era of the Penny Press.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.750
Called the Penny Press because they cost
– you guessed it – a penny, these papers were
incredibly popular.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.220
They spread like wildfire, especially among
the middle and lower classes.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:59.420
Suddenly, anyone, even an unlikely street kid
without two pennies to rub together could be in the
know and feel like they were King of the World!

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.040
Newspapers weren’t just about educating
the masses.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.740
They were also about making lots of money.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.700
Penny paper owner Benjamin H. Day, printed
this motto atop every issue of The New York Sun:

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.140
"The object of this paper is to lay before the public,
at a price within the means of every one,

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.940
all the news of the day, and at the same time
offer an advantageous medium for advertisements."

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.920
By the mid 1800’s, the penny presses were making
so much money from ads that people worried about
publishers choosing profit over truth.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.060
The more publishers relied on advertising revenue
to pay the bills, the more sensational papers became.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.080
This trend came to a head around the turn
of the 20th century.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:41.480
In the late 1890’s, Joseph Pulitzer (Pulitzer
like the Prize), a self-made, traditional newspaper
man who owned the New York World,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.920
and William Randolph Hearst, a young mining
heir who wanted to emulate Pulitzer and owned
the New York Journal, went head to head.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.120
They both wanted their papers in as many
hands as humanly possible to attract bigger
and better advertisers.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.980
The two papers began ramping up their stories,
focusing less on getting the facts straight and more
on getting more readers and more cash.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.580
This became known as Yellow Journalism.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.300
Yellow journalists used bold, scary or misleading
headlines; faked interviews and exaggerated stories;

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.300
and used lots of splashy pictures and
illustrations, and did anything else they
could do to sell a paper.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.720
They prioritized sensationalism over professionalism
and journalistic ethics.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.580
They thrived on scandals, sports, crime, and
self-promotion.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.840
Good thing we don’t have to worry about
that kind of thing today.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.320
Let’s head into the Thought Bubble for a
closer look.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.460
Here we have a classic example from the peak
of yellow journalism.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.320
This article is from Pulitzer’s The New
York World, published in February 1898.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.060
The main front page story is about the sinking
of a U.S. battleship, the Maine, in Havana Harbor
a few days earlier.

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.620
Cuba, which was colonised by Spain, was in
the middle of a revolution.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.220
The U.S.S. Maine was there as a show of power to
protect U.S. interests in Cuban independence.

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.620
But it was also a gesture to ease tensions
that were growing between the U.S. and Spain.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.700
Then suddenly, in the middle of the night
February 15, an explosion tore apart the Maine.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.720
It sunk, killing 260 men.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.220
Let’s take a look at this headline about
the sinking.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.440
“Maine Explosion Caused By Bomb or Torpedo?”
question mark

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.820
Well that’s not a suspicious use of punctuation
or anything.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.379
Even today, the cause of the Maine’s sinking
is unclear.

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:17.259
A naval inquiry held in 1898 concluded a mine
laid in the harbor had exploded.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.439
But today, some experts believe the explosion
was internal, caused by a coal bunker fire.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:25.319
EIther way, two days later in 1898, no one
knew what happened.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.240
But Pulitzer’s paper didn’t hesitate before
taking a guess.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.700
During their stand-off, both Pulitzer and
Hearst stoked tensions between the U.S. and
Spain to sell papers.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.340
With this headline the New York World
helped to spread rumors about enemy
involvement in the sinking.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.920
Notice the huge, ginormous illustration.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.720
It takes up nearly the whole page!

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.660
This visual re-telling of the explosion – complete
with bodies strewn around and flames shooting
into the air – is so dramatic.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:55.200
Since the paper didn’t have a photograph
of the event, they dramatized it with a gory
graphic to grab your attention.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.840
Finally, take a look at the subheadlines (often
called the “deck” of a story).

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.449
They’re full of equally dramatic tales from
the scene of the supposed crime.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:05.870
But if you look closely, the writing signals
they’re just feeding the rumor mill.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.600
The “facts” the article claims are really
just suggestions and overheard talk, with
no solid confirmed information.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.840
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.400
You can see from this example that yellow
journalism isn’t trying to sell truth and facts.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.920
It sells a story.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:25.560
By taking a closer look, we discover strategies
publishers use to entertain or distract us – like staying
away from the facts and leaning into drama.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.420
The race to sell as many papers as possible
was – and still is – a race to the bottom.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.740
And publishers know all too well how to make
a buck from a good story.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.080
(And in case you’re wondering:

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:42.280
They called it Yellow Journalism because Pulitzer
and Hearst’s papers fought over which one would print
a popular comic called The Yellow Kid.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.580
It was a strange time.)

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:49.900
Yellow Journalism, then and now, helps remind
us of those ancient questions – what happens
when we rely on media?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.920
Should everyone have access to it?

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.800
What happens if that access is exploited?

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.760
Media literacy is nothing new, but it’s
adapting and changing all the time.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.340
Where media literacy once required a
mastery of language and a quill,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.940
the age of the penny press required the
ability to analyze headlines at a glance and
tell truth from sensationalism.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.900
With every new medium, a new set of skills
is needed to navigate it all – and we haven’t
even gotten to TV.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.680
That’s for next time, during The History
of Media Literacy Part II.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.260
For now, I’m Jay Smooth.
