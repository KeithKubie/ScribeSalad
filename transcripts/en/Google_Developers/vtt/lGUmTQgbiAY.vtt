MIKE PODWAL: Hello.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:04.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.090
Welcome.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.350
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.060
My name is Mike.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.710
I'm a product
manager on Daydream.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.360
It's awesome to be here.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.420
So just to start things
off, how many of you just

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.062
attended the talk on Google VR?

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:21.270
[CHEERING]

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.880
Yeah, I thought so--
a lot of people.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.290
That's great.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.310
For those of you who weren't
there, in that talk we just

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.726
announced Daydream Labs, our
rapid prototyping effort.

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:32.350
We're excited to tell
you all about it.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.670
So we'll dive right in.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.130
At Google, we spend a
lot of time thinking

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.740
about what works well in VR.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.630
Our industry has come a long
way exploring the possibilities,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.790
discovering its
killer use cases,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.110
learning how to design
a great experience.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.830
And part of what makes
VR so exciting right now

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.650
is that it's still early days.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.240
There is so much
left to explore.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.780
So last year, we
started Daydream Labs.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.820
Our goal is to
experiment with VR

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.530
and share what we
learn with everyone.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.430
We do research and
rapid prototyping

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
on lots of things like
hardware and usability.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.500
One area we focus on
is app experiments.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.760
We build bit-sized prototypes
that allow us to quickly test

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.450
a single hypothesis about VR.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.270
We don't focus on any
particular product or platform.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.870
And we love building on all
kinds of hardware-- HTC Vive,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.610
Oculus, Daydream, and more.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.210
For each experiment,
we try to pick

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.335
the right tool for the job.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.150
And we try to move pretty fast.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.040
On average, we build two new
app experiments each week.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.290
And if you're interested in
learning a little bit more

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.730
about the process for
our rapid prototyping,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.700
we have another talk today at
4:00 PM that's all about it.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.120
Check it out.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.310
Just a quick overview of how we
work-- for each app experiment,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.660
we pair one engineer
with one designer.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.470
They start the week
building stuff.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.160
By the end of the
week, they'll share it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.780
with a bunch of people,
get their feedback,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.340
and see what we learned.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.980
And then we share those
lessons within Google.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.450
Today, we're so excited
to start sharing

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.689
these lessons with everyone.

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.480
In this talk, we'll
walk through what we've

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.630
learned across
three areas-- first,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.330
interactions, the
amazing things you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.770
can do in VR with a
controller; second, immersion,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.500
your environment in VR and all
the things that contributes

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.310
to a sense of presence;
and finally, social,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.600
what it's like to share these
experiences with other people.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.750
So with that, I'll
hand it over to Stefan

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.450
to talk to you
about interactions.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.610
Thank you.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.004
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.160
STEFAN WELKER: Hi everyone.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.930
It's great to be here.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.340
My name is Stefan Welker.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.836
I'm a software
engineer on Daydream.

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:04.085
Let's talk about interactions.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.280
To set some context, in VR,
the main way people interact

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.630
is by using a controller
that is tracked in 3D space.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.190
What's awesome is that these
controllers can look and act

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.970
like any tool.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.000
Your controller can
be a laser pointer

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.760
that makes it possible to
reach things that are far away.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.760
And that can be across
the room or even

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.280
across the whole galaxy.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.660
Controllers can also
become your virtual hands.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.740
But there is no reason
to limit yourself

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.070
to these common input types.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:53.600
Your controller can also turn
into a hammer, a tennis racket,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.240
a fishing rod, or
even a frying pan.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.815
Come on, this is crazy.

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:01.765
AUDIENCE: Woo.

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:04.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.400
STEFAN WELKER: Your controller
can become any tool or toy.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.640
In a sense, the visual
representation drives its use.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.840
And since we humans
are naturally

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.279
good at using proxy objects like
tools to manipulate the world,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.130
controllers also
feel very natural.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.240
With accurate tracking
in VR, the skills

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.780
needed to interact with objects
in the real world or in VR

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.190
are already present
in everybody.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.510
So nobody has to learn
how to use a controller.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.570
Let's walk through a
few of the interaction

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.740
models that are possible.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.270
One of our first lessons
was that direct manipulation

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.300
of objects-- for example,
picking something up

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.540
with your hands-- is one of
the most natural and satisfying

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.900
input methods.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.820
In this experiment, we let
you play drums, which was fun.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.080
We also gave people the
ability to grab and move

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.740
the drums by grabbing
them with a controller.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.470
We learned that
height adjustment

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.300
and ergonomic positioning
is really easy in VR.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.260
People quickly built their dream
drum kits and started to play.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.510
There is no feeling like
building your own drum fort

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.053
and hiding inside it.

00:05:27.053 --> 00:05:29.831
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.950
We also found that
everybody really

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.890
likes throwing things in VR.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.570
Gestural input is a
very powerful concept.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.450
In this prototype,
you scoop up seeds

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.630
and you water them
with a watering can.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.810
People already know how to
use a real watering can,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.740
so they expect the same
behavior of these VR objects.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.720
There is no need for
any buttons here.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.270
We then took it
even a step further.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.740
In this experiment, people
weren't holding a controller

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.930
at all.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.830
They were holding
a real watering can

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.480
where we stuck a Vive
controller inside.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.430
We matched the geometry,
so it is really satisfying

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.550
to touch an object in
VR and in the real world

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.850
at the same time.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.170
We added some weight, so it's
weighted with a bag of water.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.360
And we expected that
people would set it down

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.030
because it would feel heavy.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.530
But it connected for
them the real world

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.020
and the virtual worlds together
in a delightful manner.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.780
You can only imagine
what kinds of objects

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.795
could be tracked in
VR in the future.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.210
Designing environments
is much more natural

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.660
when you are in the
environment yourself.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.810
In this living room
examples, we give the users

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.380
superpowers like
lifting heavy objects

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.660
or even scaling them with
a simple stretch gesture.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.290
Doing these things on
a traditional 2D user

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.080
interface with a mouse
would be pretty hard.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.640
Yet they're very intuitive given
positional controller input.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.730
In this experiment,
we also learned

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.210
that giving users
creative freedom

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.570
can lead to unexpected outcomes.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.960
In the app, we added
a clone button.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.380
People started to replicate
objects lots of times.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.910
They were very creative.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.555
They built trees
out of speakers.

00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:39.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.620
But ultimately, we learned that
this creative freedom can also

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.500
distract from the
app's core use case.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.350
As a developer,
you should consider

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.070
that if you want to
direct the user to perform

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.610
certain tasks in your app.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.450
Controllers for VR
have become incredibly

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.650
precise and responsive.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.930
But just because this
precision is possible,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.380
we don't require everyone
to be precise all the time.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.010
Fluid interactions can be
supported by allowing throwing

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.860
or snapping together of objects.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.990
In VR, imprecise actions can
lead to an ordered result

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.370
instead of chaos.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.100
In our photo experiment,
you can throw things

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.970
at a wall to create
a wall paper,

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.830
toss them around the
room to share them,

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.159
or scoop up a whole
mess of photos

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:39.030
just with one fluid motion.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.390
You can create a really
neatly organized folder.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.350
To the user, it feels like the
system is reading their minds.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.420
And it just works.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.418
[TAPPING]

00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:56.406
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.240
We call this one drum keys.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.590
This is a volumetric keyboard.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.870
The buttons give visual,
sound, and haptic feedback

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.860
to the user.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.900
This makes the keyboard feel
responsive and fun to use.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.300
The feedback may
seem very subtle,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.410
but it is very noticeable
when it is missing.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.050
Just for kicks, we
made a game out of it

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.690
to see who had the
highest words per minute.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.890
There are so many new
things you can learn and do

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.750
with a VR controller.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.870
You should really
try it yourself.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.240
It's really eye-opening to
use computers in this way.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.300
With this, I'm going
to hand over to Manuel

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.990
to talk about immersion.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.810
Thanks.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.525
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.810
MANUEL CLEMENT: Hello, my
name is Manuel Clement.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:07.150
I'm the designer/crazy
prototyper on Daydream.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.820
In VR, there are
many things that

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.330
contribute to a
sense of immersion--

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:16.430
your environment, how you
move around, audio, and more.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.640
Let's look at a few things
we've tried and learned

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.340
about creating the sense of
immersion and even increase it.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.130
This prototype
demonstrates the importance

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.760
of fluid, reactive environments.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.580
In VR, your environment
is everything around you--

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:47.650
in this case, a simple
floor, a wall, and the sky.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.740
People naturally want to
interact with their world,

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.580
manipulate it.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.780
They push, they
pull, they reach,

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.780
and they even throw stuff.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.430
The more reactive your
environment, the more immersive

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.810
it will be.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.900
People will feel connected.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.610
It's so amazing to see
your virtual world respond,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.633
come to life, obey or even
break the laws of physics.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.660
After interacting with
their environment,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.720
the first thing people
want to do is move around.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.580
The challenge is that many
of the techniques that

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.270
allow people to move around
in large virtual environments

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.980
can also make them lose
context, which breaks immersion.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.040
In this case, you're looking
at a technique commonly called

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.080
teleportation.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.970
It works in most cases.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.920
Like, at one point
there's a Google logo.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.290
I want to go here.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.076
Oh, there you go.

00:11:52.076 --> 00:11:53.950
When there's a Google
logo and you go there--

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.260
because you have a frame of
reference, it works fine.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.470
But if you advancing through
a forest and everything

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.080
kind of looks the same,
it's hard to understand

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.080
what just happened.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.650
So we tried many things.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.680
We explored things
to enable movement

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.950
while preserving
context when moving

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.770
around large environments.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.660
We call this one
Slides and Ladders.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.570
Pay attention to
the top left corner.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.520
You can see a video of
myself moving around

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.180
in RR, real reality.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.725
Notice how small the room is.

00:12:32.725 --> 00:12:38.110
It's about five feet by
12 feet, not very large.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.930
There's slides that
do what you expect.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.690
When you sit down
on them, they go.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.680
There's ladders you just
reach and pull to climb.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.930
There's a virtual
gondola you can ride.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:55.200
And even you can float on
a cloud across the sky.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.440
When people took
of their headset,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.210
they were stunned to see
how small the room was.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.010
They had forgotten because
the VR environment they

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.470
had experienced was massive.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.170
They never lost context.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.180
They traveled through
a huge space there.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.640
We can't wait to
see what you all

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.580
will come up with
to do teleportation

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.590
and movement in VR.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.690
Here we built a
conveyor belt game

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.040
lets you sort through
cubes and eat donuts.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.410
What's important
here is that it shows

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.730
how even a flat-looking
environment needs texture

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.100
and shadows to feel real.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.500
In real reality, we never
encounter flat colors.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.210
Let's imagine that a large
object fills our field

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.820
of view in VR, like a wall.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:59.520
It needs texture to maintain
your sense of depth and scale.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.330
Look at the conveyor
belt. You'll

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.890
see that it's moving, because
it has a simple noisy texture.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.040
What does it mean to you all?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.164
Stay away from flat
colors and materials.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.050
Now we're going to
do a little exercise.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.110
Let's all try to be quiet for
a few min-- a few seconds,

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.880
not minutes.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.050
I'm going to count down.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.320
Ready?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.860
Three, two, one.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.920
As you probably
noticed, the real world

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.690
is never truly silent.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.142
Now let's all go somewhere else.

00:14:42.142 --> 00:14:44.118
[BIRDS CALLING]

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:46.660
[WAVES CRASHING]

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.470
I hear birds right there.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.910
And there was water
all around me.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.400
In VR, technologies
like spatial audio

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.738
allow you to have audio coming
from specific 3D locations.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.340
Audio is so important.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.870
We have a talk tomorrow
morning 9:00 AM.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.854
Do not miss it.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.670
For those of you who are
used to 2D experiences,

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:22.410
it's worth pointing out that in
VR, the world is your 3D stage.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.410
You can have 2D UI like
the map on this wall,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.700
where it makes sense.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.400
Additionally, the 3D map
in the middle of the room

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.260
displays dynamic data
over time, in this case,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.990
US population per state.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.280
Users can walk around.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.150
They can inspect things
and compare data points.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.170
3D makes it easy to understand
sizes and relationships

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.870
intuitively.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.210
OK, we're all here today.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.320
That means that our
ancestors at one point,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.866
they were in savanna.

00:15:55.866 --> 00:15:58.240
And they were able to tell
the difference between a kitty

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.390
cat and a lion.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.130
So bring on 3D UI.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.720
The goal should not always
to be replicating reality.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.660
Reality is great in many cases.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.930
However, as humans,
a few crazy elements,

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.900
ingredients can create
these environments really

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.510
make you want to stay
immersed in them.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.330
How about floating
apples and bananas?

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.680
Let's be serious for a second.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.530
We call this one Fruit Salad.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.580
Time and again, we saw
people more engaged

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.310
with playful environments.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.040
They were more delighted to
invest time in the experience

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.540
and explore.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.160
Don't be constrained by reality.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.900
When you design
new environments,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.420
consider multiple vantage
points, different scales.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.290
We call this one Dollhouse.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.869
And when people realized
they could become tiny,

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:09.770
they screamed with joy.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.420
The kid inside them had
always wanted to do this.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.990
It's amazing.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.109
This reminds me of
my own daughter.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.970
She loves to make fairy
houses in our backyard.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.960
And her deepest wish
is to experience

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.460
these magical worlds,
to become a fairy.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:38.750
What if you were as big as the
galaxy or as small as an atom?

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.180
I mean, you notice VR
is a unique opportunity

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.513
to experience the impossible.

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:51.630
And now I'm going
to hand it over

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.610
to Robbie who will talk
about social in VR.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.470
Thank you so much.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.170
ROBBIE TILTON: Thanks.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.520
Hey everyone.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.410
I'm Robbie Tilton, a designer
and prototyper on the Daydream

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.930
team.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.630
We've talked about interactions
and building immersive worlds.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.000
Let's talk about social.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.180
Our industry has already
explored many possibilities

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.180
with social and VR.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.250
Social apps really let
you feel like you're

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.110
in the same room
as someone else,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.899
regardless of where
you are in the world.

00:18:24.899 --> 00:18:26.940
We've done some experiments
too, and we're really

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.773
excited to share some
of what we've learned.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.620
Let's start with avatars. .

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.110
There are many ways to
represent people in VR.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.930
First, we found
even simple avatars

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.520
can be extremely expressive.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.150
This avatar's head only
has a pair of eyes,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.370
and it's still able to
communicate a lot of emotion

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.010
just with the way it moves.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.660
When you combine this
with hands and voice,

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.840
all things come together
to give a real sense

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.590
of shared presence.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.376
You really feel like they're
there in the room with you.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.300
Let's talk about eyes
in a little more detail.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.250
In this video, you
see the avatar blink,

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.630
which is programmed to
happen at a random interval.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.390
When the head turns,
the pupils move

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.080
in the direction it's headed.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.340
Even without other
facial features

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.690
like a mouth or
eyebrows, we were

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:31.702
surprised by how connected we
felt to this other individual.

00:19:31.702 --> 00:19:34.660
Eyes amplify face-to-face
communication.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:40.090
They give people a clear place
to look to and speak toward.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.920
And we called this
one Googly Eyes.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.330
When you're in VR
and your avatar only

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.080
has a head and hands, one of
the first things you'll do

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.477
is look down and ask
yourself, where'd my body go?

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.310
One thing we tried, which
really didn't work well,

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.550
is showing full body avatars.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.560
Most VR systems today
track head and hands.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.960
So by showing the
body, we're basically

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.630
predicting where the legs,
arms, and torso should be.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.260
And most of the time,
we got this wrong.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.840
People expected their
body to be in one place.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.990
And when they looked, it
was in a different place

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.530
than they expected.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.490
It feels really weird.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.630
Full body avatars are
really hard to get right.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.600
If you're going to use them,
be thoughtful about the design

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.482
and how they move.

00:20:39.837 --> 00:20:41.795
Let's talk about designing
social interactions.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.750
We've tested our
social experiments

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.070
with a lot of people.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.000
Just like in real
reality, sometimes people

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.100
end up in the same room and
just had nothing to talk about.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.990
So to remedy this,
think about giving users

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.350
a shared objective.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.590
Giving them something
to play with together

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.044
makes it easy for them to
socialize and break the ice.

00:21:15.099 --> 00:21:16.640
It was also interesting
for us to see

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.833
how free people felt in VR.

00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:21.731
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.250
In case you don't
recognize him, that's

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.270
Manuel Clement, who
just spoke before me,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:35.068
dancing like no one's ever
going to live stream this.

00:21:35.068 --> 00:21:37.394
MANUEL CLEMENT: Robbie?

00:21:37.394 --> 00:21:38.904
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:38.904 --> 00:21:40.570
ROBBIE TILTON: Sorry
about that, Manuel.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.280
Time after time, we saw
people willing to have

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.290
fun with others, dance
around, jump, and get goofy.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.490
This is one of my favorite
parts about social in VR.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:56.620
It's just a ton of fun.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.866
When you put a few
people in a virtual room,

00:22:02.866 --> 00:22:04.240
one of the first
things we saw is

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.350
that people try to physically
connect with each other.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.786
For example, people
love high-fiving.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:12.101
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.030
As a developer, explore ways to
amplify physical contact in VR.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.700
As just one approach,
in this app,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.674
we combined haptic feedback
with a fireworks animation

00:22:23.674 --> 00:22:24.965
every time the hands connected.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.490
Not everything in
VR is fun and games.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.740
We noticed that some
simple interactions

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.450
that may seem innocent can
come across as trolling in VR.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.950
Here you see a
shopping experience

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.555
where two people are trying on
different hats and accessories.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.480
One user decides
to playfully put

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.953
a hat in front of the
other user's eyes.

00:22:59.953 --> 00:23:01.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.150
While this may
seem harmless, this

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.680
can cause serious issues in VR.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.470
This user couldn't see anything.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.570
They felt like they
lost control and even

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.770
had to take their headset off.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.110
Another common problem is people
getting too close to each other

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.380
and invading personal space.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.770
So be cautious.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:20.690
Test your apps out.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.230
And make sure users
feel comfortable

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.146
in social experiences.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.480
And with that, VR designers need
to start thinking about rules

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.010
and logic to prevent trolling.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:37.854
In this example, you see
two dogs playing poker.

00:23:37.854 --> 00:23:41.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.470
Player one is about
to lose a bet.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.740
And you'll see that they get
up in frustration, intending

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.974
to take their chips back.

00:23:47.974 --> 00:23:49.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.790
You'll also notice, when
they get out of their seat,

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.530
the world turns gray.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.930
They disappear from the scene.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.860
And they can no longer
interact with the world.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.980
By design, players can
only see each other

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.450
when they're both seated.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.960
This prevents
things like stealing

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.450
chips or even something worse
like physical confrontation.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.120
This is just one approach.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.980
We'd love to hear
more ideas from you

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.180
to encourage fair play.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.180
Especially in these
early days, not everyone

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.860
will have access
to a VR headset.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.210
But many people will want to
participate in the experience.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.220
One thing we tried
is to let users film

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.395
and share from inside VR
with a virtual camera.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.670
It's like filming
your own TV show.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.930
You just grab the
camera and point it

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.980
at whatever you want
your audience to see.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.600
This lets anybody watch
the VR participant

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:59.770
in the virtual world from any
screen like a phone or laptop.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.830
For another example of this,
check out the spectator camera

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:03.730
in Tilt Brush.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.120
We're super excited
about social in VR.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.480
And we're even more
excited to hear your ideas

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.510
and what you guys
are going to build.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:15.990
Now I'll pass it back to Mike.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.703
Thank you.

00:25:16.703 --> 00:25:19.481
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.450
MIKE PODWAL: So
just to recap, we've

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:30.210
talked about interactions,
immersive worlds, and social.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.840
And when you bring
these all together,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.930
you can build some pretty
compelling experiences.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.500
So to close this
talk, we're going

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.820
to walk through a few more
experiments that show how

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.743
we can combine these things.

00:25:40.743 --> 00:25:43.701
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.630
People had so much fun
with the drums experiment

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.150
that we built another prototype
all about playing music

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.470
with friends.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.920
You can play a virtual
xylophone, a harp, drum kit.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.511
Of course, you can move these
around however you like.

00:26:03.511 --> 00:26:05.010
And you can do
things that you can't

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.080
in real life with real drums
like stack five of them

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.072
on top of each other and strike
them all at the same time.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.030
We call this one Architect.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.490
Many architecture
firms use VR today

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.630
to preview a 3D model
that they've designed

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.780
on their desktop computer.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.340
So we played with
the idea of letting

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.680
you design that model in VR.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.640
You can grab materials and
pieces with direct manipulation

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.760
and get tactile feedback.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.560
And when you place a
piece in a certain spot,

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.265
it just snaps right in,
interpreting your intention.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.680
When you want to
preview your design,

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.240
you can step inside and get
a whole new perspective.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:05.480
There are many examples of using
VR for storytelling, especially

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.460
in VR video.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.760
This prototype lets anyone
be a storyteller in VR.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.200
Here you can
animate virtual toys

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.720
into moving,
lifelike characters.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.220
Inspired by motion capture
systems used in Hollywood

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.860
films, you grab
a couple of toys,

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:27.090
in this case Android
figurines, maybe a plane.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.110
You move them through
space and time.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.730
And then you replay the
scene and step into the world

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.640
that you've built.
It is make-believe

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.300
on a whole new level.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.015
And that dog always
cracks me up.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.340
We also love the notion
of a pure thrill.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.370
And sometimes people
will get skeptical

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.140
of a VR experience that's
a little straightforward.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.180
Where's the narrative?

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.900
Where's the utility?

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.740
We learned that sometimes
just being someplace amazing

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.430
is enough.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:05.080
In this experiment, we attach
two controllers to your shoes

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.160
and asked you to go for
a walk off a diving board

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.510
53 meters in the air.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.830
And it is absolutely terrifying.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.544
And not everyone can do it.

00:28:17.544 --> 00:28:18.460
But it's a lot of fun.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.930
In this experiment, we
use social to teach you

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:29.760
a new language, in
this case, Mandarin.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.580
You interact with a teacher who
gives you a new word to say.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.422
You repeat it back.

00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:35.880
And when you do a
good job, you get

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.750
verbal and non-verbal
feedback from the teacher.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.353
You can also have
a nice interaction

00:28:40.353 --> 00:28:41.936
with another student
in the classroom.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.360
VR lets you see products
at their true scale.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.750
This is especially
powerful for larger,

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.540
three-dimensional,
more expensive things

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.450
like furniture.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.530
VR also lets you design
your store however you like.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.090
So for this
experiment, we imagine

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.480
what it would be like to
shop for furniture in a 3D

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.710
model of a home.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.450
You sample the
different products,

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:16.240
see how much they cost, maybe
check out a couple of chairs,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.790
and then drop a specific
speaker in a specific spot

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.610
to see how it looks.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.910
Or I guess you can make a tree
out of speakers-- #SpeakerTree.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.750
And finally, we
built an experiment

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.190
for rehearsing performances
and presentations

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.218
with Google Slides.

00:29:36.218 --> 00:29:39.062
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:43.256 --> 00:29:44.630
And we may have
modeled this room

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:47.676
and maybe used it for
this specific talk.

00:29:47.676 --> 00:29:50.050
So that's the last thing we
have to share with you today.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.290
Before you go, we
have two quick things.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.830
First, we have a lot of
great talks about VR today

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.570
and tomorrow.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:59.860
We hope you check them out.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.400
Later today, we have a talk on
monetization and distribution

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.700
for Daydream.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.390
We have a talk on designing
for the Daydream controller,

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.160
where you can learn how to
make your own frying pan.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.357
We also have a talk
on VR design process

00:30:11.357 --> 00:30:13.940
where you can learn more about
how we do our rapid prototyping

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.830
at Daydream Labs.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.270
This is just the start
of a conversation.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.740
We're going to be posting
regular updates to our blog,

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.420
which is linked to here.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.170
We really look forward
to staying in touch

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.640
and hearing your feedback.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.740
Thank you so much.

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.520
We can't wait to see
what everyone builds.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.390
Thank you.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.190
