00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.220
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.650
- Good evening.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.850
Yes.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.460
And welcome to the
Radcliffe Institute

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.510
for Advanced Study at
Harvard University.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.290
As Faculty Director for the
Humanities at the Institute,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.120
I'd like to both thank you
and to congratulate you

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.190
for coming to this
event, which I

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.650
think will not only
be illuminating,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.310
but also great fun.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.850
My name is Shigehisa
Kuriyama, but only for a few

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.630
more minutes.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.050
For over the course
of the next two hours,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.900
I've been given the opportunity
to become someone else, someone

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.380
new, someone whom I've never
known in my 64 years on Earth--

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.310
--and yet someone who
has doubtless been

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.050
within me all along, waiting
for this evening with you

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.410
and the magic of talented
transformation artists, who

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.540
are with us tonight.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.340
So tonight you'll get
a chance to witness

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.020
this transformation live
not only in me, but also

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.634
in Professor Robin Bernstein--

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:26.660
[APPLAUSE] --current
Radcliffe fellow

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.940
and Chair of the
Department of Women's

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.940
Sexuality and Gender
here at Harvard,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.380
and was gamely agreed to
join me in this adventure.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.197
Harvard professors in drag.

00:01:41.197 --> 00:01:42.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.292
Who'd have thought it?

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:47.130
[CHEERS]

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.300
But then again, why not?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.890
It's an experiment.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.260
And frankly, nobody knows how
exactly it's going to turn out.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.920
But as you track our
gradual metamorphosis

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.340
into people whose gender
will probably seem much less

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.060
clear than they
seem right now, I'd

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.640
like you to bear
three things in mind.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.730
The first, and probably
most important,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.810
is that Robin and I
are basically you.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.030
We're merely stand-ins.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.510
And in observing the changes
that we are undergoing,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.340
you have to imagine
yourselves being transformed.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.000
You must imagine
yourselves exploring

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.530
the possible selves within
you that have not yet

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.670
been realized.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.490
The second point that I'd
like you to think about

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.710
is the remarkable power of
the art form known as drag

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.410
to spotlight the enthralling
complexity of human identity,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.940
how the many different
permutations of sex, sexuality,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.590
and gender take on
infinite gradations

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.590
as they become combined
with the performance

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.330
and the communication of gender.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.310
This is one of the central
lessons of the wonderful 2017

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.360
documentary called Kings,
Queens, &amp; In-Betweens,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.830
around which this evening's
activities are organized.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.800
And we're privileged and
delighted to be joined

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.910
this evening by Gabrielle and
Jen Burton, two of the five

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.530
sisters who produced this
film, as well as five drag

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.390
performers, some of
whom actually you'll

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.760
see in the film.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.740
So here's the
trailer for the film.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.870
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.990
- When people think of sex and
gender, it's black and white.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.080
Drag is a way to
show the gray areas.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.610
Because it's not
black and white.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.421
It's never been black and white.

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:02.109
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.830
- The root of a lot of
violence and bullying and stuff

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.440
like that is not about
sexual orientation,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.463
it's about gender identity
or gender expression.

00:04:12.463 --> 00:04:13.880
- So I can have a
different gender

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.740
identity from my
physical sex and that

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.899
has nothing to do with who
I want to have sex with?

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:18.399
What?

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.140
- I'm a teacher by day
and a drag king by night.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.858
- I'd go to the Royal
Renegade's shows.

00:04:30.858 --> 00:04:31.900
I thought it was awesome.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.370
But I said there's no way in
hell I would ever do that.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.270
I would never glue
hair on my face.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.770
- All of a sudden
some of the people

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.350
who voted against gay people
having the same rights

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.780
as straight people in the
state are saying, well,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.367
why can't Julie have any
time to stay with her family

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:47.200
when you had a baby?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.240
They have that feeling
of like, well, I

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.324
would never want you to not
be able to be with your son.

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:54.754
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:57.920
- I know that my parents saw a
very different picture for me.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.800
I think they wanted me to go
into politics and be a lawyer.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.087
They also saw me getting
married, having kids.

00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:04.670
I plan on having a
white picket fence.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.753
I plan on having children.

00:05:05.753 --> 00:05:07.465
But I plan on doing
it with another man.

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:09.870
- Oh, no, I mean, the
only time we have sex

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.076
is when it's in drag.

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:11.830
No.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.580
- Do not use that.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.485
That is so not true.

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:13.985
- [LAUGHS]

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:15.880
- That will never happen ever.

00:05:18.413 --> 00:05:20.830
- I had to sit down and ask
my bro, like, how to be a guy,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.200
like, how to walk like a guy.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.410
- I'm a trans guy.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.390
I'm doing theater.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.840
This isn't drag for me.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.700
- I don't think
being a man is bad.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.650
I don't think being
a woman is bad.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.980
I just happen to be
really in the middle.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.214
- A drag show in Ohio?

00:05:35.214 --> 00:05:37.339
I didn't even know there
were 400 lesbians in Ohio.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:44.600
- It's OK to be who you are.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.243
I mean, that's what
it's about, not

00:05:46.243 --> 00:05:47.660
being afraid of
being who you are.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.460
- I don't have to be a man.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.625
I don't have to be a woman.

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:51.500
I just have to be me.

00:05:57.974 --> 00:05:59.966
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:04.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.150
- So in a few moments,
Gabrielle and Jen

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.480
will speak to you in greater
detail about the movie

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.830
and the interplay of gender
and drag performance.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.720
And you'll be treated to
some terrific performances

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.610
by our artists.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.910
But I want to conclude with a
third and more general lesson

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.350
that the encounter with
drag might teach us.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.500
And that's a lesson
about latent,

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.062
unrecognized possibilities.

00:06:34.062 --> 00:06:35.770
And here I'm going to
introduce something

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:44.950
that I'm sure you never
expected in an event on drag.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.640
Drag invites us, I
think, to ask what if?

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.060
What if we tried something
that we never, not only never

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.780
tried before, but never
even thought of trying.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.790
What wonderful new truth about
the world, about ourselves

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.830
might we discover?

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.550
Now, I want to illustrate this--

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.090
and this is the
unexpected part--

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.830
with a simple example
about something

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.330
that probably most
of you have never

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.740
tried and certainly
not tried in connection

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.620
with reflections on gender.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:26.650
The thing I have are paper.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.900
Everybody has paper.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.830
Everybody's handled
strips of paper.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.420
But have you ever thought
about the potential

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.360
of two strips of paper?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.000
Think, you could have all
sorts of associations.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.300
One is sex, sexuality.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:51.007
One is John and Joanna, John and
Mary, the body and performance.

00:07:51.007 --> 00:07:52.590
There are all sorts
of things that one

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.080
could associate with these two.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.390
Now, if you were to take
a strip of paper and glue

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.170
them together and then cut
them, what would you get?

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.490
You'd get two rings.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.580
Everybody knows this.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.080
But here's something that
probably you have never tried.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:20.830
Suppose you have two strips and
you glue them together and then

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.328
what you can do--

00:08:23.328 --> 00:08:28.850
let's see here-- in terms
of unexpected possibilities.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.610
This is something that you
can try at home, right?

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.169
It's PG.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.934
No, no, you can do it
with four year olds.

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.150
Sorry.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:50.430
So you're going to
glue one and the other

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:56.400
so that you end up
with two rings, right?

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.390
Simple enough.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.780
Definitely try this at home.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.620
Now, before, if we had one
ring and we cut it apart,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.180
you know you get two rings?

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.330
What happens if I now
take this and split

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.953
this does anybody know?

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.370
Again, it's not something that
you do every day, you know?

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.130
It's not part of
your daily practice.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.835
Oh, let's see if I can cut this.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:33.480
You get one ring, four
rings, anything else?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.840
Any other takers
before I finally--

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.315
So we have four rings, you have
one ring, but what do you get?

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.723
You get a square.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:02.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.900
Who'd have thought it, right?

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.925
So we had two straight
rings, and we got this.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.280
I just wanted to show.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.313
I just sort of lost track.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.840
See how user friendly we are?

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.160
We want to make sure that
you're able to do this at home.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.540
So you just saw the result.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.330
Now, we're going to
a second possibility.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.970
So now you get,
oh, maybe there's

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.090
something more to these
ordinary strips of paper

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.640
than you thought.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.490
And you think, OK,
now I know I can

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.110
try something different, which
is you take two cross strips

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.890
and you make one ring, but the
second time you add a twist,

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.340
right?

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.870
You add a twist.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.940
So again, you can imagine, OK,
sex, sexuality, John and Jen,

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.550
there are all sorts of
variations you could think of.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.340
So this time, instead of
just two straight rings,

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.980
you're going to get
one with a twist.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.705
So what is the result
of that process?

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.506
Any takers here?

00:11:18.506 --> 00:11:21.260
- A tetrahedron.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.100
- Tetrahedron?

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.570
Somebody who knows a lot
about geometry, but not really

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.928
about sex.

00:11:30.928 --> 00:11:34.344
[LAUGHING]

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.190
So again, don't
take my word for it.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.750
Try it.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.560
What you get,
interestingly enough--

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:57.900
whoops-- is again, you'll get
a square, even with a twist.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.410
So final experiment-- think, OK,
that's been going pretty well.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.750
This time we're going
all the way, right?

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:21.100
We're going to go and
make two interlinked rings

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.910
with one twisted toward
the right and one

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.990
twisted toward the left.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.702
What's going to happen?

00:12:30.702 --> 00:12:32.055
- A square.

00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:33.408
[LAUGHING]

00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:36.270
- Oh, OK.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.709
So, a pessimist.

00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:42.132
[LAUGHING]

00:12:45.555 --> 00:12:48.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.100
It doesn't look like it's
going to be a square.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.400
What is it going to look like?

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:06.970
Let's see.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.756
Just got a little-- oops.

00:13:08.756 --> 00:13:09.780
My finger is stuck here.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:24.525
If you unfold it, what you find
is basically two linked hearts.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.265
And I think this
is a good lesson.

00:13:30.265 --> 00:13:34.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.450
Now, what I'd like you
to think about is this,

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.610
paper is such a simple thing.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.140
It only has two sides.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.670
Anybody can use this, right?

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.020
Human beings are so
much more complicated

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.870
than a two-sided sheet of paper.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.670
Think of the possibilities.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.450
So that's one of the
themes of this evening.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.253
I'd like now to turn it
over to Jen and Gabrielle.

00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:00.634
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:05.470
- Thank you so much.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.940
- Thank you so much, Hisa.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.180
That was so wonderful.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.355
So I'm Jennifer Burton.

00:14:10.355 --> 00:14:11.980
And this is my sister
Gabrielle Burton.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.240
And we are two of
the five sisters.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.730
We have a company Five
Sisters Productions.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.990
We've made seven feature films,
many commercials, shorts,

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.690
and including many that look
at gender from different angles

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:26.830
and perspectives.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.380
We've made the MTV
LOGO film Happiest

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.850
Day of His Life, which is
the picture-perfect wedding

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.070
all gender reversed.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.260
We're making a series of short
films called Half the History

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.390
on the under-told stories of
women in American history.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.230
We have a new film coming
out that's about parenting

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.130
and gender.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.830
And, of course, Kings,
Queens, &amp; In-Betweens.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.570
Tonight, I also wanted to add,
is a particularly celebratory

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.070
night.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:59.200
We're very happy to be kicking
off the 2019 conference.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.270
And also tonight one
of our performers

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.450
in the film, Nina West, is
premiering on the RuPaul drag

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.640
show.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.178
So that's exciting.

00:15:09.178 --> 00:15:09.970
- Hashtag teamnina.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.490
So we made this
film because we were

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.550
interested in capturing gender
diversity and the complexity

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.120
of gender performance
both on and off stage.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.870
Drag is a perfect window to open
up these questions about how

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.900
we define identity in our
society, how we might get

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:34.090
beyond the binaries of, say,
male-female, straight-gay,

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.850
masculine-feminine and
instead create space

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.390
to recognize the complexity
of all of our humanity.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.420
Using music and
costumes and movement,

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.560
drag goes beyond words to
explore new possibilities

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.070
for the aesthetics of gender.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.890
And so much of gender is
communicated non-verbally.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.750
We'd like to start
by introducing you

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.667
to some of the performers
we were lucky enough

00:15:57.667 --> 00:16:01.360
to be able to film for
Kings, Queens, &amp; In-Betweens.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.982
I need to remind you that
Harvard's campus is cash free,

00:16:03.982 --> 00:16:05.440
so you have to
refrain from tipping

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.125
these performers tonight.

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:10.750
So without further ado, here are
members of the Royal Renegades

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.848
the Reverend Roy Rogers.

00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:13.390
Twinkerbell--

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.121
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:15.121 --> 00:16:17.640
[LAUGHING]

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.280
I'll read all the
names, then you can--

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.120
Twinkerbell, Topher Wright,
Dr. Cool Ethan, Jaden Jamison,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.210
and drag queen Anisa Love.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:31.665
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:36.615
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.470
- As so much of drag is
about transformation,

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.670
we'd like now to invite our
two professor volunteers up

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.854
to begin their transformation.

00:16:57.854 --> 00:17:00.194
[CHEERING]

00:17:00.194 --> 00:17:03.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.690
OK.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:09.970
So we have Hisa Kuriyama
and Robin Bernstein

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.760
to start, who will be here.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.420
And as we start
the transformation,

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.692
we're going to be showing
the first clip, which

00:17:15.692 --> 00:17:17.109
is seven minutes
long and lays out

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:20.349
some of the issues
about drag and gender.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.373
So we'll get you set
up with your chairs.

00:17:23.373 --> 00:17:24.040
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.210
- For me, it's not
about gender, at least.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.160
- I think it's easy for him to
say that it's not about gender.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.987
Because I don't honestly
think in his mind

00:17:31.987 --> 00:17:33.070
it is about gender at all.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:37.810
I think, like, but I don't
think that drag from the outside

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.470
perspective cannot be about
gender in our society,

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.720
whether it's
subconscious or not.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.740
Like, I feel like it
says a lot about gender,

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.607
whether it's meant to or not.

00:17:49.607 --> 00:17:51.690
- Because when you get on
stage for drag and I say

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.150
I'm Toe B, a drag king,
there is an expectation

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.280
from the audience that
I look like a man.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.190
And then I get judged
on how masculine I look.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.570
I like to blur all that stuff.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.120
I like to be feminine and
masculine at the same time

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.250
because there's a whole
continuum of where

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.170
people are in terms of gender.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.695
And so I want to
mix all that up.

00:18:09.695 --> 00:18:11.320
- It's a complicated
issue, because I'm

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.790
dressing like a woman.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.055
But really, I'm not really
dressing like a woman.

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:18.140
If you think about it,
it's such a character.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.000
You know, it's big
hair, pounds and pounds

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.120
of-- tell me what woman
wears that much makeup.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.700
- Gender really is this
made up thing in our head

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.370
to keep everybody in order.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.990
That's all it really is.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.920
It doesn't even make any
sense, no sense whatsoever.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.160
Not every girl looks
good in pastels.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.050
- For gay men, I'll
say that I think

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.900
it's very difficult to live up
to a standard of what you think

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.623
masculinity is supposed to be.

00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:44.290
There's this kind of
like Will and Grace

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.910
style gay man that's,
like, everybody's best

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.080
friend at the office, you know?

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.630
And I don't know that there's
quite that lesbian identity of,

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.170
like, oh, you know, like, that
the straight guys at the office

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.420
are going to be like, oh,
my best friend is a lesbian.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.280
I'm going to take her to, like,
get some power tools with me.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.090
- Oh, no, the flip
side is the coach.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.590
- Right.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.048
- You know, or the
beast, you know?

00:19:01.048 --> 00:19:04.340
The big old coach, butch
woman who's, you know, scary,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.440
scares everyone.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.440
- I remember when I was 13,
I had to ask my brother,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.400
literally, I had to sit
down with my brother,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.690
who is a football-playing,
you know,

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.905
beating up people guy
and lifting weights.

00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:18.280
I had to sit down
and ask my bro,

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.570
like, how to be a guy, like
how to walk like a guy.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.590
And I remember him sitting down
and showing me how to walk.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.900
- It's like you raise your
eyebrows and you smile.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.158
Hi, oh, there's a
little baby in here.

00:19:28.158 --> 00:19:28.950
Oh, that's so cute.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.730
I mean, you know, and
if you talk like that,

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.850
people are going to
be like, oh, well,

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:32.930
this person has to be a woman.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.472
- I couldn't tell
you the first thing

00:19:34.472 --> 00:19:37.198
about how to do like boy stuff
like fix a car or, you know,

00:19:37.198 --> 00:19:38.740
fix a computer or
anything like that.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.740
- That's not necessarily
boy stuff, though.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.990
- This is how I'm comfortable.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.620
I'd rather not wear baggy
clothes and backwards hats

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.530
and polo shirts.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.250
That's me.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.650
This is how-- No
one criticizes me

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.130
for the way I dress because
I pass for what feminine

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.385
is supposed to be.

00:19:55.385 --> 00:19:57.760
- There actually is a moment
in the film Paris is Burning

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.690
where one of the characters
is talking about wanting to,

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.190
like, knowing that he wanted
to be a woman because he wanted

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.390
to like wear frilly
underwear and carry a purse.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.820
And I'm like, well, I'm
a woman and I've never

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.820
worn frilly underwear and
I don't carry a purse.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.720
- Some of our greatest
chefs and cooks are men.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.560
But at the same time, they'll
tell you in the household,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.120
in a heterosexual
relationship, it

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.500
should be the woman that cooks.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.923
Now, how do you
make sense of that?

00:20:19.923 --> 00:20:20.590
- You know what?

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:21.490
I'm a guy.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.570
And I am feminine.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.070
And I have the right
to be feminine.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.270
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.110
And I am a guy.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.360
I don't have to be your
stereotype of a guy.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.860
Even in the trans
community, there's

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.590
a lot of expectations there
of what you're supposed to be.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.340
And I have people
telling me all the time,

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.215
why are you messing it
up for the rest of us?

00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:38.950
People look at you and they
see you with your pink hair

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.680
and acting like a girl
and that tells people

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.170
that being a trans guy isn't
real and that you're faking it

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.210
and that you're messing it up.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:50.740
And then it's like, what can
you say to that except I'm just

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.220
trying to live my life.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.230
- The root of a lot of
violence and bullying and stuff

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.290
like that is not about
sexual orientation.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.590
It's about gender identity
or gender expression.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.250
I mean, cultural expectations
that, if you have a vagina,

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.950
you will be a female.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.330
You will then have a
certain kind of femininity,

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.140
and then, you know, certain
jobs and certain power dynamics

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.710
and certain relationships to
someone of the opposite sex who

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.470
has a penis and all
of the expectations

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:20.470
that go along with that.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.240
And people who don't follow
those rules get pushed around.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.370
And it happens on the
playground when you're five.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.980
And it happens in the
corporate world when you're 50.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.703
- But the binary of
gender maintains things

00:21:33.703 --> 00:21:35.370
like the census, where
you have to pick,

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.670
are you a man or a woman,
are you male or female.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.780
But there are
obvious alternatives.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.420
Like, we could ask
people, where do you

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.340
sit on the spectrum
or a continuum

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.800
between masculine and feminine?

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.340
- Super feminine, super butch,
I think there's a lot of us

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.290
out there that just kind
it fall in the middle.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.590
- What comes to mind for
me is going to the bathroom

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:05.040
in a public place as a woman
who reads as masculine often,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.138
I've had years of stares and
gasps and, [GASPS] are you

00:22:09.138 --> 00:22:09.930
in the right place?

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.097
You know that kind of thing.

00:22:11.097 --> 00:22:15.000
But no woman responds
with violence towards me.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.423
They respond with like
shock or something.

00:22:17.423 --> 00:22:18.840
- You kind of watch
over your back

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.580
to see what's
happening behind you,

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.830
you know, if you're walking
down the street, you know?

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.680
Even though nothing would ever
happen and nothing ever has,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.370
you always are kind of keeping
an eye open, you know, to--

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.130
- I wouldn't say
nothing ever happened.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.450
- No, I mean, you know,
people will yell something.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.260
But I'll tell you--

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.280
- You got egged.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.500
- But not in drag.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.090
I think you have more
problems just as a gay man

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.620
than you do as a drag queen.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.020
- When people think of sex and
gender, it's black and white.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.120
And for me, drag is a way
to show the gray areas.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.620
Because it's not
black and white.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.300
It's never been black and white.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.210
- The really fun part of
drag is playing around

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.890
with what gender can mean.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.110
I can have, like, a
package in my pants

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.940
and still not be bound.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.190
- You can be this masculine
person who is this

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.310
male-identified character,
yet the male character that

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.800
you're identifying
is really femme.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.860
- Once he starts singing, it
drops all gender barriers.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.960
- It's the freedom of drag.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.690
And I don't have to
be a man to do drag.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.930
I don't have to be a woman.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.120
I just have to be me.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.766
And I really think that's
what the essence of drag is.

00:23:24.766 --> 00:23:27.206
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:27.206 --> 00:23:30.622
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.440
- Thanks.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.720
This conference is about
gender and communication.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.700
And we're so happy to
be here with Kings,

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.790
Queens, &amp; In-Betweens and
some of the performers

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:41.750
who were in it.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.000
It took us over six years
to make the movie because we

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.410
wanted to get it right.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.913
And in our film
company, we sisters

00:23:47.913 --> 00:23:49.580
have often thought
about the issues that

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.050
are communicated through media
about gender, what subconscious

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.570
and conscious
messaging is telling us

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.520
through those images.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.530
There is a fundamental
question about identity,

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.760
how we communicate
identity beyond words

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.280
and how our cultural
presumptions, stereotypes,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.140
and traditions play
into that, either

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.310
influencing or reinforcing
what is being communicated.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.990
Drag shakes all that up.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.060
It shakes up a binary
system that is often

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.280
imposed upon our thinking.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.470
Drag makes us
question what we see,

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.470
what we perceive in the
layers of what we might know

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.470
or what we actually
think we know.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.510
The communication of
gender within drag

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.330
is completely up for grabs.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:35.210
Now, not literally, though
that does happen at some shows.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.630
But gender and identity and drag
are not defined or communicated

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:42.140
through clothing, hair
quaffing, or other indicators

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.180
that we typically stereotype.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.460
Drag uses its art
form to shake up

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.530
the whole idea of what it
means to be female or male.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.250
And within an LGBTQ
performing space,

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.300
it also raises questions of
how we communicate sexuality.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.790
Is it on the surface?

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.630
Is it in our swagger
or in our engagement

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.970
with an audience
who knows perhaps

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.300
how we represent ourselves
outside of that space?

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.880
Recently, the #MeToo movement
has brought communication

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.920
and gender to the
forefront, gathering

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.050
the strengths of millions
of individual voices

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.290
and amplifying their gendered
experiences, helping them to be

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.650
heard as a group, in strength.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.110
Ultimately, for Jen and
me, all the performers

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.720
of this who are here
tonight, questioning

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.157
these assumptions is the
key, questioning ourselves

00:25:30.157 --> 00:25:32.240
and raising questions
perhaps in the conversations

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.270
we have with others.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.560
And there's also then the
celebratory acceptance

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.940
of welcoming in not defining
others, of welcoming

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.875
in one's own self definition,
whatever that might be,

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.500
and of all of it
being OK because we're

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.730
each masterpieces in the making.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.650
Drag communicates that to
the audience, that that's

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.680
what we are, whoever we are,
and whatever experiences

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.720
we might be having
in life or have had,

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.110
whatever pain we might
be in, and the joys, too.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.640
This is an art form
that celebrates

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.980
the beauty of every
person and connects us

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.872
into one fabric of humanity
because this is who we are.

00:26:08.872 --> 00:26:10.628
And here's Anisa Love.

00:26:10.628 --> 00:26:14.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:19.094
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.943
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:31.943 --> 00:26:34.110
- The Wednesday night show
is, like, a big rotation.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.540
So since there's so many
drag queens in Columbus,

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.200
it's just kind of who is
selected and who is performing.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.932
It's a very straight crowd on
Friday nights, which we love.

00:26:42.932 --> 00:26:44.890
But sometimes it takes
them a little bit longer

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:45.340
to get into it.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.423
Because they don't know
us, necessarily, you know,

00:26:47.423 --> 00:26:48.500
personally.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.320
And then Saturday
at 6 o'clock it

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.870
starts getting really rowdy,
then 10:00 is really crazy.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.380
And then Sundays are
just really drunk, so--

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.484
[LAUGHS]

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.730
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:25.810
- That's bullshit.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:26.533
I'm sorry.

00:27:26.533 --> 00:27:27.200
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:27.950
It's bullshit, too.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.408
- Oh, no, that's
just-- he's just--

00:27:32.168 --> 00:27:34.960
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.680
- Isn't that painful
in your hair?

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.003
- Uh, no, not really.

00:27:38.003 --> 00:27:39.670
Because the sweat
takes everything away.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.783
But it's a little tight
right now because I put it

00:27:41.783 --> 00:27:42.700
on a little too tight.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.960
Wasn't paying attention.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.050
- Beverly, look at this.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:46.467
Look, come over
here and show her.

00:27:46.467 --> 00:27:47.630
Show her.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.990
Her balls are inside of
her and they're like this.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.570
Show her.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:51.070
- No!

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.938
- You look like the
Terminator right now.

00:28:01.938 --> 00:28:02.980
- Terminator or Predator?

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.630
- Your skin is all shiny.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.670
Do you think that the
celebrities in Hollywood

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.990
use PAM to take their
faces off at night?

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.070
Does Richard Chamberlain use PAM
to take his face off at night?

00:28:17.276 --> 00:28:19.250
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.530
- Love you.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.365
- Love you.

00:28:26.365 --> 00:28:27.808
- Where did I put my shirt?

- Have a good night, guys.

00:28:42.055 --> 00:28:44.850
- Our chariot, our
Lamborghini awaits.

00:28:49.174 --> 00:28:52.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.680
- You can see from
that clip how hard

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.530
work professional drag can be.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.700
And you can make money.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.530
But there are certainly other
easier ways to make a living.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.100
So what draws people
to perform drag?

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.370
The answers range from
self-expression to politics,

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.780
to community.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.420
And when we have a
Q&amp;A, you may want

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.590
to ask some of the performers
what brings them to drag

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.813
and what drag means to them.

00:29:22.813 --> 00:29:24.230
In thinking about
tonight's event,

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.410
I was also thinking about
what draws me and my sisters

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.710
to explore gender in our work.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.920
It took me way back to when
we were children growing up

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.250
in Washington DC and my parents
joined the feminist movement

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.320
in the '70s.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.510
My mother went from a
traditional housewife

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.650
who dressed up for
going out in a bouffant

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.340
and in pearls and heels.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.580
And she went from that
to giving up skirts

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:58.250
for jeans, having
long hair, no makeup.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.830
Now, this was just at the
time when my sisters and I

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.343
were starting to
enter adolescence

00:30:03.343 --> 00:30:04.760
when she was
consciously giving up

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.010
all of the traditional
trappings of femininity.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.520
So what it did for
us is we started

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.610
equating traditional
gender expression

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.380
for women with sexism.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.020
And we developed this
sort of secret code

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.780
amongst ourselves that was
really a rigid policing.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.140
So there was no
makeup, of course,

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.430
no twirly skirts, those were
definitely bad, no shaving,

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.980
which was hard in a
large public school

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:35.210
system, and no dangly earrings.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.480
I still remember the moment
that my sister Maria, who'd

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.790
grown a little
bit older, and she

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:44.090
insisted on buying these
Snoopy earrings that

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:46.220
fell just below the earlobe.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:53.820
And it felt as if so
much was at stake,

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.390
that this decision could
start everything crumbling

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.270
and lead to her ruin.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.720
So fast forward to graduating
from Harvard Radcliffe,

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.920
I majored here in drama
before they had a drama major.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.590
I did a special concentration
in non-verbal communication

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.600
in theater.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.550
And I ended up
getting a fellowship

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:18.660
to go to Japan to study
traditional Japanese theater,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.950
Kabuki and Noh.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.960
And there is a very
strong tradition

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.590
of drag in the national
theatrical tradition of Japan.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.040
So one of the first dances
that my kabuki sensei

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.560
taught me is "Sakura."

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:36.125
And he taught it to me as a
female, which is very small

00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:37.460
and in.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.690
And you do these
kind of movements.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.218
And you speak in
a very high voice.

00:31:42.218 --> 00:31:43.760
And then he taught
it to me as a man.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:49.010
And it's open and
big and loud and low.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.620
And over the course
of the year, I

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.300
realized that I
didn't want to be this

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.160
and I didn't want to be this.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.660
But I was somewhere in between.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:05.880
And studying this
theater for a year,

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.630
it gave me the ability to decide
myself about gender in my life

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:14.840
and work without listening too
hard to what others, including

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:20.162
my mother, thought about
the way that one should be.

00:32:20.162 --> 00:32:21.870
So my son and daughter
are growing up now

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:25.560
in Brookline where they have
a dizzying number of options

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.400
for how they want
to look and act,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.700
which carries its own
difficulties for adolescents.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.000
But the key difference is that
they are navigating at a time

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.700
when we are developing
the words, when we

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.790
are finding models for being.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.820
What I, as a child,
vigilant about

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.970
the dangerous slippery
slope of dangling earrings,

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.090
could never ever have imagined.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.974
Thank you.

00:32:50.974 --> 00:32:52.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:57.396
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:23.084
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:26.130
- So sex, gender, and
sexuality, I got it?

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:26.790
- Yes.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.548
- Everybody has a sex, a
gender, and a sexuality.

00:33:29.548 --> 00:33:30.840
And they're mutually exclusive.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.460
One does not dictate the other.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:39.360
- Sex, gender, and sexuality
are three separate things.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.580
- Like, oh my god, so I
can have a different gender

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.410
identity from my
physical sex and that

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.570
has nothing to do with who
I want to have sex with?

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:46.250
What?

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.140
- OK, so sex is
your physicality--

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.650
I'm a man or a woman.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.553
Sexuality is who
am I attracted to.

00:33:51.553 --> 00:33:53.970
And then gender is everything
that is socially constructed

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:54.665
around me.

00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:56.790
A woman should be very
feminine and everything that

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:57.623
represents feminine.

00:33:57.623 --> 00:33:59.873
And a man should be very
masculine and everything that

00:33:59.873 --> 00:34:00.870
represents masculine.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:04.890
- Maybe they were born female,
they're transitioning to male,

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.258
but they're attracted to men.

00:34:06.258 --> 00:34:07.800
Then a lot of people
would say, well,

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.590
then why wouldn't
you just stay a girl?

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.290
And then you'd be normal.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.905
And that's not how
it works either.

00:34:15.905 --> 00:34:18.030
- I don't know I don't
think that any one person is

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.590
necessarily gay or straight.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.520
I don't think any one person
is necessarily male or female.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.068
I think you have traits of
both involved in everybody.

00:34:27.068 --> 00:34:28.860
- I don't think that
it would be impossible

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.017
for me to date a man.

00:34:30.017 --> 00:34:31.350
In fact, I can see it happening.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.719
But it wouldn't
be a straight man.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:37.409
It would be like a gay man
or a transgendered man.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.280
Like I could
definitely see that.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.040
- I have only and still have
only dated straight guys.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.747
I don't consider myself--

00:34:46.747 --> 00:34:48.330
I consider myself
in the gay community

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:49.889
because I support
the gay community.

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:53.250
And I'm definitely a huge
fan of the gay community.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.719
But I consider myself--

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.980
I'd like to say straight.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.960
- I am in a relationship.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.970
I'm in a 15-year, I
think, relationship,

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:09.380
been married 11 years,
with a born female who

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:20.606
does not necessarily see herself
as a lesbian or even gay.

00:35:20.606 --> 00:35:25.010
It's just me who she fell for.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.070
- I think most people label me
as queer because I am attracted

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.990
to so many different people.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:35.060
- And in the male gay
community, are you welcomed in?

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.970
- Yeah, but, I mean, there are
a lot of gay men, obviously,

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:42.230
who want somebody with
biologically male parts.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.290
But there are a lot
of men that just

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.453
want that masculine
physique that, you know,

00:35:47.453 --> 00:35:49.370
if you've got that, it
doesn't matter what you

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.600
have underneath your clothes.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.620
- I recognize Kristin as a drag
king when she's performing.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:58.465
But, I mean, I like
that she is a girl.

00:35:58.465 --> 00:35:59.450
[LAUGHING]

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.930
- We have people who are
women, who identify as women,

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:05.090
and their bodies represent
womanhood to them.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.980
But then they get
with someone on stage

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.740
who they're partnering to
make it a straight couple.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.190
But then queer people are
watching that and seeing it

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.288
as a queer relationship.

00:36:14.288 --> 00:36:16.580
They don't be like, hey, look
at those straight people,

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.252
this is hot.

00:36:17.252 --> 00:36:18.710
They're like, I
know that those are

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.260
both girls I think that's sexy.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.410
So the way the desire is
placed on drag performance

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:26.270
is one of the most
fascinating things.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.250
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.240
- So now we're going
to check in with--

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.300
[LAUGHING]

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.480
You can keep working.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.695
Keep working.

00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:42.210
[LAUGHS] So I have a mic
coming up, I believe.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.510
- I swear I'm not going
to knock your eye out.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:47.635
- Just going to do
a mic for Robin.

00:36:47.635 --> 00:36:48.260
Here they come.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:48.760
Here we are.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.320
Oh, here they are.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.170
My mistake.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:05.830
So Robin, I wanted to ask, what
is this experience like so far?

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.090
- Well, I haven't seen myself.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:08.740
I have no idea what I
look like right now.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.210
This is definitely
the most makeup

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.903
I've ever had on my face.

00:37:11.903 --> 00:37:15.610
[LAUGHING]

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:22.330
- So would you like to talk
a little bit about sort

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.205
of in terms of--

00:37:24.205 --> 00:37:26.430
[LAUGHS] I'm so distracted.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.930
[LAUGHING]

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:31.876
I think I'll go over on
this side for just a second.

00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:38.104
[LAUGHS] Hisa, what do you--

00:37:38.104 --> 00:37:42.580
[LAUGHS] what is this
experience like for you so far.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.283
- Uh, looking good is hard work.

00:37:45.283 --> 00:37:47.960
[LAUGHING]

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.750
- That is for sure.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.892
So Corey, could you talk
a little bit about--

00:37:52.892 --> 00:37:54.100
- What's happening right now?

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.380
- Yes, what kind of things
have you been working on?

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.200
- Here, I can hold it
and you can keep working.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.590
- Perfect.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.590
Well, it's really weird.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:02.150
Because when you try to
take a masculine face---

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:05.770
I will say this now, Asian
men are perfect specimens

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.350
because you already have these
beautiful high cheekbones.

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:09.150
- Hey!

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.740
- Hey!

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.730
But normally, when you're
trying to take a masculine face

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.010
and make feminine features,
it takes a lot more work

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.180
and chiseling.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.490
We don't have that kind of time.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:21.020
So we're just making
shit out of Shinola.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.660
It's going to be beautiful.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.522
He'll be delicious, I swear.

00:38:26.522 --> 00:38:27.850
[LAUGHING]

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.340
She gonna be so purty.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.500
- Hisa, was this sort
of what you exp--

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.870
I mean, when we pitched
this idea to you, did that--

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:35.390
[LAUGHS]

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.680
- He said, ah, no.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.380
- Did you have any idea?

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.430
- I had no idea.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:40.270
I had no idea that.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.150
But it's great.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.300
[LAUGHING]

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.520
- That's what they said
on the Titanic, too.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.160
[LAUGHING]

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.532
- OK, we'll come on over here.

00:38:53.532 --> 00:38:55.240
So tell me a little
bit about what you've

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:59.930
been doing to transform Robin.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:03.480
- So typically there are certain
features that is typically

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.440
a stereotype of masculine.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.820
So what I'm trying to do is
paint Robin's face in a way

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.230
that you are seeing
the furrowed--

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.730
men tend to have
that ridge and they

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.040
tend to have more of
a pronounced nose.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.720
So I'm trying to bring those
features forward using makeup.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.650
- Interesting.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.000
OK.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.740
And do you have a plan for
any facial hair for her?

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.200
- Yes, it's coming.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.737
- No, no, no.

00:39:30.737 --> 00:39:32.320
I know, I was just
going to see if you

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.460
wanted to talk about that.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.482
Because this is our check-in,
sort of what your plan is.

00:39:36.482 --> 00:39:38.250
[LAUGHING]

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.976
I was not saying
you're behind schedule.

00:39:40.976 --> 00:39:42.800
[LAUGHS]

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:49.290
- Yeah, so there will
be facial hair as well.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.910
I have to set the makeup first.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:54.030
Then actually, the
facial hair is just the--

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.100
I guess, the, you know,
topping on the cake.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.030
But essentially, the makeup
forms the foundation for you

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.510
to create those features first.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.420
So without those
features, facial hair

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.700
really doesn't do much in
terms of the transformation.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.030
So I need to set the face first.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.430
- And then we asked Robin
to do a little preparation

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:14.160
for the facial hair so you
could talk about what you did.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.840
- Oh, sure, well, I got a
haircut and saved the hair.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.990
[LAUGHING]

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:24.720
So I've got a Tupperware
right over there with my hair.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.240
And I had to chop
it up really fine,

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.350
which took a really long time.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:33.240
So that's where
it's coming from.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.620
- So then it will all match.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:43.200
OK, so basically, drag involves
many different types of gender

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.190
and physical transformation.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:50.040
And these can include binding,
tucking, packing, facial hair,

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.070
clothing, wigs, and so on.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:56.190
So while our amazing
professor volunteers

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.920
are getting their
final transformations,

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.710
we thought we would show you a
five-minute clip that gives you

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.960
a little insight into
what courage it took

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.180
for them to accept
being here and part

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.693
of tonight's performance.

00:41:09.693 --> 00:41:10.360
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.120
- I had seen Virginia West
perform before I knew Chris.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.210
And then when I saw Chris
and met Chris and talked,

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.190
and then I found out
he was Virginia West,

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.300
and then I saw Virginia again.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.130
And, I mean, it
just blew my mind.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:28.470
I still have never seen
him actually tape up

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:29.760
and everything like that.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.140
I've seen him take it off.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.268
But I've never seen him tape up.

00:41:33.268 --> 00:41:35.310
I don't know that I
necessarily want to see that.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:36.690
- I don't think anybody
should ever see that.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:38.340
- I think it seems
like, to me, that

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.630
just feels like mutilation.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.130
Like, that just
looks like it hurts.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:43.123
I'm not interested
in seeing that.

00:41:43.123 --> 00:41:44.790
I mean, there's many
times where I would

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.020
like to inflict that pain.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.570
But-- just kidding.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:48.910
Just kidding.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.772
There's gonna be so
much things that--

00:41:50.772 --> 00:41:51.480
- Well, I don't--

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.500
I think-- You said--

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.120
do you think I tape?

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.020
- I don't even know.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:55.950
I don't even know.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:56.370
- Because I don't.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:57.412
- I don't how it happens.

00:41:57.412 --> 00:42:02.080
- I don't actually, I know a
lot of drag queens will tape it,

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:02.580
but I don't.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.310
Because I wear pads,
hips pads, and I

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.890
wear so many pair of
tights that, you know,

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.040
I don't have to do that.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.470
But that would be pain--

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.220
I can understand why
that would be freaky.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.990
- Like, for me putting the
balls up inside of you,

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.993
does that not happen?

00:42:16.993 --> 00:42:18.660
So you have your ball
sack hanging down?

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.550
- Wow, we're getting
real-- real--

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.950
- Well, see, like,
this is obviously not

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.900
going to be a PG documentary.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.880
But, like, I mean, that
just seems like it hurts.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.290
- They naturally go in there.

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.090
- No, they don't on me.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.170
They don't on me.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.430
That hurts.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:36.510
That hurts.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.130
- I have a thing
with my partner.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.590
He doesn't love it.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.420
He appreciates that
he knows that that's

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.750
how he met me and he
knows that's what I do.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.250
But he said, "how long does it
take you to get out of that?"

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.480
I said, "about 10 minutes."

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.420
He goes, "can you
cut it to five?"

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:55.890
- When it comes to binding,
some people use an ACE bandage.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:58.290
- I tend to go
with the duct tape.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.570
Other people have
full outfits they

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.375
wear underneath their clothes.

00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:03.750
I don't know what
they're called.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.720
- Post-surgical-type
compression vests that really--

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.860
it's like a whole sort
of shirt that you wear.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.510
- ACE wrap is the worst thing
that's ever happened to drag,

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.090
even though it's like
a staple for drag.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.420
I mean, I use it too.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.590
But really, one, you
can't dance in it.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.660
You bend over, you do
any of these things,

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.860
and it's going to roll down.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.420
And you have to
duct tape your skin.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.130
And it's cinches
your ribs and it

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.560
can constricts every time
you breathe because it's

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.352
supposed to be compressing you.

00:43:32.352 --> 00:43:33.620
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.450
- OK, go easy there on my back.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.272
- OK, so we just
need to come around.

00:43:39.272 --> 00:43:41.730
Because what happened is--
like, this happens with me, too.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.063
It'll start pushing up too much.

00:43:43.063 --> 00:43:45.235
And then it looks
really weird and lumpy.

00:43:45.235 --> 00:43:45.860
- I don't know.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.562
We like that.

00:43:46.562 --> 00:43:48.020
- But we like a
little bit of lump.

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:48.530
- You're doing it a
little rough today.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:49.363
- Go ahead and spin.

00:43:49.363 --> 00:43:50.760
- I thought you liked rough?

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.590
- Man cakes.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.290
- Man cakes.

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.390
- Ready?

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.650
We're going to end it here.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.120
And then what we're going
to do is put a shirt on

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.315
to see how it looks.

00:44:04.315 --> 00:44:05.440
'Cause she's good at these.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.440
I don't like that on me.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.972
But she likes that.

00:44:07.972 --> 00:44:09.430
Tony Walnuts, he
likes that on him.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:10.930
- I'm sorry I have
the biggest pecs.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.765
- I don't know, you're
like a Jersey Shore guy.

00:44:14.765 --> 00:44:17.227
So we'll readjust it.

00:44:17.227 --> 00:44:18.310
Cause it's a little lumpy.

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.170
But when you put a
shirt on over the shirt.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:23.900
- Yeah, I think we
need a little bit here.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.410
- OK.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.910
- You know?

00:44:27.503 --> 00:44:28.670
It's going to get my armpit.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.680
It's fine.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.800
- All right.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.335
Many, many, many a night do
I cut this off of my skin.

00:44:37.335 --> 00:44:39.155
I've had like
scratches on my body.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.210
My back has literally
bled from the marks

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.170
from pulling this off.

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:46.730
- OK.

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:47.350
That's good.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:57.420
I can breathe, but not as
deeply as I used to be able to.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.310
- All right.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.290
- That's good.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:01.270
- Looks good.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.430
- Thanks, bud.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:05.538
- It's sort of like a tank top.

00:45:05.538 --> 00:45:07.330
And then it pulls all
the way down to here.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.630
And they also make ones that
are short that are just here.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:13.535
And then it just smooths
you and flattens you out.

00:45:13.535 --> 00:45:15.910
And when I had a bigger chest,
when I first transitioned,

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.520
I was like a D. I
absolutely refuse

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.423
to wear a tight binder
all day because--

00:45:21.423 --> 00:45:23.590
So this one is significantly
tighter and it makes me

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:25.456
like super flat.

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:28.930
Then you do the
classic binder hop.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.740
Any sane person isn't going
to wear this for very long.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.900
It's better than an ACE bandage.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.762
I mean, ACE bandage
is a nightmare.

00:45:40.762 --> 00:45:41.720
It cuts into your skin.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.620
- Do you know
where my socks are?

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.203
- The binders cut
into your skin, too.

00:45:44.203 --> 00:45:44.890
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.840
- But like, it's
just not as bad.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.200
And it distributes the
pressure so much better.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.570
So you know, if you're
just bound up here,

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:55.956
it, like, really
wrecks your lower back.

00:45:55.956 --> 00:45:57.820
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:07.760
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.917
- I'm taping the fat away.

00:46:09.917 --> 00:46:11.825
[LAUGHS]

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.460
- So how does that feel?

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.490
- Oh, painful.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:19.930
It's terrible.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:22.830
It's the worst part.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.390
Yeah.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.307
Yeah, no peeing for the
rest of the night now.

00:46:25.307 --> 00:46:26.034
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:26.034 --> 00:46:28.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:33.230
- So I think we need to get
just a little bit more time in.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.290
So we're going to go a little
bit off script here and ask

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.750
Ethan Balk to come
to the stage to talk

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:42.362
about something, an issue that
is interesting in the idea of--

00:46:42.362 --> 00:46:46.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.150
--of gender and sort of
going beyond words and that

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:51.610
isn't about tipping.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.230
One of the interesting
experiences

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.680
that we had in making
the film was one night

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.833
I was going to go film Ethan
performing in this big contest.

00:47:00.833 --> 00:47:02.750
That was Nina West, so
you think you can drag.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:03.550
- Oh, thanks.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:04.900
- Thank you.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.800
- And it was an interesting
moment as a documentarian

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.570
because I felt a need--

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:14.680
it was in a gay bar
and I felt a need

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.130
to tell Ethan about
something that I had observed

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:21.280
gender wise about the
way tipping was done

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.870
and was accepted.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:26.560
And so basically,
I went up to Ethan

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.980
and I said, hey, you know,
you're going into this gay bar.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.110
And one of the things that
a lot of the kings did

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:36.340
was taking the money and sort
of throwing it off to the side.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.000
And I said that's not the
way that men in that space

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.320
actually address money.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.360
And there is this moment
that's very shared.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.250
And part of it, it
seemed to me, had

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.510
to do with lesbians demanding
money of other lesbians coming

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:53.350
to see the show, which was a
different economic situation.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:58.570
And so the whole layers of
politics, economics, and gender

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.070
came into that.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:03.670
And I just wanted to have you
talk a little bit about that

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.560
and how then you were
able to incorporate that

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.935
into your performance in that
space, which was phenomenal

00:48:08.935 --> 00:48:10.165
and he won.

00:48:10.165 --> 00:48:11.560
[LAUGHING]

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.490
All because of that.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:18.100
[LAUGHS] No, so first of all,
when I did this competition,

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:22.150
this was years before
I decided to start

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.160
testosterone and transition.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:28.720
So it's great, you know,
it's fun to watch the film

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.680
and see myself.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:35.110
And I'm like, oh my god,
I look so tiny and young.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:38.080
So it was such great feedback.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.720
And it was something
that I had not thought of

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.520
and had been doing while
performing, you know, as a drag

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.770
king, as a drag queen in spaces
that were comfortable for drag

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:51.850
kings to perform.

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:57.420
Because really before I
had done this contest,

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.380
there wasn't a mix yet.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.230
There was drag kings
doing stuff over here

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:04.900
and drag queens doing
stuff over here.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.470
And this was Nina
West's first, you know?

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.690
She was like, I'm going to
do this drag competition.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:15.010
And I'm like, well,
I'm going to do it.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:15.638
So--

00:49:15.638 --> 00:49:16.930
- You were the first drag king.

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:17.680
- I was the first.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.800
Yeah, I was the only drag
king in the competition.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.535
And I was psychotic about it.

00:49:23.535 --> 00:49:28.180
You could ask my wife
about it, who's back there.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.630
And before, you know, I was
upstairs, I was practicing.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.600
Before I went on,
Gabrielle was like, listen,

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.190
I noticed that Chris and Andrew,
Virginia and Nina, when they

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.830
go to take a tip, they connect.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:43.330
They connect with
the person, right?

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:46.600
They look them in the eye
and there's this exchange.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.280
And it was like,
[IMITATES EXPLOSION] I

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.200
was like, oh my god.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.503
And so I did that.

00:49:52.503 --> 00:49:54.420
And that's probably the
reason I won, I guess.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.890
I don't know.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.670
- No, it's because
he was so good.

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:58.830
- No, but I did that.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.150
I did that, and it
changed the game for me.

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:05.380
And from then on, I don't
know why there's probably

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.920
a lot of gender structure into
why I did not feel comfortable

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.055
doing that, but at that
point, then I was like,

00:50:12.055 --> 00:50:13.930
oh my god, I had no idea
I wasn't doing that.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.510
And so then, you
know, from then on,

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:18.280
we just did it a different way.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.780
- I think to me
what I observed was

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.750
there was a socioeconomic
different reality

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.020
in these different spaces.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.370
So some people had a lot more
disposable income and cash

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:30.310
and higher incomes, and
other people who didn't.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:34.960
And so within the club where
the kings often performed,

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.390
that was not as high a
socioeconomic audience.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.900
And so the idea of
then expecting people

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.720
to give you money was sort
of a demand on the audience.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.570
Where it was appreciated,
but it wasn't--

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:47.230
- Emphasized.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:49.270
- It wasn't, you
know, put in that way.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:51.880
But then additionally, I
thought, and you can correct me

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.380
if I'm wrong in
this interpretation,

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:57.550
but the idea of how a
man would handle money,

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.380
being given it from
somebody, and being

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.790
strong in that expression, was
about, hey, I got this money,

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:05.265
but it's just, I
don't need this.

00:51:05.265 --> 00:51:06.640
I'm going to throw
it back there.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.560
Because it's just
like small change,

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.560
whereas in the other space
every dollar matters.

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.890
And that was sort of what I
call the stripper moment to you.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:17.110
You have to have that
connection of this is my money.

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:18.940
I'm buying something
from you for it.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.773
And when you're made
to feel like the center

00:51:20.773 --> 00:51:23.590
of the world in that space, it
had a different feeling, right.

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:24.070
- Yeah, and I'm sorry.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:25.200
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:25.680
- No, go ahead.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.320
- I'm learning.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.083
Because now I present
as a white guy, so now--

00:51:29.083 --> 00:51:33.250
[LAUGHING]

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.694
Let me just mansplain
this right now.

00:51:35.694 --> 00:51:39.566
[LAUGHING]

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:46.495
You know, it was almost, like,
when we would take the dollar,

00:51:46.495 --> 00:51:48.120
I bet there was
something where it was,

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.325
like, I don't know if
we really deserve this.

00:51:50.325 --> 00:51:51.700
Thank you so much
for doing this.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.540
This is so silly.

00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.730
And I don't think that
was the same way as how

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:01.250
males performing felt.
So it was a good--

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:03.990
- Yeah, and in this
one tiny detail,

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:05.580
it was something
that I felt you were

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.990
going into this other space
and was important to know.

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:09.720
So it was sort of this
interesting ethical moment

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.510
that we had talked about,
do I say something,

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.910
do I not say something.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:13.340
- As a documentarian, yeah,
you don't want to interfere.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.680
- Do I just observe it or
do I change the reality?

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.400
And so I felt it was
an important thing

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.192
to sort of build a
bridge between these two

00:52:19.192 --> 00:52:21.458
communities, which then
happened after that show,

00:52:21.458 --> 00:52:23.000
is that Ethan started
getting invited

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.190
into the shows in that
space, and so did Becky.

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:28.680
And then it became this
kings, queens thing.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.590
And now the that
space incorporates

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:36.960
gender queer performers and a
lot of, well, what would you--

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.400
I mean, some kings sometimes.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.990
And whenever you come
back, you're in the show.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.650
- Yeah, it's the whole spectrum.

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:41.280
- Yeah.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.490
- There's more kings now.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:45.180
There's kind of gender
queer, in-betweens.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.340
There's guys that are dancing.

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:51.260
There's girls that are dancing
and they identify cis gender.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.520
- Yeah.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.990
- Yeah, so something
about that spectacle, when

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:56.640
you have everyone
up there onstage,

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.830
that makes it even harder to
sort of define and quantify,

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:00.330
right?

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:03.440
And also even the
mixing up, like,

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.650
I have a colleague who performs
sometimes as a bearded queen.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:13.260
And so mixing up even
within your character

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.200
that you're taking
on, having it be

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.390
this sort of giving very,
very strong gender cues,

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:21.073
but of different genders.

00:53:21.073 --> 00:53:21.990
- So how are we doing?

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.370
- So let's see how we're doing.

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:24.370
- We'll have a check-in.

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:27.202
- Hey, you guys, how's
it going back there?

00:53:27.202 --> 00:53:30.464
- How's it going?

00:53:30.464 --> 00:53:33.144
OK, so why don't we
open for a question?

00:53:33.144 --> 00:53:34.356
[LAUGHING]

00:53:34.356 --> 00:53:36.916
- It's going well.

00:53:36.916 --> 00:53:39.832
This is how it goes back stage.

00:53:39.832 --> 00:53:41.050
You just never know.

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:41.950
- We've gone fast.

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:42.340
- That's right.

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:43.840
So we actually are
ahead of schedule,

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.798
according to our thing.

00:53:44.798 --> 00:53:47.950
So we can ask a
pre-question before the Q&amp;A,

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:52.670
if you want to, if anybody
has anything for now.

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:53.170
Please.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:57.322
Yes?

00:53:57.322 --> 00:53:59.025
- So what got you into drag?

00:53:59.025 --> 00:53:59.525
- Me?

00:53:59.525 --> 00:54:00.634
- Oh, good question.

00:54:00.634 --> 00:54:01.480
- Me?

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.865
Oh my gosh, that's so great.

00:54:03.865 --> 00:54:05.490
We were going to talk
about that later.

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:11.380
OK, so, god, it's this whole
evolutionary thing, right?

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:15.950
So it's, you know, when I
first started doing this,

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:17.950
I hadn't started
testosterone yet.

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:20.400
I was still OK, I
guess I'm a lesbian.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.160
And that's the two choices I
have, besides the other choice,

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:28.340
that was clearly
not working out.

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.050
So, you know, I've
always loved theater.

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:37.210
And it's always been
a part of my life.

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.730
I wish it would have been more.

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:43.900
It's been a part of my life
where it was like, I love this,

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:47.680
but I don't want to
be a girl on stage.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.220
So it's like, OK,
what am I going to do?

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.240
I don't know, I did
the backstage stuff.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.970
And then I did, kind of like
some roles where it was like,

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:59.360
OK, well, you're not the pretty
one, you know, or whatever.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.500
And, you know, that just
opens up so much conversation

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.930
around the only roles that
are available for women.

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:10.600
And how it's, you know, if
you look any sort of different

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:15.460
from the main role, you're maybe
the funny one or that's it.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.260
You know, you
don't get the part.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.280
So I love that.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.690
And you know, I kind
of started doing

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:26.200
some sort of sketch
comedy in a queer space.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.180
And one of my drag
queen friends needed

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:32.910
a sidekick that was a guy.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.140
And so I kind of
started doing that.

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.120
And then, you know, it
just sort of took off.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:44.800
And before I did, you know, the
whirlwind sort of competition

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.460
with Nina's competition,
I did this small kind

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.360
of drag king thing.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.050
And so that's where I met
Becky and Kristin, the Rev,

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:54.670
and Topher Wright.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:56:02.230
And it was this moment where I
got to be a creative director.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.570
And I got to be the guy role.

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:07.330
And I got to do all of
these different things.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:12.310
And, you know, if you would
have ask me 5,000 years ago when

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:16.310
I started doing drag, you
know, why did I do this?

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:18.460
Well, it's because I
got to do the guy thing.

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:23.890
But, you know, if you
fast forward 12, 15 years,

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.230
I got to learn so
much more about me.

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.180
And, you know, my wife
and I have two children.

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.940
And what am I going
to be for them?

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:39.310
And, you know, I think I
should start testosterone.

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.600
I think I should do this.

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:45.460
And it's such a hard question
that I get these days.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:46.810
You know, why do you do this?

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:50.080
And it's like originally,
I had this idea.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.480
But now it's because
I get to stand up here

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.150
and I get to talk to people
about how there is so much

00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:59.440
gray in the questions that
we expect to be answered

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.000
in black and white.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.550
And if I could just
show people that there

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:08.350
needs to be no boxes, right?

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:10.660
There needs to be no--

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.010
there's no yes or no.

00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:15.130
It's this gray kind of thing.

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:18.160
Then I feel, then that is
what kind of completes me now

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.490
as a performer.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:19.990
- Excellent.

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.250
- Great.

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:20.750
Woo-hoo!

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:25.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.900
- So, all right, I think
we're good on timing.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.150
So thank you all so
much for coming tonight.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:33.650
We're looking forward
to joining you

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:35.270
at the rest of this conference.

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:37.820
And we're going to close
this evening with a film clip

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.130
from Kings, Queens,
&amp; In-Betweens,

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:43.030
which you can get on
iTunes and Amazon,

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.210
that touches on how
drag as an art form

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:47.750
shakes up as our assumptions
and presumptions.

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:51.200
And, in doing so, it does help
us break down those barriers

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.950
that Ethan is talking about
to build new social groups

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:57.890
and towards building one
community of human beings

00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:59.400
all together.

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.690
So we'll then have, after
the clip, our closing

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:05.840
number from our wonderful
performers Anisa Love, Topher

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:08.990
Wright, Dr. Cool Ethan,
Jaden Jamison, Twinkerbell,

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:13.180
the Reverend Roy Rogers, and
our new special guest stars,

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:16.548
War and Peace and
Queen Shesahesa.

00:58:16.548 --> 00:58:21.306
[LAUGHING]

00:58:21.806 --> 00:58:22.770
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:25.030
- I think when people
mess with gender in public

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:27.880
and perform that, I
think that's always

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.860
empowering for people
in the audience

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.630
to see the possibilities.

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:37.045
- We, as a country, put so
much emphasis on who we should

00:58:37.045 --> 00:58:38.810
and who we shouldn't be around.

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:41.380
Why not just go out
and be able to meet

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.260
those people that you wouldn't
necessarily ever talk to?

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.240
You know, at work, you
know, where I would work,

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.200
you know, people never had an
experience with drag before.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.210
And now they come
constantly to the shows.

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:55.180
You know, so I think by
doing that, you open up

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:57.010
people's minds, you
know, to realize

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:58.716
that everybody is just human.

00:58:58.716 --> 00:59:00.174
- How many straight
people are here

00:59:00.174 --> 00:59:01.424
tonight, ladies and gentlemen?

00:59:01.424 --> 00:59:03.164
[CHEERING]

00:59:03.164 --> 00:59:05.052
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
to our straight

00:59:05.052 --> 00:59:07.390
friends for coming out and
supporting the gay community.

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:14.200
- The straight crowd has really
revitalized the art form.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.530
And being embraced
by straight people

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:19.760
has not only challenged
their viewpoints,

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.070
bit it's also challenged ours.

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:24.610
- For me, it's nice to look
out and see that there's not

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:27.280
a divide between the gay and
the straight, it's everybody's

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.270
mixing.

00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:30.400
And everybody's
there for two hours

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.410
really enjoying
themselves and not

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:34.135
caring that they're
in a gay bar.

00:59:34.135 --> 00:59:35.740
My straight friends, they
all come, they love it.

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:36.657
They have so much fun.

00:59:36.657 --> 00:59:39.340
And they're always like
shocked that, you know, wow,

00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:39.920
you look so--

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.587
I mean, I look 100%
different as a girl.

00:59:41.587 --> 00:59:43.090
Like, you would
not recognize me.

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:45.280
- I think it really breaks
down, little by little,

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.710
every bit of stereotyping
there is and every bit

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:51.520
of divide between the
two communities of being

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.520
gay and being straight.

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.910
And I think that's
what we should do.

00:59:54.910 --> 01:00:00.090
- OK, well, I don't approve
of gays, but I love you.

01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:01.840
You know, so that's
how it kind of starts.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.923
And then it's like, well,
I don't approve of gays,

01:00:03.923 --> 01:00:06.280
but I love you and I
love her, you know?

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.750
And then it just
kind of spreads.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:09.180
- You know, so I think
it's breaking down.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.638
- I think what
really helps is also

01:00:10.638 --> 01:00:14.160
they have a strong pour
at the bars, which--

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.410
- Yeah, some people get drunk.

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.830
But hey, listen--

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:16.620
- --it loosens it up.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.162
- I don't care how you lose your
inhibitions, just lose them.

01:00:19.162 --> 01:00:20.002
[END PLAYBACK]

01:00:20.002 --> 01:00:23.476
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.377
- I'm so tiny you
can't even see me now.

01:01:03.377 --> 01:01:04.810
[LAUGHING]

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:07.944
It's like a very dark shadow.

01:01:07.944 --> 01:01:10.160
[LAUGHING]

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.100
- Here, I don't
want that to break.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:16.180
You are amazing and I hope
that you win tomorrow.

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.380
- All right, Roger.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.183
- So Ethan, you mentioned
that through drag it

01:01:21.183 --> 01:01:22.600
helped find yourself
and it helped

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.200
you start transitioning more in
a deeper personal sense, as you

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.310
started doing a
gender transition.

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:31.870
Well, I wanted to
ask, do any of you

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:36.610
know anyone else that
drag has aided when they

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.170
weren't otherwise aware of how?

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:40.780
But, you know, has aided in
starting their transitioning?

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:45.850
- If you watch the movie,
the black transsexual Akasha,

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:48.220
I don't even know if she said
this in the movie or not.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:50.770
Before she ever thought
that there was transsexuals,

01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:52.817
because I was her
drag mother at first,

01:01:52.817 --> 01:01:54.400
she was just this
cute little boy that

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.840
would come to see me at shows.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:58.240
And she said there's
something about this that

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.075
is moving me in this direction.

01:02:00.075 --> 01:02:02.200
And literally, I was with
her when she went and got

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.490
her first job done,
her booby job.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:12.350
- I would say there's a lot of--

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:17.410
I watched drag kings go
through this as well, you know?

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:19.640
You know, this is
like a 10-year period.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.160
So I got into it.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.210
I met guys that had
already transitioned.

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:29.350
I met women that were thinking
about it and then transitioned.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:39.190
And so I think this is a
very raw environment where

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:42.400
you get to see what's
going on outside of you

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.880
and then decide I don't know,
I think that might be me.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.830
And, you know,
you get to realize

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:50.600
all of the reasons
that maybe led

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:56.210
you to do this in the first
place, for some people, right?

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:59.810
- I've been fortunate to
compete in the pageant systems.

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:01.180
And, I know--

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.930
- Talk a little bit
about that, like, what

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:04.430
is the pageant system?

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:09.020
- A drag pageant is
like drag on steroids.

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.850
We, like, you know--

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:11.490
- Or estrogen.

01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:14.570
- Or, like, we fight with
rhinestones and glitter.

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:15.740
That's what we do.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.620
So it's like a system
where you compete

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:21.770
in different categories,
evening wear, talent,

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:24.380
on-stage question, interviews.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:25.760
This is on a judging scale.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.090
So, I mean, it's your
resources and time and money

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:30.840
that goes into it.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.715
It's a serious thing.

01:03:31.715 --> 01:03:34.670
It's like sports for drag.

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:38.600
So I've been fortunate that
I've met a lot of drag kings

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.840
who have competed at that level
who have since transitioned.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.120
And I think it's a safe
environment for them

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.530
for them to do so.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.615
And it's that period
of which, you know,

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:49.542
it's something they
can try on and decide

01:03:49.542 --> 01:03:51.500
whether at the end of
the night, it's something

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.790
they want to keep continuing.

01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:55.450
Or, you know, like, when
I leave here, you know,

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:58.283
I take my boobs out
and I'm perfectly fine.

01:03:58.283 --> 01:04:00.200
But for others, it's one
of those things where

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.080
they're like, oh, maybe I want
to keep my boobs taped up.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.510
And so that's when that
starts that journey for them.

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:10.460
And it's a very supportive
environment for them to do so.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.480
Does that make sense?

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.230
- Thanks for that.

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:13.318
- Yeah, thank you.

01:04:13.318 --> 01:04:15.860
- If I could add onto that, I
think it's an interesting issue

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:20.700
to talk about the idea of
transitioning that, you

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:22.200
know, what is that definition?

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.120
What does that mean?

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.570
And do you have to go from
one binary to another?

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:29.390
Or does drag just open
up a space for you

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.320
to find who you are?

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.970
And I think that
that's something

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:37.670
that is powerful about
it to think about.

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:41.710
- And if you didn't already
know by the last names,

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:45.430
Ethan and I are
husband and wife.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:53.590
So to expand on that, Ethan had
top surgery about 10 years ago.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:54.670
- Years before.

01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:58.600
- So, you know, when we talk
to our parents' generation

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.720
and talk about my
mom said, oh, should

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.310
we start using male pronouns?

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:06.790
And I said no, you
know, at that time,

01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:09.520
Ethan was Liz using
female pronouns.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.430
And I said, she just doesn't,
you know, identify with them.

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:15.580
And so she just, you know,
wants to get rid of those.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:18.810
But we're not, you know, we're
not talking about testosterone.

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:19.810
- Just get rid of those.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.630
- Yeah.

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:21.675
[LAUGHING]

01:05:21.675 --> 01:05:22.625
- [IMITATES SLASHING]

01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.050
[LAUGHING]

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:24.970
- Come on, cuteness.

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:26.012
I'm looking right at you.

01:05:26.012 --> 01:05:27.293
- All right, thank you.

01:05:27.293 --> 01:05:28.210
Thanks for being here.

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.883
I really enjoyed myself.

01:05:29.883 --> 01:05:31.050
I have a financial question.

01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:33.880
What's the cost of
entry, costumes, makeup?

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.430
And does that become
a barrier to--

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:39.430
- Millions of dollars.

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.210
- Does that become a barrier
to who can access drag?

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:44.470
- That's a great question.

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:47.590
- I will start.

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:50.140
I will say that things have
changed since I started.

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:53.820
This is my 19th
year of doing drag.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:56.680
Whatever, catch me at 20.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.230
Catch me at 20.

01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:02.740
Sometimes, because I look at
it, it's a business for me.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.500
I love the art of everything.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.950
However, there is an investment
that I've made in the money.

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:10.188
And I have a book.

01:06:10.188 --> 01:06:11.230
And I'm still old school.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.570
So I have a book,
an actual book.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.360
So I know from every
show I've done,

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.330
the amount of money I've put
in and the amount of money

01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:22.480
I have received, and
that will counteract.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.410
Now, I'll be honest, this dress
that is excessively too short

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:31.510
that I never tried on was $200.

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:34.510
And clearly I'm going
to find another time

01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.502
to use this dress with
a big Harvard H on it.

01:06:37.502 --> 01:06:41.200
But you have to think
about the cost of makeup.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.680
You think about duct taping,
binding, transportation,

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.030
all of that goes in.

01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:48.500
But I have turned it into--

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.400
I'm an individual
sole proprietor.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:56.320
So I am a whiz at tax deduction.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.250
Trust me.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.500
And obviously, Virginia was
the one that got me there.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.917
Because I was just spending
thousands of dollars

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:04.000
and knowing in my mind it
was coming back in cash.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.360
But I had nothing to show for
it but more glittery things.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.950
I bought a home with drag.

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:10.590
I paid off my college
loans with drag.

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.280
I'm trying to buy a
new car with drag.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.140
And this is now a
part-time job for me.

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.510
So I have other income.

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:18.130
But it's my love.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:20.645
Because I get to meet you.

01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:22.270
And so at the end of
the day, the money

01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:25.430
doesn't outweigh the
joy that I get to have,

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:28.060
regardless of the intake,
do you know what I mean?

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.430
So I still get this
beautiful connection

01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:32.350
with each and every
one of you because we

01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:33.490
have this moment tonight.

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:35.590
And it would never
be captured again,

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.835
where I'll make some
more dollars another day.

01:07:37.835 --> 01:07:38.710
You know what I mean?

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:40.480
So money will come
and go, but this stuff

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.670
is the best part
about all of it.

01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:44.540
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.440
- To answer that
question, I mean,

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.940
yes drag is an investment.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.160
But you slowly
build your tool box.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:51.910
That's what it is.

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:53.080
You don't drop a whole--

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.910
because no one gets into drag
thinking I'm going to get rich.

01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:58.410
No.

01:07:58.410 --> 01:07:59.470
No.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:01.957
So you slowly learn to
build your tool box.

01:08:01.957 --> 01:08:04.290
Like, I didn't go out and buy
the most expensive makeup.

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:06.940
You know, I started
off with CVS makeup.

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.720
And then I cut
corners where I could.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:09.220
- Goodwill.

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.070
- Honestly, like, Goodwill
is the best way to do it.

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:12.940
- Goodwill.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:15.730
You know, if you learn how
to tailor your own clothes.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.319
I'm the size of a
10-year-old boy.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.810
And, you know, like,
I learned how to sew.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:25.330
And you know, I only
need one yard of fabric.

01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:28.654
So that costs $5, you know?

01:08:28.654 --> 01:08:30.029
And everyone thinks
I'm a wizard.

01:08:30.029 --> 01:08:31.703
I'm like, no, it
only cost me $5.

01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:35.180
- We share a lot.

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.707
You know, like, we share
costumes, share facial hair.

01:08:38.707 --> 01:08:41.290
I mean, a little bit of Becky's
facial hair tonight, you know,

01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:42.350
is mine.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:47.290
So like if you're fortunate
enough to start doing drag

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:50.870
where you become friends with
the folks you're doing it,

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:51.939
you get to know them.

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:53.833
I mean, the resources
in the community

01:08:53.833 --> 01:08:55.750
and with, you know,
YouTube and all the things

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.729
that the kids are
doing today online,

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:59.319
there's just so many resources
I feel like out there

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.390
that have helped, at
least in the past 15 years

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:03.569
since I've been doing drag.

01:09:03.569 --> 01:09:07.750
- And another thing is if
you are fortunate enough

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:11.260
to receive enough visibility,
you end up with sponsorships.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.600
I'm actually sponsored
by TransTape,

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.370
who buys all the tape I need.

01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:17.560
Anytime I need tape,
they provide it for me.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.926
So I'm starting to get people
who want me to, you know,

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:24.640
use their products.

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.069
- I think that drag is also
a mentorship community.

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:34.420
And so there is a culture of
perpetuating, bringing people

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.740
up through the
education process, the,

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:42.399
you know, people all have
a drag mom, drag dad.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:45.370
People all have drag babies.

01:09:45.370 --> 01:09:46.960
You know, it's a true family.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.830
And the tradition of kind of
that culture of bringing people

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:54.400
up, and so you kind
of learn those tricks

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.080
as you're coming up with
the help of your elders.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.860
- Yeah.

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:01.690
- Hi, my name is Amanda.

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:02.920
I use they/them pronouns.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.900
And I'm very comfortable
saying that because I

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.680
think I was very
fortunate to be exposed

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.320
to that when I was quite young.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.820
My question is for
the entire panel,

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:13.510
but I think specifically
perhaps for parents,

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:15.370
what do you hope that
these types of movies

01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:17.787
will do for the next generation
of young folk being raised

01:10:17.787 --> 01:10:19.720
as if this is their norm?

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.730
- Oh, I can start that question.

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:24.590
Because one of
the reasons that--

01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:27.160
I think I'm wired, actually--

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.470
one of the reasons
that I made the film,

01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:30.970
and when I pitched
it to my sisters,

01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:35.320
was that I went to
a drag show which

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.980
the couple that was in the clips
that you saw when they were

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.855
talking about, "I don't
know if you tape it,"

01:10:40.855 --> 01:10:42.730
and they were having
that whole conversation.

01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:43.540
- The balls.

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.690
- Yeah,

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:46.780
- That's my best friend.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:51.940
- Yeah, the bald guy is
my close friend, Seth.

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.860
And I had known him
in a writing group.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.700
And then he invited me, he said
do you want to come to a show

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.020
that my husband's in?

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:02.290
And I said, oh, sure, you know,
be supportive of your husband.

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:04.540
And then it was this
enormous drag show.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.120
And his husband is one of
the top queens in Columbus.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.380
And so it was just an incredible
variation of performance

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:14.740
and exciting and
splendid and spectacular.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:20.350
And yet also I had toddler
children, a son and a daughter.

01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:25.780
And in technicolor up on stage
was being played out the issues

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:29.440
that I was thinking about every
day of how they were being

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.920
immediately gendered into
these binary camps and given

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.100
expectations and
toys and, you know,

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:40.000
from being hairless
babies in a yellow onesie

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.680
and how people would
have their expectations

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.490
they put on them with
whatever biological sex

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:46.750
they thought they were.

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:50.750
And so I went home and called
up my sisters and said,

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.700
could we make this documentary?

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.020
And I think it'd be
really a great window

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.020
into talking about this.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.730
And the impact I
was hoping to have

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:01.270
was to actually talk about
this to open up possibilities

01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:05.170
for parents and children and
people to sort of self-define.

01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:08.200
And I said it would take
us six months or something.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.340
And then it took 25 years.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.910
- Hi, my name is Priscilla.

01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:18.280
Welcome to Harvard.

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.950
I'm delighted that you guys
are here, all of you are here.

01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:28.080
My question is about health
care, access to medical care.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.950
And there's so much in the
news about these backroom

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:36.540
operations, going into a
hospital, not being accepted,

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.665
either you or your partner.

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.210
Has that changed?

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:46.550
What's happening in
that whole realm?

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:49.590
- So I'll just talk
about that for a second.

01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:51.570
My wife and I have
been married for--

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.456
- Uh-oh.

01:12:55.456 --> 01:12:56.210
- 25 years.

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.622
- That's so typical.

01:12:58.622 --> 01:12:59.830
We've been married for years.

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.500
We were living in Ohio when
we had Lyla, our daughter.

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:13.480
And I'm not on her
birth certificate.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:16.810
So I was fortunate
enough, we had our baby

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:21.070
at Ohio State, which is a
very inclusive environment.

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:24.670
So I was fortunate
enough to be there.

01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:26.980
This was before I had
started testosterone.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:31.185
So Mara and I were two
moms having a baby.

01:13:31.185 --> 01:13:34.000
And they were very sweet.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.700
And, you know, Mara took
on a lot of this herself

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:40.270
because she knew how
upset I was about it.

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:44.200
But I wasn't involved
in the conversation when

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.860
the social worker comes
into the delivery room

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.480
to sign the birth certificate.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.050
And I'm still not on the
birth certificate for Lyla.

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:55.630
So that was difficult, you know?

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:56.830
That was very hard.

01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:03.010
And the opposite
of that was really

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:08.080
upsetting to me when I had
started this transition.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.230
And for our second child,
Amos, who we call Tuggy.

01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:16.570
When Tuggy was born,
it wasn't a question

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:20.620
because I was just
presenting as something else.

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.510
And it wasn't a conversation.

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:27.620
And it was upsetting
to me because I

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.690
had gone through that
whole thing before.

01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:32.000
And now there was
just this assumption

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.430
that, sure, you're involved.

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:38.640
And, you know, you're
obviously the dad.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.310
And, you know, you
can be on this now

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.730
because it's OK because
you're presenting one way.

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:49.020
So it was very tough for myself.

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.818
But I have to
credit my wife, who

01:14:50.818 --> 01:14:52.110
I've been married to for years.

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:54.786
[LAUGHING]

01:14:54.786 --> 01:14:59.370
- The difference was also
that, first of all, when--

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:00.360
Lyla is 4 and 1/2.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.140
So she was born before
DOMA was passed.

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:09.630
And so that passage
provided a whole slew

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.760
of rights for our
friends in Columbus.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.215
And then we moved to
Connecticut two years ago.

01:15:15.215 --> 01:15:18.300
And there was a conversation
with our son's birth.

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.430
And because the birth
certificate asks,

01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:24.790
do you know the child's
biological father?

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:26.360
And we had a long conversation.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.520
We went back and forth.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.040
The social worker made a bunch
of different phone calls.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.310
And then she finally was
just like, yes, yes, yes

01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:34.570
is the answer.

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:40.250
Because whether or not Ethan was
presenting as male or female,

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:43.220
we didn't have his sperm.

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:43.720
It wasn't--

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.959
- There isn't any.

01:15:44.959 --> 01:15:47.893
[LAUGHING]

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.910
- So really quick, because
you mentioned the back-door

01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:52.820
operations.

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:53.320
- Yes.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.470
- And I'll just speak.

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:57.420
And look at that, I'm the
black person on the panel, too.

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.945
I've had many sisters pass
away because of the surgeries.

01:16:00.945 --> 01:16:02.320
That's something
that needs to be

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.670
regulated, especially within
the south, which is very odd.

01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:08.500
But, like, within
south Florida there

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:12.340
was just a transsexual
woman arrested because she

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.480
was doing injections.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.080
And those illegal injections
caused multiple deaths,

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.480
two of which were
my personal friends.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.390
Well, one of them, I'm wearing
her earrings right now.

01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:23.740
Taneesha, she was amazing.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:30.560
So it's hard when you're already
an entertainer by yourself

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.120
to get health care.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.760
That's something
that you're going

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.510
to have to spend money
on COBRA and you're

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:37.430
spending all this extra money.

01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:42.800
So, for example, the nightclub
I worked in years ago, actually

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.320
right around the same time
the movie was being filmed,

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:49.700
I severed one of my toes,
a tendon in my big toe.

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:52.017
And I had to pay for
that out of pocket

01:16:52.017 --> 01:16:53.600
because I didn't
have a full-time job.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.980
Because at that
point I was still

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:57.710
running around auditioning as
a singer and doing all this.

01:16:57.710 --> 01:17:00.650
So years of me trying
to pay for this surgery

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:03.320
that the company I worked
for wouldn't cover.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.320
Cut to now, and I'm
in a different life.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.700
And now I'm using Anisa
as a source of income plus

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:15.530
my full-time job offers
me, all-inclusive me--

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:17.750
I could be on the stage
and break something

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.300
and my health insurance
from my full-time job

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.950
will cover it regardless.

01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:24.560
So it's really with
time and acceptance.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.130
However, we need to legislate
all of the legalities.

01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:31.120
Because no matter
what we find, there's

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.620
always going to be someone else
who wants to try it cheaper.

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.900
And sometimes cheaper
is not better.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.960
And I am a budget bitch.

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:41.170
I am the first
person that will see

01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:42.770
through a way out of something.

01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:44.540
But it's not my health.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.040
Lord knows, it
won't be my health.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:46.707
What's going on?

01:17:46.707 --> 01:17:47.540
- Oh, you know what?

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.190
Let me add really
quick one thing.

01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:52.070
The movie is being used with
medical conferences now,

01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:53.538
actually, as an education tool.

01:17:53.538 --> 01:17:54.830
So that's been really exciting.

01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:59.270
Because it's been proven
effective as a way to,

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:02.300
not necessarily for just
trans people, but the idea

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.480
of doing gender performance or
presenting in a different way

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.920
and what could be a way
to educate caretakers

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.340
on different modes that people
might be dressing or presenting

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:15.350
themselves and the health
implications of that.

01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:19.216
And so that's been an
exciting part of progress.

01:18:19.216 --> 01:18:21.140
- OK, thanks again
for being here.

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.640
My question is about
the mixing that

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.800
was mentioned with the
Nina West competition

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.790
where you have a traditional
drag queen space now filled

01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:31.820
with performers and a
broader gender spectrum.

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:35.450
Have you found that that's
promoted a deeper understanding

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:36.560
of intersectionality?

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.660
And is it translating
into coalition building

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.910
and other aspects
of the community?

01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:43.340
And I'm particularly curious
about the straight audiences

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:46.340
that are coming, maybe for a
spectacle and a stiff drink.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:49.130
Are they turning around
and then supporting you

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:51.760
at the community health center
fund raiser and the ballot box

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.718
and that sort of thing?

01:18:52.718 --> 01:18:54.767
- I can say, and I'll
speak just for quick,

01:18:54.767 --> 01:18:55.850
I'll make it really quick.

01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:57.142
Nina is one of my best friends.

01:18:57.142 --> 01:18:59.650
To be fair, we started doing
drag the exact same day,

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:00.860
exact same place.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:04.550
And I just took another
name, she took West.

01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:07.130
It has been amazing
over the past 20 years

01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:10.850
to watch the crowds
go from all gay men,

01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:13.370
and then, right
around the late '90s,

01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:14.970
like, I would say
early 2000s, there

01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:16.850
was this amazing
group of lesbians

01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:18.280
that started showing up.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.840
Then they started--

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.330
Then they started telling
their straight friends.

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:25.438
And my mother was
at every show I

01:19:25.438 --> 01:19:27.230
did when I first started
because she wanted

01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:29.110
to make sure my hair was right.

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.900
Trust me.

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:34.550
So now we have these amazing
partners across the globe

01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:37.670
and across the spectrum that
are they are cheering us on,

01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:39.080
giving their money.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:43.010
And they're using their voice
to help us raise awareness

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:46.190
and funds for health care.

01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:50.920
In Columbus it's Equitas who
does every part of any health

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.737
care a person needs,
from Planned Parenthood

01:19:53.737 --> 01:19:54.320
to everything.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.237
And in Columbus, we've
raised over $2 million.

01:19:56.237 --> 01:19:58.580
And we would never have
been able to do that

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.130
without straight people coming
to every one of our shows

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.480
and giving their money.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.730
Last week we raised $7,000
and it was 15 minutes.

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:11.060
$7,000 and 15 minutes
on a Sunday show.

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.640
And all of that money went
to the Mosaic Project,

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:17.450
which is a form of Equitas
Health, which that money will

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:21.620
be moved towards transgender,
non-binary, people of color,

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:23.665
of youth.

01:20:23.665 --> 01:20:25.380
And that's the only
program like that.

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.830
And then the other
half will go it's going

01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:30.700
to the Ronald McDonald House.

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:33.650
And I'm fortunate to
live in Columbus still,

01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:36.560
to where we can make
all of this money

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.820
and still help our community.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:40.010
So at the end of the night, I
can put my head on the pillow

01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:42.160
and know that we've done
something wonderful. .

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.700
And that would never happen
without straight people.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.030
- So, yeah, we have
time for a couple more.

01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:49.518
So we should--

01:20:49.518 --> 01:20:50.560
- Hi, my name is Patrick.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.640
Thank you all so much
for being here tonight.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.640
My question mainly goes to
the producers of the film,

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.530
but this can be addressed
from everyone on the panel.

01:20:58.530 --> 01:21:00.110
But I'm thinking
specifically that it

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:02.870
is 2019, which will mark 50
years since the Stonewall

01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:03.860
Uprising.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:07.190
And I think it's important
that we honor our trans

01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:09.885
and queer women of
color who really

01:21:09.885 --> 01:21:11.010
launched that fight for us.

01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:11.480
- Mother Marsha.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.320
- And so I think it's--

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.820
Marsha, Mother
Marsha, that's right,

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:15.590
and Sylvia and Miss Major.

01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:17.570
But I also am
wondering, too, with

01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:19.100
this particular
documentary, which

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:23.450
I think the clips that we've
seen have been wonderful.

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:27.030
And I noticed that a couple of
times in the film that Paris

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:31.305
is Burning was mentioned, which
largely featured folks of color

01:21:31.305 --> 01:21:33.180
in the ballroom scene,
things of that nature.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:36.800
So I'm wondering, as we
think about drag today,

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.030
how are we continuing to
honor those initial authors

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:43.723
of that culture in a way that
can still kind of center them

01:21:43.723 --> 01:21:45.890
and sort of honor them
today, especially as we think

01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:48.430
about how far we've
come as a movement

01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:49.895
as we continue to
honor our trans

01:21:49.895 --> 01:21:53.270
and queer folks of
color ancestors.

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:54.800
- Really quick, only because--

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.200
That's, A, point on.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.680
In Columbus, we're
still in Ohio,

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:03.410
so you have to really
understand that there are not

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:06.200
very many African-American
people of color that

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.130
are performers.

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:09.830
And I'm not saying
the level where I am.

01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:12.890
I am one of the most
visible people of color

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:17.020
you will see in the state
of Ohio only because I'm old

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.110
and I'm very outspoken.

01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:24.350
So when the movie was filmed,
since this has launched,

01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:28.850
there has been this resurgence
of all of these amazing queer

01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:33.650
people of color that are walking
and giving life and living just

01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:36.200
like I did when I first
saw Paris is Burning

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.230
and I was definitely a teenager.

01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:41.120
So now, like, we had a ball.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.060
We had a ball.

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.895
And we brought in--

01:22:43.895 --> 01:22:45.770
Jesus, there were like
four different houses.

01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:48.740
And to be fair, my drag
mother is a Balenciaga,

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:51.260
if you know anything, Raquel
Lord, Balenciaga, from Atlanta,

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.250
is my drag mother.

01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:55.110
So we had this amazing
ball at Axis Nightclub,

01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:57.710
which 10 years ago, would
have never happened.

01:22:57.710 --> 01:23:00.110
Because if you weren't
at tweaky white kid,

01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:02.310
you would not have
been accepted.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.730
And then I turned the corner
and walked into my home

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:08.500
and saw all these beautiful
shades of brown, yellows,

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:11.990
white, and it took me
back and it made me cry.

01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:15.170
Because the work that we're
all doing is making this

01:23:15.170 --> 01:23:18.590
happen on an everyday basis
in every one of our towns.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:19.670
So it's happening.

01:23:19.670 --> 01:23:21.650
It may not happen as
fast as you want it to.

01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:23.100
But bitch, it's happening.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.940
- Yeah, I wanted
to add one thing.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:25.440
- Can I--

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:25.765
- Yeah.

01:23:25.765 --> 01:23:26.265
- Can I--

01:23:26.265 --> 01:23:27.565
- Oh, yeah.

01:23:27.565 --> 01:23:30.870
- I do recognize,
as a POC performer,

01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:33.140
I think, it's especially
among drag kings,

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.800
I think I can count seven
Asians in the United States drag

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.670
kings.

01:23:37.670 --> 01:23:40.220
And I understand like, a
little bit about my background,

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.940
I'm from a [INAUDIBLE] family.

01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.750
You know, grew up with that
cultural, you know, stressors

01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:47.370
that I had to be
feminine, passive.

01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:52.610
And so I do this because I
want to be visible for others.

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:55.200
And I take that seriously.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.170
And so this is
why I go out there

01:23:57.170 --> 01:24:01.610
and do these educational
things because they're my jam.

01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:04.585
Just So that others can see
me and they can feel welcome

01:24:04.585 --> 01:24:05.210
into the scene.

01:24:05.210 --> 01:24:08.180
Because sometimes it can
be especially as a king,

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:11.420
it can be somewhat intimidating.

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:15.860
And especially these are
spaces, you know, ran by men.

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:19.100
You know, so as a drag
king, it's even more,

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:22.310
I bear a greater responsibility
being a role model out there,

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:24.096
just being visible.

01:24:24.096 --> 01:24:27.000
- We see you!

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.880
- So in producing
the film, one thing

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.740
that was really
important to us was not

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.945
having mediators,
sort of talking heads.

01:24:32.945 --> 01:24:35.070
Or there was one idea that
people came in and said,

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.350
well, why don't you
sort of say, what

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:38.970
was your experience, Gabrielle,
coming into this community

01:24:38.970 --> 01:24:40.340
and what you learned.

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:44.433
It was really important to have
people speak for themselves

01:24:44.433 --> 01:24:46.850
and have their experiences and
show how complex they were,

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:49.050
that there was one part of
the structure of editing

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:51.770
which is that one person will
say a definitive statement,

01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:54.140
and then often there's
other people sort

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:55.760
of saying different
things, and so

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.835
showing all the way
through the film

01:24:58.835 --> 01:24:59.960
that there are many voices.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:06.380
And it was important
to us to represent

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.570
the range of people
who are performing

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.800
and have them speak
in their own voices.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.460
And I think that that's part of
the educational mission is also

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.710
then having these conversations
so that people can see

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:20.690
themselves on screen and
also then maybe continue

01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:23.450
to learn about the history from
seeing what's happening now

01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:24.430
and how it's changing.

01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:25.730
- Yeah, and we stand
on the shoulders

01:25:25.730 --> 01:25:28.313
of all those activists who have
come before us and everything.

01:25:28.313 --> 01:25:31.190
And the history
that Radcliffe is

01:25:31.190 --> 01:25:34.640
about preserving and
exploring and all

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.925
of these realms of
intersectional being.

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:42.080
And I think that the
kings and queens and trans

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.150
and other gender
performers in Columbus

01:25:44.150 --> 01:25:47.450
often actually
mention that at shows.

01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:50.390
And we certainly feel that us
five sisters in filmmaking,

01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:52.473
that we stand on the
shoulders of the women who've

01:25:52.473 --> 01:25:53.270
come before us.

01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:55.338
And hopefully, we'll be
lifting up other people

01:25:55.338 --> 01:25:56.630
in the future on our shoulders.

01:25:56.630 --> 01:25:59.060
- Where can we see the movie?

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.820
- Oh, you can see the
movie on iTunes or Amazon.

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:02.680
So, yeah.

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:08.860
- I'm going to try to move this
without breaking everything.

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.960
OK.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.640
Hi, I'm Jack.

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:17.410
My question was that as a trans
masked person who has also

01:26:17.410 --> 01:26:21.270
really always been interested
in drag and like drag king

01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:23.620
performances, like
all that good stuff,

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:27.700
I find myself like caught in
this other, like, bogus binary

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:31.060
of authenticity
and artifice, which

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.830
I think becomes coded, right?

01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:36.580
Because like sexism as
masculine and feminine,

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:38.710
like masculine as
authentic, feminine

01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:40.150
as artificial and fabricated--

01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:44.800
And like, I love drag because it
then takes it and is just like,

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.050
well, everything is authentic
and nothing is authentic

01:26:47.050 --> 01:26:49.630
and everything is
artifice and nothing is.

01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:51.680
So it's this awesome
like post-modern thing.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.980
But how do you engage
and hold, like,

01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:01.870
that performativity and
artifice as like an extension

01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:04.780
or a [INAUDIBLE] of the
idea of authenticity

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:08.420
when it's like on your
body or in a community.

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:12.490
So the person who was talking
about the gate-keeping that

01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:14.500
happens in the trans
community sometimes around

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.440
like, oh, you're ruining
it for the rest of us.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:22.000
When so much of our lives
is dependent on, like,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.970
living our most authentic self,
right, that's the branding,

01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:28.370
how do we then love
artifice and love drag?

01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:29.470
- Oh, interesting.

01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:30.640
That's a great question.

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.770
- Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:33.790
- I could--

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:34.680
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.110
- I was just going
to say, I mean,

01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:40.045
for me, I feel kind
of most in myself,

01:27:40.045 --> 01:27:42.970
I feel some of the most
authentic in those moments.

01:27:42.970 --> 01:27:46.270
I feel some of the most
authentic when I can step up.

01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:49.220
You know, when, I was younger,
I literally had no friends.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.530
I spent years of my
life eating lunch alone.

01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:57.310
And in this family, being
able to step into these roles,

01:27:57.310 --> 01:28:00.400
I'm able to practice, you
know, radical inclusivity

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.650
by seeing people
and by really trying

01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:04.287
to like connect with everyone.

01:28:04.287 --> 01:28:06.620
Tonight when I was in the
audience giving hugs to people

01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:09.805
is because I, just like what
we were talking about earlier,

01:28:09.805 --> 01:28:11.680
it's those connections
that are so important.

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.710
So to me, I think take a
deep breath, step into it.

01:28:14.710 --> 01:28:19.300
And there is no greater time,
when I am at my full true self,

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:23.170
when I'm standing up blasting
in this costume I feel like it's

01:28:23.170 --> 01:28:25.740
me turned up to full blast.

01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:26.620
- To 11.

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:27.980
- To 11.

01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.970
[LAUGHING]

01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:32.770
- Robin and Hisa,
do you want to talk

01:28:32.770 --> 01:28:37.210
a little bit about the artifice,
now that you're in artifice.

01:28:37.210 --> 01:28:38.840
I mean, what would
you say to that.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:42.169
I think that's an interesting
question to throw to you.

01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:43.558
- [CLEARS THROAT]

01:28:43.558 --> 01:28:45.410
[LAUGHING]

01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:47.720
I think one of the things
that strikes me is really

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.850
the importance of mirrors.

01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:51.882
Because I actually, I
mean, I had the experience

01:28:51.882 --> 01:28:53.340
of being dressed
up, but I actually

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:58.010
have no idea what it looks like.

01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:59.510
- We purposely kept
the mirror away.

01:28:59.510 --> 01:29:00.200
- Should we bring the mirror?

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.533
Should we bring the mirror over?

01:29:01.533 --> 01:29:03.036
- Would you like to see?

01:29:03.036 --> 01:29:03.536
Here.

01:29:03.536 --> 01:29:05.780
- Yeah, like legit has no clue.

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.675
Got dressed in the
dark, has no idea.

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:08.830
- What about you, Robin?

01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:09.788
Have you seen yourself?

01:29:09.788 --> 01:29:11.260
- I would like to see myself.

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:11.470
- Wow.

01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:11.970
- Right?

01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:14.234
- [LAUGHS]

01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:19.950
- Hey, girl.

01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:22.425
[LAUGHING]

01:29:22.425 --> 01:29:25.650
- He looks so
amazing, [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:25.650 --> 01:29:27.505
- I like the artifice.

01:29:27.505 --> 01:29:28.495
[LAUGHING]

01:29:28.495 --> 01:29:29.272
- What did he say?

01:29:29.272 --> 01:29:29.980
- You're welcome.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:33.800
- And so--

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800
- Well, how do you feel?

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.333
- Yeah, what is it--

01:29:37.333 --> 01:29:38.750
- As I mentioned
at the beginning,

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:40.850
I think I really
do feel that I'm

01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:44.785
exploring another possibility
of myself, a better possibility

01:29:44.785 --> 01:29:46.570
maybe.

01:29:46.570 --> 01:29:49.640
- I feel very hot.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:52.120
- What do you think, Robin?

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.780
- I'm wearing my own clothes.

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:54.720
These are my clothes.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:57.920
So I actually feel
kind of ordinary.

01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:59.180
I love wearing a tux.

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:01.430
I'll wear a tux
any excuse I get.

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:04.670
So this is very limited
artifice for me.

01:30:04.670 --> 01:30:06.770
The face is very new.

01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:10.910
But what I can see, like,
I can't see my own face.

01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:12.980
So what I can see and
what I can experience

01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:19.100
is actually a delight and
not totally unknown to me.

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:19.640
So.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.890
It doesn't feel like artifice.

01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:22.900
It feels like me.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:25.250
But I want to take
this moment to just say

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:30.470
thank you so much to this
troupe and to the producers

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:32.000
and to Gwen in
particular for doing

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.382
my makeup, which is amazing.

01:30:34.382 --> 01:30:35.840
So I just want to
say thank you for

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.030
this extraordinary experience.

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:39.200
Thank you all.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.860
[APPLAUSE]

01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:41.600
- My pleasure.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.822
Thank you.

01:30:43.822 --> 01:30:47.642
- We should turn it
over to Hisa, I think.

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:49.100
- It was touch and
go for a moment,

01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:50.514
but this bitch is pretty.

01:30:50.514 --> 01:30:53.500
[LAUGHING]

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.577
- So Hisa, do you
want to wrap up?

01:30:57.577 --> 01:30:58.660
We have one more question.

01:30:58.660 --> 01:30:59.327
Do you want to--

01:30:59.327 --> 01:31:01.550
- Uh, do we want to
take one more question?

01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:02.690
Or do you--

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:05.107
- I was going to ask you what
you were thinking right now,

01:31:05.107 --> 01:31:07.460
but you already you
just basically--

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:08.720
you already talked about that.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.678
So unless you want to go
out a little bit more.

01:31:10.678 --> 01:31:13.340
- No, no, so let
me let me wrap up.

01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:18.170
First of all, I want to
echo Robin and really thank,

01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:21.740
especially, Gabrielle and Jen
for putting this all together

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:24.600
and bringing, you know,
this fantastic group.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.120
Corey was fantastic.

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:31.770
I mean, not only as an artist
and performing and putting

01:31:31.770 --> 01:31:35.360
this together, but this
whole group, I think,

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:41.560
you can really feel the sense
of community that everybody has.

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:43.250
It's expressed in the movie.

01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:46.920
But experiencing it live,
I think that was the most,

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:52.760
you know, profound
experience for me.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.845
Becoming a beautiful person,
it's a once-in-a-lifetime

01:31:55.845 --> 01:31:56.345
experience.

01:31:56.345 --> 01:31:57.068
[LAUGHING]

01:31:57.068 --> 01:31:58.675
- You were already
beautiful, bitch.

01:31:58.675 --> 01:31:59.800
You were already beautiful.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.650
We just put a wig on it.

01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:02.650
- But this experience of
the community, I think,

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:05.070
is really something
very special.

01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:08.860
I also want to just thank
Becky Wassarman, Academic

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:10.764
Ventures at Radcliffe.

01:32:10.764 --> 01:32:12.192
She put in so much work.

01:32:12.192 --> 01:32:15.048
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.900
Thank you to you all
for coming tonight.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.620
I hope, at least
some of you will

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:24.880
be able to come to the
conference tomorrow, which

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.420
we have another very different,
but fantastic set of speakers

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.930
and presentations that
I'm sure will be just as

01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:33.190
interesting as this evening.

01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:35.080
So thank you very much.

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.960
- And we want to just do a
shout out to Becky and Jessica

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.583
and the whole AV
crew and everybody

01:32:39.583 --> 01:32:40.500
was behind the scenes.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.000
- Steve.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.160
- Steve in security.

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.460
- Steve.

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.510
- And then thank you
so much Hisa and Robin,

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:52.120
amazing courage,
wonderful volunteers,

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.700
and just throwing themselves
fully into the experience

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.790
and having us here at Radcliffe.

01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:57.790
It was really wonderful.

01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:58.450
We're thrilled to be back.

01:32:58.450 --> 01:32:59.530
- Yeah, thank you all.

01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:00.430
[APPLAUSE]

01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:01.630
- Thank you so much.

01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:05.880
