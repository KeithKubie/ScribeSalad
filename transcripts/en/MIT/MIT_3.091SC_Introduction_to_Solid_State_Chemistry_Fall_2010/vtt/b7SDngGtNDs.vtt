00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.570
Hi I'm Jocelyn and we're going
to go over fall 2009, the

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.240
final exam, problem number 6.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.750
It says, the dipeptide shown
below is derived from alanine

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.120
and serine.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.050
And I'll write up that
structure here.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.450
And we know it's a dipeptide
because we

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.590
see that it has two--

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.220
what look like--

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.790
amine groups and two kind
of carboxyl groups.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.870
So that's an indicator that
we're dealing with a dipeptide

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.830
not just one amino acid.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.670
Something to notice right off
the bat is that we're given

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.950
the zwitterion form.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.480
We have the amine group at the
end here is protonated and the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.040
carboxylic group on the other
end is deprotonated.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.460
So moving to part 1.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.870
It asked us to indicate the
position of the peptide bond.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.400
Hopefully this is a pretty
straightforward task.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.260
We realize that the
dipeptide bond is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.690
what makes the dipeptide.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:55.390
It's the bond between the amine
group of one amino acid

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.304
and the carboxyl group
of another.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.640
Right there.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.990
So circling that carbon nitrogen
bond would get you

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.850
full credit on that part.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.130
Moving to part 2.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.600
We are asked to draw the
skeletal structure of each

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.380
constituent amino acid as it
would be present in an aqueous

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.740
solution of an extreme
basicity, i.e. pH

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.540
greater than 12.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.730
So before even starting to write
we want to think about

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.230
what extreme basicity means.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.440
Well it means that both our
amine group and our carboxylic

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.230
acid group are going
to be deprotonated.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.000
So let's start with
alanine first. We

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:56.257
have the central carbon.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.180
The amine group.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.772
And the carboxylic acid group.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.890
Now I just drew that
totally protonated.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.370
However we want to draw it
totally deprotonated because

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.520
it's in basic solution.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.850
So I'm just going to erase
the extra hydrogens.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.600
And we have a deprotonated amine
group and a deprotonated

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.250
carboxyl group.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.460
And that is what it would look
like in basic solution.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.440
Now serine is a little different
because you have a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.420
side group with functionality.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.100
It has not just carbon
and hydrogen.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.100
First drawing up the backbone
here, we have a central

00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:01.590
carbon, which has a methyl
alcohol group off of it.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.705
And attach the carboxylic
acid.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.930
And amine group on
the left here.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.610
So this one I drew as the
zwitterion, which would be in

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.170
moderately or kind of neutral.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.350
It depends upon the
amino acid.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.080
But again we want to deprotonate
our amine group

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.530
here because pH greater than 12
will not have a protonated

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.340
amine group.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.470
Now the question is,
what do we do with

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.970
the side chain here?

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.510
It has an H attached
to an oxygen.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.210
Does that come off in super
basic solution or not?

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.180
A lot of students got
tripped up on this.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.620
An alcohol actually has
a pKa of about 16.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.460
And so it won't be deprotonated

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.860
in an aqueous solution.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.380
Therefore we want to keep
this hydrogen on.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.750
It will not be--

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.770
this will not be a charged
oxygen in the basic solution

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.910
that we were asked about.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.930
So now we are going to
move on to the second

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.290
part of this problem.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.530
The second part asks us about
the tertiary structure of the

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.830
length of protein
that is shown.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.760
I am not going to draw the whole
length of protein but

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.660
we're going to--

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.400
at the four specified
locations--

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.980
we're going to indicate what
we would call the tertiary

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.260
structure; or what functionality
is causing the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.070
tertiary structure.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.180
So looking at that
protein chain.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.190
Professor Sadoway has indicated
four different

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.090
distinct parts of the chain.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.040
And the question is asking us,
at each of the four numbered

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.590
positions name one chemical
change to the environment of

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.540
the protein that would
destabilize the associated

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.860
feature in the tertiary
structure.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.140
Explain the relevant chemistry
so it's asking us to say what

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.960
can we do to disrupt that
tertiary structure?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.740
And the first thing we need to
do is figure out what the

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.080
tertiary structure is.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.180
So if we look at number 1, we
see that it has two sulphur

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.980
atoms connected together.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.770
So we call that a
disulfide bond.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:57.030
The second part, we see that we
have a phenyl group, so it

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:04.090
has a very electron-deficient
hydrogen interacting with a

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.370
deprotonated carboxyl
oxygen anion.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.800
And so we have a hydrogen bond
there and that's what's

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.550
causing those amino acids
to be pulled together.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.850
So let's just say
hydrogen bond.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.960
At the third number we see
that we had a deprotonate

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.630
carboxyl group and a protonated
amine group

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.640
interacting.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.780
And that's not quite a hydrogen
bond but it's a

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.580
negatively charged part of the
molecule interacting with the

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.920
positively charged part of
a different molecule.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.480
And so we call that
electrostatic interaction.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.900
It's similar to a hydrogen
bond in that it's a

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.240
intermolecular interaction
that's causing these molecules

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.573
to move closer, preference
to be closer together.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.270
And now we come to
the fourth part.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.620
Which is hydrophobic
interactions.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.460
So we see that there
are a lot of just

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.710
carbon hydrogen chains.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.750
No oxygen is around, no
amine groups around.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.580
Purely carbon and hydrogen.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.660
And because this is an aqueous
solution, those hydrophobic

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.380
parts of the molecules will
preferentially go together and

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.130
kind of make a little--

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.190
almost like an-- oil
droplet in water.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.020
They're trying to decrease the
amount that they experience

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.240
the polarity of the water.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.810
And so the interactions
are hydrophobic.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.610
So now that we know what the
functionality at each of these

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.910
points in the DNA structure are,
we can go back to what

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.130
the question is actually asking
us, which is, how can

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.080
we actually disrupt
these features.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.220
So the first one is the
disulfide bond.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:32.560
And in class Professor Sadoway
talked about how to disrupt

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.780
the disulfide bond.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:43.430
And one of the ways
is to put extreme

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.210
heat on to the protein.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.750
And that breaks the disulfide
bond and you can straighten

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.760
out that portion of the DNA.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.830
This is how you straighten your
hair if it's curly or

00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:00.520
other types of things with
the disulfide bond.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.680
So heating the disulfide bond to
extreme heat will cause it

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.700
to break and thus the protein
will lose that, that folding

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.300
or whatever the disulfide bond
imparted to that portion of

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.090
the protein.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.100
Now going on to number 2.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.290
We have hydrogen bonding.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:29.530
And we see that it's between a
alcohol group on a ring there

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.260
and a carboxyl group.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.170
So one way to disrupt that
hydrogen bond is to make the

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.070
carboxyl group no longer
deprotonated.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.480
So if we put back on the
hydrogen to that oxygen it

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.410
will become less partially
negative.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.490
It will have a lower

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.430
interaction with that hydrogen.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.480
And so we can say, to protonate
that carboxyl we

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.720
want to make the solution
more acidic.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.000
So we can add acid.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.600
So the disulfide we're going
to heat, the hydrogen bond

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.850
we're going to add acid.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.050
Looking at number 3 we
see that we have a

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.080
electrostatic reaction.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.210
And so we want to not have that
electrostatic reaction.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:30.540
And one way to do that is to
make one of those entities not

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.190
have a charge.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.190
So one way to do that would be
to reprotonate the carboxylic

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.490
acid, just as we did in
the previous step.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.300
Or we could deprotonate
the amine group.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.970
And that would cause it to lose
its charge and thus the

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.380
electrostatic interaction
would be weaker or gone.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.980
So to deprotonate the amine
group we should know that we

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.230
want to add base.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.640
And the final part is, the
portion with hydrophilic

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.360
interactions.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.090
And here we want to figure
out a way to make those

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:26.480
hydrophobic portions of the
amino acids not hold as

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.670
tightly together.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.640
And one thing we learned
about in class is

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.740
something like soap.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.090
Something that has a hydrophobic
side and a

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.580
hydrophilic side.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:44.960
And so if we put soap in with
this protein it can kind of

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.190
stabilize the hydrophobic part
and make it stretch out a

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.910
little bit more, not
ball up so tightly.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.628
So soap or detergent would be
a good answer for this one.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.480
And so for this question, as
long as you indicated the

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.230
relevant chemistry, which is
specified what tertiary

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:18.310
structure you were looking
at and how your suggested

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.210
procedure would disrupt that
tertiary structure, that's

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.420
what Professor Sadoway was
looking for and that would

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.940
mean that you answered the
question completely.
