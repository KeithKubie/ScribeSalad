00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.061
&gt;&gt; FINNE: Hello, everyone. Happy Thursday.
Welcome to the last Good I/O session in this

00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:08.370
track and I think the last of all the sessions.
This is Analyzing and Monetizing your iPhone

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.420
apps. My name is Chrix Finne and I'm a product
manager on the mobile ads team at Google.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.199
And this is my colleague Jim Kelm. We're here
to talk to today about AdWords, AdSense and

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.710
Google analytics for your apps. Just to get
started, out there today, how many folks use

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.539
Google AdWords today? Anybody? Got a few people,
awesome. How many use AdSense either on their

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.191
blog or whatever? Awesome. And how many people
are using Google analytics, websites? Look,

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:37.710
look at those, awesome. So, this maybe a little
review for some of you guys but we've got

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.900
some exciting stuff in store. And, yeah, that's
really about it. We have some T-shirts and

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.421
pamphlets for you at the end if you stick
around. So, I just wanted to throw that out

00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:51.560
their. And we'll get started, this is Jim.
&gt;&gt; KELM: Well, thanks, Chrix. It's great;

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.710
a lot of you are already familiar with some
of the products that we'll be talking about

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.860
today. So, yeah, let's jump in. Before we
get started, I've always wanted something

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.379
like this for a lot of meetings that I'm in,
sort of the guide of this presentation or

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.829
how to get from now to happy hour. We're going
to talk a little bit about platform, that'll

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.560
be interesting. We're going to talk about
$100 free credit that you're getting. That

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.520
should be really interesting. Afterwards,
we're going to show a live implementation

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.030
of Google ads inside mobile applications.
That's going to be really special for me and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.560
really amusing for you. And then Chrix is
going to talk some more about analytics. And

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.850
one of the disclaimer before we begin, we're
all developers here or used to be developers

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.970
and in case with me. And I'm used to engineering
slides having a certain histologic aspect

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.490
to them, but we're talking about monetization,
we're talking about business. And so, don't

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.900
hold the prettiness of the business slides
against them.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.429
&gt;&gt; FINNE: So, fundamentally, we know that
you guys are all app developers but also,

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.460
you know, these apps are becoming businesses
in many folk's cases and so that's important

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.420
and we're trying to--trying to speak to that
too. So, there some very pretty slides. Thank

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.229
you to our colleague Lawrence to refer all
of our work by the way.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.970
&gt;&gt; KELM: So let's talk a little bit about
the life cycle of an application. So it starts

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.720
with you have an idea, you bounce it off to
your friends, you start hacking your way at

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.310
it; before you knew it, you got an app. And
then you're--you're sitting their, you're

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.761
adding features to it, your debugging it,
you launch it, and you start to get users.

00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:31.600
And it starts to grow and grow and grow and
you're getting up in the morning and seeing

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.460
how many downloads roll over night. And it's
really exciting stage. And then at some point,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.681
you have enough users that you start to think
about monetizing this thing. And you've--in

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.850
a sense you've paid your app and now your
apps starts paying you. You put--you can put

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.450
some ads in it. Start to make revenue off
that way. And before it long, your app keeps

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.450
growing. Your phone might ring one day and
it's some agency or advertiser on the other

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.560
end and they want to directly buy some inventory
from you. All of a sudden, you've got this

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.440
robust business based on your application.
So the good news is Google can be there for

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.990
you all along the way. Starting with the Android
platform as a great place to build your apps,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.380
to analytics for measuring and improving your
applications, to AdWords for promoting your

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.220
applications, driving that growth just a little
bit faster, AdSense for monetizing them, and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.090
then later on when you start doing direct
sales, you can use double click for publishers,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.530
in manager sales, in backflow with AdSense
or even third party on that works. We will

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.790
talk about all of those today. So let's start
with building your app. So, let's see, Chrix

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.370
you already asked about AdWords and AdSense.
Anyone who have an iPhone app out there? Okay,

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.903
a bunch of people. Anyone who have an Android
app? And for those of you who--all right,

00:03:50.903 --> 00:03:54.550
yeah. For those of you who don't have Android
apps, a lot of you can--the remainders considering

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:02.120
building Android apps in the near future,
so yeah. So, you've got company. You know,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.440
as Vic was saying this morning, Androids got
momentum. And, you know, it's a lot of people

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.890
are developing for it and even those that
haven't build apps for it or are planning

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.950
to develop them in the next six months. And
also as you heard this morning, you know,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.160
Android devices are now shipping number two
in the U.S. market behind BlackBerry which

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.870
is incredible. So, there's a lot of momentum
here and it's a great place to build your

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:36.940
app. Now, you're already familiar with AdWords.
One can that we started to see out there is

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.810
developers using advertising in order to promote
their apps early in the life cycle. We all

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.580
know how important it is to achieve a certain
level of downloads is that you'll end up in

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.680
rankings in front of consumers and the sort
of organic--the burst of organic growth you

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.100
can have when get there. Fortunately, Google
knows a little bit about the online advertising

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.840
business. And we've taken this to mobile.
And there are some powerful capabilities we

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.620
can offer you. First is reach. So across all
of our ad networks, be they search or content,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.560
we can reach consumers wherever--and users,
wherever you need to. Second is targeting.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:23.440
So we've got some great ways to target ads
like carrier, by device, by location, and

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.509
all the ways that we traditionally do for
those who have ads.

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.230
&gt;&gt; FINNE: Things like, you know, placements
and keywords, obviously, all these things

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.889
we're all sort of fundamental.
&gt;&gt; KELM: And finally, they are the tools that

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.440
you needed in order to measure and monitor
your campaigns and track conversions so that

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.840
you know that your advertising is effective.
As I was saying, we can reach users on a number

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.710
of different networks. Earlier today, Vic
was talking about how different advertisers

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.090
have different needs when it comes to ad formats.
And you can use the different formats that

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.400
we've--and the different functions we've created
in order to reach users wherever they are

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.620
particularly when they're engaged in mobile.
So, for example, you can reach them in other

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.070
mobile applications, you can reach them when
you're browsing the Web, which we're hear

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.280
today. Despite rumors, on the contrary, it's
the number of three usage of the smartphones

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.360
behind the phone calls and text. And you can
reach someone you're doing mobile search.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.330
So one particular example of this that we've
highlighted is the Corcoran Group, they are

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.460
a real estate company in New York. They built
an app in order to highlight their listings

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.740
to perspective the real estate purchasers.
And they wanted to drive adoptions as quickly

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.600
as possible. They used an AdWord campaign
and we're able to boost their downloads by

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:50.010
28% with a minimum investment, and so that
worked very well for them and its something

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.490
that's affordable to any app developer out
there.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.990
&gt;&gt; FINNE: I kind of want to also just really
stress the importance of how we see application

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.880
advertising as one sort of route to bootstrapping
your app, you know, up into an apps store

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.820
because these apps stores have these ecosystems
around featured and top ex-apps. It can be

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.300
really important to kind of get into that
slot and you can use advertising as one way

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.070
to sort of bootstrap your way up there. This
sort of app ads are something that we're seeing

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.110
a lot more developers doing when we think
it's providing a lot of use list to them.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.169
It's dead simple, you just link to the app
store in your ad, AdWords actually handles

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:25.560
all the targeting in our end and you can get
doing, you know, probably just after the session,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.139
if you guys want to.
&gt;&gt; KELM: Great. So it worked for Corcoran

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:35.241
and we'd like to see it work for you which
is why we're providing $100 free advertising

00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:41.040
credit to any Google I/O developers that has
signed up for AdSense for mobile applications.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.100
So we would encourage you to use this $100,
create some ads; see if you can drive some

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:57.100
installs in your apps. And you can find out
more information about that on google.com/mobileads.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:03.370
One important note, this supply is not only
the slides but also to ads when you're trying

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:10.169
to promote your applications, definitely putting
this mix credibility. Okay, earning from your

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:15.150
app. So you've got some scale, you've got
some users out there and just as publishers

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:22.150
monetize their traffic, you can monetize your
usage. So that's where this opportunity is

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.300
just growing everyday. It was under half a
billion dollars last year and it's going to

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.850
quadruple within the next couple of years.
And it's really just the beginning. What we're

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:37.640
seeing is large traditional advertisers are
only starting to experiment in mobile. And

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.870
largely they're finding what all of you already
know which is that the users are there and

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:48.061
that they're engaged. So we expect more and
more advertising by June to go in to mobile

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:57.089
advertising. And as we find new innovative
ad formats to engage users appropriately in

00:08:57.089 --> 00:09:04.270
a mobile context, we expect the pie to just
continue to grow. To click to call ads that

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.899
we're showing this morning were one example
of them. These are testing incredibly well

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:21.500
with advertisers and they are proving to be
a significant source of revenue to our publishers.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.250
So, that's where AdSense comes in. So AdSense
has enabled web publishers to monetize their

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:32.230
traffic and we have AdSense for mobile applications
now or AFMA as we sometimes you call it for

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:39.450
mobile app developers. Same concept as putting
ads in your website, put them in your mobile

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:44.370
application and start to earn money from your
applications. So this has been in private

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.710
data for a while now with a small number of
developers. As was announced this morning,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:58.240
we're opening it up to all the Google I/O
attendees. And we look forward to your feedback.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:06.100
So, what did--can AdSense for mobile applications
offer you? First, AdSense has a great fill

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:12.770
rate, you know, any ad network we'll talk
about, the revenue they can potentially provide.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:18.030
But in order to do that they have to be able
to fill the inventory, to sell your inventory

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.670
to advertisers. AdSense offers that right
out of the--right from the start. Second is

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:28.310
our focus on user experience. So, in general,
the Google products were constantly focused

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.630
on the user and we're trying to iterate and
improve their experience with the product.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:38.860
And I might say, "Well, what does that mean
in the context of ads." What it means in ads

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:45.560
is looking for new ways to match a user with
an ad out there that would be the most relevant

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.140
to them at this particular time or in this
particular context and were constantly investing

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.700
there. And those investments will yield improvements
in the user experience in the ads in your

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:03.600
application, because we want overtime to write
more and more relevant ads. And then finally,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:13.930
we've got a great sales team. And they are
on the phone everyday with all of the agencies,

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.390
brand advertiser, direct advertisers, and
small and medium businesses out there. And

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:23.390
they'd be happy to help sell your inventory
too. So you saw this morning in Vic's keynote,

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:30.100
I think, seven or eight different new ad formats
that we've done, including expandable ads

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.450
which we think are great thing because they
enable users to interact with the ads without

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.220
leaving your application. You saw "click to
call" which is showing great traction with

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:46.740
a category of advertisers that is really eager
to get into it. And you even saw Google serving

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:53.620
third-party ads, rich media ads on our network.
And so those are some examples of innovative

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.890
ad formats that we've been rolling out. And
that we will continue to rollout across our

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.940
network.
&gt;&gt; FINNE: Yeah, really. This is really just

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.180
a beginning of a whole wave and you can see
this across the industry of really interesting

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.130
things that people are able to do with mobile
devices, right? You know user's location potentially.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:16.800
You know various other things that you can
basically use to help deliver the most relevant

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.040
information. That's both for search and ads
and everything that we think about in Google

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.390
Mobile. And as those things progress, that
just brings sort of more value into the picture

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.760
for you guys as developers, for our users,
and for everyone which is really exciting.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.540
It's really just the tip of the iceberg.
&gt;&gt; KELM: So now comes the demo. AdSense for

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:41.180
mobile application is really easy to implement.
So easy that even product managers maybe able

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:49.010
to do so onstage. So let's give it a shot.
So there's three key things here; it's basically

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.110
modify your layout to have an ad view. You
may need to change some permissions. This

00:12:53.110 --> 00:13:05.350
is Android example, and a little bit of code
that you add. So let's get to it. All right.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:12.350
Okay, so I said step one is modify your layout;
actually, step zero is make sure that you've

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:20.730
got the JAR to do. There's also one here for
Google Analytics that Chrix will be talking

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:26.970
about. All right, I'm in a--by the way this
is the code for the Google I/O, Android App,

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.470
which were going to be open sourcing if it
isn't already. Hopefully, some of you have

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:39.680
seen it. We're going to modify that to put
in an ad. So I've got the activity main XML

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:53.370
file open, and at the end we just put in little
ad view, pretty straightforward. Step two

00:13:53.370 --> 00:14:03.600
was the permissions. So as was discussed in
the keynote today, we get--we want to enable

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.910
the Internet, which we have done, and may
already have--probably already have in your

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:16.339
applications. As a side note for Analytics,
we also want to enable access network state,

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:29.829
so pretty straightforward. Okay, then all
we need to do is do an import for AdSense.

00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:41.070
I've done a couple others, so I don't get
some notifications. Analytics, same thing,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:51.294
clear some strings, client ID, app name, the
company name, and keywords. And just create

00:14:51.294 --> 00:14:54.850
an ad view here. Now we're going to do an
expandable ad, although it's going to be at

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:59.480
the bottom of the screen expanding up as opposed
to earlier today there was one at the top

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:08.360
of the screen expanding down. And then you
show it. So that's really just a few lines

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:42.190
of code. Let's go over into--I mean later,
okay. It's running. And that's all it takes

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:52.920
to put a Vampire Diaries' trailer ad in your
application. So...

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.260
&gt;&gt; FINNE: Nicely done, sir.
&gt;&gt; KELM: Okay, so again. All we had to do

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:06.730
there, it's so easy a PM could do it; was
modified the layout, permission for the Internet

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:14.500
if not--if you don't already have it, and
add a little bit of code. So how do I get

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:20.050
started? Well, if you don't already have an
AdSense account signup for it. And then once

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:25.279
your account is activated go in to AdSense.
Under the AdSense Setup tab, you'll find AdSense

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:32.560
for mobile applications, just select that.
And follow the steps to apply to the data.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:39.050
When you're registered for Google I/O, you
got a Google I/O confirmation number. Use

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:44.029
that number in the process when we ask for
it because it'll enable us to identify you

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:52.050
as developers and give you a little bit of
extra attention to help you get onboard faster.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:56.860
So as I said earlier, you know, some of you
are going have rising--you know, Rising Star

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:03.180
Applications that are just going to grow and
grow and grow, and those are always great.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:09.110
And someday you may be approached by an agency
or an advertiser that wants to buy directly

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.049
from you. I just wanted to note that Google
does have tools to help you for that. That's

00:17:13.049 --> 00:17:17.449
what double click for publishers was all about
on desktop, it was that we had these publishers

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:24.500
that reached to scale where they started doing
their own direct sales. And they needed to

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.680
be able to manage those sales. And then for
the inventory that they didn't sell, they

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:32.780
wanted to backfill it with AdSense or really
whichever network would pay them the most.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:38.360
And that's what double click for publishers
was on desktop and we've extend that to mobile.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:45.160
So Google can be there to grow with you as
your business needs for your apps grows. So

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.680
now I'm going to turn in over Chrix to talk
to you a little bit more about Analytics.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:56.660
&gt;&gt; FINNE: Thanks so much, Jim. Get the thinger
here. Cool. So I guess--we've talked about

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.630
sort of all the things that you can do to
sort of turn your app into more of a business.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.800
And, you know, whether or not you're even
using advertising in your application, you

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.140
really want to know what's going on. And I
hope that that's something that, you know,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:15.110
that desire is shared. I mean this is something
that has become sort of a core part of the

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:20.620
Web ecosystem over the last 10 years that
you, you know, take some traffic, you know,

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.950
coming into a website or a mobile app or whatever
and, you know, sort of slice and dice it to

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:30.470
understand the types of things that your users
are doing and to get insights about what they

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.850
might want or might not be getting out of
your site or app or whatever. I mean that's

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.150
really what Google Analytics core mission
is all about. I've noticed that a lot of you

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.890
are already users on the Web, which is great.
So I apologize if some of this is background.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:48.299
But as of November, we are actually offering
two SDKs for iPhone and Android apps to bring

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:52.960
that same sort of goodness straight into your
app. We know that most of your apps are connected

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.611
and, you know, are in many ways, you know,
similar to sort of, you know, Web applications

00:18:57.611 --> 00:19:04.240
out there online. And by bringing Analytics
into your apps, you can start to get the same

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:11.960
sorts of insights and other, you know, optimizations
basically that you would used to online. One

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.070
thing that Analytics really does well and
that we're starting to bring to Android is

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:21.750
referral tracking. So, you know, say, you
actually are paying for traffic to your app

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.600
or you're linking to it from your website
or maybe you get a blog post. You really want

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.040
to know whether or not all those different
traffic sources are providing value, right?

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.390
Especially, if you're for paying them, right?
And we can start to do that. All right, this

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.320
is something that has been around not for
while on the web as I've said and is bringing--we're

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.990
bringing into apps. We're bringing the sorts
of insights and reporting that you need to

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.940
make sure you're users are getting what they
need out of your apps. I need to make sure

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.670
I didn't miss anything before we move along.
Yes, and then of course the last point is

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.960
that this is all part of Google Analytics
that many of you know and love already. Like

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.890
the interface is the same, you came to the
same front-end, and you can understand what

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.490
people are doing in your app in the same interface
even alongside the reports of what they may

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:08.260
doing--may be would be doing on your website,
which is just--is just really cool. So let's

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.789
take a look. This is actually our mobile devices
report that we added to Google Analytics again

00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:18.549
when we launched back in November. This along
with the carrier report and what we call an

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:22.750
advance segment, it let's you look at your
mobile traffic in a little more, you know,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.690
sort of mobile specific way. Obviously, most
people out there on the web wouldn't care

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.270
about your mobile device or your carrier,
but we know that people that are in mobile

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.900
do. So we can show you this, we can show you
what sorts of, you know, different types of

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.290
trafficking patterns they're getting, what
sorts of, you know, engagement and usage and

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.860
we can also split any of your mobile traffic.
Maybe you have a site that has both mobile

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:50.280
and regular desktop traffic. We can split
any of the Analytics reports by mobile using

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.510
this advance segment, which is pretty cool,
not really relevant to apps but it's also

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:59.330
really cool. So, using these sorts of reports
you can understand what people are doing with

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:05.360
mobile but this is just a tiny, I think, maybe
2% or 3% subset of all the different reports

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.539
that are available in Google Analytics that
you understand really anything you can imagine

00:21:10.539 --> 00:21:13.730
about your users. I'm not going to have time
to go through them all today, but, you know,

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.190
again the basic idea is that we're bringing
all of this power from Google Analytics out

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:22.340
there on the Web straight into apps. So let's
talk a little bit more about exactly what

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:28.840
we can do in Google analytics form mobile
apps. So as I've mentioned the basic, basic

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.020
thing is aggregate usage tracking. We have
sort of borrowed the concept of the pageview,

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.200
which is, again, you know, very sort of fundamental
metric out there on the Web. How many page

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.690
users you're getting a day? How many unique
visitors divided by page user hopping? All

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:46.110
of these sorts of things and brought it straight
into your app. It's trivially easy. I'll show

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.500
you in a second to trigger a pageview whenever
you sort of load a new screen or a new level

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.590
or whatever it may be in your app and, you
know, compare to that to the other pages.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.970
You can start to get metrics like, you know,
number of unique users in seven days, time

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.970
on site, time between different page users.
You can start to see where people are really

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.520
engaging with your app and where they may
not be. And that can lead to like really,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.780
really interesting insights. As I was mentioning,
you can sort of start to slice these engagement

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.160
metrics. Again, all based on sort of that
atom of the pageview into all sorts of different

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.620
things. So you can--you can talk about session
length, you can talk about, you know, things

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.000
like whether or not a user, you know, bounces
at one page versus another or whether maybe

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.330
they come back and bounce or if they're returning.
There's a bunch of different ways of slicing

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.500
that. And again this is all just coming straight
into the apps with very, very, very little

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.080
effort on you guys' part. It really is just
the equivalent of dropping that Google Analytic

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.840
JavaScripts, dip it into any website, which
I guess many of you already are familiar with.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.650
As I've mentioned before we have a few sort
of mobile extras, such as device and carrier

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.350
reporting as well as this mobile segment.
It's sort of let's you look at any traffic.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:56.280
Maybe you actually want to put all of your
traffic into one analytics report. I--I know

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.539
many people out there have apps that are actually
very similar to a website out there. So, you

00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:04.920
could actually line them up against each other
and compare to see, say, if somebody is maybe

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.340
engaging more with the sort of appefied version
of your service versus the Web version. I

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.080
know this is certainly true when you look
at a lot of the big players out there like

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.970
eBay. They have both a really great mobile
website and a really great mobile app. I'm

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:22.000
a big fan and, you know, if I were them, I
would want to know whether or not these two

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.309
sorts of similarly featured platforms are--are
performing similarly or not. There's one other

00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:33.419
thing in the analytics sort of world that's
a little less well-known, that we think is

00:23:33.419 --> 00:23:36.870
really exciting especially for sort of the
application use case, and that's called event

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:41.770
tracking. I'm going to show you also how to
set that up in a minute, but, basically, sort

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:47.049
of separate from this sort of basic pageview
base reporting. Analytics offers a flexible

00:23:47.049 --> 00:23:54.932
framework to just declare events, like something
happened, right? And they can, you know, you

00:23:54.932 --> 00:23:57.950
can name them anything, they will actually
have three different levels of hierarchy that

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.890
you can group them into. So, you can have
in all the buttons in your app or a group

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.919
and maybe the different labels and the different
sort of actions on those different buttons.

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:10.340
And you can start to understand how often
these things are occurring basically and how

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.600
much value they're bringing you, which is--which
is pretty neat. You could imagine a scenario

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.590
where you're a gamer or something, all right.
And you could actually, you know, trigger

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:23.040
an event every time somebody kills a monster,
right? Okay, so that's something. But maybe

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.210
you have a bunch of different monsters in
your game that you want to try and tune. So

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:31.280
you could just trigger an event and then understand
how many monsters are actually being successfully

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:38.010
killed by your users and tune them that way.
I know they're like the World of Warcraft

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.500
guys do this all the time by turning the knobs.
So these are the sorts of insights you can

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:44.200
start to get. Really it's pretty neat to be
able to sort of not worry about this. There's

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:48.680
a lot of, you know, in theory any of this
can be done on you guys as in these developers,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.950
if you log and send stuff back, but we sort
of we're able to do this at scale and provide

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:58.240
reports for you just really easily. And this
is all made possible by sort of this intelligent

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.950
SDK. Again, it's trivially easy to implement
as you'll see in a minute, but what the SDK

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:10.590
allows you to not worry about are things like
network and battery. Things that, you know,

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:14.320
actually are important considerations when
you're building your mobile app. You don't

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.650
want to run down the user's battery. You don't
want to hang the app. Well, you should never

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.090
put it in the main thread, but you don't want
to hang the app if the network is down or

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:26.771
any things like this. And so no matter how
many events in the pageviews or whatever else

00:25:26.771 --> 00:25:32.200
is going on that you're sending to our Analytics
SDK, it's going to intelligently batch those

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:38.289
and sort of hang on to them until either set
dispatch interval hits, you know, every minute

00:25:38.289 --> 00:25:41.530
or two or whatever, or until your app has
some other sort of network activity that goes

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.100
on and then all you need to do is call the
dispatch method and say, "All right, time

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.250
to phone home and send those events back to
Google Analytics." So it's actually pretty

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:52.370
flexible and we found that our developers
that who've adopted this so far have not really

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:57.460
seen any impact on battery life or anything
like that. So it's really pretty neat to be

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:03.890
able to sort of get this, you know, pretty
much for free. So that's all well and good

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:09.270
but, you know, why even do we offer Google
analytics for free, if you may ask. It's because

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:14.150
of what you can do when you're using it with
ads. This is again something that if you use

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.270
AdWords online, I hope you actually have it
hooked up to your Analytics account. But as

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:24.059
I was saying before, tracking referrals into
your app is a really powerful thing. And this

00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:30.950
is something that is now possible using the
Android market in Google Analytics. So this

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:37.470
is something that is honestly the reason that
we provide it to the world, because it's so

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:42.409
valuable for our AdWords advertisers to be
able to see what traffic has coming in based

00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:46.820
on different campaigns, different keywords,
you know, search engines versus direct traffic,

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:51.520
you know, links on blogs versus some, you
know, new sites or whatever else. Once you

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.000
see all those referrals coming in the different
traffic sources, you can split them and understand,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.450
"Well, hey, you know, I did this campaign
but nobody convert it or I did other keyword

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.250
and everybody stayed on my site twice as long
as I thought they would." These are the sorts

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:08.830
of things you can start to understand in your
app. So let me talk a little bit more about

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:13.549
this funnel. Funnel is the sort of, you know,
sales speak for this, sorry, but, anyway,

00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:17.730
basically, let's just imagine you have an
app that you're trying to bootstrap and you

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:22.270
setup an ad campaign that say, "Hey, come
down to my app." And you have a couple of

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:27.630
different keywords there. So what you can
do now is just make a special Android Marketplace

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.890
URL for that. It's pretty easy, you just append
the, you know, referral equals parameter,

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:37.470
because it doesn't really work like it would
on the web in the HTTP header. And you say

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.000
this is this campaign, this is this other
one. So users go and start clicking on those

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.950
links and it, you know, sends them to the
Android Market download page, right? So they

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:49.250
say, "Okay, do I want this? Do I not want
this?" And the Android market now has an Android

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:54.100
1.6. back in November, is smart enough to
take that referral string and pass it as an

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.830
intent into the app. I think you guys have
all heard a lot about Android intents, if

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:02.299
you've been to the sessions today. We're using
that as well, so that any app that's getting

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:07.280
installed from some link that came from one
of these referral strings gets that into its

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.820
manifest and you can look at it. And our Analytics
SDK, once the user has sort of downloaded

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.770
and open the app, will automatically pick
that up and send that back as a traffic source

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:23.020
which is just really cool and it's open. And
this referral technology is something that

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.380
anybody can use in their app. You don't have
to even be using the Google Analytics SDK,

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:31.179
you just sort of look out for it and you can
process that on your end if you want to. So

00:28:31.179 --> 00:28:35.409
even, you know, other analytics providers
or whoever else can sort of use this Android

00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:41.390
market pass through to get that sort of granular,
referral level of reporting on your user base,

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.200
which is just--which is just really exciting.
This is something that we're not--not aware

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.480
of any other sort of mobile app stores other
than the Android market offered today. And

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.419
there are--there are some other solutions
out there that do sort of--a little hacky

00:28:54.419 --> 00:28:57.970
thing where they look at the device ID on
one end and then the other end to see if click

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.860
came from another application. But this is
really direct and pretty exciting because

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:08.200
we think that this is making that sort of
value that people are used to on the Web available

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:15.159
on people's apps. So this is great. There's
one other pretty neat thing that we're actually

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:21.110
just about to release out into the wild which
is AdSenses. As Jim mentioned you guys are

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:26.890
all welcome to sign up for AdSense for mobile
apps and apply for that today. And so once

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:31.850
that starts going, you want to know about
that too. As about a year ago, we actually

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:37.730
provide an AdSense integration into ad analytics
on the web and we're adding that to mobile

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:42.730
apps now too. So what you can see here is
a report which starts to tell you which pages,

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:48.100
which of use of your app are monetizing well
or are not. So that's really important, you

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.480
don't want to just know once you started running
ads in your app what the top line is, you

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.919
want to know, "Well, are my users getting
value from my ads or are they getting value

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:59.549
from the ads in all the different parts of
my application where there may be ads, or

00:29:59.549 --> 00:30:04.240
the ads put in the right spot in the application
to sort of deliver the most value and the

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.010
most clicks from users because they click
when they think the ad is useful?" Do they,

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:13.100
you know, do--the users that are coming in
through this different referral channels,

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.130
they click on my ads or not? These are all
the sorts of insights that you can start to

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:21.029
get with this AdSense report. This is not
yet part of the public Google Analytics SDK

00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:25.550
just because AdSense for mobile apps isn't
yet public. But once you're signed up and

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:30.630
running, you can ask for this from your Google
contact and we'll send it right along. So

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:36.200
that's pretty exciting. So what you need to
do to is just sign up. As I've mentioned several

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.929
times, it really is trivially easy; again,
so easy, a product manger can do it. So, we're

00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:44.799
going to go through that right now. You just
go to google.com/analytics. You can sign up

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:48.120
for what's called the web property ID. You
probably already have one of these. If you

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.860
have it for your website, we recommend that
you create a separate sort of sub-property

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.500
for your app, but if you want to sort of correlate
them together, you can; you can even name

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.669
the page and use the same thing. It will actually
add together if you have sort of one to one

00:30:59.669 --> 00:31:05.000
mappings of stuff in your app to stuff on
your website which is neat. You just import

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.690
our tracking SDK as very similar to what we
did with AdSense, and then you, you know,

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:14.970
send a few function calls out to track your
pages in event. So, let's see what that looks

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:27.279
like. We should shut down the thing here first,
okay. There it goes, cool. So, again, I'm

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:32.350
just going to go back and check my build path
here. As you can see, we have the "libgoogleanalytics.char"

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:37.710
which is right there and that's available
for download today, if you'd like. And then

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:42.049
we back--we go back to Android manifest and
just verify-- set this up just before hand

00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:46.570
so I wouldn't make any typos, but we have,
you know, access to the Internet so we can

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:52.149
send those sort of batches that hits home,
and we have this sort of network state here.

00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:57.080
What that's allowing the app to do--sorry--allowing
the Analytics SDK to do inside of your app

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.080
is look at those HTTP requests, and when you
want, piggy back on them before they get closed.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.110
So if you call the dispatch method, it just--it'll
just sort of hop in there and then you don't

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:11.429
get any access network or battery overhead
which is really cool. And lets go look at

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:18.700
what it looks like in the--it will avoid main
here. So, here we are. So, Google Analytics

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.090
tracker is the library that we're importing,
that's really all you have to do. As you can

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:27.320
see at the beginning of our activity here,
we've instantiated a tracker object, which

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:34.169
we call a tracker. So there's the instantiation
of that. And then to call our first pageview,

00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:39.580
all we need to do is, say, "tracker.start,"
we put in that Web property ID that you would

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:44.480
have gotten signing up online. And I've put
in 20 seconds here so that's the default dispatch

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.090
interval, as you leave that parameter out
it will wait until you call the dispatch method

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:54.170
on your piggy backing. But for this app, we're
just going to send a message every 20 seconds

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:58.090
or--however, many have spool up in that time,
and then we just say track page you, it's

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:02.251
really that easy. We're calling this page
the Google I/O home screen page but, you know,

00:33:02.251 --> 00:33:06.460
you can of course create a hierarchy just
as you would with a website and the network's

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.520
just the same; so that's pretty neat. And
so what about events? As you can see we have

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.669
and event down there, but I had a few buttons
in that app if you remember up in the front,

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:19.260
if you've used the app. What do you have to
do with a sort of maybe instrument one of

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.419
these buttons? So let's go back to our layout
here, go find some of the buttons, where are

00:33:22.419 --> 00:33:29.260
the buttons? Here we go. So here's the scheduled
button, here's the map button. I already have

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.980
the scheduled buttons set up so let's set
up the map button. All I need to do is create

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.870
an on-click method for the button. This is
probably something you should have for your

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:43.640
button already, I guess, but we don't in this
case. So, we're going to call it on map click,

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:51.490
so that's good to go there. And then I just
go back here and we're going to create the

00:33:51.490 --> 00:34:04.660
on map click method. Good to do down here.
It should look pretty similar in the schedule

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.660
one. And we're just going to say, "tracker.trackeven".
These again are those three levels of hierarchy

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.190
that I was mentioning before. This is going
to be a click event for a button and we're

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:14.659
going to call this the map button. So you're
going to also assign a value to any event

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:18.759
which is, again, if you actually have transactions
happening, it's pretty neat because it will

00:34:18.759 --> 00:34:22.339
sort of add them all up and you can compare
them by the different sort of categories of

00:34:22.339 --> 00:34:27.711
events which are driving more or fewer sort
of dollars or points or whatever they are

00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:31.359
in your app. So, I think that is all good
to go, don't forget the semicolon, and let's

00:34:31.359 --> 00:34:47.200
see what happens. Okay, we'll save, just a
second. We'll go back to our emulator, and

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:59.559
here it comes. So there we go, we got a second
ad impression which is great. I can just go

00:34:59.559 --> 00:35:05.489
in here and button mash on my little buttons
here, and those are now going to start sort

00:35:05.489 --> 00:35:09.729
of triggering these events and sending them
back up to Google Analytics. So, that's really

00:35:09.729 --> 00:35:15.150
all there is to it. So let's see what this
actually looks like. Go back to Google Analytics

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:23.269
here. I'm going to log in to my demo account,
so I have to sort of do the Julia Child thing

00:35:23.269 --> 00:35:27.450
here. Those clicks I just made aren't going
to show up for a few hours, so I did a few

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:34.269
yesterday to see if all the caps rollout.
So here we go. So there we go. Look at that.

00:35:34.269 --> 00:35:45.819
Just yesterday we had a bunch of visits and
we can sort of zoom in on that. Awesome slide.

00:35:45.819 --> 00:35:50.219
There we go. So we had five visits yesterday,
we've had 11 visits today, and it's really

00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:54.089
easy to sort of see what's happening. As you
can see, all of my traffic here is direct

00:35:54.089 --> 00:35:58.650
traffic, because we've just been coming straight
to the app from that emulator. But if I were

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:03.190
to push those apps out to the Android market,
you can start to see those sorts of referral

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:08.709
track or, you know, splits right here in your
traffic sources which is pretty neat. As you

00:36:08.709 --> 00:36:13.259
can see, today we only have the one page in
our little silly demo app, but, you know,

00:36:13.259 --> 00:36:19.529
we've got 60 unique views on that page in
the last day and 50% bounce rate, that's so

00:36:19.529 --> 00:36:23.560
great. But you can, you know, start to dig
in with all of these things in, you know,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:30.750
just a plethora of report the Analytics offers.
So what happen with events? Oh, there's events.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:33.969
I can also just get a really easy roll up
of the events that have occurred. We actually

00:36:33.969 --> 00:36:39.530
had 46 yesterday and 20 today so far which
is, you know, exciting, though I don't know

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:44.119
if I like the slope of that graph. I can look
in here and you can see the all 66 of those

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:48.729
events were actually, you know, part of a
button which is intended and we can go down

00:36:48.729 --> 00:36:52.390
and just break it down by the schedule map
in sessions button you can see, you know,

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:57.609
how many events were triggered? How many events
were unique per event type? And, you know,

00:36:57.609 --> 00:37:00.849
how much value you're going getting. You can
see that the schedule button is actually driving

00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:04.969
a lot more value than the map one in this
case. So, whatever, you know, value you may

00:37:04.969 --> 00:37:09.140
ascertain from your app, you can start to
understand that using events. It's very flexible

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:14.249
and a great way to sort of get those sort
of second order insights into what people

00:37:14.249 --> 00:37:18.680
are actually doing rather than just looking
at your pages which is really cool. And, you

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:25.599
know, that's really about it, the Analytics
SDK is very easy to get going, you just go

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:31.640
to code.google.com/mobileanalytics/api/mobileanalytics.
Excuse me, and we have all of what I've shown

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:40.999
you today documented so you can get set it
right up. So, let's go back to the presentation.

00:37:40.999 --> 00:37:45.779
And yeah, that's actually all there is to
it, google.com/mobileads. I think you've guys

00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:50.269
have seen a lot today, that's where you can
get signed up fro ad words, or Adsense for

00:37:50.269 --> 00:37:56.180
mobile apps. There is a sort of approval process
for AdSense accounts just because we will

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.359
end up, you know, paying you guys money, so
hope you can understand that. And the same

00:37:59.359 --> 00:38:05.969
thing for AdWords if you want to get set up,
you just sort of enter into the account sign

00:38:05.969 --> 00:38:13.680
up process and it's very easy. Analytics is
even easier, you just go to code.google.com/api/mobileanalytics

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.229
and you can download the SDKs for iPhone or
Android today. Jim and I are going to be hanging

00:38:19.229 --> 00:38:23.690
around after the presentation; I think it
might be time for some T-shirts.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.760
&gt;&gt; KELM: Yeah, we've got T-shirts in the back.
We've also got flyers.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.059
&gt;&gt; FINNE: This is our colleague Loren right
by the back left back door who has T-shirts

00:38:29.059 --> 00:38:33.829
and flyers if you're interested in signing
up for AdSense. We thought we'd end a little

00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:38.009
bit early today because it is the end of the
session and you guys are obviously eager for

00:38:38.009 --> 00:38:41.790
happy hours. So thank you so much, and have
a great trip home those of you who had made

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:42.390
it out here.
&gt;&gt; KELM: Thanks everyone.
