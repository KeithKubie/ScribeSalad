00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.860
We're talking about ancient human hearing!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.290
We're talking about ancient human hearing!

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:13.080
We're talking!! oh forget it.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.420
listeners and friends
We've spent a lot of time on DNews talking

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.130
about language and the power of spitting flow
atcha, but no matter how sick your flow, if

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.280
we hadn't evolved hearing, it would be lost
on you.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.320
Hearing is one of our essential traits, and
according to a study from a Jan 2006 issue

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.290
of Nature we got our auditory adroitness from
fish gills!

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.460
Our ears have tiny bones which translate waves
of energy pushing through the air from wave

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.829
energy to mechanical energy, then fluid energy,
before conversion to chemical signals for

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.160
processing in the brain.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.719
But, 370 million years ago, a fish called
Eusthenopteron [Yoos-then-opter-on], had a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.180
small bone which had a kink that blocked the
gill opening, and its descendant, Panderichthys

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.040
[Pander-ick-this] had a slightly wider version
of that bone, called a spiracle.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.579
Spiracles allow the fish to breathe air above
the surface while it remains underwater (which

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.939
in itself is incredible), but scientists think
the spiracle is the missing link between fish

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.009
gills and land-animal hearing!

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.810
There are, of course, a number of evolutionary
steps in-between; for example, the hyomandibular

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.899
[hi-oh-mandib-u-lar] bone which became the
stapes -- a stirrup-shaped bone in the middle

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.329
ear -- evolved from a bone that used to brace
the lower jaw of sharks and early jawed fishes.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.729
Because of these tiny bones and slow adaptations,
we slowly adapted our own hearing.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.659
According to an old study from the Journal
of the Acoustical Society of America: generally

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.350
speaking, mammals have larger audible fields
than birds and reptiles, mostly because of

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.359
our ability to hear higher frequencies thanks
to adaptations of the middle ear around 40

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.920
million years ago in the Eocene era.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.789
Human hearing isn't the best in the natural
world, but it's not the worst either.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.200
Thanks to our close-set ears, we can hear
high-frequency sounds; a great adaptation

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.029
for hearing brief high-frequency noises -- like
the rustles made by predators in the woods.

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:00.130
Just a guess.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.539
As time wore on we eventually got to the 2.1-million-year-old
Australopithecus Africanus, an ancient human

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.539
ancestor.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.709
This hominin had an earlier version of our
hearing systems, and a new study in September

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.709
2015's Science Advances, scanned the skulls
of this and Paranthropus robustus and used

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.650
the scans to reconstruct a computer model
of early human ears.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.569
Turns out, Australopithecus' and Paranthropus'
physiologies allowed them to hear very differently

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.849
than modern humans.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.941
Back then, we were more sensitive to Ts, Ks,
Fs and Ss in the 1 to 3 kHz range, because

00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:39.520
savannahs don't have things for sound to bounce
off of!

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.780
The researchers think they would have been
able to hear these hard consonant sounds short-range

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.769
across open areas, which makes sense because
these ancient humans were all about that savannah

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.769
life.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.299
On top of that, Australopithecus and Paranthropus
were better at 1-3kHz than we humans OR our

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.860
primate cousins are now.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.749
By comparison, today, modern humans speak
in the 1kHz to 6kHz range, something these

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.099
ancient humans wouldn't have been good at
at all.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.219
A 2011 study in the journal Science, used
a mathematical model to trace DNA evidence

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:13.969
of human migration and language development,
and found verbal communication did likely

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.430
originate in Africa; probably in the form
of click language.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.120
Hard consonant languages could be 100,000
years old!

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.580
What if, as we left the forests and savannahs
of Africa, our hearing changed too, and we

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.319
evolved language to match that evolution!

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.489
That would explain why we speak in that 1-6
range today, but these ancient people use

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.650
the click languages and spoke in hard consonants,
because it was easier to hear.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:04:13.370
Science is still trying to figure this out,
but what do you think?
