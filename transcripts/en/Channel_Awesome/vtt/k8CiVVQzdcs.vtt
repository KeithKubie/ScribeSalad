00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.220
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.060
Hilary Swank.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.200
You may remember her from Boys
Don't Cry,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.800
Million Dollar Baby,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.700
and my personal favorite dramatic
performance followed by death.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.920
Hilary Swank (NC impression): Yay, I'm finally a complete person.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.180
[dies]

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.660
NC: Yes, it's true that Hilary Swank certainly dies in a lot of movies,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.600
but it's very rare that an entire movie dies

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.720
even before you pronounce the title.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.380
Let's try it.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.980
The Next Karate--

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.180
[someone off-screen groans and collapses on the floor]

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.280
NC: You see?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.080
NC: Now some of you might be saying

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.960
"What? When do they make another Karate Kid movie?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.240
I don't remember that."

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.040
Well, if you take your copy of Karate Kid Part III

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.020
and simply turn it around...

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.020
Bingo! Karate Kid 4!

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.600
NC: That's right, this film is so bad that it couldn't even get its own DVD release.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.740
It had to be teamed up with the other piece of shit Karate Kid sequel

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.240
just to see the light of day.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.800
NC: So what's wrong with one of Hilary
Swank's very first movies?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.860
Well, let's go over a little history first.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.520
The first Karate Kid came out in 1984.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820
It started Ralph Macchio as Daniel-san

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.400
and that guy from Happy Days (Pat Morita)
as Mr. Miyagi.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.980
It's now sort of a standard story.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.260
It's about a kid who gets beat up by bullies
and this over-the-top teacher,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.700
so he learns karate
from a quirky but wise karate master.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.580
His methods are strange, but
effective,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.660
and at the end the kid finally proves himself

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.440
by fighting against the bullies
in tournament.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.200
Standard, but enjoyable.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.080
The sequel was a little different.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.080
Miyagi and Daniel go to Okinawa,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.400
so Miyagi can visit his dying father 
and make amends with his angry brother.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.700
It wasn't as good as the first, but it wasn't half bad.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.240
Even though it had its schmaltzy moments, 
it continued the story.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.520
It wasn't just a cheap retread of the original.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.260
That was left for the third movie, 
and this one flat out sucked.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.040
It was the same story as the first one
—same character, same plot threads—

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.860
the only thing that was different was instead of one hammy over-the-top villain, you had two,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.280
who put all their business aside for revenge.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.780
Literally! They say that!

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.700
Terry Silver: Margaret, I'm going to be working full-time on this from now on. Full-time.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.040
For the next few weeks my business is strictly revenge.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.440
Margaret: Everything is in place, sir.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.020
NC: Who the hell talks like that?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.640
Nobody calls up their secretary and says

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.420
"Oh, by the way, cancel my meetings, I'm going to have a diabolical plan to destroy my archnemesis.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.320
Thanks, you're a doll."

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.000
NC: Same set-up, same climax,
 what a load of shit-shit platter.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.080
So you think that would be the worst Karate Kid movie, right?

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.180
Well, just a mere five years later they tried to cash in
with another karate chop to my nuts

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.920
in their latest and final sequel, The Next Karate Kid.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.440
Well, I think I've built up the shitstorm long enough.
Let's take a look.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.160
NC: So it starts off with Mr. Miyagi accepting some sort of army unit citation,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.400
along with the wife of one of his old army buddies, Louisa.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.400
They catch up on old times, talk about... 
 Chinese food or something,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.040
when we're introduced to the karate brat herself.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.760
Louisa: Julie, this is Mr. Miyagi.
He was a friend of your grandfather.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.860
Julie: Hi.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.560
NC: Hey, show some respect!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.840
He came all the way from Karate Kid Part III for this!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.540
Louisa: I want you to talk to him.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.520
Julie: You invited him here, you talk to him.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.020
Louisa: Where are you going?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.900
SUSAN!

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.520
Julie: My name is Julie! My mother's name was Susan!

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.420
She was killed in a car accident with my father
and they're both dead!

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.320
[drum roll]

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.680
NC: And the award for
"Worst Exposition Ever to be Uttered in a Movie" is...

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.940
The Next Karate Kid!

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.180
[applauds]

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.960
You suck!

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.300
NC: I mean... WOW! That was just painful!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.660
How much more forced could you possibly get?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.240
Julie: My name is Julie! My mother's name was Susan!

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.080
She was killed in a car accident with my father
and they're both dead!

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.720
[Spaceballs]
Dark Helmet: Everybody got that?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.160
NC: So where does angry troubled Julie sneak off to in the middle of the night?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.420
Well, I'm sure she's part of a gang or something
or some sort of criminal drug ring

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.080
or some kind of illegal underground fighting or... something else

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.260
to make the real payoff look unbelievably stupid.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.920
She breaks into her school —which is ironic,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.880
because most kids trying to break OUT of school—

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.860
and she spends her time feeding a bird.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.660
NC: Oh, no!

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.820
NC: Really? This is the height of her troubled teendom?

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.160
Feeding a hawk with a damaged wing?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.660
Unless she's gotta use it for cockfighting,
that's not very impressive.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.900
But Boston's doughiest arrive on the scene
as they try to stop her illegal bird feeding.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.160
NC: I love this scene. Watch.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.460
Cop #1: Look out!

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.900
NC: Yeah, shine a light on the people
you don't want to find you

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.660
and then throw it at them
so that you can't see where you're going.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.800
Now, technically you could argue
that she's trying to distract them away from the bird,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.060
but... why doesn't she just drop it off 
at 'em back to begin with?

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.900
What is she, Karate Kid, M.D.?

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.060
I mean, it makes no sense.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.880
Cop #2: Come on!

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.360
[chuckles]

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.480
NC: What, they just stop? Who sent these guys?

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.880
They're about as fit as a morbidly obese fiddle!

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.440
NC (as Cop #2): Don't make me run!
I'm filled with pork chops and syrup!

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.100
NC: So, in a sort of strange foreign exchange program,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.360
Susan (Louisa) leaves Boston to go to California,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.280
while Mr. Miyagi leaves
California to look after Julie...

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.380
makes sense to me.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.980
Mr. Miyagi: Miyagi pick up you here this afternoon,
okay, Julie-san?

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.600
Mr. Miyagi: Sayonara!

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.740
NC: Gee, I wonder if this is the villain.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.020
NC: Yeah?

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.140
NC: Yeah?

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.260
NC: Just because you can hold on a shot 
doesn't mean you should!

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.800
NC: Cut!

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.800
Ned: Morning, Julie.

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:49.349
NC: So she's approached by one of the bad guys,
who, of course, you can tell as a bad guy

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.860
because we always wears a black shirt.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.680
Ned: It can get you into little trouble.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.660
Or I could pick you up tomorrow night

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.860
and take you down to the docks.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.020
You've been to the docks, haven't you, Julie?

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.860
Julie: Dream on.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.340
Ned: Hey!

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.080
Most girls in this school like me.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.220
Now you're lucky to get an invitation.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.480
NC: Typical teen love story.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.560
Boy meets girl, boy challenges girl to fight on docks...

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.660
something's not right about that.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.840
NC: So it turns out that psycho kid is working
for the strange sort of school security

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.920
called Alpha Elite.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.280
They're nice people
if you compare them to the Third Reich.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.620
Dugan: Some kid drops a candy wrapper,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320
you make them pick it up and eat it.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.740
NC: That's both... odd and cruel.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.060
NC: Their coach, who is actually
named Colonel Dugan,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.420
partakes in normal after-school activities,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.200
like punching his students in the face, 
kicking them in the gut and just flat out choking them.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.400
Dugan: When the enemy's weakest,
that's when you destroy them.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.580
NC: Aaaaand his ass will be fired.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.120
NC: But for the lazy convenience of the story
let's just go with it.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.120
One of the students is named Eric,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.380
♫ who Julie has a crush on! ♫

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.220
Ned: Hey, Colonel Dugan told me 
to take Julie Pierce to her next class.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.820
Any problems?

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.640
Eric: No.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.900
Ned: No? Good.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.000
Don't forget she's mine.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.700
NC (as Ned): She's mine to...

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.160
beat and/or make my girlfriend.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.440
Eric finds out about Julie's first-degree bird feeding

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.800
and so he toys with her about
whether or not he's gonna tell anyone.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.540
Julie: If anyone finds out about Angel,
they're gonna take her away.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.860
Eric: Is that what you call her? Angel?

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.940
How do you know she's a girl?

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.500
Julie: Will you just answer the question?

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.000
Look, I'm not getting out of this car 
until you tell me what you're gonna do.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.200
Eric: Fine.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.760
NC (as Eric): This is how I kidnapped 
all my other girlfriends, so go ahead.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.700
Eric: Hey, do you like my car?

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.480
It's an Oldsmobile 442.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.240
Julie: It's just a car.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.760
Eric: "It's just a car"?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.940
Does Michael Jordan just play basketball?

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.400
NC: Yes! Have you seen him play baseball?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.460
NC: So after they form some sort of bond, I guess,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.920
Mr. Miyagi and Julie find that
they don't quite get off on the right foot.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.520
Mr. Miyagi: Miyagi also talk to people, your teachers,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.520
bring home homework you miss for three weeks.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.240
Julie: Don't order me around.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.840
I told you this morning I know where I'm going in my life

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.100
and I don't need any math problems to get there.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.740
NC (as Mr. Miyagi) How about this math problem?

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.180
What does one fist plus your face equal?

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.380
Mr. Miyagi: Julie-san!

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.740
Julie: Will you just stay out of my life?

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.580
Stop telling me what to do!

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.680
Mr. Miyagi: Not try tell you nothing,
try teach you something.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.520
Julie: Teach me? Look at you!

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.960
You can't even speak English!

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.560
NC: Ow! Bitch! That is Mr. Miyagi!

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.560
You do not diss Mr. Miyagi!

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.280
He's like Yoda; he could snap his fingers,
and your brain when fucking explode!

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.780
[car horn]

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.260
NC: Nail that whore!

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.860
NC: There, now. You see?
It's not nice to mess with Mr. Miyagi.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.780
God tried to smoke you. Hope you're happy.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.700
Mr. Miyagi: You not hurt?

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.980
Julie: I said I was OK!

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.160
Nc (as Julie): I'm gonna run back into the house
I was originally running away from!

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.700
Julie: Go ahead, do what my grandmother does.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.160
Tell me I made another mistake.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.680
"Julie, you're so thoughtless,
Julie, you lost your temper again".

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.220
NC (as Mr. Miyagi): Okay, then what?

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.660
Mr. Miyagi: Julie-san, Miyagi not need say nothing.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.480
Julie: You're not gonna say anything? learn what jump into Tiger

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.480
Mr. Miyagi: Where you learn that?

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.680
Julie: Learn what?

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.420
Mr. Miyagi: Jump into tiger position
when car almost hit you.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.480
NC: So she tells him that 
her father used to teach her karate,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.380
which is funny because Mr. Miyagi used to 
teach her father kara— Hey, wait a minute!

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.180
Mr. Miyagi: Anger no bring them back.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.760
Julie: It wasn't right that they were killed.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.360
Mr. Miyagi: Death not fair to anyone.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.820
But, still, we must live our lives.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.300
Julie: I used to see them so bright in my mind, so clear.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.100
Now all I have are these photographs.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.620
NC (as Mr. Miyagi): Look, I'm running out 
of the fortune cookie sayings.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.820
Can we just cut to the sports montage?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.320
Julie: I thought maybe you could give me a few lessons.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.960
Mr. Miyagi: You pay Miyagi,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.360

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.300
Julie: Let's start right now.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.260
Mr. MiyagI: Good. First we wax the car.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.900
This hand wax on...

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.560
NC: Oh, here we go a—

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.800
Julie: Forget it, I'm not waxing anybody's car.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.460
NC: gain...

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.560
Mr. Miyagi: Ah, but first we wax the car ,
and we work the engine.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.880
Julie: You know what? I don't think
you know anything about girls.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.760
NC (as Julie): I'm gonna be a boy from now on,
nobody will take that the wrong way.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.440
Mr. Miyagi: Boys easier.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.000
NC: So she sees past the "wax on, wax off" bull-dookey,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.300
But Miyagi instead hires her on to
be a babysitter next door.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.300
Julie: Hey! Hey!

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.640
NC: And three dead children later,
Julie has learned a valuable lesson.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.080
Mr. Miyagi: Babysitting some time good exercise
for karate student, Julie-san.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.200
Julie: Well, then do I learn
how to break boards and stuff like that?

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.600
Mr. Miyagy: Why break boards? What boards do to you?

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.060
NC (as Julie): Hey, a board was driving the car
that killed my family, okay?

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.620
NC: So she breaks out again
for her [gasps] bird feeding,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.320
as it turns out there's a few friends waiting for her.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.500

Ned: Julie... what's going on?

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.060
NC (as Ned): We're gonna bust you for
breaking into the school,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.320
even though we're technically
 breaking into the school to bust you.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.380
NC: But Julie escapes,
 as the tight shirt boys track her down.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.940
Ned: There's no way out, Julie!

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.900
Let's just talk!

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.140
Let's try to be friends, Julie!

even through they're hired to protect it.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.440
God, these guys make no sense.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.640

It's not a damn gas bomb!

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.340
Ned: I'll see you at the docks!

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.820
NC: So Julie gets in trouble again
and is kicked out of school for two weeks.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.000
So Mr. Miyagi decides to take this time

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.540
to take her to some monks
to teach her the true ways of karate.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.060
But before they get there,
they have to go through a few more stock a-holes

but I guess I'll take it.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.840
Julie: That was great, Mr. Miyagi!

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.740
Mr. Miyagi: Not great. 
Miyagi always look for a way not to fight.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.340
Miyagi hate fighting.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.860
NC (as Mr. Miyagi): And yet somehow
I do it in all four films.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.020
Bad luck, I guess.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.540
NC: So they get to the monastery or...
whatever the hell this place is,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.400
as Miyagi tries to teach Julie her first move.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.000

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.140
when she suddenly spots a cockroach.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.240
Julie: What?

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.580
What's the problem?

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.620
Mr. Miyagi: Within monastery walls

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.720
nothing is ever killed.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.220
Julie: What a stupid rule.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.420

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.980
Julie: What are you doing?

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.020
Mr. Miyagi: Miyagi don't live in monastery, Julie-san,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.720
but still respect all living things.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.040
NC (as Mr. Miyagi): Now, if you will excuse me,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.520
there's a fly I have to crush with my chopsticks.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.560
NC: So after the HORRIFIC attempt at cockroach murder

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.620
they decide to eat separately from Julie,

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.280
afraid that her Nike of Doom
will harm yet another innocent animal.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.260
NC (as Monk #1): Cockroach killer.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.140
NC (as Monk #2): Whore.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.000
NC (as Monk #3): Slut!

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.300
NC (as Monk #4): I do not know you.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.940
NC: But it's OK,
because she brings a mantis into the monastery,

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.600
and I guess that makes everything better somehow.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.740
Julie: Sorry I tried to kill the cockroach.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.940
Look.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.200

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.600
AHH! A mantis!

I hate fucking mantises!

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.060
NC: So the training continues
as she is taught to fight obstacles without any vision.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.440
Julie: Come on, Mr. Miyagi!
How can I block an attack if I can't see?

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.760

against bags and catcher's mitts

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.480
until they finally decide she's ready to leave,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.900
but not before one last bit of
bullshit that they have to go through.

NC: So she finally gets to go back to school,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.080

that maybe it's time to let the hawk go.

Maybe if you believe,

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.960
Angel believe too.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.840

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.860
If she flies, then she was ready to fly.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.860
If she falls...

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.180
then she was a witch.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.860

the latest dance moves,

Julie: How'd you know my size?

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.980
Mr. Miyagi: That was very difficult part.

and make their way home.

or, at least, the movie thinks there's no time to explain,

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.840
as the bad guys challenge Eric to a...

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.840
duel, I guess.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:39.520
Where?

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.740
Where else? The docks!

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.980
Finally we get to see these damn docks.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.240
They've been hyped up so much!

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.920
Ned: I didn't think you were gonna show!

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.720
Dugan: Remember the bullring, McGowen?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.360
Light it.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.040
Nc: What the-? They blew up a car?!

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.360
What is with these people? It's is school security,
not fuckin' gangland!

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.080
Dugan: Now it's payback time.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.640
NC: Okay, did anyone do
a background check on that guy?

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.660
Dugan: Finish him off.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.340
NC: IT'S SCHOOL SECURITY!

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.720
YOU WRITE... HALL PASSES
 AND SEND PEOPLE TO LUNCH!

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.460
WHERE DOES IT SAY MURDER IS PART OF THE JOB?!

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.020
Dugan: What are you all looking at?
What do you think I've been training you for?

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.720
NC (as a student guard): Manslaughter, of course.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.480
NC: This looks like a job
for a teenage girl and an old Asian man!

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.860
Mr. Miyagi: Come. We go.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.320
Ned: What? What, are you kidding me?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.020
Julie: Lemme fight him!

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:38.520
Eric: No.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.580
Ned: You wanna fight me?

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.300
Mr. Miyagi: No fighting.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.800
Ned: She wants to fight me!

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.300
Julie: Mr. Miyagi...

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.480
if I'm ever gonna repect myself, I have to do this.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.760
Eric: No, no.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.480
Mr. Miyagi: Julie-san right. Now is time.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:53.960
NC: Wow.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.040
That took a lotta coaxing.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.720
NC (as Julie): "Mr. Miyagi, wanna fight him!"

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.220
NC (as Mr. Miyagi) "No."

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.160
NC (as Julie): "But I really want to!"

00:18:59.160 --> 00:18:59.860
NC (as Mr. Miyagi): Good point.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.640
NC (as Julie): *karate noises*

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.220
Mr. Miyagi: All over, Julie-san.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.820
Dugan: What are you talking about?

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.820
The war is not over because one battle's lost!

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.200
NC: What war? Who are you? Where did you come from?

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.080
Dugan: It's not over.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.080
Mr. Miyagi: Then we finish.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.600
NC: Y'know, for a guy that doesn't like fighting,
he sure does do it a lot.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:36.760
[epic karate fighting]

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.340
NC (as Mr. Miyagi): I'm Mr. Miyagi, beyotch!

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.300
Mr. Miyagi: Time put your lights out.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.600
NC: That's right, Mr. Miyagi! Blow him away!

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.600
[blows at Dugan]

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.540
NC: Not quite what I had in mind, but OK!

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.980
[Miyagi wins!]

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.500
[Blowality!]

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.120
Julie: We kicked some butt.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.020
Mr. Miyagi: Fighting not good,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.620
but if must fight,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.340
win.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.100
NC: So I have to give the movie some credit.
It's nice enough not to have an epilogue.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.580
It just sorta stops, like,

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.360
"Okay, we've tortued you long enough. You can go now".

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.980
NC: And thank God too, because it turns out
The Next Karate Kid was also the last Karate Kid.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.600
NC: They never made another movie sequel,
and thank heavenly Jesus,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.500
because these films simply got worse and worse
and worse.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.060
NC: But in all honesty, to the film's credit,

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.220
it did try, online audience. It did try.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.780
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.980
NC: Okay, one more!

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.960
[The Empire Strikes Back]
Yoda: Do. Or do not. There is no try.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.480
NC: Hee-hee-hee, I love that Muppet.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.100
Bye!
