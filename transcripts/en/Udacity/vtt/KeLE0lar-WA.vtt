00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the answer here is 1 or true,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and you can see that as follows:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So X1 is equal to 1, not X2 is equal to 0,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so 1 or 0 is equal to 1,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so this whole part here is equal to 1,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and actually X3 is also equal to 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So we have that this whole part here is equal to 1,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
X3 is equal to 1, and 1 or 1 is 1 again,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so this whole part here is equal to 1.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And over here we have not X1, which is 0 or X2,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but X2 is true or 1,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and so the whole thing  0 or 1 is equal to 1,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and so we have 1 and 1,

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which evaluates to 1.
