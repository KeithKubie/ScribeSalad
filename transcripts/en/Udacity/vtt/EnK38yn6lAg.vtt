00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.180
Okay. So, Michael, I want to go into some algorithms,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.710
or at least some classes of algorithms but before we do

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.270
that, I think it's useful to really ask a very simple

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.880
question, which is exactly how hard is this problem. And to

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.790
help answer that we're going to do a quiz, because you

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.980
like quizzes, and I'm going to define my terms just a

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.320
little bit better but maybe not that much better. So, here's

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.909
the quiz. You've got a set of data with N features.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.040
And your goal is to find a subset of M

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.220
features. Where the size of that subset is no greater than

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.570
the original subset. Which makes sense. The original set of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.780
features in which makes sense. Okay? And that's it. And so,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.580
what I want you to be able to tell me

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.780
is given this generic problem of starting with N features and

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.970
finding a subset of M features How long does it

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.542
take in terms of time complexity to do. Is it linear,

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:55.384
quadratic, polynomial, or exponential nm?

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:57.694
&gt;&gt; Polynomial includes linear quadratic so you mean

00:00:57.694 --> 00:01:00.220
sort of of polynomial that's not linear quadratic.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.930
&gt;&gt; That's right and I mean quadratic as not linear.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.599
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.490
&gt;&gt; And I mean exponential that's not polynomial or quadratic or linear.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.160
&gt;&gt; It's not.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.240
&gt;&gt; Well it could be. You could have 2 to the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.830
n plus n squared for example, times 0. You could do it.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.680
Don't mess with me man. Okay, so you got the problem?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.990
&gt;&gt; Just to make sure I understand. So, so, can

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.060
you draw like a rectangle? Like our input space x?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.430
&gt;&gt; Okay. So we've got some input space x. This is a rectangle.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.750
&gt;&gt; And it's got n features, so those are like the columns.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.650
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.630
&gt;&gt; Alright. And we're going to select a subset

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.900
m of those n features. So we'll have

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.040
a like, a skinnier matrix, but not shorter.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.920
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Right.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.635
&gt;&gt; Alright, so and, can I choose any way I want to to define what

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:54.900
subsets I like better than which other subsets,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.300
because then I can do this really fast.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.830
&gt;&gt; So what we're going to do is there's going to be some function,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.400
let's just call it F, okay, which given a set of features,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.650
return a score. Oh, that looks sort of familiar.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.848
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And this function may be arbitrarily complicated, it

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:15.950
may be really simple, but you don't know what it is.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.230
&gt;&gt; Oh. Alright. Then I think, I think I can answer this question now.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's go.
