00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.323
Female Voiceover: The
false mirror presents us

00:00:05.323 --> 00:00:08.493
with this enormous, lashless eye.

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:11.872
Its iris is very and implausibly filled

00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:15.152
with this luminous cloud-swept blue sky,

00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:20.304
and then right at dead
center is this matte black,

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:23.662
opaque disk that doubles as its pupil.

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:25.672
Male Voiceover: Before cleaning,

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:29.798
the pupil was very shiny
and glossy and refelctive.

00:00:29.798 --> 00:00:31.897
Once the vanish was removed,

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:35.266
the black became very soft and deep,

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:39.507
so it really does become
the focus of the painting,

00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:44.008
and you could also see more
details in the clouds in the sky,

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.623
also details like the highlights
in the corner of the eye

00:00:48.623 --> 00:00:52.155
became much more apparent and visceral.

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:54.207
The white that forms the highlight

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.908
on the white of the eye is in zinc,

00:00:57.908 --> 00:01:02.439
so it's a cooler white than the
lead white used in the clouds,

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.014
which are softer and warmer.

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.041
We can actually distinguish these

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:11.215
in x-rays images that
we have of the painting.
