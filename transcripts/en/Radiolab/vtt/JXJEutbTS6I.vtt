1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.630
Alright. Should we get, should we, yeah, hold on. I'll pull my daughter down.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.930
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I am Robert Krulwich. Hi, today just for gigs,

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:12.660
we're going to start in a park.

4
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.070
Yeah, so let me set the scene please.

5
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.000
A couple of days ago we gathered a bunch of Radiolab listeners in McCarren Park

6
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.480
in Brooklyn. You guys are amazing for coming out today. Thank you so much.

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.980
This is a random set of listeners. Random celebrities showed up.

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.190
Whoever's showed up as a result of a few tweets and Facebook postings got about

9
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:35.970
70 people in just a little bit more. It's a super cold day.

10
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:39.660
This park was covered in snow and we had brought everybody there to help us make

11
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:42.900
some noises that we would use in this segment, like

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.630
gasping or

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.720
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

14
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.080
<v 0>chanting and you'll, it was amazing. You'll hear them throughout the hour.</v>

15
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.970
But when got people got there,

16
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:56.060
we hadn't actually explained to them why we wanted them to make these noises.

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.100
So just to start things off, I just asked them a couple of questions.

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.720
Okay, so a questions at the moment. Take versatile use. Ask,

19
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:07.250
how do you guys like football?

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.870
Uh, how long have you guys hate football?

21
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.840
This is not a shocking revelation. No.

22
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.840
[inaudible] football will disappear in the next 10 years

23
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.440
with these anti football sentiments.

24
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:33.930
I believe they say more about you and I and our fans. Then again, although I,

25
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.721
in fairness,

26
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:38.830
I mean there are a lot of people who I would even consider myself a a,

27
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.320
I watched for the ads. Okay? Whether you watch for the ads like you are,

28
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:48.640
whether you love the game like I happened to you or lows it like some others,

29
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.440
football right now

30
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.630
<v 1>it's huge. It is through the roof.</v>

31
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.590
97 and a half million views.

32
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.400
Sunday's game was the most watched event in American television history.

33
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.670
Superbowl Sunday had become a national holiday.

34
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.470
<v 0>It's massive. Massively popular. That's not the same as well.</v>

35
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.350
I get to think it's massively interesting.

36
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.280
<v 2>Also, here's the way to think about it. Sally Jenkins, author of the book, uh,</v>

37
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.410
that real all Americans, she puts it this way.

38
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:24.380
Imagine a thousand years from now, maybe 10,000,

39
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:26.510
maybe a hundred thousand years from now, we're all gone.

40
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.160
All our history has been forgotten.

41
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:31.250
All the silly trifling games we played in lost to time.

42
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.750
Imagine the future human beings looking back on us. Let's say, you know,

43
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.830
some archeologist goes around digging, they're going to find these really,

44
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:42.080
really huge stadiums.

45
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.940
That's what they're going to find. Okay. Yeah.

46
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.190
And they're going to understand just like we understand about the Greeks,

47
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.140
what was really important to us.

48
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.530
Okay. So here's the thing, Radiolab listeners, we're going to do an entire hour

49
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.420
<v 0>on the game of football</v>

50
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.790
in part because it just seems to me that there are a lot of questions in the air

51
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.900
about football right now about what it really is and what that means about us

52
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.280
and what it might or could or can't become. Am I going to like this? Absolutely.

53
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.180
This, in a way,

54
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.390
this whole hour is for the people like you who really don't care about football.

55
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:22.450
And I am willing to wager that the end, they will care more,

56
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.290
particularly because of this first story which comes from Sally Jenkins who you

57
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.580
just heard. Uh, it comes from her book, the real all Americans. This is a story,

58
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.730
a not about the game as you might think of it now,

59
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.980
but about where it came from.

60
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.250
It didn't come from the people you'd expect. Okay. I'm folding my hands in.

61
00:03:40.251 --> 00:03:42.740
You see here in my lab and I'm going to listen to this. Okay.

62
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.120
You want to get in the three point stance?

63
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.793
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.233
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

65
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.123
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

66
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.820
<v 0>we're ready to begin. And it is a story about the beginning. Well or not quite,</v>

67
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.900
I mean football, football is as old as sort of the Celtic civilizations.

68
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:04.560
I mean you can trace of primal games of, you know,

69
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:08.310
Danish invaders kicking skulls around the shores of England.

70
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.000
I mean that's not a football kick exactly.

71
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.710
But of organized football is really a creation of,

72
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.440
of the 1860s and seventies in this country.

73
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:20.460
It's a post civil war creation comes along, uh,

74
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.440
just really a couple of years after, you know,

75
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.210
the last great conquering armies settle the West.

76
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.780
Basically she says you had these kids whose parents had fought in the civil war

77
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:34.920
and then some of them had gone west to fight the, a Lakota, the Cheyenne,

78
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.100
the wrap over the Apaches. And now those wars are winding down,

79
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.510
which oddly enough created kind of an issue for young men at the time.

80
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.200
If you're a young student, say back east at a fancy school like Harvard,

81
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:50.240
how are you going to prove your own toughness? I mean your older brother, your,

82
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.580
your father, he, they may be fought at Gettysburg. Add a little big one.

83
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.773
What the hell have you done?

84
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.280
<v 3>The American frontier experience was over,</v>

85
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.810
there was this feeling among a lot of intellectuals that um, that um,

86
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.960
American men were losing their masculinity.

87
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:07.060
They were being feminized in a sense.

88
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.770
<v 0>So according to historian David Adams,</v>

89
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.090
you just heard those kids were desperate for opportunities to man up.

90
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.190
There was this cult of money

91
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.080
<v 4>familiness around this time,</v>

92
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.590
<v 0>David and see a bunch of violent sports take off.</v>

93
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.570
And in particular for our purposes, you see these kids at Harvard and Yale

94
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.790
<v 4>getting together and</v>

95
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.930
knocking the snot out of each other in this game that's kind of like rugby,

96
00:05:35.931 --> 00:05:38.360
but just more violent.

97
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.970
<v 0>The game used to be basically brutality.</v>

98
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.490
<v 3>The origin of football was such a profoundly different game.</v>

99
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.060
Write a check close to a and before him historian Dr. Conrad Crane, you know,

100
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:53.760
a first down instead of 10 yards was only five yards.

101
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.190
He had three downs to get five yards and basically all the teams did was sort of

102
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.910
slam into each other and try to move the ball incrementally.

103
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:06.911
It was almost as if every play of the entire game was a goal line stand in the

104
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.640
metaphor people always use when discussing football of course is, is military.

105
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.830
It's the idea of taking land and giving life.

106
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.980
Well the origin of football that was even amplified.

107
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.930
<v 2>There were formations and strategies and that kind of thing,</v>

108
00:06:18.931 --> 00:06:23.540
but it was pure like right out of Napoleon's military playbook. I mean,

109
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.380
where you, you concentrate your force, you know,

110
00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:27.800
shoulder my shoulder next to your shoulder, nick the, his shoulder.

111
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.470
I think it's a lot like you bunch up all the,

112
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.820
all your man and then pierce the other guy's army. Yeah.

113
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.430
That was the basic idea. So you just end up with piles of guys. Yeah.

114
00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:38.400
And inside those piles there's all kinds of things that go on in those scrums.

115
00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:41.280
I mean there's kicking his bite and there's gouging languaging and crotch

116
00:06:41.281 --> 00:06:44.090
kicking and wow, head wrenching.

117
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.800
And I remember we were talking about Harvard boys doing this.

118
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.040
I have to work to imagine that because I think of Harvard and Yale now and I

119
00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:54.120
think of like, I think, yeah, I don't think of it as big guys.

120
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.710
Well at the time they were the, the,

121
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.400
I mean there are all these wonderful stories about these chops that they would

122
00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:00.091
eat for dinner.

123
00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:04.980
I mean they were drinking milk by the gallon and the Ivys were the great power

124
00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:07.650
of the time physically as well as intellectually.

125
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.990
But then along comes the school,

126
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.320
this tiny little school founded in 1879 in the middle of nowhere that if you're

127
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:20.290
a football fan or just a fan of American history kinda changed everything where

128
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:24.540
it was Carlo, Carla was in Pennsylvania. Right. Very close to Gettysburg.

129
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.960
Let's go there. Let's, so, so, so tell me about what is the wind,

130
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.310
does it formed and what was there?

131
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.290
The Carlisle Indian school is formed by a former of,

132
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.140
well actually he was an active military officer at the time named Richard Henry

133
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.130
Pratt, the guy shock of white hair, large nose. Pratt had served gallantly,

134
00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:42.780
quite gallantly in the civil war.

135
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.310
And then he had actually served out West in Oklahoma territory. Uh,

136
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.890
he had fought, uh, American Indians himself.

137
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.610
And it was after winning a lot of those fights, too many of those fights really,

138
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.510
you were talking a 1870s, now that pret had a change of heart and he,

139
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.100
he suddenly became concerned about the very people he had just been fighting.

140
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.330
<v 3>The fact of the matter is that Indians were in very, very desperate situation.</v>

141
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.080
The bison were almost extinct.

142
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:16.250
They were being pushed onto reservations and population fallen to two.

143
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.530
It's almost all time low.

144
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.010
<v 1>Uh,</v>

145
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.060
<v 3>Pratt, um,</v>

146
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.690
and a lot of other policymakers came to the conclusion that something had to

147
00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:27.930
happen fast or Indians would literally become extinct.

148
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.710
They would in fact become the vanishing race.

149
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.660
And so Pratt, um,

150
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.890
<v 2>he comes to Washington with an idea.</v>

151
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.430
His idea was to start a boarding schools specifically for American Indian

152
00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:44.400
children. That was kind of a radical experiment.

153
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.580
<v 3>Children will be taken removed for several years at a time.</v>

154
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.470
They would be stripped of their,

155
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.400
what was called their savage heritage and they would be civilized,

156
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.540
<v 2>I. E. They would be white. It was, it was forcible assimilation.</v>

157
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.590
A Pratt had a slogan, kill the Indian, save the man.

158
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.370
That's Barbara Landis Carlisle Indian school biographer.

159
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.460
We went up to Carlisle to talk with her and her colleague, Cara Curtis,

160
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.820
and they told us that Pratt basically made that pitch, kill the Indian,

161
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.920
save the man, not just to Congress,

162
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:18.390
but directly to American Indian families all over the country. I want your son.

163
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.590
Is that, how does that work?

164
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.090
I want your children because white people are going to keep coming and coming.

165
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:25.620
They want to settle in your lands.

166
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:29.910
They want to take your lands and you need to learn how to deal with these

167
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:34.230
people. So we need to teach your children how to speak English.

168
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.320
We need to teach them how to communicate with the white man so that when the

169
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:40.020
white man comes and tries to get you to sign away the black hills,

170
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.290
you won't fall for it again. And it was a convincing argument.

171
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.170
<v 5>Well, do you know back in those days or you're talking about survival over here?</v>

172
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.950
Would you mind introducing yourself? Okay. My name is Joe American horse.

173
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.210
I'm 79 years old and I'm a grandson of chief American heart.

174
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.040
<v 2>Joe Lives near the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. He's Lakota.</v>

175
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.740
And he told us the story about his grandfather,

176
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.590
who was a famous Lakota chief in the 1890s.

177
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:08.910
His grandpa led a delegation of American Indians to Washington.

178
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.220
<v 5>Well, he went to Washington DC and he, he was down here,</v>

179
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:15.270
but he's a lot of people downer

180
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.900
<v 2>just as his grandpa had this moment where he was just stunned by how many white</v>

181
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:21.310
people there were. His phrase was there like an,

182
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.350
<v 5>and pretty soon they're going to come to the, our area.</v>

183
00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:29.240
So he had the idea of uh, trying to send his kids to school so they can,

184
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.200
uh, inner mingle or you know, intercept or whatever.

185
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.040
<v 2>Basically Joe says his grandpa just had this realization,</v>

186
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.080
<v 5>we can't, we can't go back. We've got to go forward.</v>

187
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.320
<v 2>And it seemed to him Carlisle was the way forward.</v>

188
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.230
So where are we going now? This is our photo archive. As kids are admitted,

189
00:10:50.231 --> 00:10:51.100
here's how it would work.

190
00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:54.880
They would come in and they'd immediately have their picture taken on arrival.

191
00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.160
Then they'd be given an extreme makeover, which would also be photographed.

192
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.013
Okay. Really?

193
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.570
<v 5>Wow. This is Tom Tour Lino. Wow. This is, this is Tom Carlino as you,</v>

194
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.840
as he comes in,

195
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.310
Barbara showed us a picture of a Navajo kid looking maybe 18 years old,

196
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.180
does 1882 this is when he arrived. So he's got kind of dark skin,

197
00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:20.810
high cheekbones in long earrings.

198
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.400
He's wearing elaborate necklace.

199
00:11:22.401 --> 00:11:25.620
It looks like it might be made of bone and he's wrapped in a blanket and then,

200
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.680
and then the, here he is in a suit with clean cut hair. And the second picture,

201
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:34.020
his hair is very short, not long, no blanket swearing,

202
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.020
a three piece suit sitting there with a cro,

203
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:40.340
Fox and a spread collar and a part of here. Wow. It's like in a snapshot.

204
00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:44.180
You have Tom Indian, Tom White Man,

205
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.110
[inaudible] and Sophie Jr American horse,

206
00:11:48.111 --> 00:11:51.830
said his family saw that transformation firsthand and Sophie was there in

207
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.020
Carlisle for five years. And when she came back and she looks like a wind woman,

208
00:11:56.021 --> 00:12:01.020
you know, she had a real tiny waist and a vomit and everything and uh,

209
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.860
she can't speak Lakota.

210
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.390
<v 2>She forgot [inaudible] it. Just think about this for a second.</v>

211
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:11.260
Just think about this. And we spoke with one guy, a professor, Eric Anderson,

212
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.970
who teaches at Haskell. He's also a part Pottawatomie. Just imagine the parents,

213
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:18.430
he says the first time they see their kids,

214
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.460
parents are seeing their students marched around in essentially the uniforms of

215
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.660
what had not very long before for many of the tribes been the uniform or the

216
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:34.180
enemy at the very least.

217
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.870
I think that would be startling.

218
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.890
Ninny case. According to Sally Jenkins,

219
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:44.440
after the kids were re cropped and redressed,

220
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.360
Brett would run them through a bunch of drills and Carlisle was a,

221
00:12:47.361 --> 00:12:51.880
a little military academy and the Indian kids were so unhealthy at first.

222
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:53.680
They had been put on an unfamiliar Diet.

223
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:57.310
They had been sleeping indoors for the first time in their lives and a lot of

224
00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:58.510
them were getting sick. I mean,

225
00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:01.000
we know that in the 39 year history of the school,

226
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.450
at least 200 kids died of disease or poor health or even homesickness.

227
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.970
And so Pratt was constantly trying to get the kids outside and [inaudible] at a

228
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:12.690
certain point he,

229
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.290
he had hired some teachers and Sally thinks that one of those hires,

230
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.960
probably one of the first dormitory masters,

231
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.450
this guy who had formally taught at an Ivy League school,

232
00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:23.770
he showed the Carlisle Indian kids. Yeah.

233
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.180
This game that the kids at Harvard were playing,

234
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.340
maybe he thought it would toughen them up. Who knows? But suddenly

235
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.690
<v 7>they are playing football. Now keep in mind, this is, you know,</v>

236
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.160
at a point pocket 1882 where football's barely a thing.

237
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.140
Not so many schools had teams.

238
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.210
There wasn't such a thing as a head coach back then.

239
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.080
They were volunteer coaches who tended to be students or students with the

240
00:13:45.081 --> 00:13:48.350
Carlisle kids self organize level. The fields start to play.

241
00:13:48.351 --> 00:13:52.580
They even start to scrimmage some kids across town. And at one of those games,

242
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.773
according to Barbara,

243
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.630
Stacy Matlock who was a Pawnee student at Carlisle later became a plenty chief.

244
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.080
He broke his leg

245
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.170
<v 3>playing football and press it. That's it. No more football</v>

246
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.200
<v 2>because in his mind he was trying to civilize these kids and football was doing</v>

247
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:09.034
the opposite.

248
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.643
<v 8>Uh,</v>

249
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.710
<v 3>short time later, since David Adams,</v>

250
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.550
approximately three dozen Carlisle boys came in to Pretz office and they said,

251
00:14:17.551 --> 00:14:18.780
we want to play football.

252
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.500
<v 2>Do we know what they said? Exactly?</v>

253
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.460
<v 3>We do. We don't have, we don't have the exact words,</v>

254
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.010
but Pratt says at one point, he says,

255
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:30.340
while they stood around my desk and I'm quoting him while they stood around my

256
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:35.110
desk, their black eyes intensely watching me, um, he says,

257
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:40.111
the orator gave practically all the arguments in favor of our contending and

258
00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:45.371
outside football and ended up requesting the removal of the embargo.

259
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.170
According to his memoir,

260
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:52.171
Pratt was sort of bowled over by the eloquence and passion of the appeal.

261
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.320
<v 0>So we said, okay, you can play if you do these two things. One, he says,</v>

262
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.950
never slung people who are looking on, we'll say there, that's the Indian of it.

263
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.370
Just see them. They are savages and you can't get it out. Okay.

264
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.240
And the other one was you have to beat the best teams in America.

265
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.170
And at that early point in American football, far and away,

266
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:16.760
the most powerful team was Yale, which brings us to October 24th, 1896.

267
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.080
<v 4>It's, it's a raw fall day in New York. They played in New York.</v>

268
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.990
Yes. At, uh, the old polo grounds, barely.

269
00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:27.940
There was about 4,000 people in the stands,

270
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.610
including a handful of newspaper men,

271
00:15:30.611 --> 00:15:34.840
New York newspaper men knew Jimmy was a big story. How did they publicize it?

272
00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:37.540
What did they say? Well, the newspapers became incredibly intrigued

273
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.920
<v 1>on one side or the undergraduate. She has an old and great university.</v>

274
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.283
<v 9>[inaudible].</v>

275
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.880
<v 1>Hey represents basically the perfection of modern athletics or intellectually</v>

276
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.870
the culture and refinement of the best modern American life. On the other side,

277
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.650
we have originally the real showing on the forest and playing the red skin of

278
00:16:01.651 --> 00:16:04.560
history. Story of war developed over me,

279
00:16:04.561 --> 00:16:07.010
or as the case may be by education,

280
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.540
<v 4>and if you read the newspaper stories,</v>

281
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:13.040
they're written as they're written in this kind of blood curdling shot through

282
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:17.410
with Indian cliches, you know the red skin, they here come the red skins. Right,

283
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.480
right. According to David Adams, in one paper, it was a reference to yodeling.

284
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:25.430
The writer said that then the fans were yodeling in that Indian fashion. I mean,

285
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.940
try to put yourself in the shoes of a New Yorker. In the early 1880s,

286
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.260
your contact with an American Indian was in a wild west show. It was theater.

287
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:33.710
Uh,

288
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.460
and here comes a football game and all of these American Indian kids run onto

289
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:38.294
the field.

290
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.910
And there's literally an instance in one of the first games with [inaudible].

291
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.430
<v 0>Someone in the audience says, well,</v>

292
00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:47.540
they look just like our boys because of course that's what Brad wanted.

293
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.740
Now one thing that was immediately clear to everyone in attendance when they saw

294
00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:55.220
the Carlisle players was that they were physically outmatched.

295
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.310
<v 1>Do you ever have, your weight is</v>

296
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.600
164 a shack 20 pounds by two to one man.

297
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.060
<v 4>And going in is that there'll be an absolute smear job, or at the very least,</v>

298
00:17:04.061 --> 00:17:06.130
the odds are heavily against him. But

299
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.413
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

300
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.690
<v 4>three minutes into the game, in the midst of a big up</v>

301
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.563
[inaudible],

302
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.710
<v 0>a Yalie fumbles the ball. It comes squirting out.</v>

303
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.390
<v 4>Carlisle guy picks it up. Yep. And runs the entire length of the field.</v>

304
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:29.560
63 yards scores the touchdown.

305
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:38.360
<v 0>Now nobody had scored on Yale in seven games. They were furious.</v>

306
00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:40.370
So what they do is they use their bulk,

307
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.200
<v 4>slow,</v>

308
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.200
push the pile down the field twice to take leave.

309
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:49.503
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.030
<v 4>And with three minutes left, yeah.</v>

311
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.620
Lists up 12 to six Carlisle has the ball Carlisle running back charges the pile

312
00:17:57.621 --> 00:18:02.300
in, gets clobbered, falls backwards.

313
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.790
And just as he's about to hit the earth,

314
00:18:04.791 --> 00:18:08.960
he laterals the ball to a teammate who grabs it, runs around the scrum.

315
00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:10.340
The entire length of the field of score.

316
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.820
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

317
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.760
<v 4>Carlisle scores a touchdown that would have tied the game,</v>

318
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.373
<v 1>what</v>

319
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:27.050
<v 2>it's called back by a referee who was a Yale man.</v>

320
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:33.170
Why the call was that the referee claim that a whistle had blown the play dead.

321
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.850
And what was the crowd's reaction? Uh, well they were, they were furious. Yes.

322
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.780
<v 4>Bullying and hooting. Everyone knew it was a terrible miscarriage of justice.</v>

323
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.870
And some of the Carlisle players said, oh, we're gonna Walk Outta here.

324
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.890
We are leaving this game. But according to David at the last moment,

325
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.980
Pri runs down from the stands, comes onto the field. Just wait a second.

326
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:54.320
Wait a second. Wait. Don't forget. [inaudible]

327
00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.100
<v 11>rule number one, be a gentleman.</v>

328
00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:02.110
Pratt did not want this game to end because of their tempers,

329
00:19:02.111 --> 00:19:05.050
even though they'd been wronged by, uh, by that call.

330
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.790
So the Carlisle boys finished the game and when they walk off the field

331
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.280
<v 1>[inaudible],</v>

332
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.050
<v 4>they get a standing ovation. Carlyle wins,</v>

333
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:26.340
incredible respect and renown in the aftermath of the game. In fact,

334
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:29.580
one of the newspaper men after another Carlisle Yale game or something

335
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.660
<v 2>similar happened,</v>

336
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.680
wrote something to the effect of a Carlisle could beat 11 year old men,

337
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:37.290
but they couldn't beat 11 Yale men and a Yale referee.

338
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.473
<v 4>Yes.</v>

339
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.870
<v 2>After the Yale game of 1896, Pratt is committed.</v>

340
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.880
Pratt believes that it's the greatest thing that can happen to his school.

341
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.070
It is an instant way to do what he's been struggling to do for 15 years at the

342
00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:56.731
Carlisle school,

343
00:19:56.731 --> 00:20:00.840
which is to prove the value of these American Indian kids against their white

344
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:05.100
peers, to prove the value or to quit civilize them. Well, both to civilize them,

345
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.660
but also to prove that given education and equal opportunity,

346
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.710
they were the equal of there. Hm. That's interesting. Their white peers.

347
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.640
I mean he was for all of his forcible assimilation methods, which were,

348
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.540
you know, to remain extremely cruel and destructive.

349
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.520
He truly believed in the concept of, of racial equality.

350
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
The complicatedness of Pratt and of the whole Carlisle idea kept smacking us in

351
00:20:33.151 --> 00:20:34.860
the face as we were putting the show together.

352
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:37.830
I mean on the one hand they were clearly students who felt that Carlisle was

353
00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:40.110
prison. Is that Barbara Landis,

354
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:44.460
when she took us on a tour of the grounds of the former Carlisle Indian school,

355
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:48.190
she said that kids would even set fire to the buildings. It's, yeah,

356
00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:52.330
some did burn down, which is kinda typical on Indian campuses.

357
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.700
A lot of fires and burning buildings. Why? Um,

358
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.700
it's a form of resistance on the other head.

359
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.090
<v 1>No, you see,</v>

360
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.200
<v 2>when we started looking around for original archival recordings of some of the</v>

361
00:21:06.201 --> 00:21:09.620
earliest Carlisle players, pretty much the only recording we could find

362
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.900
<v 1>has this tape. We would like for it to be as much of your making is possible,</v>

363
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.790
<v 2>was this oral history with a guy named</v>

364
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.610
<v 1>your name. Your full name is Andrew [inaudible].</v>

365
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:21.043
<v 2>Albert x and dine.</v>

366
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:21.760
<v 1>All right.</v>

367
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.310
<v 2>The interview was done in the early seventies. When he was 88.</v>

368
00:21:24.311 --> 00:21:25.540
He entered the school

369
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.770
<v 1>just before 1899. You were 50 years old.</v>

370
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.580
<v 2>Can't really play you too much of this cause the audio quality is really bad.</v>

371
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.200
But in the interview, Pratt comes

372
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.170
<v 1>r h Prek, Pra, d, G</v>

373
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.970
<v 2>and X. And Diane talks about them with a great deal of affection and gratitude.</v>

374
00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.920
<v 1>We call him the diff father of ending education.</v>

375
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.120
<v 2>We call him the father of Indian education. Yeah.</v>

376
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.560
<v 1>Oh, he was a wonderful man.</v>

377
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.370
<v 2>So he's a tough figure. Pratt, and he's got very mixed legacy. I mean,</v>

378
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:58.170
I like to say Pratt was his country.

379
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:05.180
Whenever you think of him, he was his country. So, okay, so 1896,

380
00:22:05.181 --> 00:22:09.020
he gets the bug, like he sees p football's a good PR. Yes.

381
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.880
What happens next? Well, he, he hires, uh, he begins looking around for coaches,

382
00:22:13.881 --> 00:22:18.650
full time coaches to come in and coach the team. Uh, and he winds up, um,

383
00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.400
with a Cornell Grad, uh, named pop Warner,

384
00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.540
Glenn, Pop Warner. Now,

385
00:22:26.541 --> 00:22:31.220
pop Warner was an interesting guy because this pops right here just to give you

386
00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:35.600
a visual. Whew. Look at him.

387
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.780
And Carrie showed us pictures. It looks Kinda like a Mike Ditka.

388
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.310
If Mike did go ahead. Einstein's hair up pops a little bit of a,

389
00:22:42.311 --> 00:22:47.270
of an outlier case. He's got these Texas roots, he's a bit of a rogue,

390
00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.530
can be kind of vulgar party a little bit.

391
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.610
He liked to gamble really.

392
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.370
And that is exactly what he does in spectacular fashion when he gets to Carlisle

393
00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.850
because pop Warner looks at at his squad and he realizes that,

394
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.860
sure they're fast, they got heart,

395
00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:06.730
but they're underweight and they're small wasted wall. You know,

396
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.180
while they might occasionally force a tie with it with a Yale if they, you know,

397
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.730
have killed themselves, uh, physically,

398
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.090
they weren't going to beat the Ivy Leagues on any kind of consistent basis

399
00:23:17.091 --> 00:23:20.940
without, without doing something different. And, um,

400
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.260
there was a very fine line between innovation and cheating.

401
00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.260
And Pop Warner starts exploiting that line. Absolutely. Uh,

402
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.190
as hard as he can. And he comes up with, uh, the trick play,

403
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.120
for example, 1903 pop Warner devices, the hidden ball trick. But what is that?

404
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:46.800
The hidden ball trick is I'm the quarterback takes the ball and actually behind

405
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:52.631
this huge pile of men tucks it under another guy sweater while the big pile of

406
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:55.640
men is struggling in the mud in the center of the field,

407
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.440
not knowing quite where the football is,

408
00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:59.450
but believing it's somewhere in the middle of the pile.

409
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.630
Here's this kid who squirts around the end with the football hidden under his

410
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:06.020
Jersey and he's 30 yards down field before anybody realizes it.

411
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.900
And how does he keep the ball from falling out of his jersey?

412
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.790
You'll have the flu.

413
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.820
I think they actually sewed the Jersey so that the ball would stay in there

414
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:18.080
without falling out. So they made a cheating pocket and made a cheating pocket.

415
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.860
Was that legal? But they got it. Did they get their religion? Was it legal?

416
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:26.861
You ask pop Warner would have said there was nothing in the rule book against

417
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:31.450
it. Another thing he does, which actually works brilliantly is uh,

418
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:37.030
he sows footballs onto the front of their jerseys,

419
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.960
which are really bulky sweaters at the time.

420
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:44.110
He sows leather football shaped patches onto the front of their jerseys in order

421
00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:47.320
to try to disguise who's got the ball really,

422
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.270
I guess Harvard and the Harvard coach goes insane.

423
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.680
[inaudible] send me pregnant. This is the kind of thing, I mean,

424
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.450
<v 13>but Harvard did not take this line down.</v>

425
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.700
Harvard retaliates by painting the football's the same color as their jersey.

426
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:08.060
It's my room everywhere. So when they held the ball against their chest,

427
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.230
<v 2>basically, well, you can't see it. I mean they all broke the rules.</v>

428
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.220
American football is essentially a rule breaking experience as opposed to

429
00:25:17.221 --> 00:25:19.860
British football, which didn't have referees,

430
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.040
at least initially a British football ran on the honor system.

431
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.250
But with American football, the rest were there practically from the beginning.

432
00:25:26.251 --> 00:25:29.940
And she says it was largely a response to the brutality of the game,

433
00:25:29.941 --> 00:25:33.930
but also to the kind of rule bending that you saw from pop Warner in the

434
00:25:33.931 --> 00:25:37.140
Carlisle Indians. Every time pop Warner came up with an innovation,

435
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.000
the next year there was a rule against it.

436
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.270
So immediately the Ivy League would get together and pass a rule and say, okay,

437
00:25:42.271 --> 00:25:43.080
no more of that.

438
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.590
And that's how the rule book really burdens in an American football.

439
00:25:46.591 --> 00:25:51.360
And it's thanks to pop Warner's slights of hand in pop Warner's greatest slight

440
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:55.760
of hand and maybe the Carlisle Indians most soaring moment.

441
00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:00.490
And I mean that literally happened at a moment when the game almost uh,

442
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.890
disappeared. That's coming up.

443
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.133

453
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:52.011
And getting back to our story on the Carlisle Indian school and the birth of the

454
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.530
monitory game of football. One of the most important moments in this story,

455
00:26:55.531 --> 00:27:00.360
a happens at a time when football was right on the edge of disappearing.

456
00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.773
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

457
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.970
<v 0>talking about 1905 this was the most violent year in football to this point.</v>

458
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:11.640
19 people died on the football team.

459
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.290
One nine one death is alon 19 that's crazy. Yeah.

460
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.320
Cause what would happen is that Carlisle would try and do these things to sort

461
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:20.154
of open up the game.

462
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.060
The ivies would consistently respond by making the game more about brute force,

463
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.170
more about violence.

464
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.520
So you had all these tests and suddenly all the major programs were spooked.

465
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.370
You know, Columbia polls, their PR or their football team.

466
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.110
Harvard even thinks about doing that.

467
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.820
And this is kind of odd into the fray steps.

468
00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:40.450
The president of the United States of America, Teddy Roosevelt, in order to,

469
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.720
cause he was a fan. According to Conrad Crane, he liked football. He liked the,

470
00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:49.150
the manly aspects of it, the tough aspects of it. But nobody like people dying.

471
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.460
And then there was his kid, his, his son was playing and,

472
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:57.880
and getting beat up pretty badly as well. Uh, broke his nose, slid his eyebrow,

473
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.840
and one game he got knocked out cold. So after the violence of oh five,

474
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.770
the president calls the president of all these colleges and so on and to

475
00:28:05.771 --> 00:28:07.690
Washington, and according to David Adams,

476
00:28:07.691 --> 00:28:10.600
he basically tells them that the rules had to be rewritten.

477
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.530
It had to become a little bit more safe at least, or it would be banned.

478
00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.270
And out of that, we see a couple of rule changes. First, uh,

479
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.970
the schools decide in order to loosen up the pile, so to speak,

480
00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.590
they're gonna Tinker with the down yardage ratio. You know,

481
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.200
instead of going from three downs to gain five yards,

482
00:28:29.201 --> 00:28:31.660
it becomes three downs to gain 10 yards,

483
00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.880
three downs to get tenure to four downs to get 10 yards.

484
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.090
Four would come a couple of years later. Oh. But the second rule change,

485
00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:40.510
which is maybe the most important for our stories for the first time they

486
00:28:40.511 --> 00:28:45.511
legalize the ability to move the ball through the free floating air.

487
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.560
It's surrounds us all. Okay, so where do we go watch the next day?

488
00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.710
So if I could, if I could place you in a moment,

489
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.880
unless there's a moment before this, you'd like to hit a,

490
00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:01.480
I believe November 23rd, 1907 yes. Yeah, big moment.

491
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.270
Okay. Can you set the scene? Well, the, the scene

492
00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:09.340
from the standpoint of broader American history, things have gone airborne.

493
00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.580
You mean Wilbur and Orville, right. I'm talking about not just them,

494
00:29:15.581 --> 00:29:17.170
but I'm talking about hot air balloons.

495
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:20.400
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

496
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.550
<v 0>there are aeronautical experiments happening really all over the world.</v>

497
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:26.490
In France, everyone is experimenting with flying machines.

498
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:27.840
Things are going up in the air,

499
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.430
but not so fast with football because when the rural committee had made that

500
00:29:32.431 --> 00:29:33.420
rule about Ford passing,

501
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:36.970
they had also hedged a little bit saying if you throw a forward pass and you

502
00:29:36.971 --> 00:29:40.140
receiver doesn't catch it, you are penalized 15 yards,

503
00:29:40.141 --> 00:29:43.960
which back in the day was a monster amount. So nobody threw the ball.

504
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.860
It was too risky. But story goes, as soon as that rule got past,

505
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:51.790
pop Warner goes back to his garage. It's always a garage quest with a ball.

506
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.070
And he starts experimenting. Any sort of thing. All right. Okay.

507
00:29:54.071 --> 00:29:57.330
What would be the most efficient way to toss this thing?

508
00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.100
And people have to understand that the footballs and those days are not the

509
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:02.580
footballs we have today with the Nice, yeah,

510
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.800
of whatever that old oblate spheroid or whatever they call it with a nice points

511
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:09.460
and things. These are rugby balls, sort of imagine a deflated basketball.

512
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.250
They're thicker in the middle. They're not as well shaped.

513
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.520
They're really tough to get your hand on to throw. Right,

514
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.700
and in 1906 there's a tiny bit of tape in Albert x and [inaudible] oral history

515
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:25.660
where he talks about this in 1906 he says, pop called all the players together.

516
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:26.763
You tells them

517
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:27.843
<v 1>hi rollers.</v>

518
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.240
If you wouldn't have to learn to decide in a Volvo.

519
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:35.780
<v 0>He says, I think you're going to have to learn to spiral. The ball</v>

520
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.140
<v 1>does as far as the ball,</v>

521
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.590
<v 0>because if you throw the ball in a spiral,</v>

522
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:42.250
it gets 10 times less air drag than if you throw it end over end.

523
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:43.810
Plus it's easier to catch. Yeah.

524
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.120
They start experimenting with it a little bit in the,

525
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:50.130
in 1906 but they come out in 1907 as a throwing off fence,

526
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.680
which gets us to that game.

527
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.440
<v 4>November 23rd,</v>

528
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.800
1907 Carlisle plays the University of Chicago last game of the season.

529
00:30:57.801 --> 00:31:01.610
We're in Chicago and the Chicago team is arguably the best in the nation,

530
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.570
the best.

531
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.210
I don't think it's even arguable what Carlisle is good at this point though.

532
00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.700
Yeah. But Chicago is like stag field

533
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.420
and there are 27,000 people in the stance. Well, what happened was,

534
00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:14.780
uh,

535
00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:19.780
the Chicago players had decided to try to defeat Carlisle's innovative folds

536
00:31:19.851 --> 00:31:24.851
passing by just knocking the crap out of their receivers every time they came

537
00:31:24.861 --> 00:31:27.830
off the line of scrimmage. And so Carlisle's greatest receiver,

538
00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.813
Albert x and Diane,

539
00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.450
our guy had been stymied the entire game because the minute the ball was

540
00:31:32.451 --> 00:31:32.811
snapped,

541
00:31:32.811 --> 00:31:37.520
Chicago players would hit him and try to throw him down or knock him out of

542
00:31:37.521 --> 00:31:38.354
bounds.

543
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.370
<v 0>So pop Warner said to x and Diane,</v>

544
00:31:41.371 --> 00:31:44.310
here's what we're going to do next time they hit you out of bounds.

545
00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.470
Sneak around the bench and get back on the field by some accounts.

546
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.910
This was x and Diane's idea, but whoever thought of it on the next

547
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.770
<v 1>Albert x died as expected. Ends up out of bounds, but it keeps running.</v>

548
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:03.700
<v 4>He runs around the back of the bench, runs around the spectators,</v>

549
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.300
maybe around the band and comes back on the field right at that moment

550
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.520
<v 0>Hauser the quarterback of Carlisle</v>

551
00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:17.230
<v 4>lets loose a vicious spiral. Can I have you read recently? Sure. Okay, hold on.</v>

552
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.980
This is Sally's description of that moment from her book,

553
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:25.870
the real all Americans. For a moment it was a frozen scene in a stage drama.

554
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.020
The ball hung in in

555
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.820
<v 15>the air, a tantalizing possibility could x and dine reach it.</v>

556
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:35.930
Would he catch it or drop it? Defenders wheeled and stared down.

557
00:32:35.931 --> 00:32:40.220
Field spectators watching from the stands found that breath had died in their

558
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:41.330
collective throat.

559
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:43.500
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

560
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.280
<v 15>the spiraling ball seemed to defy physics. What made it stay up?</v>

561
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.310
When would it come down in that long moment,

562
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.400
27,000 spectators mashed together on benches and crammed on platforms may have

563
00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:59.910
felt their loyalty to the home team evaporate in the grip of a powerful new

564
00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:04.020
emotion. They may have noticed something they never had before,

565
00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:08.520
that a ball traveling through space traces a profoundly elegant path.

566
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:13.320
They may have realized something else that it was beautiful.

567
00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.053
<v 1>Uh,</v>

568
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.660
<v 15>the ball struck it's human target x and don caught the pass all alone and</v>

569
00:33:24.661 --> 00:33:26.370
trotted over the Chicago gold line.

570
00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.920
<v 1>[inaudible] exploded in sound and motion.</v>

571
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:42.090
The rest was just anticlimax. The final score was 18 to four for Carla

572
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.713
[inaudible],

573
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.680
<v 2>but the very next year,</v>

574
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:57.100
the Ivy League passes a rule that you can't leave the field and then come back

575
00:33:57.101 --> 00:33:59.980
onto that. Yes. That's where that rule comes from.

576
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.040
They get a say that that description of the ball in the air is,

577
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.110
is timeless in a way.

578
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.090
That's exactly why football is still beautiful at times. That's, that's,

579
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.780
that's when Carlisle in 1907 is when American football becomes the sport that

580
00:34:16.781 --> 00:34:21.170
you watch today. Exactly. Our story.

581
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:26.150
Oh Wow. This is the field field. This is the field. Can we get out?

582
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.143
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

583
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.010
<v 0>After we'd spent an entire day looking at pictures of, you know,</v>

584
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:44.470
Albert x and dine and Pratt and pop Warner and Douglas Lone Wolf and Tom Merlino

585
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.490
and all these Carlisle players.

586
00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.960
Barbara and Cara took us to the field where they practiced.

587
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:55.370
And so this is the Carlisle Indian school football field covered in snow

588
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.020
like 10 degrees out here. Really,

589
00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:03.590
really bright sun coming off the snow and it's just empty.

590
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.330
And we just kind of walked around and tried to imagine all this stuff we just

591
00:35:12.331 --> 00:35:17.280
seen in photos. It was a little bit like walking among ghosts. Yeah,

592
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.410
that's the sound of the flag blowing in the background.

593
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:38.040
I remember standing on that field and I'm having this thought that I couldn't

594
00:35:38.041 --> 00:35:42.000
quite articulate, but later, um, Eric Anderson,

595
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:45.090
that professor from Haskell is a member of the Pottawatomie nation.

596
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.940
He sort of put his finger on it and he essentially said that like,

597
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.830
there's a lot of room on a football field.

598
00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

599
00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:57.430
<v 0>I mean there's room for anger and war and violence,</v>

600
00:35:57.431 --> 00:36:01.600
but there's also room for pride. And a kind of coming together.

601
00:36:01.601 --> 00:36:06.601
That's not a Pratt coming together where one side gets erased but it is a coming

602
00:36:06.611 --> 00:36:07.180
together.

603
00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.710
<v 16>Yeah, I mean there is a middle ground. Clearly it's more than a game.</v>

604
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.640
The stakes are higher than that. You know,

605
00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:22.080
will we as Indian people be accepted on our own terms and

606
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:30.390
also in our ability to meet you halfway.

607
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:37.180
Will we be accepted through this as the vehicle?

608
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.550
It's clearly more than a game.

609
00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.493
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

610
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.040
<v 0>a lot of people to thank for this episode. We had original music, uh,</v>

611
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.400
made for us for that episode from Morgan O'kane.

612
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.190
You can hear him right here playing the Banjo. That's

613

Also we had original music from Austin musician,

615
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.740
shaky graves and the Albert and Diane tape that we'd played is from the research

616
00:37:20.741 --> 00:37:22.750
division of the Oklahoma historical society.

617
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.560

621
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.640

622
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.970
And we also have a link to Sally Jenkins Book,

Thanks to our amazing volunteer cheer squad that came out and weathered the

629
00:38:05.921 --> 00:38:09.550
Brooklyn cold to scream and Holler and bring this story to life.

630
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:13.780
And speaking of that very special thanks to Brenna Farrell who found the story

631
00:38:13.781 --> 00:38:17.100
and produced it with us and a production support from Damiano Marchetti. Wow,

632
00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.240
that's a lot of people to have that. But we will have,

633
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.410
we will have more to listen to.

634
00:38:20.411 --> 00:38:23.110
And more people to bank in the second half of our program. Yeah.

635
00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:26.680
We're going to take a distinctly modern view on football coming up.
