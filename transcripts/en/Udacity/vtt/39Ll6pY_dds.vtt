00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
So please take a while and familiarize yourself with this algorithm

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.750
and then tell me some of its properties.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.150
Does this algorithm eventually find

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.390
any combination of program and input

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.590
that halts, or are the some that this algorithm might be missing?

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.110
Is this algorithm feasible or infeasible in practice?

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.170
And finally, could we modify this algorithm here

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.930
so that it doesn't only find program and input combinations

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.540
that do halt,

00:00:25.540 --> 99:59:59.000
but also those that don't halt.
