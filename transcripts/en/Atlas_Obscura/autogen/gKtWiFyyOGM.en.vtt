complicated answer and we're not

oxygen and iron and these microbes go
and break them apart and they eat the

and break them apart and they eat the
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.160
and break them apart and they eat the
sulfur and are able to pull oxygen out

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

when they do this the iron fits back in
because there's a bunch of free-floating
