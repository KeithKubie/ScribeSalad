00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.540
- [Instructor] What you see depicted

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.790
here is known as a pedigree.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.740
And a pedigree is a way of analyzing

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.760
the inheritance patterns
of a trait within a family.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.610
And it can be useful to
understand more about that trait,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.050
maybe to make some insights about

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.700
the genetics of that trait, and it's a way

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.200
to think about what's happened
in the past in a family,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.840
and then maybe we can help
get some probabilities

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.980
or get some understanding of what

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.640
might happen in the future.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.530
But let's just break it
down, so we understand

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.400
all of the different parts of a pedigree.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.400
So big picture, a circle
represents a female in the family.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.790
And a square represents
a male in the family.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.370
If either the circle or
the square is colored in,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.120
like we see right over here,
or we see right over here,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.130
that means that that
person exhibits the trait.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.170
And the trait of this particular pedigree

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.670
is for is the trait of freckles.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.610
And whether or not we're
colored in, that is a phenotype.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.180
That is an observed trait.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.410
You just look at the person and say

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.340
do they have freckles or not.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.050
This male right over here
does not have freckles.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.780
This female right over
here does have freckles.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.610
This male right over
here does have freckles.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.210
But once again, this phenotype,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.290
that's the observed characteristic,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.260
we don't know exactly the
genotype just from this.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.330
Although we might be
able to infer some ideas

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.720
about the genotype by seeing
how the phenotype patterns

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.340
spread from generation to generation.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.980
But just going back to
understanding the pedigree itself.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.390
When you have a horizontal line

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.410
connecting a male and a female,
it's called a marriage line.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.160
And it means that they are coupling up

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.700
and they are reproducing.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.110
They don't necessarily, I
guess, have to be married.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.070
It's more that they reproduce.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.960
So this male and this
female have reproduced.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780
And then this vertical line that goes

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.940
from that horizontal line,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.810
that's known as the line of descent.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.310
So it's going from that first generation

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.010
to the second generation.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.210
And so all of the people
connected to that vertical line

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.160
at the bottom of the vertical line,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.670
these are their children.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.060
All the people who are
directly connected to this.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.910
And this is known as a sibling line.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.050
So, this person, this
person and that person,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.850
they are all brothers and sisters.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.960
You can see that generation one,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.670
they had two daughters, one
of whom exhibited freckles,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.660
and one son, who had freckles.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.690
Now these other people in generation two,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.480
these aren't children
of the first generation.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.650
These are people, you could say,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.900
who are brought into the family.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.370
They either married into the family,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.260
or you could just say they
reproduced with the children.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.990
But that's what's happening
with generation two.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.770
And so you can see, you have another

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.070
what's known as a marriage line,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.870
but I guess it could be a
coupling line, a line of descent,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.640
and then they have two
daughters in this case.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.720
So it turns out that freckles

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.420
is an autosomal dominant trait.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.460
And I will explain what
that means in a second.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.970
Autosomal

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.610
dominant,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.963
dominant trait.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.070
Autosomal means that it
is a trait associated

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.910
with one of the non-sex chromosomes.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.300
We have 23 pairs of chromosomes as humans.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.120
One of those pairs determines our sex,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.360
the other ones don't determine our sex.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.180
So this means that freckles is associated

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.530
with one of the 22 pairs of chromosomes

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.100
that do not determine your sex.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.220
And dominant means that in general

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.190
you get two versions of a gene.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.170
One from your mom, and
one from your father.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.740
And each of those versions
of the gene for say

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.760
whether or not you have
freckles is known as an allele.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.800
And if a trait is autosomal dominant,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.370
that means that if you
have even just one allele

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.550
for that trait, that you are
going to exhibit the trait.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.240
And so, for example, if
the alleles for freckles,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.120
if capital F is you have freckles,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.000
it's dominant, so you write it in capital,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.160
and lowercase F means that
you don't have freckles,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.020
if someone has a genotype
of capital F, capital F,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.850
or capital F, lowercase F,
or, I guess we could say

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.540
lowercase F, capital F if we
wanted to think about order.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.840
Which one you're getting
from which parent.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.820
Well then in all of these situations,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.160
they would exhibit the
phenotype of freckles.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.250
And we talk about genotype
and phenotype in other videos.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.700
And of course, the only genotype in which

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.440
they would not exhibit freckles

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.840
would be having both of
the recessive traits.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.690
So with this out of the
way, what can we infer

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.070
about the genotype of this
individual right over here?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.530
And this individual will sometimes be

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.350
referred to as individual I-2.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.740
They're in generation one,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.603
and they are individual
two in generation one.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.070
Well, we know that they exhibit freckles.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.360
So we know for sure that since
the phenotype is freckles,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.280
they're in one of these scenarios.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.400
And these two, these two
are frankly equivalent.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.900
So this person, we know
that they're either

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.900
capital F, capital F, so that
would be homozygous dominant.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.630
Or they're capital F, lowercase F.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.180
Which are, they are a heterozygote.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.150
Well, let's first think
about the situation

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.040
if they are homozygous dominant.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.940
If they are homozygous dominant,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.580
that means to every one of her children,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.390
she would give one of these alleles.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.110
And either of those are dominant.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.590
And so that would mean
if this were the case,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.780
that all of her children would get

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.470
at least on dominant allele.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.640
Well, if they all get at
least one dominant allele,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.220
then all of her children
would have freckles.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.620
But we're seeing a situation where

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.820
all of her children do not have freckles.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.970
Two of her three children had freckles.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.870
So this cannot be the case.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.410
So this individual right over here

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.290
must be heterozygous for freckles.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.950
So they must be capital F, lowercase F.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.310
And what do we know about this
individual right over here,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.510
the person that she coupled up with?

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.680
Well, they don't exhibit
the phenotype for freckles.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.700
So they must be lowercase F, lowercase F.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.230
And then from that, you might be able

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.580
to intuit a lot more about that.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.753
And we'll do that in
future worked examples.
