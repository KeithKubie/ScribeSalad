00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.160
When I was in grade school, my teacher taught
me that about 66 million years ago a huge

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.910
asteroid hit the earth right around Mexico
and BAAAM.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.250
Just like that - wiped out the dinosaurs.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.880
Yeah… not true.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.800
Hello survivors, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.359
The mass extinction that doomed the dinosaurs
is still a bit of a mystery.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.130
As with anything that happened millions of
years ago, we must rely on indirect evidence

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.779
to test theories about things that we can
no longer directly observe or record.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.079
So there are lots of theories about how the
dinosaurs died off.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.490
But one thing scientists are increasingly
agreeing on is that the dinosaurs did NOT

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.399
die all of a sudden.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.810
Nope, instead they died a slow, miserable,
gradual death.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.359
It wasn’t just the asteroid that killed
them.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.820
Though it definitely played a part, there
were many other factors involved.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.160
Scientists in the UK at the University of
Reading and the University of Bristol think

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.719
they actually started slowly dying out about
40 million years before the asteroid hit;

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.070
And then, after the blast, continued to die
off for millions of years after.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.610
Sure, they agree with most of our teachers
that the asteroid at Chikshuhloob Mexico did

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.530
indeed kill many dinosaurs through direct
impact and through the tsunami it triggered.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.909
But, they argue that this was more like the
straw that broke the camel’s back.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.759
During the Cretaceous period, before the asteroid
hit, the earth was experiencing global environmental

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.520
changes that did not favor land roaming dinosaurs.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.660
It was experiencing sea level fluctuations,
a period of extreme cooling, and lots of volcanic

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.680
activity.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.130
This meant that dinosaurs had to move around
to find food and resources where the climate

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.130
was more favorable.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.880
But, it was difficult for dinos that roamed
on foot because during the course of the Cretaceous

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.969
period, the land itself was slowly breaking
up from one large continent to many different

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:48.969
land masses.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.689
Things were a little better for birds who
could fly to places with resources, but even

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.439
then, many birds species also died out.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.880
On top of that, mammals were on the rise before
the asteroid - it turned out pretty good for

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.990
us, given that they’re our ancestors.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.600
But, scientists theorize that our small rodent
looking relatives likely helped to knock dinosaurs

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600
out.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.920
They may have competed with the dinosaurs
for food and other resources, eaten their

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.660
eggs, or infected them with disease.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.620
Pretty big impact from such little guys.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.480
Altogether this meant that when the asteroid
did hit 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.180
were already vulnerable to extinction.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.489
The dwindling populations could not reproduce
quickly enough to survive the losses from

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.090
the asteroid’s impact, the tsunami and other
environmental changes that ensued.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.120
Between that, the volcanoes, the fluctuating
oceans, and the global cooling (not great

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.819
for cold-blooded reptiles) - the dinos didn’t
stand a chance.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.849
The asteroid certainly had an impact, but
the dinosaurs had been dying millions of years

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.580
before it, and continued to die off millions
of years afterward.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.569
We can’t give the rock all the credit.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.519
But for more on which dinos actually survived
the mass extinction.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:07.090
Check out Tara’s video here

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.090
What do you remember being taught about the
dinosaurs?

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.800
Did your teachers tell you the same thing
I was told about their extinction?
