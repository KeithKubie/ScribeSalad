00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.160
it's not inspiration its concentration

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.170
it's not inspiration its concentration
 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.780
it's not inspiration its concentration
more you know and it's it's to do with

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790
more you know and it's it's to do with
 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.230
more you know and it's it's to do with
developing skills of concentration and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240
developing skills of concentration and
 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.820
developing skills of concentration and
and I think that's something which is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830
and I think that's something which is
 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.230
and I think that's something which is
one of the few things I think about

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240
one of the few things I think about
 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.539
one of the few things I think about
about being a writer that you get better

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549
about being a writer that you get better
 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.350
about being a writer that you get better
at with time you know there are things

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360
at with time you know there are things
 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.330
at with time you know there are things
that you that you would perhaps don't

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340
that you that you would perhaps don't
 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.370
that you that you would perhaps don't
get better at you know I mean energy is

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380
get better at you know I mean energy is
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.250
get better at you know I mean energy is
something which maybe declines but I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260
something which maybe declines but I
 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.470
something which maybe declines but I
think concentration focus the ability to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480
think concentration focus the ability to
 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.350
think concentration focus the ability to
shut out the extraneous and focus on

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360
shut out the extraneous and focus on
 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.540
shut out the extraneous and focus on
what you're doing I think you know the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550
what you're doing I think you know the
 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.770
what you're doing I think you know the
more you do it the better you get at it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780
more you do it the better you get at it
 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.229
more you do it the better you get at it
that's I think that's true and I think

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239
that's I think that's true and I think
 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.560
that's I think that's true and I think
it's also true that and I think I've

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570
it's also true that and I think I've
 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.389
it's also true that and I think I've
heard other writers say too that when

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399
heard other writers say too that when
 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.209
heard other writers say too that when
you write you in a way right out of what

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219
you write you in a way right out of what
 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.369
you write you in a way right out of what
you think of as your best self you know

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379
you think of as your best self you know
 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.770
you think of as your best self you know
that the part of you that is lacking in

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
that the part of you that is lacking in
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.779
that the part of you that is lacking in
foibles and weaknesses and egos egotism

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789
foibles and weaknesses and egos egotism
 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.079
foibles and weaknesses and egos egotism
and you know vanities so on you're just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089
and you know vanities so on you're just
 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.969
and you know vanities so on you're just
trying to really say something as

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979
trying to really say something as
 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.040
trying to really say something as
truthful as you can out of the best that

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050
truthful as you can out of the best that
 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.350
truthful as you can out of the best that
you have in you you know and and so I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360
you have in you you know and and so I
 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.440
you have in you you know and and so I
think and somehow the physical act of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450
think and somehow the physical act of
 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.679
think and somehow the physical act of
doing it is the only way you have of

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689
doing it is the only way you have of
 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.609
doing it is the only way you have of
having access to that self you know it's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
having access to that self you know it's
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.029
having access to that self you know it's
when you're not physically writing the

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039
when you're not physically writing the
 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.260
when you're not physically writing the
key you don't have the key to that door

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270
key you don't have the key to that door
 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.770
key you don't have the key to that door
you know and and but when you get in a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780
you know and and but when you get in a
 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.609
you know and and but when you get in a
certain speaking for me when I get into

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
certain speaking for me when I get into
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.350
certain speaking for me when I get into
you know I get into a state of properly

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360
you know I get into a state of properly
 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.029
you know I get into a state of properly
concentrated attention then I do think

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039
concentrated attention then I do think
 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.830
concentrated attention then I do think
that that is probably I think about is

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840
that that is probably I think about is
 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.209
that that is probably I think about is
my best self the self that does that and

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219
my best self the self that does that and
 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.859
my best self the self that does that and
and I mean I wish I had access to it the

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869
and I mean I wish I had access to it the
 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.800
and I mean I wish I had access to it the
rest of the time it's at least I at

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810
rest of the time it's at least I at
 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.539
rest of the time it's at least I at
least I can find my way to it through

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549
least I can find my way to it through
 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.490
least I can find my way to it through
that it's not inspiration I think

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500
that it's not inspiration I think
 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.480
that it's not inspiration I think
inspiration is nonsense actually every

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490
inspiration is nonsense actually every
 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.419
inspiration is nonsense actually every
so often I mean like one day in 20 or

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429
so often I mean like one day in 20 or
 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.029
so often I mean like one day in 20 or
something you will have a day when the

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039
something you will have a day when the
 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.830
something you will have a day when the
work seems to just flow out of you and

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840
work seems to just flow out of you and
 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.069
work seems to just flow out of you and
and you feel lucky when you feel you and

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079
and you feel lucky when you feel you and
 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.929
and you feel lucky when you feel you and
often surprised and you don't quite know

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939
often surprised and you don't quite know
 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.300
often surprised and you don't quite know
why it is working like that and on days

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310
why it is working like that and on days
 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.749
why it is working like that and on days
like that it's easy to believe in in a

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759
like that it's easy to believe in in a
 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.479
like that it's easy to believe in in a
kind of inspiration but most of the time

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489
kind of inspiration but most of the time
 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.890
kind of inspiration but most of the time
it's not like that you know most of the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
it's not like that you know most of the
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.660
it's not like that you know most of the
time it's I mean I wish there were more

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
time it's I mean I wish there were more
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.320
time it's I mean I wish there were more
of those days

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330
of those days
 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.800
of those days
most the time it's it's a lot slower and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
most the time it's it's a lot slower and
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.930
most the time it's it's a lot slower and
more exploratory and more a process of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940
more exploratory and more a process of
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.110
more exploratory and more a process of
discovering you know what you have to do

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120
discovering you know what you have to do
 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.600
discovering you know what you have to do
then just simply have it arrive like a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
then just simply have it arrive like a
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.890
then just simply have it arrive like a
like a flame over your head you know so

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900
like a flame over your head you know so
 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.450
like a flame over your head you know so
I do think it's it's to do with

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460
I do think it's it's to do with
 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.980
I do think it's it's to do with
concentration not into it's to do with

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990
concentration not into it's to do with
 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.680
concentration not into it's to do with
paying attention and I think the the the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690
paying attention and I think the the the
 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.110
paying attention and I think the the the
business of writing has a great deal of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
business of writing has a great deal of
 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.000
business of writing has a great deal of
it is is is the business of paying

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010
it is is is the business of paying
 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.550
it is is is the business of paying
attention to your characters to the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560
attention to your characters to the
 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.170
attention to your characters to the
world they live in to the story you have

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180
world they live in to the story you have
 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.790
world they live in to the story you have
to tell but just a kind of deep

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800
to tell but just a kind of deep
 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.910
to tell but just a kind of deep
attention and out of that if you pay

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920
attention and out of that if you pay
 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.560
attention and out of that if you pay
attention properly the story will tell

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570
attention properly the story will tell
 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.170
attention properly the story will tell
you what it needs
