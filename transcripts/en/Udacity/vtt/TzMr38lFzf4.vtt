Layout dependent on the size of my browser,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.689
right? What happens if I rotate my phone?

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.210
&gt;&gt; If the dimensions of the layout viewpoint

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.380
change, the browser has to rerun the layout

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.530
step. That's what happens every time you rotate

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.210
your phone or, for that matter, resize your browser.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.720
&gt;&gt; Hm, I see. So our examples are pretty

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.740
simple but could this possibly a performance bottle neck?

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.800
&gt;&gt; Yep, let's take a look at their tools. I've captured a trace of gizmodo.com

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.250
which is a popular new site. If you're curious you can grab this trace from

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.119
the instructor notes and follow along. Let's take

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.370
a look. First of all, there's a turn

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.300
of events here. Since we're only interested

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630
in layout, let's filter out the loading, scripting,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.610
and painting events. Okay, here's the first layout

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
event. Check it out. It took 145 milliseconds.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.520
&gt;&gt; Wow! That's a long time.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, as you can see there are over 1400 nodes. In the tree.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.260
&gt;&gt; Huh. but there are other layout events in here. What's going on?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.020
&gt;&gt; That's a great question. Recall that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.970
any time we update the render tree, either

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.350
by modifying styles or the content, there's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.670
a good chance we have to rerun layout.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.910
And in this case, it looks like

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.310
that's exactly what's happening. The page is adding

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.460
new content and modifying styles, and hence, we

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.470
need to run layout a few more times.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.980
&gt;&gt; Hm. I see. So how do you go about optimizing for that?

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.910
&gt;&gt; It really depends on the site, but a good rule

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.630
of thumb is to batch updates to avoid having multiple layout events.
