00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 
you know this is Felix from Berlin

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460
you know this is Felix from Berlin
 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.430
you know this is Felix from Berlin
Germany and I want to know if the

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
Germany and I want to know if the
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.289
Germany and I want to know if the
universe is expanding faster than the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299
universe is expanding faster than the
 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.480
universe is expanding faster than the
speed of light

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490
speed of light
 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.339
speed of light
I feel like so you want to know if the

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
I feel like so you want to know if the
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.959
I feel like so you want to know if the
universe is expanding faster than the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
universe is expanding faster than the
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.440
universe is expanding faster than the
speed of light yes in a way what we see

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
speed of light yes in a way what we see
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.090
speed of light yes in a way what we see
is that distant parts of the universe

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
is that distant parts of the universe
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.029
is that distant parts of the universe
are going away from from us so fast that

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
are going away from from us so fast that
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.519
are going away from from us so fast that
we can't receive light from them and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
we can't receive light from them and
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.070
we can't receive light from them and
that's not in contradiction with the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
that's not in contradiction with the
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.390
that's not in contradiction with the
theory of relativity you've probably

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
theory of relativity you've probably
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.370
theory of relativity you've probably
heard that things cannot go faster than

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
heard that things cannot go faster than
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.320
heard that things cannot go faster than
the speed of light and that's true if

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330
the speed of light and that's true if
 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.089
the speed of light and that's true if
you're talking about two things at the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
you're talking about two things at the
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729
you're talking about two things at the
same place if I have two particles

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
same place if I have two particles
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.310
same place if I have two particles
passing each other like this in front of

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
passing each other like this in front of
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.040
passing each other like this in front of
me they cannot go past each other with

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
me they cannot go past each other with
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.569
me they cannot go past each other with
this speed faster than the speed of

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
this speed faster than the speed of
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.569
this speed faster than the speed of
light but since the story of the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
light but since the story of the
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.700
light but since the story of the
universe is that space is expanding it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
universe is that space is expanding it
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380
universe is that space is expanding it
is possible for different parts of the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
is possible for different parts of the
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229
is possible for different parts of the
universe to recede from us so fast that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
universe to recede from us so fast that
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510
universe to recede from us so fast that
light cannot keep up so the answer is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
light cannot keep up so the answer is
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.820
light cannot keep up so the answer is
yes
