00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.200
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.780
Today our topic is liars and the people who try and catch them.

3
00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:09.290
And we've got a tale for you now from our own Ellen horn.

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.580
The story that she heard from a friend of hers, Robert, which? No. Uh, so Jude,

5
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:17.080
your friend Jude. Yup. What a t describe him real quick for us. Shoot.

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.600
So a sweet guy. We used to work together. He keys,

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.510
kind of a slight fellow with Auburn hair and he's just a really thoughtful,

8
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:28.750
trustworthy guy. How do you know?

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.270
What do you mean? How do you know that he's trustworthy? Well, you just know.

10
00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:39.100
I don't know. Huh? Okay. Tell me about the story that you told you.

11
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.420
Well, this is a story about someone that he dated and someone who changed him.

12
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.320
It's the girl that's a girl and how many meter he met her at a barbecue,

13
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.940
<v 1>a friend's party. And incidentally it was my birthday, right?</v>

14
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.910
He was at this party. It was his birthday. He meets this girl,

15
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.990
sandy blonde hair, blue eyes. And after the party a couple days later,

16
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.180
he gets a phone call from his friend saying,

17
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.330
do you remember hope who was at at the party on Sunday?

18
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.770
She was asking after you, okay, is it okay if I give her your phone number?

19
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:11.680
Tell her how to get in touch with you. Are you flattered? Of course.

20
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.450
So she calls, he asked her out and they went out on a date.

21
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.890
I remember thinking to myself, wow, this girl is, she's kind of electric,

22
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.250
vibrant. We're saying yes a lot to each other.

23
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.580
We're laughing a lot. Yeah. She just had a wonderful smile.

24
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:31.600
She would look you right in any,

25
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:36.601
I mean she just had a way of connecting right through to the back behind your

26
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:37.380
own eyes. Okay.

27
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.610
<v 3>You just felt like you were dealing with,</v>

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.200
so they went on again and then they went out again and pretty soon the shipping

29
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.580
all

30
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.900
<v 0>their time together. And then what happened? Well,</v>

31
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.950
<v 1>I don't remember when it turned.</v>

32
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:54.310
At some point she started to have a lot of problems.

33
00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:57.760
Small crises started to come up, a whole series of things.

34
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.520
They were [inaudible] problems, insurance problems. You know,

35
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.460
I've got a situation where I need to move out of the place where I'm currently

36
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:06.790
living and it's because my roommates, you know, crazy.

37
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.570
He's felt himself sort of pulling back. Yes, yes.

38
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:14.230
Until one evening he gets a call from hope and she's totally panicked so you

39
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:16.540
have to come over, we have something we really need to talk about.

40
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.630
And at this point I haven't, I have no idea what it is, but now at this time,

41
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.280
but uh, she said, hey, I'm pregnant.

42
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.130
<v 3>I think I'm pregnant. Wow. But what did you do? Well,</v>

43
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.230
he basically stood up and did the right thing. I think

44
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.250
<v 1>there really was a part of me that was thinking, well,</v>

45
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.580
here's the test of a person who is going to stand by her and support her through

46
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.850
the pregnancy. And he said, okay, let's go to the doctor together. I would say,

47
00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:47.851
where when I want to be there and she would say three o'clock at the doctor's

48
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:53.470
office. Then I would say, okay. And I would go be there early, you know,

49
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.960
two 45 and uh,

50
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.740
she would not be there at three 15 would roll around and three 30 roll around

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.220
there I am sitting sort of alone and the receptionist would sort of continue,

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.190
continue, you know, can I help you? She would say,

53
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.090
oh well that that appointment was at one o'clock or I would notice on the sign

54
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.670
in sheet that she had actually signed in and I could see the handwriting.

55
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.480
It was indeed, it was hopes and she had signed it two hours earlier.

56
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.010
So then did you confront hope about giving you the wrong appointment time? Yeah.

57
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.170
Oh yeah. Yeah. And as this continued, I would say, repeat that for me. Three.

58
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.910
Okay. So three o'clock. I mean, these are moments in crystal clarity of life.

59
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.590
You're not losing track of stuff.

60
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.260
<v 4>Then he gets a call from a woman named Leslie. I met hope off craigslist,</v>

61
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:42.261
actually put out an ad for a roommate and she moved in with no furniture.

62
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.190
She showed up with just all of her stuff in trash bags and then she disappeared

63
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.900
leaving the bags behind.

64
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.520
So it was right around that point where her check bounced and I was like, oh no.

65
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.790
And so through a mutual friend, she tracked down Jude. I, it was kind of like,

66
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.740
okay, well she has this boyfriend, she called him,

67
00:03:58.741 --> 00:03:59.940
called him and sort of wondered like,

68
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:03.360
is he in on this dude had no idea what she's talking about. No,

69
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.990
he didn't even know she had a roommate named Leslie. I mean, who the hell was,

70
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:10.410
who are, you know, who are you? You owe me money and no I don't. And she,

71
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.320
you know, it was all very confusing not knowing what else to do.

72
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.440
Leslie decides to go into hope's room and start looking through her style and I

73
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:18.180
just thought, you know, I'm just going to go through this.

74
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.420
Let's see what's in here. And that's when I found those notebooks.

75
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.710
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

76
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.880
<v 6>spiral-bound notebooks and inside literally pages upon pages of different names</v>

77
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:31.600
with different socials next to them. Credit card numbers, mother's maiden name,

78
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.830
birth date, page after page of that kind of information.

79
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.810
What exactly was this? These are like crib notes for con woman.

80
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.110
That's when I called Jude and I said, get over here.

81
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.790
What did you do at this point? Well, Jude knew he had [inaudible]

82
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.350
<v 1>and I finally got up the courage to confront pope and say,</v>

83
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.780
this is over my own responsibility here. Not withstanding to the, um, you know,

84
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:02.840
the pregnancies. Well, and what about Leslie at this point? Was she,

85
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.151
<v 4>well,</v>

86
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:06.630
Leslie wondered how many of those people in that notebook hope had met through

87
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:08.430
craigslist, which is where Leslie met her.

88
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:12.300
So she went back to craigslist and started posting warnings many times a day.

89
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.100
<v 3>Thanks. Single white female makes Pacific Heights, meets the grifters,</v>

90
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.120
be like 20 something gap closed, five foot three blue eyed blonde runaway,

91
00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:23.780
runaway. In fact, war on your hairdresser. She's posting. Warning after warning.

92
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.600
If you have any information about this person or simply want some empathy,

93
00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:27.434
please

94
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.610
email@khanbyhopeatyahoo.com and Craig took them all down as in Craig from

95
00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:34.400
craigslist. Craig Newmark, Alger of craigslist.

96
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.250
He thought that they were inappropriate, they were unfair,

97
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.620
but do the right thing. But everyone has rights.

98
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.560
She would pose note the drama is not okay. He would take it down.

99
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.710
She would post back to the matters that hope is out there somewhere.

100
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.670
He would take it down,

101
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.710
but within a few days in those moments where Craig was in the bathroom away from

102
00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:56.080
his desk, people respond to other stores and they get multiple reports at.

103
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.310
She ripped off every

104
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.010
<v 4>different kind of person from all over the place. Yoga instructors,</v>

105
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.750
landlord's car mechanic, spanks, flower shop owners, boss, veterinarian,

106
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.300
Car Rental Agency, check cashing place,

109
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.860
She one good act for emo seems to be to move in with tons of stuff.

110
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.220
Sands furniture will pass the check out of a closed account than bolt when it

111
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:25.100
comes back. Over the course of several years,

112
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.660
there were posting Tom Hertz list and there were people who were trying to find

113
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:34.070
and stuff. Oh, she got kind of a celebrity following.

114
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.100
By the way. We used to get emails like every day from people who were just like,

115
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.340
is there any news dude, I love seeing those posts. Can you tell us anything?

116
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:42.110
I'm like, no, she's in hiding. Sorry.

117
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.170
<v 3>Who was this woman? I'm teary. Can I get you to introduce yourself?</v>

118
00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:47.160
Just say who you are and what you [inaudible].

119
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.020
<v 7>My name is Terry Allario.</v>

120
00:06:49.021 --> 00:06:51.450
I'm a special agent with the Louisiana Department of Justice

121
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.960
<v 3>Louisiana. Yeah. How'd we get to Louisiana? Well, after a few years,</v>

122
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.690
hope resurfaced in New Orleans,

123
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.790
<v 7>we had a call in complaint from a lady down in the New Orleans area.</v>

124
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.860
Her credit card had been used.

125
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.330
Someone had tried to purchase Dell computers and it just started from there.

126
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.510
Every time we talked to one victim had led to one or two other victims. Got It.

127
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800
Hope has a almost like a cult following, you know,

128
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.490
her emo was that she knew him. She got to know him really well.

129
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.810
I talked a lot of victims and they just don't trust people anymore.

130
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.230
A lot of these people did some good human open-heart things with her and said,

131
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.330
this poor girl, I've got to help her out, and they were,

132
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.440
they were really let down and you just don't trust people anymore and it's sad,

133
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.921
you know?

134
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.130
Not only do you have to worry about clearing up your credit and getting your

135
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.700
money back from your banks, you know you've got to deal with,

136
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.310
with people on the surf now and that you don't know, you know,

137
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.210
who you're standing next to.

138
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.020
<v 3>She had had that feeling for good reason and one of the houses that hope it</v>

139
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:54.500
blown through in San Francisco,

140
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:57.110
he had found something that was really upsetting.

141
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.100
I had come across it a letter that she had written to my parents but never

142
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:03.830
mailed, just sings very, very terrible things,

143
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.920
which Jude says were totally untrue in this letter to his parents.

144
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.333
Hope wrote

145
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.290
at at one point during pregnancy

146
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.640
<v 1>she was having complications and the main symptom was like severe vaginal</v>

147
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:26.380
bleeding and that this, that she was on somebody's living room floor,

148
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:30.880
other minor, hers in this terrible condition and that,

149
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.160
um, that I had that I just left totally abandoning the situation and my

150
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.090
responsibilities.

151
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.030
Just a graphic and ugly depiction of an awful scene.

152
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.760
<v 3>She was traumatized. The whole experience. He compared to an earthquake</v>

153
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.910
<v 1>five year ago, urban</v>

154
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.040
<v 3>been an earthquake? No, never. Well, one the things that happens</v>

155
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.760
<v 4>is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and so for a little while</v>

156
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:03.780
after the earthquake, you're not sure that when you put your foot down,

157
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.360
the ground is still going to be in the same place as it was a minute ago.

158
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.470
<v 1>There were days,</v>

159
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.230
I can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say

160
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.220
anything of any consequence. That was just true.

161
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.740
You know, to say,

162
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.770
I have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires on September 17th and

163
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:26.604
that was true.

164
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.210
It didn't say September 19th or September 15th it said September 17th I've had

165
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:36.360
people crying on the phone talking to me about this situation and they were

166
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.260
victim six, seven years ago. People are embarrassed, they're embarrassed,

167
00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:41.094
and then they become [inaudible]

168
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.620
<v 4>mad, you know? And that's when they become detective,</v>

169
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.940
make a lousy private attack.

170
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.590
Where are you now in front of hope's mother's house in a bad neighborhood in New

171
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.020
Orleans. Then around midnight. What's her name, by the way? Her mom. Oh,

172
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.740
Marsha Ballantine. And why are you there? Exactly. Ah, you could,

173
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.400
could kind of gotten a little obsessed with him. You got obsessed. Yeah.

174
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.240
I can't see any else. Number six to me why?

175
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.890
I have no idea.

176
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.110
I said this having tightness in my chest. I'm feeling nervous.

177
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.140
There was something about imagining how she was doing all this and so nervous.

178
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.320
It was like really fun to imagine and maybe that's what happens to Leslie to

179
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.700
that. Like once I started looking, I was able to find a lot of victims,

180
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.670
a lot of information, and I wanted to meet her.

181
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.130
Marsha Ballantine. Marsha Ballantine. Yeah.

182
00:10:39.131 --> 00:10:40.210
I'm not from around here.

183
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.930
I'll come back later. Okay, next day. All right. We hold up.

184
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.330
But what did you know about hope at this point? Well,

185
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.860
I knew that she had had a daughter who really knows anybody. Home

186
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.020
Jews? No, not Jude's. The timing was all wrong.

187
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.790
And I had located the father well and standing outside of hope's mother's house,

188
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.270
there's three classic tricycles piled up against a gate.

189
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.880
I don't see anyone inside the house.

190
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.290
The next morning I went out to find a woman named Ruby Ruby Moon.

191
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.170
I live in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ruby owns a coffee shop.

192
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.030
I lived down the street from hope's mother then when hope came to New Orleans,

193
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.900
um, her mother, you know, introduced us.

194
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.830
Ruby has a kid who's about the same age as hope's daughter and they go to

195
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:34.100
Montessori together. And when Ruby opened her shop a year ago,

196
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.530
hope did Carpool duty, she would pick them up.

197
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.620
And when we got home about five 30, six o'clock,

198
00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:43.850
we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes.

199
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.530
And quite frankly, I enjoyed having hope. Around a few weeks later,

200
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.150
the cops show up to arrest.

201
00:11:50.151 --> 00:11:55.151
Hope she had printed a check on her home with a made up account number two by

202
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.200
$12,000 used car. Here you are. You really like this woman.

203
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.370
Your kids love her and you can't believe it. You don't believe it.

204
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.200
And I wanted to stand by her. I wanted to help her, you know,

205
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:12.280
and she hadn't screwed me over. She hadn't done anything to me.

206
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.260
So maybe she's turning around.

207
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.180
Well.

208
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.180
Then my husband finds that she's taken a credit card off of the shelf that he

209
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:30.151
put away because the credit card was maxed out and she had been buying gasoline

210
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.290
and paying her phone bill wasn't much. It was like $250 it really wasn't much,

211
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.360
and my husband was like, hope. Why?

212
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.000
Why didn't you just come to us? Here you are. You're living in a house.

213
00:12:43.001 --> 00:12:46.690
You are nanny, you're a friend. We would've given you the money.

214
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.130
And here's where Ruby's situation is so different from the other victims I

215
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.830
talked to. She loves hope's daughter.

216
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.820
She can't just walk away when hope went to jail for four months,

217
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.450
ruby helped care for her. It's a very, very difficult situation,

218
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.030
especially when you're trying to do the right thing,

219
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.410
trying to do the right thing.

220
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.510
Ruby hired hope's mom to work at her coffee shop even though she's kind of pin

221
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.471
it off a waitress. I mean,

222
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:14.530
she's worked here for three months and she still forgets how to do things.

223
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.840
I mean, I don't know, but here's the thing, the a lie, like the real impact.

224
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.750
It isn't just that it makes you question that piece of information that you were

225
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:25.810
lied to about. It said it makes you question everything.

226
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.320
What happened next was that I watched ruby completely unravel because of

227
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:36.060
something that I said. Do you understand that hope's father was a doctor,

228
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.730
which the detective had told me her father was a doctor.

229
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.860
My understanding was that he wasn't really adopted Derek

230
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.900
according to the Attorney General's office.

231
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.560
Then Marsha's not a liar too

232
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.950
cause she says he was a con man. She says that Hubspot is his apartment.

233
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.920
It's funny how a piece of information can take on a life of its own.

234
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.760
The ground was shifting, staying under Ruby's feet. So then marsh is lying.

235
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.160
Marsha says he wasn't a doctor.

236
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.790
If they say it turned out that he was really a doctor there, the Marshall's line

237
00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.431
and I had it.

238
00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:19.600
I mean that that may not be information that needs anything at all and now

239
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.520
you're telling me that he really was a doctor.

240
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.630
I should be getting call after call. Hey baby, it's ruby. They handle lady.

241
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.940
Can you give me some information? She found it.

242
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.660
Anyone she knew what the connection to home.

243
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:34.970
Can I ask you a question and you just say yes or no. Hi Scott, this is ruby.

244
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.490
I live in New Orleans. Um, you don't know me.

245
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.680
I heard some disturbing news that I would like to do. Very,

246
00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:45.150
very important that you call me back my number. Please call me back.

247
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.440
Hey, I'm freaking out. It's her talking to her husband. Well,

248
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:52.040
I'm sitting here talking to the reporter and, and

249
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.290
<v 6>through things that has told me aren't true,</v>

250
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.390
that hope's dad wasn't really a doctor and he was,

251
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.640
and I still really don't understand why that one detail shook ruby so much.

252
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.340
I guess betrayal makes you doubt yourself,

253
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.080
but it explains something that you had told me that he has no new friends

254
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.033
literally,

255
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.510
that everyone he feels close to is someone that he met before he met hope as if

256
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:20.060
he never trusted his judgment about people again,

257
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.380
but that he had no choice but to rely on it from before. I mean,

258
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.180
how could you live in the world without trusting?

259
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.280
What sort of world would that be?

260
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.570
<v 4>So, um, I am in front of the Jefferson parish courthouse.</v>

261
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.860
Hope has a trial this morning.

262
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.970
40th been here since eight this morning and I haven't as yet seen home.

263
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.830
I have been trying [inaudible]

264
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.610
<v 6>to reach her for a week and a half. Left her phone messages,</v>

265
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:44.970
mailed her a letter, left her right

266
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.400
<v 4>note at the drawer. Nothing constraint. I feel like she's not coming.</v>

267
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.340
<v 6>Okay. Inside the courtroom.</v>

268
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:56.140
I am watching the door at every person who walks in wondering is it her,

269
00:15:56.141 --> 00:15:59.610
is it her? And then she walks in, she walked in and she's,

270
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.320
had you ever seen her before this moment? Pictures of her.

271
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.860
What did she look like? What did she look like? Well,

272
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.680
strawberry blonde hair, blue pinstriped suit and pointy toed high heels.

273
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.680
She sort of looks like an attorney, very well put together.

274
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.690
And I watch her look around this court room at all of the intimidating and scary

275
00:16:18.691 --> 00:16:19.650
looking people in the court.

276
00:16:19.651 --> 00:16:24.651
And I see her see me and she just makes a beeline right for me and walks up to

277
00:16:25.531 --> 00:16:27.690
me and says, you're Ellen, aren't you? You've been trying to reach me.

278
00:16:27.691 --> 00:16:31.740
And I'm so sorry I haven't been in touch and she just sits down next to me and

279
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.660
we ended up spending the next four hours together.

280
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.920
And what'd you talk about the weather mostly. She was very charming.

281
00:16:37.921 --> 00:16:41.370
She told me all sorts of things about New Orleans, New Orleans history,

282
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.720
and when it comes time for her to stand before the judge and plead guilty,

283
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.630
I find myself rooting for her. She gets sentenced to two years on hard labor,

284
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.290
but she also gets a couple of days to make arrangements for her daughter.

285
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.080
She has to report to prison at 9:00 AM on Friday morning.

286
00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.600
Do you ever get her on the record? Well,

287
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.750
I couldn't have my equipment in the courtroom, but while while we were in court,

288
00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:05.130
she agreed to an interview. Okay.

289
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.710
But then a few hours before the scheduled interview,

290
00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:10.620
she called me and told me she couldn't make it move to the next morning.

291
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.290
Then the next day and the next,

292
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:18.070
and while I know I can't trust her, I don't know what else to do.

293
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.550
I decided to run to the drugstore and buy a tape recorder and bring it to her.

294
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.050
So I go to her mom's house.

295
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.380
<v 4>Yeah, definitely. Hey there. Huh?</v>

296
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.860
At least it's a little bit better weather for your white dress. Yeah, totally.

297
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.990
It's freezing yesterday. Hey there. It's my mother. Hi, I'm Ellen. Hi Ellen.

298
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.870
How are you cleaning up dog.

299
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.130
Hi Bear. Well, you didn't call her by her name.

300
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.950
What's her? Ellen?

301
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.940
So I'm trying to make it really UV.

302
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.830
There's set recorder. It's got batteries. It's got a cassette in it.

303
00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.990
I tested it out. It works. Okay. And um,

304
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.120
yeah, you gotta put batteries in your bubble thing too. I know. Um,

305
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.880
and my other thought is as if you want to just record your thoughts and what I

306
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:16.030
mean, you know,

307
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.490
like I just want to write you some space to say what you want to say. So,

308
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.960
um, okay. And it's all addressed,

309
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.410
posted solid dress to seal it up. And um,

310
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.610
yeah, I'm sorry. Okay. I can give you better.

311
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.873
<v 0>Well, is though,</v>

312
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.890
<v 6>that was it. That was my only on the record interview with her. However,</v>

313
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.730
before she went to prison, she did send me that cassette tape.

314
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.480
It was a really crummy tape and so we had to use this voice out. What are you,

315
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:52.600
what do we call that noise reduction and you use a noise reduction filter to

316
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.470
clean it up so you could hear her voice and it makes her sound kind of

317
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.380
ghostliness.

318
00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:02.130
<v 4>It's strange. I have a child have a</v>

319
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.990
beautiful, and I don't think she could be all about it.

320
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:14.020
I was this horrible months or [inaudible] on this tape hook talks about her

321
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:19.180
daughter a lot. My life. Yes ma'am. All right.

322
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.490
I wish you said something more satisfying.

323
00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:25.810
Something that explained why it was that she chose to live this way for so long,

324
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.660
but she doesn't, I'm sorry.

325
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.130
<v 3>Hope Man. This tape to me reported to prison.</v>

326
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.840
She was released due to prison overcrowding and during Hurricane Katrina,

327
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.990
the state of Louisiana lost her.

328
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.430
About a month after the hurricane I wrote to the Attorney General's office and

329
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:51.080
asked if they had any idea where she was. I got a one word response.

330
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:52.953
<v 4>No</v>

331
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.620
<v 0>radio labs. Ellen Horn. All right,</v>

332
00:20:00.621 --> 00:20:04.520
so let me ask a question to get us to our next, next bit. [inaudible] why? Why,

333
00:20:04.521 --> 00:20:08.540
why exactly would hope lie the way she does? I mean,

334
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:11.210
there was a point in the story where, where I'm ruby you,

335
00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.560
one of the characters said, you know,

336
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.680
I would have given her everything she wanted. I would've given her the money,

337
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.990
credit cards, whatever, and yet she still did it.

338
00:20:17.991 --> 00:20:22.030
So why haven't you met people who lie all the time like this?

339
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.040
Just keep doing it and doing it and things like they, it's like they can't stop,

340
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.410
right? Yeah, exactly. They just can't help it.

341
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.310
They feel this impulse that they cannot control. Yeah.

342
00:20:31.311 --> 00:20:34.330
The light just tumbles out before they can stand. That is who, oh,

343
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.330
that's yelling yacht.

344
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.670
She's a researcher at the University of Southern California,

345
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.870
the Department of psychology and your science. And I'm a new mom,

346
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.293
not really new mom.

347
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.730
Her baby's about two months old and she was nice enough to let barge in on her

348
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:53.500
maternity leave to talk with her because when she's not playing with her new

349
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:58.390
baby, she is studying the mind of pathological liars.

350
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.690
Which by the way means what do you use that phrase? Pathological lying.

351
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:08.380
What is it? What does zero definition? I just, I just said it a moment ago.

352
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:13.310
It's people who can't stop lying. It's a visual. It's compulsive yearlings.

353
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.730
Question was, is there something about their brains,

354
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.230
their anatomy that might explain this compulsion and she thinks she may have

355
00:21:20.231 --> 00:21:24.640
found a clue in any case, getting him myself.

356
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:29.080
First thing she had to do was find a group of people who lie a lot. Why? Oh,

357
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:30.430
to study them. To study them. Yeah.

358
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.150
How do you find sitting pathological liars waiting to be studied?

359
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:39.100
We actually recruit out subject from the temporary employment agency,

360
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.150
like a temp agency where you know you would go if you type 60 words a minute

361
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:45.370
kind of place. Yes, exactly. Exactly.

362
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:48.040
This is her notion that she's funded a bunch of liars at a 10 pages,

363
00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.200
so ridiculous. It's not ridiculous heavy. Her idea was that the,

364
00:21:51.201 --> 00:21:55.390
that liars would be over-represented at a temp agency. You can probably imagine,

365
00:21:55.391 --> 00:22:00.391
you know people who need to go to the temp agency or usually people who cannot

366
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.630
remain in one job. For a very long period of time.

367
00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.240
That's not true of all people who work at temp agencies,

368
00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:08.290
most of them are just fine,

369
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:11.770
but some of them she figured keep ending up at the temp agency because they just

370
00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:16.180
have this palm with their, you know, their lifestyle. The truth prop. All right,

371
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:19.660
let's keep going. I want to hear how this comes out and they get so yelling.

372
00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:22.690
And her crew went to a couple of temp agencies in the La area,

373
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:25.330
interviewed 108 people as some all kinds of questions,

374
00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:28.000
not just about their employment history, but about their past.

375
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.940
Their childhood history of their family's very personnel information,

376
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.560
checked their answers to those questions against their family and friends

377
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.610
against their court records,

378
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.450
just to see if she could find people who stories had do you know in

379
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:44.080
consistencies big ones. And in the 108 folks that she queried,

380
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:45.790
she found a pathological liar.

381
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:50.080
12 actually 1212 out of 108 samples. Whoa.

382
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.710
Are they pathological learners? I don't know. It depends on how you define it.

383
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.600
I would hope that she found 12 people that you wanted to look at further.

384
00:22:55.601 --> 00:22:56.434
She said to them,

385
00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.510
would you be willing to come in on a purely voluntary basis into the lab and let

386
00:23:01.511 --> 00:23:02.344
me scan your brain

387
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.180
just another day at the temp office?

388
00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.160
Basically it would put people in the MRI scanner and then we scan their brain,

389
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.900
scanned everyone's brains, all 108 participants, the liars and the Non Liars.

390
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:20.770
No one knew which group they were in and she was looking at a particular part of

391
00:23:20.771 --> 00:23:24.610
their brains just behind their forehead called the prefrontal cortex.

392
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.390
This is the part of the brain that process,

393
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.360
the information is where the real thinking happens.

394
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.960
Decisions and more judgment. For example.

395
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.630
Now if you zoom into that place just behind your forehead,

396
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.800
what you'll see are two kinds of brain tissue.

397
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:45.130
You've got gray matter and then you've got white matter.

398
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.280
I've heard of great matters. Yes. Well, we think if the brain is being great,

399
00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:51.470
but actually it's two things. It's great and white, the gray stuff,

400
00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.560
and kind of think of it as like the computer processor part. Yeah.

401
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.440
It's these little clumps of neurons that process information

402
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.800
like computer chips. That's the great, where's the white white matter?

403
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.501
It's like the,

404
00:24:04.501 --> 00:24:07.670
the connections between all these complete computer and the white matter.

405
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:12.671
In other words is what moves the thoughts around gray is where the thinking

406
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:17.690
happens. And then white is when you move the thought from here to there.

407
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.280
Exactly. Yes. They transfer information from one end to the other. Okay.

408
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.600
So you've got your gray, you've got your white.

409
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:27.380
What y'all link thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people

410
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:31.280
who lie a lot? I thought we would see a reduction.

411
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:35.150
Just some piece of it. Not there. Yeah. They're missing something differently.

412
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:39.320
She thought she would find less gray stuff. Less of the thinking stuff.

413
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.840
Why wouldn't, why would, why? Because that's what she's seen in other, um,

414
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.790
mental disorders that are kind of like this.

415
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.190
And if you think about it in a really simplistic level,

416
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.900
the gray is where you think your thoughts.

417
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:55.430
And it's also among other things where you crunch your moral calculations and

418
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:57.590
liars. She figured it out of trouble in this department.

419
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.320
So maybe they have less gray. That was her notion,

420
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.600
but when she got the pictures back,

421
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:07.601
what she saw was such a great increase in more and not the gray.

422
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.320
Why matter more white stuff.

423
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.930
A lot more like a quarter.

424
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.970
They have 25% more connections in their head. The non liars. Yes.

425
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.170
Before we get to what that means, what were you thinking when you saw this?

426
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.370
I was really bubbling. I thought this was,

427
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.030
this was something, something, something, something.

428
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.260
Here's her idea. So far. You Ready? Yes.

429
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.320
She thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in a kind of in the

430
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:44.720
moment storytelling. That's essentially what lying is.

431
00:25:44.721 --> 00:25:47.630
Coming up with a story on the fly and let me give you an example. Okay.

432
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.101
You're leaving work,

433
00:25:49.101 --> 00:25:53.240
you're walking down the hall and you're on the elevator and an annoying but nice

434
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:56.690
coworker corners you, corners you in the elevator

435
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.040
asks you out. Um,

436
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:05.140
you know I haven't been to ask you made me want to go out with me on Friday to,

437
00:26:05.421 --> 00:26:08.000
there you are. Questions dangling in the air.

438
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.220
For most of us right at that moment inside our head and our brains were

439
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:16.850
thinking, oh, show, test, so you're busy. So you're busy saying, I'm busy.

440
00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.780
What do you visit with citizen teaching,

441
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.210
reaching out into the void,

442
00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:26.780
trying to form a connection with some idea that can help you come up with some

443
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.600
excuse. I can say, you know, I can say,

444
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.580
all right,

445
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.120
really what you need to do at this moment is you've take a bunch of disparate

446
00:26:38.121 --> 00:26:42.680
thoughts on different sides of your brain. Like I'm me tonight, teeth,

447
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.370
dentists, and connect them all together.

448
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.120
I'm having some late night dental work like that. Okay, okay.

449
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.420
We can all do it given enough time. But for the pathological liar,

450
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.260
she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to begin

451
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:56.094
with,

452
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.600
<v 4>they're faster.</v>

453
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.880
My mom is visiting that night and meeting a friend for Sushi for morning into

454
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:03.090
circus, practical cloudbees, hockey practice, Yoga. I have to polish the silver.

455
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:06.450
I've got chemo. The more connections, sorry, beekeeping.

456
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.210
The faster the speed of the processing.

457
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.520
You can jump from one idea to another and you can come up with more, um,

458
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.340
random stories. She thinks that in the brains of most of us,

459
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.350
we have trouble making this connections. We have,

460
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.480
would you have trouble if I said to you like, come on, come on,

461
00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.600
go out with me on Friday night. Would you not be able to come up with a wowser?

462
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.810
<v 0>I would say um, yeah, they um, yeah,</v>

463
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.100
<v 7>I have to stop. I have to count straws to see a third, 13, nine struck county.</v>

464
00:27:31.101 --> 00:27:35.180
We always, we have about 316 straws so far. And uh, I'm only,

465
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.970
I'm only doing ones with, with um, with little red circles on them.

466
00:27:37.971 --> 00:27:42.880
So that's 39. Sorry. Like, I don't know. I did, it just happened.

467
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.850
I just, there you go. See you've got, you've got extra white matter per head.

468
00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.090
So she's saying this is

469
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.860
<v 0>cause of line or an effective line? Well, she's not sure.</v>

470
00:27:50.861 --> 00:27:51.790
And this is a big debate,

471
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.560
which he can say is that children as they grow from age two to eight 10,

472
00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.530
there is a big jump in their why matters.

473
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.460
<v 4>Oh, and that's it.</v>

474
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.300
<v 0>Actually the same age that they give up the skill to lie</v>

475
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.120
<v 4>among other things to close. Let me just ask you,</v>

476
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.060
given everything we've just talked about, how do you see

477
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.560
<v 0>where this information with being a new mom? I mean, um,</v>

478
00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.010
is this your first kid? Yes. It's my first one. A boy or girl. A girl.

479
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.630
What's her name? Ad Zoe.

480
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.240
Doesn't it make you wonder a little bit about Zoe and what's what's going on

481
00:28:26.241 --> 00:28:30.830
inside her head? Oh yes. I wonder about that all the times.

482
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.590
It's still too early to scan her brain,

483
00:28:33.591 --> 00:28:38.300
but eventually I will do it. Are you serious? Yes.

484
00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.980
<v 7>This is a moral to this. Never. If you're a little baby,</v>

485
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.690
have a social psychiatrist. As a mother, we went to the fair,

486
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.990
we read the interest thing. Anyway, if she does this,

487
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.660
maybe we'll know a little bit more about the nature and nurture of liars,

488
00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.060
but until then, this is radio lab and we'll be back

489
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.280
<v 0>in a moment. Like to scan your brand.</v>
