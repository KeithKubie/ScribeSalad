00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
What's up guys, I'm hanging out again with my good friend Richie from the Sonic Dad Labs.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:10.940
You might remember him from a video where we got together and built this thing. This is a 25 millimeter cannon powered by alcohol and shoots at an impressive speed

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.420
So out of the blue one day Richie says,  "I've just been playing around for fun and i have made this little missile  for the cannon, what do you think?"

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.380
And first of all I love it, because its black and yellow, its totally my colors

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.660
The second thing that went through my mind was, some of your comments said: "why don't you try making exploding ammunition?"

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.300
So I asked Richie: "can we put some kind of a pin firing device in here that would hit a primer cap?"

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.980
And make these things into impact sensitive exploding missiles

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.560
How do you actually design a missile like this Richie?

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.760
Well I have a 3D CAD system, basically you know, I start with the bore of the barrel and go from there

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.780
Figure out the ratio I want for the length and diameter

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.000
I actually looked at some more shell designs because I really liked the shape

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.540
and this is kinda fashioned after some of the mortar shells out there so I think it looks pretty cool

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.900
So the primers are the little cups that go on the back of your bullets

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.640
and when the firing pin from the gun hit them

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.600
it causes an explosion to come out to other end and send your bullet flying

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.020
Now when you add your primer you want to add with the inside of the cuffs facing inside the shell

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.000
so that the flat end is sticking out.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.040
And that's so that when the nail hits it it will fire inside the nose cone.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.440
We're going to use a bit of superglue around the base of this retainer, that's going to help hold it in place in the nose cone.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.700
My fingers are going to stick together in a second

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700
Then we use some activator here

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
This stuff helps the glue harden  a little bit quicker

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700
Now there's a couple of ways we could go with this desing, guys

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700
We could take a primer cap, set it in the tip

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700
and then insert our nail

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.700
and now we basically got a glorified cap dart

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.700
that will go off with a tremendous amount of power

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.700
But for this project, we thought

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.700
we would take it up a  notch , by introducing a little bit of black powder

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.700
The way, that Richie designed these nose cones

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700
is, we can actually pack them up with about four to five grams of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.700
a black powder equivalent

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.700
Then we will use a little bit of hot glue

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.820
to form a bulk head and put the tail fins in place

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.300
once these things are put together they're actually very very safe

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.160
it's not until you add the nail to the tip that they become active and ready for use

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.660
this is a muzzle loading compellent but its still really fun to play with

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.180
a little craft foam divider will help separate the black powder from the hot glue

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.860
makes it a little bit safer and helps hold it in place

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.500
and then we just seal that thing up

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.060
Beautiful, thats beautiful looks just like liquid glass

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.700
so there are 2 different variations that richie's made

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.060
one is just the nose cone that we fill up with powder and then basically glue the tail into place

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.280
the second one here is a little bit different, it's got a chamber for the powder on the inside

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.340
and then an outer chamber that we're going to fill up with baby powder

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.380
the idea is that when these things explode its gonna spray powder everywhere

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380
and make it a little bit more noticeable infact

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.480
you wanna put the baby powder around first, so I've got this whole piece that goes in

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.540
keeps baby powder out of our (gun)powder chamber

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.740
and then a funnel

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.340
Grant: ah he's thought of everything

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.440
so I'm just using a little del to help consolidate this (baby)powder so that i can get in as much as i can

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.260
you know on, on this design the nose cone is really thin out here so I'm actually going to put the glue around the center where its thicker

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.460
otherwise the glue would melt the nose cone

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.200
and just put that down there

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.480
there is nothing you can't do with a little bit of hot glue

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.960
you remember that Richie designed this barrel so that it just pops right off

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.400
and now you cant take your ammunition and push it up into the barrel

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.180
and then is just slides right back in to the ignition chamber

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.440
and it's ready to go

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.400
so we've got our two variations set, the glue is hardening so all I have to do is repeat that process now

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.280
over and over and over again

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.540
multiply it by thirty

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.960
improvised party horns

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.160
so there you have it guys, with a little bit of time and with Richie's amazing brains

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.920
we've just put together a whole arsenal of these little exploding missles

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.780
which hopefully will go off on impact

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.860
unfortunately we can't test them out right now because we're at the golf course

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.140
we need to head out deep into the desert because we're gonna make about thirty more of these things and test them all out

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.560
so you'll see that in the next video

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.640
in the mean time go over to the Sonic Dad channel

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.260
they've got a smaller version of this cannon that will shoot marshmallows

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.480
and I'll put a link the description to where you can go and download the pdf for FREE

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.100
the Sonic Dad team has amazing and they're all very kid friendly

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.720
so go check them out SonicDad.com

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.380
Richie: Thank you grant! it was fun doing this project with ya! :D

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.960
yes it was! :D YEA *fist bump*

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.820
CHEERS :)

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.920
Richie: and they go off

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.860
ahahah yea

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:21.560
