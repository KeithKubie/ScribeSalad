00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.609
Today we're going to take our YouTube diamond play button and see if we can use it to cast a solid candy play button in

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.609
as clear of candy as we can get

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.220
Not long ago

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.840
We made this diamond play button mold and we've been trying to think of the best things that we can cast in it and one

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.909
Of the ideas we came up with is to try and make the whole thing look like a diamond rather than just the one triangle

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.709
In the center, and so we thought maybe we can cast that in hard candy

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.400
We've done some cool hard candy stuff before we've made pokeballs with Pokemon in them

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.129
we've made an Iron Man helmet and we think now it's time to see if we can make a candy diamond to play button the

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.000
Idea here is pretty simple

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.279
We're gonna whip up a big old batch of our candy recipe

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.860
see if we can tinker with it a little bit to make sure it stays a nice clear color and then cast it in our

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.850
diamond play button mold

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.850
We're going to be using a slightly different

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.109
Recipe than we've used for candy in the past before our recipe consisted of sugar corn syrup and water

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.499
But there is a downside to that and it's that if you don't add any food coloring

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.169
It usually ends up turning a little bit yellow today

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.320
We're using a different recipe that doesn't have quite as much of that problem

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.949
It uses Splenda sugar and corn syrup with no water

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.920
The recipe is 2/3 cup Splenda 1/3 cup sugar and 1 cup corn syrup

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.150
We're gonna do a double batch here. So single batch is 2/3 cups

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.749
We're going to do 4 thirds cups single batch is 1/3 cup, but because we're doing a double recipe 2/3 cups

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.259
And now we need 2 cups of corn syrup

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.129
Well, there are more bubbles than I was expecting and it's yellower than I was hoping for but we're just going to pour it into

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.129
The mold anyway and see how it turns out

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.389
All right, let's take a look at what we've got so far

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.378
I thought that I was making enough of this recipe that I could fill the mold about halfway

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.119
And then I also thought that the recipe I had would turn out quite a bit more clear than this

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.669
and that I could just let it sit for a bit and end up with fewer bubbles and I was wrong on all three of

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.780
Those points and this is after doing a fair bit of research on how to make this work

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.699
So clearly I need to do some more research and we'll try something else again

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.259
Her sugar layer seems to have hardened quite a bit

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.450
So we'll see if we can pop it out in what sort of texture we have. I'm guessing one with a lot of bubbles

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.809
We've got the shape really well as

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.739
You can probably see though. The surface is just completely covered in bubbles like everywhere

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.809
I do still think it's gonna be possible to get this whole thing as one solid clear block of sugar

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.299
I may need to use a different type of artificial sugar. There's something called isomalt that I know is often used for this

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.459
So I might have tried getting my hands on that

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.209
All right

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.098
Well, apparently I am terrible making things out of isomalt because this was supposed to be clear and instead

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:17.149
It's well completely opaque more than any isomalt has ever been opaque ever. So I need to call in an expert Cali

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
Yeah, okay. I

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.010
I'm not good at ice and well

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.779
Actually, it doesn't even taste good I've worked with ice melt a lot so I have made it clear many many times

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.030
I didn't actually know it could do this

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.179
not either it's a lot simpler than people make it out to be I really come down to

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.950
Clean tools and exactly what ingredients ice melt if you want it clear

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.189
You're not worrying about adding food coloring or flavoring or anything else?

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.289
You just need the ice mold itself and then you just need to make sure you keep everything clean. It's about easy

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.689
So I will clarify add one things even

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.239
Instructions on the backs of these will sometimes tell you to add a couple tablespoons of water to about a cup of ice and melt

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.479
And melt that down

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:04.530
You can

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.269
Especially if you're adding food coloring, you'll still get a pretty decent result

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.289
But it's still gonna turn out a little bit cloudy or it won't be perfectly clear

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.970
You're gonna get a yellowish tinge with tap water

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.369
Now if you use distilled water, you'll have better results

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.240
but honestly

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.120
You can just mop isomalt on its own which is what makes it so unique

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.950
Even from sugar from all of the other things that makes it different the clarity of it is the main thing

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.940
But the fact that you can just melt it down on its own and you can get beautiful results

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.389
It's kind of what makes it so special. Let's try it. All right, I'll show you to

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.910
perfectly clean metal pot

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:42.169
this is nonstick and then I've got two new clean spatulas that Nate has never stirred anything or burned anything with

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.440
Nice

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.450
Turtle medium mm. We're gonna start it 20 minutes medium heat

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.429
So once it hits a certain level of heat, I think it's close to the hard crack stage for sugar

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.429
It will discolor no matter what there's no saving isomalt

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.739
If you burn it, you leave it on a medium heat you don't need to worry about it not dissolving correctly

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.769
What's gonna happen is it's gonna melt from the bottom. You can tip it gently

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.540
You don't want to stir it because of those bubbles

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.540
You don't want to really mess with it too much

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.049
All we're gonna use the spatula score is to poke any of the stuff that hasn't fully melted down to the bottom

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.519
Once it looks nearly done. We'll turn off the heat 40 minutes. I say we're going to be good to go

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.450
So, I mean we can compare do you want to hold this next to your diamond plate

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.500
No, let's just pour this in and you can compare my failure to your success. Later

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.119
So that's probably gonna take I would say seven hours

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.369
I'm probably gonna let it cure at least

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.829
so you might as well just leave it overnight and then it should be nice and hard and it should be clear and then we

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.379
Take it out, and we just melt those bubbles off. I'll be good to go

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.629
There are bubbles and you can definitely see bubble, ooh the top guys we've got a clear piece of candy here

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.300
That was a very good sign

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:46.708
Okay, a little bit of discoloration and a lot of bubbles that could be worse and we can actually get rid of these

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:13.409
Guys we learned so much about this namely you can't put sugar in a silicone mold

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:17.908
Mmm, hot sugar bubbles on contact with silicone. That's pretty much unavoidable

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.359
We even tried making some other types of molds

00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:28.259
But those like I made one out of thermoplastic, but thermoplastic isn't gonna hold up to hot candy being poured in to do it

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:28.800
Just melt again

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.690
and so in the end what we did is we did use the diamond play button mold and then we just

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.209
Blow torched over the surface to smooth it out

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:41.759
This one is obviously the correct size but gosh the bubbles are bad

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.589
So we've just got so much candy here. This one was pretty good except that it's too thin and

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.440
We let it solidify all the way and once it's solidified and it's a separate batch

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.369
Like you're never gonna get the color just right. It's not gonna laminate perfectly to it

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.649
And so we would have a gap there forever. And we really wanted like the right thickness all the way through same color

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:04.709
That one here that ended up being a little bit too dark

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:07.078
You can see it is red if we hold it up to a light

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:10.889
But if you're not holding it up to a light it kind of just looks black and we tried pouring

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.959
Another layer of molten sugar over it

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:19.319
Rips here's the pour lines off to the side. It did not get rid of the bubbles

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.769
like we hoped it would now the

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:26.069
Isomalt, actually, I think if we hadn't been using a silicone mold would have been our best bet

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:31.739
The problem is Isum all over a long period of time and the fact that we've had it above the stove

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.620
So it's been steaming up when opaque again

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.989
However, you can see where we took a blowtorch to it

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.729
And the nice thing about ice mold is unlike sugar when it heats up it stays

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:49.079
Beautifully clear. It doesn't caramelize at all. Well, I can burn it if you're too hot, but it doesn't caramelize and turn like yellow

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.870
Guys thanks for watching
