00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.510
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Audible

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.220
The CDC was just caught using expired disinfectant
in their labs, which got me thinking…

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.030
Disinfectant expires?!

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.240
WHAT?!

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.340
Howdy gang, Trace here with some DNews for
ya!

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.730
The CDC's use of expired cleanser was discovered
after 75 employees were accidentally exposed

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.769
to live anthrax last month, and the USDA stepped
in to look at their procedures to see who

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.769
screwed up.

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.080
Most labs use bleach as their disinfectant,
because the active ingredient, hypochlorous

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.190
acid, [a]causes the proteins in bacteria to
unfold and the bacteria die.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.470
Bleach is what was being used by the CDC in
their labs -- and it has an expiration date

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.550
of only six months from date of manufacture,
so probably three to five months once you

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.550
get it home.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.390
It expires because the sodium hypochlorite
decomposes over time.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.081
The cooler the storage area the better, but
bleach manufactured and stored in the warm

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.640
summer months, WILL degrade faster.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.040
Expiration dates are used by manufacturers
not to tell you, "time to throw this away,"

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.560
but more to say, 'we cannot guarantee this
product is perfect anymore.'

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.640
The dates are usually printed on the product,
and there are LOTS of them.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.980
The latex in a condom has an expiration date
of five years, because the latex needs to

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.100
be moist… moist… moist… to work.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.600
And after five years, the brand can't guarantee
the latex hasn't degraded from drying.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.330
If it has spermicide, it's even shorter, only
three years.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.200
Like with bleach, spermicides' active ingredient
degrades over time.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.010
Sunscreen also expires, mainly because the
tiny particles inside the solution clump together

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.350
as the sunscreen ages, this decreases the
effectiveness and causes the sunscreen to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.170
eventually become crappy.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.799
Mascara expires after two or three months,
so if you're going to splurge on that fancy

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.340
lash-lengthening formula, use it all.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.340
Why?

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.590
Because your eyes are dirty, once it has been
used, the mascara becomes a breeding ground

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.920
for bacteria.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.960
After the date, the bacteria could have build
up enough to cause eye infections like conjunctivitis

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960
-- or pinkeye.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.020
And you should DEFINITELY get rid of a loofa
after THREE TO FOUR WEEKS!

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.020
Bacteria folks.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.440
It's growing on stuff.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.279
It's all about the active ingredients.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.900
Anti-acne creams usually break down within
three months of first opening, sometimes sooner,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.900
if they're natural.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.299
Hair gel and hairspray lasts two to three
years.

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.689
Soap usually expires in 18 months to two years;
especially if it contains essential oils!

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.930
Soap is made of lye -- a generic term for
an alkaline solution -- and a collection of

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.930
fats.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.099
Over time, the lye gets less potent and the
fats degrade… sensing a pattern here?

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.099
Exactly.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.769
It's not just bathroom stuff, motor oil is
organic, it used to be tiny plants and animals

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:40.769
remember?

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.769
FOSSIL fuels!

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.769
Like all the other things, once it's open
the air begins to break it down and after

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.930
90 days it's expired; unopened it can last
as maybe five years.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.889
Alkaline batteries last five years, too.

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.629
The chemicals inside batteries will only hold
a charge for so long -- and because their

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.840
elements are different, lithium batteries
can as 10 years.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.029
There are a LOT of things with expiration
dates, and while you might not have to pay

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.690
attention to them all the time, it's good
to take note.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.879
The CDC bleach, by the way, would still be
okay to use up to nine months after manufacture,

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.280
but every month more of the acid is depleted.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.450
Hopefully, the CDC will pony up for some new
cleaner, and so should you.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.409
Kinda makes those trips to Costco seem…
well… silly… don't it?

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.510
There are two things that I found that never
expire.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.610
Honey, and nail polish remover.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.610
Yep.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.610
So that's good to know I guess.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.800
What other things have surprising shelf lifes?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.570

It was AMAZING.

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.709
He dictated the whole book back in 1904 so
it's like listening to him talk, literally.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.790
Double meaning there… ha!
