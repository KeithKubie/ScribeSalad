00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:29.615 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH!

00:07:29.648 --> 00:07:30.683 align:start position:0% line:85%
JAKE TAPPER!

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:33.719 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YOU JUST TAPPER-ED THAT ASS!

00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:38.557 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S MY BOY!

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.159 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND FINALLY, JUSTICE CLARENCE
THOMAS.

00:07:40.192 --> 00:07:41.594 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE'S NOT A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE,
BUT I DO WISH HE WOULD RUN...

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.195 align:start position:0% line:85%
INTO AN OPEN PIT.

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:47.800 line:85%
SORRY, I COULDN'T STOP MYSELF.

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.969 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE CHOSE TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE
OF DIGNITY.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND, OF COURSE, HE USED THE
OBVIOUS SLAVE ANALOGY.

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:58.010 line:91%
ACCORDING TO THOMAS, "SLAVES DID
NOT LOSE THEIR DIGNITY (ANY MORE

00:07:58.043 --> 00:07:59.879 line:91%
THAN THEY LOST THEIR HUMANITY)
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWED

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:03.482 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEM TO BE ENSLAVED."

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:09.622 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT SLAVERY
IS?

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.491 align:start position:0% line:91%
SLAVERY IS THE COMPLETE
STRIPPING OF HUMANITY AND

00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:14.860 align:start position:0% line:85%
DIGNITY.

00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:17.129 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THAT'S THE POINT OF SLAVERY.

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:19.899 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WHEN DO YOU THINK SLAVES
WERE WHIPPED?

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:24.336 line:91%
WHENEVER THEY DARED TO TRY TO
SHOW ANY HUMANITY OR DIGNITY.

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:29.875 line:91%
CLARENCE, PLEASE APPROACH THE
BENCH AND THEN JUMP OFF OF IT

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:33.812 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTO THAT SAME AFOREMENTIONED
PIT.

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:37.983 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LOOK, THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE GAY

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:39.718 align:start position:0% line:91%
MARRIAGE FIGHT HAS BEEN ALL
ABOUT.

00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT ABOUT CHANGING THE
DEFINITIONS OR UPSETTING

00:08:41.353 --> 00:08:43.689 align:start position:0% line:85%
INSTITUTIONS.

00:08:43.722 --> 00:08:46.392 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE FIGHT HAS SIMPLY BEEN ABOUT
HUMANITY AND DIGNITY.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.758 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
