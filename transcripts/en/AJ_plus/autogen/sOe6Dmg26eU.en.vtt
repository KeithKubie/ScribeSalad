00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.619
Every day, Ruhul Amin retraces his daughter's last footsteps ... the daughter he lost.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.160
The 35-year-old fled the massacres in Myanmar and crossed over, with his family, on foot.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.399
He had built a shelter made out of bamboo and tarp in Kutupalong camp in Cox's Bazar, in Bangladesh.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.419
Then the rains came. And tragedy struck

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.339
There were heavy storms. Even before monsoon season began. The rains pelted the roof of their hand-made shelter.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.269
Huddled together in their makeshift home, the family needed fuel to cook a simple meal of rice and stew.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.180
And, in the refugee camp,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.760
children are often sent to collect the firewood. It's a chore that can last from sunrise to sunset.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.800
Ruhul remembers the day his seven-year-old daughter Aziza Begum set off early one morning in May 2018.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.060
While Aziza, her older sister Romiza, their cousin Momina and their two friends were gathering firewood,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.480
disaster-hit.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.980
The two friends saved themselves, by digging out of the torrent of mud and shouted for help.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.980
But Aziza, her sister, and cousin were still trapped.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.180
A little farther away, four boys were playing soccer. When they heard the cries for help, they rushed to the scene.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.060
The three girls were taken to the hospital. And when news reached him, Ruhul rushed there too.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.679
What happened to Aziza is a constant fear for people living in the refugee camp.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.219
While Aziza was the first recorded fatality,

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.619
a few weeks later a two-and-a-half year old boy died when a wall of mud fell on him.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.619
And it was reported that a Rohingya man died when he was hit by a tree that had been weakened by rainfall.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.479
Even if it doesn't kill them, Rohingya refugees live with the fear of the monsoon destroying what little they have managed to build.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.649
Shelters are risk of being swept away during the rainy season, pitched on sandy clay soil.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.480
Since May 2018,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.440
there are almost 50,000 refugees living in shelters in areas that are at high risk of landslide.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.860
Fewer than half have been relocated to safer settlements. And safety is what drove Ruhul to flee in the first place.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.339
He had brought his family to Bangladesh to escape all the violence his people were facing in Myanmar.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.799
After escaping all this, he'd now lost a child.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.100
These scattered mementos in the family tent â€“ a cup,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.860
her schoolbooks, the toys she shared â€“ are all that's left of Aziza.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.460
A reminder of a friend, a sister, a daughter.
