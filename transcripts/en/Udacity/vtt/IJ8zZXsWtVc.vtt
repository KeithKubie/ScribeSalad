The answer is a disc shaped volume, a pretty flat cylinder. Whatever axis you

00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:08.984
rotate around, each point will trace out a circle perpendicular to this axis,

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:13.100
with the center at the origin. It's useful to think about the axis of rotation

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.850
this way. For example, if you have a location and want to rotate it to another

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.140
location, find the circle that has its center at the origin and contains these

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.263
two points. The circle's corresponding axis is the one to rotate around.
