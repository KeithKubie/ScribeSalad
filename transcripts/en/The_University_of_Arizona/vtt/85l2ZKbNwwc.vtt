00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.780
Good evening and welcome
to the penultimate lecture

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.770
in this year's lecture
series on cosmology.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.820
Just to remind you, the universe
is 13.7 billion years old.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.850
Hydrogen, helium and lithium
were formed in the Big Bang.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.970
All of us are 90% stardust.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.100
And today we're going to
talk about black holes.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.910
I want to thank our
underwriters, the Arizona Daily

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.420
Star, Cox
Communication, Bob Davis

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.066
in Innovation Park, Innovation
Place, Stantec, DPR, Bob.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.230
Our Galileo Circle
members, Godat Design,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.840
Raytheon, Research Corporation
for Science and Advancement,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.920
UniSource Energy and
Ventana Medical Systems.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.610
Obviously, it's not
parking and transportation.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.120
I want to remind you before
I introduce our speaker

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.190
tonight that we do
have, for those of you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.190
interested in astronomy,
we do have a sky center

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.480
on top of Mount Lemmon with some
pretty spectacular telescopes.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.450
And here what you see
is in fact a picture

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.690
that was awarded by NASA
the picture of the day.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.910
It's a picture of the NGC 1999,
a nebula that is currently

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.940
forming stars in the
constellation of Orion.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.749
So in addition to the
highly acclaimed sky nights,

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.040
and you can buy pictures like
this from Adam Block, who

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.980
I think is back there,
in addition to the highly

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.090
acclaimed sky night
program, the sky center

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.650
is offering a companion
series to this cosmic origins.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.350
And Phil Pinto, for those of
you that missed his lecture,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.150
will be there April 1st.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.520
So I urge you to go
up to Mount Lemmon.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.720
Take your boots and
all your heavy clothes

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.010
and enjoy the telescopes.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.400
It is my pleasure to introduce
today's speaker, Feryal Ozel.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.650
She is an associate
professor in astronomy

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.370
whose research interests are
black holes, neutron stars,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.620
structure formation,
and the reionization

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.120
of the early universe.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.400
Her research has
received numerous prizes

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.190
and recognitions,
including the 2010 Bart Bok

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.480
prize from Harvard University
and the Lucas award.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.760
Her work has been
supported by NASA and NSF,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.200
totaling almost $1
million just in this year.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.280
She is a frequent guest in
TV documentaries on PBS,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.400
the History Channel,
CNN International,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.420
as well as many scientific
articles in the popular press.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.510
Feryal is often invited
as a keynote speaker

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.250
in international events for
the public and the industry,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.440
such as the International
Innovation Day hosted

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.040
by Novartis, and the Middle
East Women's Literacy Campaign

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.285
launched by Louis Vuitton.

00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:20.660
When she's not exploring the
far reaches of the universe,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.300
she likes to push her
own limits by competing

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.670
in triathlons and marathons.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.120
This past year, Feryal came
in second in the Wineglass

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.640
Marathon in New York,
and also climbed

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.290
Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.280
She says the skies
look absolutely amazing

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.570
at that altitude.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.130
So Feryal, where are you?

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.000
Good evening.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.340
And I would like to
welcome all of you

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.940
on this beautiful Tucson
evening to Centennial Hall.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.340
I will tell you about black
holes and how we find them.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.519
I would like to take you
on a journey of what it is

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.890
that we understand about them.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.690
And I would like to tell you
how they push our understanding

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.630
of physics and gravity.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.690
And I would also
like to tell you

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.920
that black holes are very
unique objects in the universe.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.010
We only find them
through their influence

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.780
on their surroundings,
because we

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.080
don't have a direct way
of seeing them just yet,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.225
because as the name
suggests, they are black.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.060
I would also like to tell
you that despite everything

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.500
that we associate with them,
all the energetic phenomena, all

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.280
the general relativity,
complex mathematics,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.310
and the various ways
in which we find them,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.630
they are actually
fairly simple objects.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.040
And they're at the same
time pretty extreme objects.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.210
And I would also like to tell
you that they are everywhere.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.450
We find them in our galaxy.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.230
We find them in other galaxies
in the nearby universe.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.270
And we find them when
we look far back in time

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.100
to the early universe.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.290
But before I do all
of that, I don't

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.210
want to get ahead of myself.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.020
I would like to tell you a
little bit about gravity, what

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.470
we understand about it,
how our understanding of it

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.700
developed over centuries,
and what are some challenges

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.840
that we face in understanding
the next frontiers.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.285
What I'm about to
show you is a movie

00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:54.720
of the solar system, which
is our first encounter

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.460
with gravity.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.270
And in this movie,
if we had the luxury

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:07.290
of being far out in space, and
looking at the solar system way

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.920
beyond Neptune's orbit, this
is what it would look like.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.810
And don't worry about
the fact that our sun

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.615
has become a red giant
at the end of this movie.

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:44.500
That's five billion years away.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.050
And I'm pretty sure we'll
either destroy our planet

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.130
by other means by then, or we
will have found other habitable

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.750
planets to move to.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.710
So not worrying
about that last bit,

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.040
let's look at what
the solar system,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.220
our very first
experience with gravity,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.890
has taught us over
the centuries.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.950
So that takes us back
to the time of Kepler,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.680
Johannes Kepler, in the 1500s.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.160
He's the first
person to formulate

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.200
the motions of planets and
how they relate to how massive

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.660
the object at the center
of such a system should be.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.300
At that time, the
heliocentric belief,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.440
which is that the sun is at
the center of our solar system,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.950
was fairly new.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.400
It had no observational support.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.460
But Kepler was one of
the first believers

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.460
of the heliocentric
point of view.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.820
And not only that, but
he actually formulated

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.250
mathematically, as I said,
what the mass of the object

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.220
at the center of such
a system should be that

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.130
holds things in
motion around it.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.590
This could be a
circular orbit, or it

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.640
could be a distorted circle,
such as an ellipse, as we

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.790
see in some of the planets
in our solar system.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:17.900
And just looking at Kepler's
laws formulated in the 1500s

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.040
can tell us what is the source
of gravity that is keeping

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.230
all these planets in places.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.500
In fact, Kepler has
been so influential,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:34.419
one of the first figures
of scientific revolution,

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.010
that today we call
a Kepler problem

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:43.169
anything that involves orbiting,
planets, stars, et cetera.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.510
It doesn't even
have to be a planet.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.240
If a star orbits
around a black hole,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.610
we still call it
a Kepler problem,

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.850
just because his laws are
applicable to those situations

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.380
as well.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.100
Of course, it was Galileo's
observational support

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:10.630
that first provided the data for
the heliocentric point of view.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.630
He didn't have the luxury
of what we just had,

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.330
stepping outside
of the solar system

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.140
and looking at a movie of
how everything is moving.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.470
He constructed bits
and pieces of orbits.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.290
He looked at phases of Venus.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.520
He looked at the motions
of moons around Jupiter.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.530
And because of the telescope
that he was able to build,

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.200
he actually collected
the first data

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.290
on the motion of the planets.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.140
And then came Newton.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.960
Newton was the
first person to say

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.400
that if these planets are
moving in circles or ellipses,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.940
it must be that they are
held there by some force,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.090
and he named it the
gravitational force.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.640
He not only named
it, but he was also

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.860
able to formulate what
this force would look like.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.640
So very simply what
he said is that there

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.960
is a constant that determines
the strength of this force,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.630
but this force goes with the
mass of the central object that

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.660
is keeping the planets in place.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.180
It goes with the
mass of the planet.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.670
And it's reduced by
distance squared.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:34.170
So the farther away two objects
are, the less the gravitational

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.060
pull is between them.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.820
The more massive an
object is, the more

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.220
of a gravitational
influence it has.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.410
That force is larger.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:49.680
And this formulation is what
we used for several centuries

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.650
to understand the
gravitational force.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.850
So is this it?

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.350
Can we go home?

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.285
Well, not really.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:04.100
Newton's theory explained a lot
of the data that was available

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.240
back then, and most of it was
just the solar system data.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.170
There was one little piece of
data that it couldn't explain,

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:17.300
and that was the so-called
precession of Mercury's orbit.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.710
What does that mean?

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.800
So Mercury is the inner most
planet in the solar system.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.070
It also happens to
be the planet that

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.640
has the most elliptical
orbit, the most distorted

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.200
from a circle.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.890
Now when you have
an elliptical orbit,

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:41.730
can put the sun at one of the
focal points of this ellipse,

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.480
and then you can orient this
ellipse either this way,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.180
or this way, or this way.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.750
According to Newton, whatever
the orientation of that ellipse

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.020
was, it would not
change by much.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.910
That was what the
classical theory predicted.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:06.470
Except that what was observed
was that the orbit of Mercury

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.980
actually changed its
orientation with respect

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.600
to where the sun was.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.520
In astronomical
terms, we call that

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.370
the precession of the orbit.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.159
So this is something that
Newton's theory was not

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:20.825
able to explain.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:31.340
Then came Einstein and
said you have it all wrong.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.980
He actually said that gravity
is not a force at all.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.040
He said we know of other forces.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.640
We know of
electromagnetic force.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.290
We know how things
stay in place.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.190
But he said gravity is
actually not a force

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.730
but a geometric effect, and
he called that the distortion

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.800
of space and time.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.410
Even though the precession
of Mercury's orbit

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.900
was known at the
time of Einstein,

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.660
that was not one of
Einstein's motivations.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.770
He had other issues with
the physics theories

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.110
at the time that he
was trying to correct.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.720
He was trying to make
those theories, especially

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.140
gravity, compatible
with his seminal work

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.620
on special relativity that
he had formulated in 1905.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.440
But you might think, what
on earth does that mean?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.060
What does it mean for space
and time to be distorted?

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.900
Where did time get
into all of this?

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:42.670
So I would like to show you
with pictures what actually that

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.030
means.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.260
But first I would
like to actually

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:53.020
show you a copy of the paper
that he published in 1916 where

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.560
he first introduced the
theory of general relativity.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.430
And that is the theory that
forms our understanding

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.550
of gravity today.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.200
So he said gravity
is not a force.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.290
It's not a force as
we understand it.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:20.540
It doesn't actually have
an effect on other objects

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.660
because it pulls
them or pushes them.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.150
So you might think,
that's pretty

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.610
contrary to my
experience, because when

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.990
I shoot a basketball, I know
that if there was no gravity,

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.830
it would go in a straight
line with the same speed

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.800
and direction with
which I shot it.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.860
But I know that there is gravity
on Earth, so balls get curved.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.315
A fastball gets curved a little
bit less than a slow ball.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.700
So how are we going to
make this compatible

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.040
with our understanding?

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:05.260
Well, Captain Kirk would
say, this is a straight line.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.430
It's just a warped spacetime,
and this is a straight line

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.620
in that warped spacetime.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.930
So for a moment,
I would like you

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.410
to imagine that
you're little ants,

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.930
and I would like you
to imagine that you're

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.510
walking on rocks,
on fabrics, maybe

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.250
on the fabric of my jacket.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.740
And you think that
you're going straight.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.920
But the fabric underneath
itself is warped.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.620
And this is what
Einstein is telling us,

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.370
that the mass
stretches and distorts

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:46.170
the fabric on which we
live, on which we measure

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:50.190
our time, on which we
walk straight lines,

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.180
and on which we
measure distances.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.750
So again, looking
at the solar system,

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:03.110
if this is the sun at the
center of the solar system,

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.770
because of its mass,
because it weighs something,

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.670
the sun distorts the
fabric of spacetime

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:17.730
so that the Earth is actually
going in a straight line,

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:23.110
or rather it is trying
to go in a straight line,

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.010
but the straight line in
this warped space time

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.000
is the circle that
it traces out.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.490
Now there are other
consequences of this.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:38.820
Einstein said not only do
objects like ants and planets

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.090
move in straight lines
in this curved spacetime,

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.950
but so does light.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.400
Light also feels the
exact same distortion

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.630
of the spacetime
fabric as we do.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.600
So what that means is
that if we were looking

00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:01.380
at a distant object and the sun
was between us and that object,

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.650
the light that came from
that distant object,

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.290
the actual position
of the star would

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:13.859
have to go in this distortion,
what we call the potential well

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:19.380
that the sun creates, and climb
back out and reach us on Earth,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.780
and be visible to us, either to
our eyes or to our telescopes.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.530
Now because it has gone
through this straight path

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.880
in this curved spacetime,
when we look at it in the sky,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:38.170
we would actually think that the
light came from this direction.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:43.610
So we would assume that we
should just extrapolate or make

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.950
this line of sight
longer, and we

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:51.700
would see the star over there.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.530
Is this what happens?

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.070
Well, actually it very
much is what happens.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:01.900
And this was the first real
triumph of Einstein's theory

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.670
of general relativity.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.760
It happened in 1919
shortly after the end

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.490
of the First World War.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.540
And it was Sir Arthur
Eddington who led an expedition

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.760
to look at the positions
of the stars behind the sun

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.740
during a solar eclipse.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.670
And the reason that they did
this during a solar eclipse

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.540
is that the light of
the stars behind the sun

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.710
wouldn't be overpowered
by the sun's light

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.710
like it is normally
during the day.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.740
So what they saw, even though
you can't see it very well

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:43.930
on this image, is that the
positions of the stars when

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.780
the sun was directly
in front of them

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.960
was actually different
than the same star

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.180
when the sun was
not in front of it.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.610
So they measured the actual
displacement of various stars

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.190
in the sky during
the solar eclipse,

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.490
and it provided the
first real evidence

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.810
of how general relativity
was the correct description

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.980
of gravity.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.010
In fact, it made the
headlines of the day.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:17.440
This is just a small excerpt
from the New York Times cover

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.650
shortly after the expedition.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.130
Men of science, more
or less agog over

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.320
results of eclipse observations.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.010
It also goes on to
say that Einstein

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.520
thought that nobody understood
general relativity but him.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.580
That's all bogus, but it
makes a good newspaper story.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.320
Now with our modern telescopes,
we observe this phenomenon

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.840
that we call
gravitational lensing

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.150
everywhere in the universe.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:20:00.570
So not only do distant
images of galaxies and stars

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.290
look like they're displaced
from their actual position,

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.380
but they also look distorted
because light travels

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.470
through different
paths to get to us.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:15.450
And here is a famous
so-called blue arc,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.250
which you can see here.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.230
That was taken by
the Hubble Space

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.230
Telescope, our first
optical telescope in space.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:26.070
That opened many new
frontiers for us.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.490
And what you see here is
that this massive galaxy

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.630
cluster at the center
is in the line of sight

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:38.150
between a distant
galaxy and us on Earth.

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:43.340
So that massive galaxy
cluster actually

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.150
makes the light coming from
the distant galaxy travel

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.740
through its warped spacetime,
and we see multiple images

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.660
of it forming in the sky.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.590
So what you see here
as this arc is actually

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.980
a single object
that is magnified

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.826
through a gravitational lens.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.710
So let's take this gravitational
lensing, this distortion

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.050
of light one step further.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.740
And that's where it's going
to lead us to black holes.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.820
Black holes are the
ultimate gravitational lens.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.260
That's one way to
think about it.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:29.110
So what I mean here
is that if matter

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:34.240
or the distortions of
spacetime by matter

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.100
has the ability to make light
move in these straight paths

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.980
in this curved
spacetime, what happens

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.700
when that gravitational
field is really extreme?

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.240
It's not that of the sun,
which is, let's face it,

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.170
it's a pretty measly object.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.410
It's not even that
of a galaxy cluster,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.950
but it is something
with extreme gravity,

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.840
so that when light is trying to
pass through this distortion,

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.520
it actually loops
back onto itself.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.200
In other words, it cannot escape
from this gravitational field.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.550
If that happened, that
object would look dark,

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.250
because light would not
be able to actually leave

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.970
the vicinity of that
object and reach

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.710
a distant observer like we are.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.860
We are actually familiar
with the concept of an escape

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.860
velocity from our daily lives.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.400
If I had a ball here and
I threw it in the air,

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.520
I know that it would come back
down, because even though I run

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.520
marathons, I'm not
strong enough to have

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.860
a ball escape the gravitational
field of the earth.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.070
But if I put a rocket
under that ball,

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.000
I know that I could generate
enough speed for that ball

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.840
to escape the gravitational
field of the earth, right?

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.980
We know that.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.840
We have been able
to go to the moon

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:08.270
and even to further reaches
of the solar system.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.260
So what we are saying
here is that let's think

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.880
of an object that is so
strong in its gravity

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.240
that in order to escape
its gravitational field

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.450
would take speeds that
exceed the speed of light.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.320
Light is the fastest
thing in the universe,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.010
and even that would not
be able to escape it.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.220
There is another way to think
about strong gravitational

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.550
fields and black holes,
and that is possibly

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.730
a little closer to our
experience than this escape

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.620
velocity of light.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.890
And what that says
is that, well,

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.530
if we're actually
little ants crawling

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.740
in this curved
fabric of spacetime,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.200
it's kind of like
swimming in a river

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.530
or an ocean with very
strong currents or waves.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:05.590
Now, if those currents or waves
are somewhat gentle like they

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.130
are up here for this
fish, then that fish

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.950
can swim with the current,
against the current,

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.930
or perpendicular to the current.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.680
He has a little bit more
control of his destiny.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.470
But if that current
is so strong,

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.900
and it's headed
towards a waterfall,

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.690
no matter how fast
this fish swims,

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:31.650
it's just going to move with
the current underneath it.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.580
The motion of objects
around the black hole

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.040
are very much like
this fish trying

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.340
to escape its destiny
towards the waterfall.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.980
And mathematically,
we describe it

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.570
with the concept
of a light cone.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:56.720
Now, a light cone tells
us how with a given

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.940
distance from a
black hole-- let's

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.680
start with this
picture right here--

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.320
an object is allowed to move.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.980
An object is not allowed to move
faster than the speed of light.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:12.120
But beyond that, if you're
away from that waterfall which

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.900
we call the event
horizon for a black hole,

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:21.540
you are allowed to move in every
which direction that you want,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.070
including away
from the waterfall.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.950
So this is an observer
that is at a safe distance

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.240
from a black hole.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.100
But as you get closer and
closer and closer, what you find

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.150
is that your destiny, your
light cone, your future

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.180
is actually headed
in to the black hole,

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.766
and there is no escape from it.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.090
Now, that's great, maybe.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.790
Einstein's general
relativity theory

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.620
is supported by a
lot of observations.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.600
Maybe this logical
extreme of taking

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.790
that theory and gravitational
lensing to describe black holes

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.020
is OK.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.810
But really, are
there black holes?

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.330
Is it in the realm
of science where

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:17.260
we can say this object that
we observed is a black hole?

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.100
Or is it really still
a theoretical concept

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.260
where we say, taking general
relativity to its limit, that's

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.040
what we find?

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.560
What I want to show you
next is a little story

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.230
of how we actually
find black holes,

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.510
because it's a
complicated story,

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.390
and it takes a lot of effort.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.650
First and foremost, because the
objects themselves are black,

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.130
we can only view them
through their influence

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.940
on their surroundings.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.510
So we have to be a
little bit lucky in order

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.580
to observe a black hole.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.820
We want to observe
its stellar companion,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.850
or stars that happen
to be in the vicinity,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.050
in order to understand
what it does to that star.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.825
In other words, we want to
solve the Kepler problem.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.330
Instead of putting
the sun in the center,

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.030
we want to put the black
hole in the center,

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:21.870
and we want to look at what it
does to its stellar companion.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:30.640
What we do is look at the sky
first with x-ray telescopes,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.450
because even though they
themselves are dark,

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:38.410
because of their incredible
pull on their surroundings,

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:42.100
because of their ability
to strip stars of their gas

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.860
and matter and to swallow
them, they can actually produce

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.610
very energetic radiation.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:54.070
And this radiation is visible
to us in the form of x-rays.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:58.330
Now, our atmosphere
is opaque to x-rays,

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.180
which means it doesn't
let x-rays come through.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:06.700
That's great for human beings,
not so good for astronomers.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.950
If it doesn't come
through our atmospheres,

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:12.670
and we are here on earth
beneath our atmosphere,

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.430
it means that we won't be able
to see that kind of radiation.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.210
And that's typically
the first clue for us

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.610
that there is a black hole,
what we call a black hole

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.450
candidate out there.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:27.490
So what we do is put
x-ray telescopes in orbit

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.320
around the earth.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.500
And here are two
beautiful x-ray telescopes

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:37.960
from the last decade, the
Chandra X-ray Observatory,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.320
and the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer, both of which

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.350
have been real
champions in giving us

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.410
the first clues that there
might be a black hole,

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.092
either in our galaxy
or in another galaxy.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.120
That's great.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.610
We collected the
first piece of data

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.230
that makes us think
that there might

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:01.300
be a black hole out there.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.150
But remember, we are
solving the Kepler problem.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.240
We are not looking at
the black hole directly.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.220
What we want to do is look
at the stellar companion that

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.105
is orbiting it, because
if we can see its orbit,

00:29:16.105 --> 00:29:21.970
if we can see it wobbling around
this huge gravitational pull

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.130
that is caused by
the black hole,

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.400
then we can solve for its
orbit, and we can also

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.720
say how massive is the object
that is keeping it there.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.410
In order to do that, we
turn our optical telescopes

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:39.380
to our black hole candidates.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.110
This may not be the nicest
picture of the Magellan

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.750
Telescope you've seen,
but it is the picture

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.840
that I have taken on my
first trip to Magellan.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.570
These are twin 6 and
1/2 meter telescopes

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.020
that were cast in our
very own mirror lab.

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.950
And they operate beautifully,
and the University of Arizona

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:02.130
is very lucky to have observing
time on these telescopes.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:07.040
So one of the things that we do
is use the Magellan telescopes

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.310
to actually follow
the star that is

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:14.460
in orbit around the black hole.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.710
So we're collecting
little bits and pieces

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.110
of data like coins in a jar.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.770
And sometimes we even
bring in the big guns.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.590
This is a picture of
the Very Large Array.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.550
It's a radio telescope array
in Socorro, New Mexico.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:33.030
And sometimes there is
additional bits of information

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.770
that come from the
radio observations,

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:43.610
such as how far is the
object that we're looking at.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.130
We collect all these
pieces of data,

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:51.150
and we try to reconstruct what
it is that we are looking at.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.990
What we find is
that we are looking

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.440
at something very massive.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.820
So just like we can know
about how big the sun is just

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.660
by looking at the orbit of
Mercury, or orbit of the Earth,

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:16.300
or any of the other planets,
we can say with certainty

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.330
how big the object that is
keeping the star in orbit

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.480
is just by solving
the Kepler problem.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.880
There is a little bit
of luck involved, too.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.160
Sometimes the stars
don't wobble as much

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.850
as we would like them to.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:34.240
So sometimes these series
of observations take years,

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.060
and it's a concerted effort
between different astronomers

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.890
in different institutions.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:44.150
But when we are lucky, we
find something very massive.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.430
It doesn't emit light by itself.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.990
It is very dark.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.390
But it pulls everything
in its environment

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:54.590
and typically produces
those energetic x-rays.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:55.930
So we are almost there.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.900
But being scientists,
we are cautious,

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.990
and we are always
questioning what we find.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.210
Is it really a black
hole that we have seen?

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.040
There is one last question
that we have to ask ourselves

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.590
which is, is what we are
seeing a real black hole,

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.280
or could it be another
very dense object,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.650
possibly very massive,
and maybe it's dark.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:28.420
And those objects we
call neutron stars.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.960
So in order to tell you
what a neutron star is,

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.830
I want to show you a very
schematic view of what

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:40.420
a star looks like, because this
star at the end of its lifetime

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:46.480
has the ability to turn into a
black hole or a neutron star.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.930
During its lifetime,
there is nuclear reactions

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.670
going on at the center.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.220
And for those of you who
attended the earlier lectures,

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.420
we heard about
nucleosynthesis, how

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.980
metals are formed at the centers
of stars, and 90% of all of us

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.590
is star dust.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.980
And gravity, being
attractive, is always

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:15.620
trying to pull everything in,
while the pressure generated

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:19.840
by that nuclear energy
is pushing the star out.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.260
It's a delicate balance that,
throughout the stars lifetime,

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:30.170
is able to stay.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:33.860
But when the star
runs out of fuel

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:40.190
and loses that central support,
then gravity wins, everything

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:44.270
implodes, the center
collapses, and it leads

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.700
to a spectacular explosion.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.520
That is a supernova explosion.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.460
Again, if you were here
for Phil Pinto's talk,

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:58.700
I'm sure you have heard a lot
about supernova explosions.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:04.210
Here is the cauldron
boiling and expelling

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.239
the outer part of the star.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:15.810
And the very center right here
after that fraction of a second

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:20.219
leaves behind either a
neutron star or a black hole.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.590
And the outer parts
that are expelled

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.350
make for some of the
most beautiful images,

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:30.060
as well as some of the nicest
science in terms of how

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.070
different elements are formed.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:38.179
And this is a remnant
of a supernova explosion

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.760
several centuries
after it exploded.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.081
And it's taken by NASA's
Chandra Space Telescope.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.670
So in order to make more
headway between a neutron

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:54.170
star or black hole,
I need to tell you

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.890
what theory tells us about
what makes a neutron star

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.690
and what properties a
black hole should have.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.480
A neutron star
can be very dense,

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.120
but it still has a surface.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.030
There is still a force
balance between something

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:14.710
pushing against
gravitational attraction

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.300
and gravitational attraction.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.670
It's not the same
balance as in the stars.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.280
It's a lot more dense than that.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:30.270
Nevertheless, there is a
surface to a neutron star.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.040
It's also bright.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.630
A lot of times we see the
neutron star itself glowing

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:40.890
in radio wavelengths, in optical
wavelengths, or in x-rays,

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:45.250
whereas a black hole is
always dark at the center .

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.600
Furthermore, in order to
achieve this delicate balance

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.590
between forces and
still have a surface,

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:55.710
a neutron star can be
no more than two times

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.980
the mass of our sun,
whereas a black hole

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:04.090
has to exceed that limit and
implode completely onto itself.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.950
And it has to be more than
twice the mass of our sun.

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.240
So putting these different
pieces of information together,

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.840
all the data over
several years, we

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.210
can tell that we are looking
at a black hole in our galaxy.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.530
In this last part of my
talk, what I would like to do

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.520
is tell you how black holes
are connected to our origins,

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.150
because perhaps I have been
able to persuade some of you

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.990
that black holes are real,
that with all our efforts

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:43.060
we gather the data to study
them and to understand them.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.850
But really, this is a
series about our origins.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:50.950
How are black holes, which are
thought of as death objects,

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.640
connected to our origins?

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.980
It turns out they're
connected in very many ways.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.400
One of the ways
they are connected I

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.570
already mentioned to you.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.960
The supernova explosions
that lead to a black hole

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.500
are the very explosions
that allow the metals that

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.750
are formed in stars to be
given back to the universe

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.690
and to foreign planets
and human beings.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.070
But that's not it.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.900
That's not all there is to it.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:23.730
When we look further back in
the universe, what we find

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:29.370
is that black holes co-evolved,
evolved at the same time,

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.980
as everything else
in the universe.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.630
For example, the very first
stars and star clusters

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.620
were very massive.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:43.200
And this is what a star cluster
that got just a little bit too

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.230
heavy at the center would do.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:51.180
It would collapse into a black
hole shortly after it formed.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.090
What you see here is
that point of no return

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.730
that I talked about,
this event horizon.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.180
And these are various
circles of light

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.450
that were shot from the
center in this calculation.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:08.080
This is a real calculation
that took into account

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.610
all the interactions between
the various constituents

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.600
in this star cluster.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:21.240
So what we see is that even the
very first generation of stars

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:26.895
must have left behind
black holes in their wake.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.070
But that's not all
there is to it.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.280
Everywhere we look,
there is a black hole

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.960
that co-evolved either with
its galaxy or with the stars

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.430
that form those galaxies.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:48.390
So what I want to show you is
a movie from own Milky Way.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.860
This is actually a spectacular
technological feat.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.170
This was done with
the Keck Telescope

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.970
with the adaptive
optic system there.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:02.580
And what you see is how adaptive
optics brings into focus

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.980
these various stars all the way
at the center of the Milky Way.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.700
And on the upper
left hand side, you

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:14.280
will notice that
the date running

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:20.490
from some time in the mid '90s
to when this stops in 2006,

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:25.830
but we are still steadily
collecting the data in 2011.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.850
And again, what are we doing?

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.670
We are solving the
Kepler problem.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:34.650
We are tracing the stars all the
way at the center of our galaxy

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:38.280
in order to figure out how big
the black hole at the center

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.630
is.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:44.790
And what we find is that
it's at least 4 million times

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.620
the mass of our sun.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:53.290
And look at this complete
orbit as we zoom in.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.720
These are all
various data points

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.790
that come from
different observations

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:02.500
of our galactic center
over many, many years.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.390
Now how big is that orbit?

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.720
It's about 50 times the
size of our solar system.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:15.280
So from the sun to
Neptune, go 50 times that,

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:22.350
and you have to have well
within it four million times

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.450
the mass of our sun.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.660
And we don't see any
direct radiation from it.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.260
So that's what makes us
think that this red cross

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.080
at the center,
which is the center

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.910
of that gravitational
system, harbors a black hole.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.240
If we zoom out a
little bit, the region

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.510
that we just looked
at in that movie

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:49.240
is the one that is in
this rectangle here.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.420
This is without adaptive optics.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.660
And the move that
I showed you was

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.810
how this became so much
clearer when we looked

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.730
at it with adaptive optics.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.890
Now this is our own galaxy.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.080
Maybe we are unique in some way.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.960
No, actually, we are
not unique in any way.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:13.520
Every galaxy that we look at
has a black hole at its center.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:19.100
Let me first show you
the movie that if we

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.340
were able to travel
to other galaxies

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.510
and look at their centers
what it would look like.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.770
Now we don't have
that capability,

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:44.650
as I'm sure you know.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:47.770
But we do have very
powerful telescopes.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:51.860
And what we can do is,
with those telescopes,

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.180
zoom in to the
centers of galaxies.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:59.290
What you see in this image is a
Hubble Space Telescope picture

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:03.160
of a nearby galaxy.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.980
The nucleus of M84,
one of our neighbors.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:12.230
What we do is put a slit through
the center of this galaxy

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:16.820
and we ask, is anything
swirling around that center?

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.570
And the way we would be able to
tell if something is swirling

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:25.430
is that light would look a
little bluer if it was coming

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:28.130
towards us, and it would
look a little redder

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.410
if it was going away from us.

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:37.220
So throughout that slit,
which going from here to here,

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:43.310
we can actually map what the
gas and stars and everything

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.650
around that center is doing.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.860
And what we see is
a shape like this

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.040
that indeed looks
very blue, indicating

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.310
a very high speed with
which things are rotating

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:59.330
around that black hole, not
very different than the artist's

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:02.120
conception movie that
I just showed you,

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.130
and also receding from us.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.190
So we find these
beautiful profiles

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.790
that tell us that
gas and stuff is just

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.000
swirling around the
center of that galaxy.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:23.510
By doing that, we find
that every single galaxy

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:27.530
that we are able to look at
has a supermassive black hole

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.210
at its center.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.390
Which means that the
supermassive black holes,

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.840
a million times the mass of our
sun, or up to a billion times

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.530
the mass of our sun, must
have evolved at the same time

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.000
the galaxies are evolving.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.580
What I'm showing
you here is a movie

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:48.090
of how stars and
galaxies in the universe

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:52.660
are evolving under the
influence of gravity.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.180
The time is running
from billions of years

00:43:55.180 --> 00:44:00.460
ago to-- what you see here
is the redshift, which

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:07.270
is a indicator of time, and it
stops at about a billion years

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.900
ago.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.310
And here what you see is how the
temperature of that gas that is

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.860
forming the stars is changing.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:20.000
So what we find is that
as structure is forming,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.990
as these individual
stars form galaxies,

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.190
they also form the black
holes at the center.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:29.940
They are everywhere.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.700
They are, in fact,
so tightly coupled

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:37.290
that black holes know about
the properties of the galaxy,

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:39.660
and the galaxy seems to
know about the properties

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.410
of the black hole, even
though the galaxy scale

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:50.230
is much, much larger than
the central region that

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:52.480
is affected by the black hole.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.700
Remember, it's just about 50
times for our own Milky Way,

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.280
is just 50 times the
distance between the sun

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.440
and the Neptune, and
we are comparing this

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.050
to the entire
galaxy, and yet they

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.870
seem to know about
each other because they

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:10.760
must have co-evolved.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.630
One of the ways in which
they must be coupled

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:18.690
is through how the black holes
are fed in the first place.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.510
How did they gain weight?

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.690
How did they become
so massive as time

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:26.450
evolved in the universe?

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:30.280
So collisions between galaxies.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.430
Which we think happen
very frequently.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:37.940
Is one way in which the black
holes were fed fresh gas.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.840
What you see here
is two galaxies

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.220
that collided into each
other, and they stripped stars

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.520
from each other.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.900
So these are called tidal
tails because they have just

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:54.510
stripped all those
stars from one another,

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:59.160
and in the meantime,
provided a lot

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.910
of new fuel, a lot of
fresh gas into the centers

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.950
of those galaxies.

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.740
Here we're zooming
in at the center

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.950
and we're looking
at what we would

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:16.260
call the remnants of a merger.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.830
And this must be
one of the ways,

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.190
even though we don't
know exactly how,

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:24.460
in which black holes and
galaxies could evolve.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.110
Now that is not science fiction.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:32.560
This is actually an
image of two galaxies

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.595
that must have collided.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:37.810
This is the remnant of a merger.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:41.050
You see one center
here, one center here.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:44.252
And this is actually catching
them completely redhanded.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:52.980
Lest you think that we
understand all there

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.720
is to understand about black
holes, as I already told you,

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.860
we know that every galaxy has
a supermassive black hole,

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.590
we just don't quite
understand how they

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.510
know so well about each other.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.460
But that's just one
of the many puzzles

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.810
that blackwells present us with.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:13.380
So in the last few
minutes, I want

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.670
to tell you about a couple other
puzzles that are in our future.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:21.070
I could have picked a
lot of different ones,

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.830
but of course being at
the University of Arizona,

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:27.550
I wanted to share with you
some of the very recent results

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:32.150
that a team here that
I was involved in,

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:34.540
as well as colleagues
at Harvard University's

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:39.430
Center for Astrophysics,
found within this past year.

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:43.000
And it attracted a lot
of press attention.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.290
So the puzzle is the following.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.350
This is our galaxy,
somewhat schematically.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.950
This is where the electrons
in our galaxy are.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:58.390
And the red dots
represent the black holes

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:02.620
that we have been able to
find, weigh, and measure

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.750
the distances of.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:07.300
So they may look
very few in number,

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:11.245
but this is not all the
black holes that we know of,

00:48:11.245 --> 00:48:14.330
but the ones that we can
actually put on a map,

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.900
if you will.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.880
When we look at
the sample of what

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.770
we call "confirmed" black
holes, what we noticed

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:27.180
is that there are none in the
sample that are less than five

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.670
times the mass of our sun.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:32.130
Now if you remember
what I showed you

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.950
about outcomes of
supernova explosions,

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.890
I said less than two solar
masses, two times the mass

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.080
of our sun, makes
a neutron star,

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.570
and above two should
make a black hole.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:47.190
In fact, just above two,
three, four, five solar masses

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:52.090
should be the most numerous type
of black hole in our galaxy.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:55.020
If we look at a sample
of black hole candidates,

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.810
we should be finding
those the most.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:03.590
But instead, there is
absolutely none in that sample.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:07.720
So being very skeptical,
we said surely

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.330
this is because of the way
we're looking for them.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:14.620
This must be what we call
an observational bias.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.750
We are not looking
in the right places.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:20.100
Perhaps we are selecting
our candidates wrong.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:25.600
And we spent months trying to
understand if what we are doing

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.090
is influencing what
we are finding.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.650
And the answer was no.

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:32.440
It's not that we are
looking in the wrong places.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.300
It's not that we
are not following up

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.230
the right kind of black hole.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:39.130
They really are not there,
and we don't know why.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.190
It might be something about the
supernova explosion mechanism

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:44.890
we don't understand yet,
but this is something

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:49.590
that we would like to
explore in the coming years.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.680
And there is one other thing
that I would like to highlight.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.330
What you saw here is variations
on the Kepler problem, which

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.760
is a very powerful technique.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.090
We understand the
existence of a black hole

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:11.660
and we can weigh it by looking
at what circles around it.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.930
That has been
great, but we still

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:18.860
haven't being able to take
a picture of a black hole.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:23.210
I have not been able to show
you, look, the center is dark,

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:27.100
and there is stuff that
is bright around it,

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.820
but we are working on it.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.050
And one of the ways in
which we're working on it

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:35.140
is by looking at it with
a very particular type

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:39.310
of radio telescopes that are
connected throughout the world.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:44.080
This is the Global Very
Large Baseline Interferometer

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.100
Array, which University
of Arizona is a part of.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.010
In fact, we are going
to add a new telescope

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:54.610
to this array in
south pole so that we

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:58.060
can have a different type of
baseline with which we can

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.080
study the black hole at the
center of the Milky Way,

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:02.935
at our own galaxy.

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:09.800
Another way we're going to look
for it as the Giant Magellan

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.580
Telescope, which again,
the University of Arizona

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.310
is very actively
trying to build.

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.790
It is going to be cast
in our own mirror lab,

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:23.720
and it is going to be much
more powerful than any

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.190
of the telescopes
we have so far.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:31.400
So we will be able to zoom
in even further to that event

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.500
horizon, to that central part
where everything disappears,

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.180
including light.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:43.040
And finally, we also would like
to look at things in the x-rays

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.320
with higher focus.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.440
And this is the International
X-ray Observatory

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.580
that is being proposed as a
joint mission between NASA

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.040
and the European Space Agency.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.670
And we hope that if
and when it flies,

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:04.280
we are going to be able to get
x-rays very close to that event

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.520
horizon, to the center of the
black hole, beyond which they

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.140
disappear.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.500
When that happens, I
think this is the picture

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.640
that we are going to see.

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:20.290
What you have here is the black
hole at the center surrounded

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:24.620
by not only bright emission--
in this particular picture

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:29.770
in x-rays-- but you also see
that gravitational lensing,

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:33.100
that distortion that I
was telling you about.

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:36.610
What you see here is the
back of the black hole that

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:41.170
is being lensed, and we
kind of see behind it.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:43.870
You also see it
brighter on one side

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:47.320
and dimmer on the other side
because of that swirling motion

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.580
that I was telling you about.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.930
So hopefully, maybe
in another 10 years,

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:56.380
I would love to stand
here and show you

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:59.530
that this is an actual
picture of a black hole

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:02.500
that we have taken
with the VLBI,

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.450
with the Giant
Magellan Telescope,

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.570
or with the International
X-ray Observatory,

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:11.350
and maybe make further
progress with our understanding

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:12.960
of black holes and our origins.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.460
Thank you.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.650
We have time for
a few questions.

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:49.000
[? Feryal? ?]

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.400
It seems to me that
a black hole, when

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.540
it got in front of stars,
that it would make the stars

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:04.800
disappear behind it as it
would pull all the light in.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:10.870
Do you find that on any of
these black holes that you see?

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.510
The question is
whether stars that

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:17.080
happen to be behind a
black hole would disappear.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.470
It depends on how close
they are to the black hole.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:23.260
If they are in very
close proximity

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:27.340
and they circle the black hole,
then indeed light from them

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.690
would disappear.

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:32.680
And in fact, these stars that
happen to come just a little

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.290
too close to a
black hole are what

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:40.090
we think feeds them the
mass that they need in order

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:41.230
to grow.

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:43.150
Have we seen this real time?

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.340
No, we have not seen
it in real time.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.710
But just the fact
that black holes,

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:49.990
especially at the
center of our galaxies,

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:52.990
have reached the sizes
that they have reached,

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:55.600
and the fact that
we see stars so

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.170
close to the black hole at
the center of our own galaxy,

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:02.500
means that some of the stars
have wandered too close,

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:07.000
and they have disappeared
in the black hole.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.940
We have one more question.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:18.160
Excuse me if I have made
unwarranted leap here,

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:24.070
but in our solar system,
if we have black holes that

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:31.640
are five times the solar
mass, in any other galaxy that

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:41.450
has the same condition, are
those related to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.560
I'm looking at the
wrong microphone.

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.840
Well, let me, if I could,
repeat the question.

00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:01.260
So in our galaxy, we have
black holes that are five times

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.305
the mass of our sun.

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:09.725
Does that condition
exists in other galaxies?

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:16.780
Is that somehow connected
with compatibility

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:20.190
for life in those galaxies?

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.740
So this is a great question.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.530
Can we also tell that black
holes in other galaxies

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:30.380
don't exist below five
times the mass of our sun

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.780
like we observe
them in our galaxy?

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.000
And does this tell
us anything else

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.700
about the properties
of that galaxy?

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:41.270
Well, unfortunately,
those smaller guys,

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:45.110
what we call the stellar
mass black holes, somewhere

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.530
between five times and
about 20 to 30 times

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:52.640
the mass of our sun, we are
quite limited in how far out we

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.410
can find them.

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.140
We know of one in the
Large Magellanic Cloud,

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.870
and we know of one in the
Small Magellanic Cloud,

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:02.360
but that's about as
far as we've been

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.120
able to go with our
current telescopes

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.000
in finding those smaller ones.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.860
So the ones where a
single star circles

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:17.120
around them, their stellar
companion circles around them,

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.640
the data is all
from our own galaxy.

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:23.780
So unfortunately, we don't
know if other galaxies

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:26.630
have a different population
of those black holes

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:28.250
than ours does.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.830
But the supermassive
ones we've seen

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:33.620
in many different
galaxies, including

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:37.730
way out in the early universe.

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:42.470
Would you please
elaborate on what

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:46.880
you mean by the black hole
at the center of the galaxy,

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.340
knowing what is going
on with the galaxy,

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:53.120
and the galaxy knowing
the black hole?

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.850
Would you elaborate
on that, please?

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:55.550
Sure.

00:57:55.550 --> 00:58:00.410
That is one of the enigmas
of black hole science today,

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:04.100
and that is the relationship
between the mass

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.460
of the black hole at
the center of the galaxy

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.340
and the velocity,
the speed of stars

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:13.760
in the bulge of that galaxy.

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:17.270
The technical term
we refer to it with

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:18.920
is the m-sigma relation.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.210
Sigma is the speed.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:22.880
m is the mass of the black hole.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.020
And what we find is that
stars that have nothing

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:31.820
to do with the vicinity of the
black hole in a given galaxy

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.810
travel at speeds that
allow us to say what

00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:38.240
the mass of the black
hole that the center is.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.240
So we measure them
separately, and they all

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:46.970
follow a well-defined relation
in hundreds of galaxies

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:49.320
that we look at.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:53.440
Well, thank you very much
for an excellent lecture.
