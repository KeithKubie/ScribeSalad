look at these categorizations and

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
look at these categorizations and
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.669

of examples how to you know how to

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810
of examples how to you know how to
 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.099
of examples how to you know how to
categorize certain things so that we

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109
categorize certain things so that we
 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.679
categorize certain things so that we
know how to do but in in common language

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689
know how to do but in in common language
 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.959

memory is a very different thing and in

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969
memory is a very different thing and in
 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.600
memory is a very different thing and in
common language basically everything I

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
common language basically everything I
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.090

Washington you get these many different

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
Washington you get these many different
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.950
Washington you get these many different
examples and you categorize from

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960
examples and you categorize from
 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.030
examples and you categorize from
then you you recall very vividly

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
then you you recall very vividly
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.190
then you you recall very vividly
instances that happened to you like I

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
instances that happened to you like I
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.520
instances that happened to you like I
said precisely ones so I I remember

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530
said precisely ones so I I remember
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.740
said precisely ones so I I remember
vividly the birth of each one of my

first day of school happened to me just

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910
first day of school happened to me just
 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.840
first day of school happened to me just
once well I recalled my first day of

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850
once well I recalled my first day of
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.760
once well I recalled my first day of
elementary school and I recall my first

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770
elementary school and I recall my first
 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.040
elementary school and I recall my first
day of high school okay and I recall
