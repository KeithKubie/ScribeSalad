00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.590
THE ROLLER COASTER DESIGNED TO KILL ITS PASSENGERS

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:17.400
In 2010, architect and PhD candidate at the
Royal College of Art in London, Julijonas

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.869
Urbonas, from Lithuania, decided to attempt
to design a method of euthanizing people that

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.539
they might even enjoy.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.779
His solution- the Euthanasia Coaster, which
he designed and built at a precise 1:500 scale.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.149
It’s a roller coaster that could seat up
to 24 passengers and give them a good time

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.739
before ultimately killing them in a painless
and euphoric way. How does it work?

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.550
First, the coaster takes the passengers up
1,670 ft (509 meters) (which would make it

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.719
about 3.7 times taller than the current tallest
roller coaster in the world, the Kingda Ka).

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.260
Next, the passengers would plummet down the
other side reaching a maximum speed of over

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.789
200 mph.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.670
Up to this point, it’s been all fun for
the passengers, assuming they like roller

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.470
coasters that is. If they, like me, find the
free fall sensation to be extremely painful…

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.514
well, up until this point, they’re going
to have a bad time. And after, well… that’s

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:12.514
not the best either.

00:01:12.514 --> 00:01:16.540
You see, what comes next is that, after the
coaster hits the bottom, it then goes into

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.630
a loop, which at the speed the passengers
would be going at would exert about 10 G’s

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.580
of force on them, enough to drain their brain
of the necessary life giving nutrients and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.159
oxygen from their blood.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.840
Six more loops follow this first big loop,
with the loops progressively getting smaller

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.939
and smaller in order to maintain the 10 G’s
of force throughout the loops. With the loop

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.670
section designed to last 60 seconds, all without
blood being able to get to the brain, the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.939
prolonged cerebral hypoxia *should*, according
to Julijonas Urbonas, render the vast majority

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.560
of the passengers dead. (I’m skeptical-
and am going to have our resident paramedic

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.560
writer Scott answer whether this would really
work as part of an upcoming article on how

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.560
long someone’s heart would have to stop
for before there would be no point trying

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560
to resuscitate them.)

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.579
Of course, if any survived, they could then
just be run through the coaster again. Or,

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.570
as they’re all likely to be passed out,
at that point I guess someone could just shoot

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.049
them or lop off their heads or something.
They wouldn’t be conscious, so probably

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.659
wouldn’t mind if some less fun method was
used to kill them at this point.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.870
After all the riders are dead, the bodies
could then be unloaded and new passengers

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.520
put aboard, and as Urbonas said

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.420
Thanks to the marriage of the advanced cross-disciplinary
research in space medicine, mechanical engineering,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.690
material technologies and, of course, gravity,
the fatal journey is made pleasing, elegant

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.690
and meaningful…

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.680
In theory, only people who wanted to be euthanized
would be aboard the coaster. Further, the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.750
single long ride up to the top isn’t just
for needed potential energy, but also to give

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.599
the passengers a chance to consider their
decision for a couple minutes as they climb.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.910
At the top, they choose to get off if they
want. And, in fact, according to Urbonas’

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.530
design, the coaster would not continue down
until those aboard all pressed a “fall”

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.120
button, else the coaster would just stay there.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.760
Although, how they’d get down if they didn’t
want to die isn’t clear from the picture

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760
of the design…

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.400
But, according to Urbonas

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.959
The rider has a few minutes to contemplate
his decision and his life in retrospect. He

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.140
would find enough time to adapt to the height
and get through a series of imaginary fatal

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.050
falls, while realizing that the objects on
the ground are getting smaller…The slightest

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.849
movement of the car would trigger intense
heart-beating and goosebumps and most importantly

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.420
it would test your decision. Therefore the
very top of the tower is an ideal place to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.299
give the very last word.
