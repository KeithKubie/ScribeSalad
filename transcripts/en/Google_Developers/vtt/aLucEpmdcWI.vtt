TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.173
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:06.690
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.670
Developer preview
three of Android Things

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.190
is now available, bringing
new features and bug fixes

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.600
to the platform.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.140
For more details
on this release,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.980
including Android Bluetooth
APIs and USB host support,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.590
check out the post.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.340
The GitHub for Santa
tracker has been

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.220
updated with the open source
versions of the web and Android

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.320
apps from December 2016.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.340
Highlights and links to the
repositories are on the post.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.530
This is the Material
Design color, too.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.480
It's a new way to
create, share, and apply

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.500
color palettes to your UI.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.859
The link is on the post.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.900
We're increasing the
concurrent connections limit

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.270
for developers on the
Firebase Flame and Blaze

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.980
plan from 10,000 to 100,000.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.970
Also in Firebase are
some new features

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.660
of Firebase Hosting
and the Firebase CLI

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.090
that makes configuring
Firebase on your web app

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.640
and working with multiple
environments much simpler.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.190
Details and code
are on the post.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.570
One last thing on Firebase.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.360
We've released the
Firebase admin Python SDK,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.630
focusing on Firebase auth
token minting and verification.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.370
Code and links are
on this post as well.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.950
The Google Neural Machine
Translation System uses

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.570
state-of-the-art
training techniques,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.240
runs on TPUs to achieve some
of the largest improvements

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.730
for machine translation
of the past decade,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.150
and is now generally available.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.700
I've got three quick
updates about containers.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.560
First, we've started
to make Kubernetes

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.590
1.6 available to Google
Container Engine customers.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.020
Highlights include
increasing the number

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.850
of supported nodes by 2 and 1/2
times and fully managed nodes.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.590
Second, we're making
it even easier

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.380
to manage Kubernetes clusters
running in Container Engine,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.020
with significant improvements
to upgrading and maintaining

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.480
your nodes, including
automated node management

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.820
and node auto-upgrades.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.440
And third, container-optimized
OS is now generally available.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.940
If you're a Compute
Engine user, you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.700
can now run your Docker
containers out of the box

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.290
when you create a VM instance
with container-optimized OS.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.330
For details about all
these container updates

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.340
