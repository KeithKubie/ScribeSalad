00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.679
In order to become a butterfly,

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.449
a caterpillar’s body dissolves 
almost completely

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.780
and is rebuilt from its own juices.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.990
As inconvenient and even downright 
dangerous as this process sounds,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.120
it’s actually quite common.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.360
Butterflies are just a few of 
the 800,000 insect species

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.168
that transition from larvae to adults 
through complete metamorphosis.

00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:44.911
That’s approximately 85% of insects 
and 70% of all known animal species.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.183
But how exactly does 
a caterpillar become a butterfly?

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:50.564
When a caterpillar hatches 
from an egg,

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:53.451
it has none of a butterfly’s 
physical traits.

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:58.711
It does have groups of cells
inside its body called imaginal discs

00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:02.793
that will eventually 
become its butterfly parts.

00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:05.541
For now, these cells remain dormant.

00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:08.342
Juvenile hormone suppresses 
their activity,

00:01:08.342 --> 00:01:12.546
and prevents the caterpillar
from beginning metamorphosis too early.

00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:16.015
Immediately after hatching,
the caterpillar begins to feed,

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:22.042
building up fat until its rigid skin,
called a cuticle, becomes too tight.

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:28.360
At this point, a hormone called ecdysone 
triggers the cuticle to shed, or molt.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.503
As the caterpillar grows, 
it usually molts four times.

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.874
Then, when it’s nice and plump,

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:37.844
the caterpillar’s levels 
of juvenile hormone drop,

00:01:37.844 --> 00:01:40.825
which triggers it to stop
eating and moving.

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:43.215
A final burst of ecdysone

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:47.612
prompts the caterpillar’s cells 
to begin to self-destruct.

00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:52.955
Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues 
are almost entirely liquefied,

00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:58.078
though the imaginal discs stay intact
and begin to grow.

00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:02.844
At the same time, a second skin layer 
called the pupal cuticle

00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:04.757
forms underneath the first.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:09.942
One more molt exposes 
the hard exterior of the pupa.

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:13.636
Besides the imaginal discs, 
only a few tissues are spared,

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:16.136
including parts of the respiratory system,

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.056
the heart,

00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:18.276
some abdominal muscles,

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:21.419
and the mushroom bodies of the brain.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.537
The caterpillar juice then fuels 
the development of the imaginal discs

00:02:25.537 --> 00:02:26.456
into eyes,

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:27.438
antennae,

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:28.158
legs,

00:02:28.158 --> 00:02:28.920
wings,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.727
genitalia,

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:31.416
and other body parts.

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:35.578
Once its new body is built, 
the insect molts one last time,

00:02:35.578 --> 00:02:37.517
shedding the pupal cuticle.

00:02:37.517 --> 00:02:41.677
From there, it’s free to fly away 
a new butterfly.

00:02:41.677 --> 00:02:44.189
Even after such a dramatic transformation,

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.790
the butterfly does retain some memories 
from its caterpillar days.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.378
It’s likely the mushroom bodies 
of the brain

00:02:51.378 --> 00:02:56.529
carry important knowledge from the
caterpillar over to the adult butterfly.

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.319
How did such an involved developmental 
process come to be?

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.790
We don’t know for sure.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.002
The leading theory is that the caterpillar
is actually a drawn-out version

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:11.661
of a life stage that takes place 
inside the egg for some other insects.

00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:15.260
According to this hypothesis,
over millions of years,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.832
the larvae evolved the ability
to eat and live outside the egg.

00:03:20.832 --> 00:03:24.221
Regardless of how complete 
metamorphosis originated,

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:29.679
it’s become part of the life cycles of
a dizzying number of insect species.

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.551
Still, plenty of species get along 
perfectly well

00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:34.862
with a simpler developmental process.

00:03:34.862 --> 00:03:39.241
What survival advantages might 
complete metamorphosis provide

00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:41.961
to make up for the added hassle?

00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:44.391
For one, it keeps larvae and adults

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:48.041
from competing for the same habitats
and food sources.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:50.612
And while the pupa may seem vulnerable,

00:03:50.612 --> 00:03:53.722
this immobile stage 
can actually be a good way

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:57.495
to pass parts of the year 
when food is scarce.

00:03:57.495 --> 00:04:01.652
To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis 
might sound as fantastic

00:04:01.652 --> 00:04:03.913
as a phoenix rising from its ashes.

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:08.352
But these transformations are taking place
all around us, all the time.

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:09.822
From the Hercules beetle

00:04:09.822 --> 00:04:10.695
to the honey bee

00:04:10.695 --> 00:04:12.393
to the garden ant,

00:04:12.393 --> 00:04:15.794
countless squishy larvae dissolve 
and emerge

00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:19.834
as armored, aerodynamic, 
and nimble adults.
