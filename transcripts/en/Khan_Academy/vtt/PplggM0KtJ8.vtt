00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:03.525
- [Instructor] Liz's math test
included a survey question

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:06.742
asking, how many hours
students that spent studying

00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:07.865
for the test.

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:09.984
The scatter plot and trend line below

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:11.558
show the relationship

00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:13.773
between how many hours
students spent studying

00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:16.036
and their score on the test.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.252
The line fitted to the model,

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:20.333
the line fitted to model the data

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.117
has a slope of 15.

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:22.950
So, the

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:26.266
line they're talking about is right here.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.784
So this is the scatter
plot, this shows that

00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:30.795
some student who spent
some time in between

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.672
half an hour and an hour studying

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:35.833
got a little bit less
than a 45 on the test.

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.045
This student here, who got a
little bit higher than a 60

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.145
spent a little under two hours studying.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:42.786
This student over here,
who looks like they got

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:44.607
like a 94, or a 95

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:47.141
spent over four hours studying.

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:49.574
And so then they fit a line to it

00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:52.241
and this line has a slope of 15.

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:55.246
And before I even read these choices

00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:57.411
what's the best
interpretation of this slope?

00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:01.099
Well, if you think this line
is indicative of the trend,

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:03.801
and it does look like that
from this scatter plot,

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:06.024
that implies that, roughly

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.482
every extra hour that you study

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:11.598
is going to improve your score by 15.

00:01:11.598 --> 00:01:15.535
You could say, on average,
according to this regression.

00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:18.055
So, if we start over here

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:21.431
and we were to increase by one hour

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:24.338
our score should improve by 15.

00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:25.698
And it does, indeed, look like that.

00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:28.468
We're going from, we're going in the

00:01:28.468 --> 00:01:30.664
horizontal direction,
we're going one hour.

00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:32.031
And then in the vertical
direction we're going

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:33.299
from 45 to 60.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.121
So that's how I would interpret it.

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.127
Every hour,

00:01:36.127 --> 00:01:37.894
based on this regression,

00:01:37.894 --> 00:01:40.749
you could, it's not unreasonable to expect

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:41.964
15 points improvement.

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:43.779
Or at least that's what we're seeing

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:46.478
that's what we're seeing from
the regression of the data.

00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:48.145
So let's look at which of these choices

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:51.335
actually describe something like that.

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:54.161
The model predicts that
the student who scored zero

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:56.680
studied for an average of 15 hours.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.703
No, it definitely doesn't say that.

00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:01.526
The model predicts that
students who didn't study at all

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:04.259
will have an average score of 15 points.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.700
No we, we didn't see that.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.187
Students, if you take this,
if you believe this model

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:11.974
someone who doesn't study at all

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:13.473
would get close to

00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:15.637
would get between 35 and 40 points.

00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:17.685
So like a 37, or a 38.

00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:20.026
So, don't like that choice.

00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:22.314
The model predicts the score will increase

00:02:22.314 --> 00:02:25.212
15 points for each additional
hour of study time.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.566
Yes, that is exactly what
we were thinking about

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.998
when we were looking at the model.

00:02:29.998 --> 00:02:31.951
That's what a slope of 15 tells you.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.732
You increase studying time by an hour

00:02:34.732 --> 00:02:37.397
it increases the score by 15 points.

00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:39.168
The model predicts that the study time

00:02:39.168 --> 00:02:40.971
will increase 15 hours

00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:43.475
for each additional point scored.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:44.450
Well, no.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.641
And first of all,

00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:47.063
the hours is the thing that we use

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:48.357
the independent variable

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:50.125
and the points being
the dependent variable,

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:51.716
and this is phrasing it the other way.

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:53.491
And you definitely wouldn't
expect to do an extra

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.491
15 hours for each point.
