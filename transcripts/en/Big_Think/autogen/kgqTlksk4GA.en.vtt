crowd so we found it isn't the number of
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.660
crowd so we found it isn't the number of
contacts or the frequency of interaction

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670
contacts or the frequency of interaction
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880

activities they go to mixers and they

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
activities they go to mixers and they
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020
activities they go to mixers and they
look out everyone else is talking with

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
look out everyone else is talking with
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.459
look out everyone else is talking with
other people and they're sitting there

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
other people and they're sitting there
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.770
other people and they're sitting there
all alone in their head and so that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
all alone in their head and so that
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.060
all alone in their head and so that
actually can make their feeling of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
actually can make their feeling of
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580
actually can make their feeling of
isolation greater for that moment so

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
isolation greater for that moment so
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130
isolation greater for that moment so
being around other people is not what

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
being around other people is not what

makes people less lonely it's feeling
connected to other people that makes

loneliness and anxiety were treated as

loneliness and anxiety were treated as
 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.580
loneliness and anxiety were treated as
very similar constructs so much so that

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590
very similar constructs so much so that
 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.520
very similar constructs so much so that
one of the common measures of depression

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530
one of the common measures of depression
 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.580
one of the common measures of depression
that's used in epidemiology has as one

of the questions do you feel lonely our

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470
of the questions do you feel lonely our
 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.200
of the questions do you feel lonely our
own researcher research of others have

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210
own researcher research of others have
 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.430
own researcher research of others have
looked at whether loneliness and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440
looked at whether loneliness and
 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.260
looked at whether loneliness and
depression of the same thing and we find

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270
depression of the same thing and we find
 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.140
depression of the same thing and we find
them to be separate contracts their

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150
them to be separate contracts their
 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.050
them to be separate contracts their
separate mental states our longitudinal

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060
separate mental states our longitudinal
 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.150
separate mental states our longitudinal
research and our experimental research

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160
research and our experimental research
 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.990
research and our experimental research
has shown that loneliness leads to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
has shown that loneliness leads to
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.880
has shown that loneliness leads to
increased depressive symptomatology so

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890
increased depressive symptomatology so
 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.520
increased depressive symptomatology so
if no matter how depressed you are today

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530
if no matter how depressed you are today
 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.010
if no matter how depressed you are today
if you're feeling lonely today you will

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020
if you're feeling lonely today you will
 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.040
if you're feeling lonely today you will
be more depressed a year from now above

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050
be more depressed a year from now above
 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.450
be more depressed a year from now above
and beyond what your level of depression

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460
and beyond what your level of depression
 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.310
and beyond what your level of depression
today would predict because of the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320
today would predict because of the
 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.710
today would predict because of the
loneliness we also find that depression

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720
loneliness we also find that depression
 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.510
loneliness we also find that depression
leads you to withdrawal so a difference

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520
leads you to withdrawal so a difference
 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.830
leads you to withdrawal so a difference
in depression and loneliness this

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840
in depression and loneliness this
 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.330
in depression and loneliness this
loneliness makes you want to reach out

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340
loneliness makes you want to reach out
 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.999
loneliness makes you want to reach out
and contact other people be a part of

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009
and contact other people be a part of
 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.410
and contact other people be a part of
that group be a part of that

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420
that group be a part of that
 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.020
that group be a part of that
relationship depression is associated

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030
relationship depression is associated
 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.969
relationship depression is associated
with depressed effect but also with

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979
with depressed effect but also with
 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.919
with depressed effect but also with
lethargy kind of this withdrawal from

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929
lethargy kind of this withdrawal from
 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.499
lethargy kind of this withdrawal from
others and indeed with depression we

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509
others and indeed with depression we
 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.839
others and indeed with depression we
find over time people do withdrawal from

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:00.849
find over time people do withdrawal from
 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.730
find over time people do withdrawal from
others and that withdrawal and an

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740
others and that withdrawal and an
 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.499
others and that withdrawal and an
increased stress associated with that

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509
increased stress associated with that
 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.690
increased stress associated with that
leads them to feel lonelier so you have

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700
leads them to feel lonelier so you have
 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.240
leads them to feel lonelier so you have
this pernicious feedback loop but

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250
this pernicious feedback loop but
 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.100
this pernicious feedback loop but
lonelier they are the more depressed

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110
lonelier they are the more depressed
 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.080
lonelier they are the more depressed
they become the more depressed they are

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
they become the more depressed they are
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.120
they become the more depressed they are
the more they withdraw and the lonelier

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130
the more they withdraw and the lonelier
 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.860
the more they withdraw and the lonelier
they become if you look at those two

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870
they become if you look at those two
 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.229
they become if you look at those two
effects so the effect of loneliness and

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239
effects so the effect of loneliness and
 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.180
effects so the effect of loneliness and
depression is stronger than the effect

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190
depression is stronger than the effect
 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.520
depression is stronger than the effect
of depression on loneliness people can

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
of depression on loneliness people can
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.110
of depression on loneliness people can
be depressed for other reasons and

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120
be depressed for other reasons and
 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.720
be depressed for other reasons and
feeling lonely but many people who go in

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730
feeling lonely but many people who go in
 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.030
feeling lonely but many people who go in
to seek treatment for depression at the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
to seek treatment for depression at the
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.130
to seek treatment for depression at the
root of the problem is their feeling of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140
root of the problem is their feeling of
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.320
root of the problem is their feeling of
disconnection and isolation and unless

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330
disconnection and isolation and unless
 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.600
disconnection and isolation and unless
that's treated the depression or any

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610
that's treated the depression or any
 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.120
that's treated the depression or any
attempt to fix that is really just kind

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130
attempt to fix that is really just kind
 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.070
attempt to fix that is really just kind
of a transient band-aid it's not getting

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080
of a transient band-aid it's not getting
 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.960
of a transient band-aid it's not getting
at the root problem

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970
 
 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.569
 
the measurements of loneliness is

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579
the measurements of loneliness is
 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.000
the measurements of loneliness is
somewhat not obvious people know that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010
somewhat not obvious people know that
 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.289
somewhat not obvious people know that
they feel isolated they feel

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299
they feel isolated they feel
 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.059
they feel isolated they feel
disconnected they don't have others on

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069
disconnected they don't have others on
 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.309
disconnected they don't have others on
whom they can rely or talk but it's

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319
whom they can rely or talk but it's
 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.589
whom they can rely or talk but it's
mostly they don't have a confidant they

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599
mostly they don't have a confidant they
 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.869
mostly they don't have a confidant they
don't have anyone who affirms who they

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879
don't have anyone who affirms who they
 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.479
don't have anyone who affirms who they
are that's part of it now if you ask

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489
are that's part of it now if you ask
 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.670
are that's part of it now if you ask
people do they feel lonely there tends

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680
people do they feel lonely there tends
 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.740
people do they feel lonely there tends
to be this stigma associated with

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750
to be this stigma associated with
 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.660
to be this stigma associated with
loneliness I think our research has

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670
loneliness I think our research has
 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.369
loneliness I think our research has
suggested it's an inappropriate stigma

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379
suggested it's an inappropriate stigma
 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.229
suggested it's an inappropriate stigma
but there's nevertheless the stigma

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239
but there's nevertheless the stigma
 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.429
but there's nevertheless the stigma
associated with loneliness

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439
associated with loneliness
 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.649
associated with loneliness
so people under report if you ask them

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659
so people under report if you ask them
 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.020
so people under report if you ask them
do you feel lonely the under report but

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030
do you feel lonely the under report but
 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.149
do you feel lonely the under report but
if you ask them are there others some

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159
if you ask them are there others some
 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.680
if you ask them are there others some
whom they can rely to whom they can

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690
whom they can rely to whom they can
 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.920
whom they can rely to whom they can
relate in whom they can confined that's

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930
relate in whom they can confined that's
 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.199
relate in whom they can confined that's
when you start to see people admitting

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209
when you start to see people admitting
 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.080
when you start to see people admitting
this feeling of isolation there's also

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
this feeling of isolation there's also
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.539
this feeling of isolation there's also
the sense in which they don't have a

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549
