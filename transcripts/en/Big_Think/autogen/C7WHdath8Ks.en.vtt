meeting or in a legislature and that's
 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.730
meeting or in a legislature and that's
important

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.710
you know I think what really changes

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909
comfortable with women candidates
 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.550
comfortable with women candidates
whether it's for governor or for

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560
whether it's for governor or for
 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.240
whether it's for governor or for
president or for the legislature or

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250
president or for the legislature or
 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.060
president or for the legislature or
Congress then they're going to be more

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070
Congress then they're going to be more
 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.729
Congress then they're going to be more
inclined to make judgments about who

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739
inclined to make judgments about who
 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.430
inclined to make judgments about who
they support based on the candidates

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440
they support based on the candidates
 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.080
they support based on the candidates
positions on the issues rather than

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
positions on the issues rather than
 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.300
positions on the issues rather than
their gender and I think that will be

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310
their gender and I think that will be
 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:24.050
their gender and I think that will be
healthy for everybody

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.240
I think one of the the biggest

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250
I think one of the the biggest
 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.850
I think one of the the biggest
challenges today in America is the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860
challenges today in America is the
 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.530
challenges today in America is the
partisan divide that we have in this

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540
partisan divide that we have in this
 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.390
partisan divide that we have in this
country and I think that's not good for

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400
country and I think that's not good for
 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.460
country and I think that's not good for
the future of the country it's not good

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470
the future of the country it's not good
 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.680
the future of the country it's not good
in terms of solving problems and it's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
in terms of solving problems and it's
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.400
in terms of solving problems and it's
it's not good in recognizing that we are

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
it's not good in recognizing that we are
 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.570
it's not good in recognizing that we are
one country and we need to to figure out

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580
one country and we need to to figure out
 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.210
one country and we need to to figure out
how to work together to resolve the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
how to work together to resolve the
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.790
how to work together to resolve the
challenges that we face you know this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800
challenges that we face you know this
 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.039
challenges that we face you know this
country was built on compromise it was

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049
country was built on compromise it was
 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.680
country was built on compromise it was
built on people being able to to give up

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
built on people being able to to give up
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.170
built on people being able to to give up
a little something in their own

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
a little something in their own
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.120
a little something in their own
interests for the interests of the whole

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130
interests for the interests of the whole
 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.070
interests for the interests of the whole
and we've got to be able to continue to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
and we've got to be able to continue to
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.960
and we've got to be able to continue to
