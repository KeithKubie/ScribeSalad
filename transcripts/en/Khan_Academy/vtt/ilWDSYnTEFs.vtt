00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.430
I'm starting to take a little
bit more care of my health,

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.330
and I start counting
my actual calories.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.490
And let's say C is equal
to the number of calories

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.070
I eat in a given day.

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:18.770
And I want to lose some weight.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.750
So, in particular, I want to
eat less than 1,500 calories

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.250
in a day.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.430
So how can I express
that as an inequality?

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.460
Well, I want the number
of calories in a day

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.740
to be less than-- and
remember, the less than symbol,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.490
I make it point to
the smaller thing.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.040
So I want the calories
to be less than 1,500.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.540
So this is one way
of expressing it.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.998
I say, look, the
number of calories

00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:56.080
that I consume in a day
need to be less than 1,500.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.690
Now, one thing to
keep in mind when

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.970
I write that is obviously if
I eat no calories in a day,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.040
or if I eat 100 calories,
or if I eat 1,400 calories,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.040
or if I eat 1,499 calories for
C, those are all legitimate.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.770
Those are all less than 1,500.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.390
But what about 1,500 calories?

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.071
Is it true that 1,500
is less than 1,500?

00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:21.570
No.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.320
1,500 is equal to 1,500.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.880
So this is not a true statement.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.710
But what if I want to eat up to
and including 1,500 calories?

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.080
I want to make sure that I
get every calorie in there.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.320
How can I express that?

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.020
How can express that
I can eat less than

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.870
or equal to 1,500 calories,
so I can eat up to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.190
and including 1,500 calories?

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.900
Right now, this is only up
to but not including 1,500.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.850
How could I express that?

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.330
Well, the way I would do that
is to throw this little line

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.430
under the less than sign.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.810
Now, this is not just less than.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.440
This is less than or equal to.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.890
So this symbol right
over here, this

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:16.700
is saying that C is less than
or equal to 1,500 calories.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.860
So now 1,500 would be
a completely legitimate

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.700
C, a completely
legitimate number

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.274
of calories to have in a day.

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:28.440
And if we wanted to visualize
this on a number line,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.320
the way we would
think about it, let's

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.450
say that this right over
here is our number line.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.680
I'm not going to count all
the way from 0 to 1,500,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.810
but let's imagine that
this right over here is 0.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.730
Let's say this
over here is 1,500.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.800
How would we display less
than or equal to 1,500

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.110
a number line?

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.990
Well, we would say,
look, we could be 1,500,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.010
so we'll put a little solid
circle right over there.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.550
And then we can be less
than it, so then we

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.780
would color in everything
less than 1,500,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.490
and say, look, anything
less than or equal to 1,500

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.414
is legitimate.

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:11.830
And you might say, hey, but
what about the situation where

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.820
it wasn't less than or equal?

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.510
What about the situation
if it was just less than?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.130
So let me draw that, too.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.340
So going back to
where we started,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.940
if I were to say C
is less than 1,500,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.580
the way we would depict that
on a number line is-- let's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.050
say this is 0, this is 1,500,
we want to make it very clear

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.010
that we're not including
the value 1,500.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.700
So we would put an
open circle around it.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.720
Notice, if we're including
1,500, we fill in the circle.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.450
If we're not including 1,500,
so we're only less than,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.450
we were very explicit that
we don't color in the circle.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.647
But then we show that, look, we
can do everything below that.

00:03:55.647 --> 00:03:57.980
Now, you're probably saying,
OK, Sal, you did less than,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.605
you did less than or
equal, what if you

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.146
wanted to do it the
other way around?

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:03.820
What if you wanted to do greater
than and greater than or equal?

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.200
Well, let's think about
that for a second.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.900
Let's say that I'm
also trying to increase

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.940
the amount of water I intake.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.700
And so let's define
some variable.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:21.620
Let's say W is equal to the
number of ounces of water

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.330
I consume per day.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.730
And I've read that I
should have at least-- let

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.025
me throw out a number-- 64
ounces of water per day.

00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:39.150
There's one way I could
think about, where I always

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.760
want to drink more
than 64 ounces,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.870
so that would be W
is greater than 64.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.800
W here is the thing that
I want to be bigger,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.400
so the opening is to the W.
W is greater than 64 ounces.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.370
How would I depict that?

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.200
Well, let me do my number
line right over here.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.260
Let's say that this is 0.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.280
This is 64.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.260
If I wanted to make
strictly greater than, so

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.780
in this situation it's not cool
if I just drink exactly 64.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.740
That 64 is not greater than 64.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.080
I have to drink 64.01
ounces or 0.00001 ounces.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.390
It has to be something
that is greater than 64.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.310
So I'm not going to include
64, but anything greater

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.040
than that is completely cool.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.370
Now, what if I want to
loosen things a little bit?

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.280
It's OK if I drink
exactly 64 ounces or more.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:42.082
Well, then I could write W is
greater than or equal to 64.

00:05:42.082 --> 00:05:44.290
And the way that I would be
depict that on the number

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.220
line-- and obviously, I'm
not showing all the numbers

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.205
in between-- let's
say this is 0,

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:54.060
and then we go all
the way up to 64.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.070
Well, now it's OK if I
drink exactly 64 ounces,

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.780
so I'm going to fill
in the circle now.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.770
Here I opened it because
64 was not a cool number.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.820
Now, 64 is completely OK.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.980
I can drink exactly 64 ounces
of water in the day or more,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.061
and then I just go up the
number line just like that.
