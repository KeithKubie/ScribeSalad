00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now our optimizer will correctly change this to

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
ethos times zero plus zero, that's going to be zero,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
pathos times 1 times 1,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that'll be pathos,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and logus times 2 plus 5

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
will be logus times 2 plus 5,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and you might have already spotted places where we

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
could add other optimizations.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For example, wouldn't it be nice to just replace this with 7 right now.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So there's plenty of room for creativity in optimization.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we could do better with optimization,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but it takes creativity because we need to know

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
what we want to change and also when it's legal.
