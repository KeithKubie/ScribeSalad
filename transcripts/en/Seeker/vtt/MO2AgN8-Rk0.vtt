00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.160
Good news guys!

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.899
Teen cigarette smoking is on the decline!
but unfortunately they may just be replacing

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.750
cigarettes with something else:

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.310
Hi Everyone, Crystal here for DNews answering
your questions about adolescent adventures

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.160
in “recreational neuropharmacology”.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.880
We’ve covered both tobacco and marijuana
frequently on DNews, but now a new study implies

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.990
that teenagers may be choosing one over the
other.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.680
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University
recently published the results of a thirty

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.969
six year long survey of “Trends Among U.S.
High School Seniors in Recent Marijuana Use

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.539
and Associations With Other Substances”.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:43.109
The study focused on the use of alcohol, marijuana,
and cigarettes by almost 600,000 high school

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.710
seniors between 1976 and 2013.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.050
Good news from the study are reports that
teen cigarette use is finally on the decline.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.480
Study author Stephanie Lanza says “Our analysis
shows that public health campaigns are working—fewer

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.469
teens are smoking cigarettes,” but she followed
up by saying “we were surprised to find

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.460
the very clear message that kids are choosing
marijuana over cigarettes.”

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.820
A bold statement that is relatively devoid
of nuance.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.820
It is true.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.340
the study shows that since the 90’s, marijuana
use amongst teens has been on the rise with

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.780
22% of the high school seniors polled in 2013
reporting marijuana use in the last 30 days.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.250
But it is also important to note that 22%
is less than the 30% of teens who reported

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.470
marijuana use when the study began in 1976
and that was before it became legalized in

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.680
several states.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.080
Additionally in some reports, the incidence
of marijuana use among high school seniors

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.020
found in this study is being compared to the
approximately 19% that report use of conventional

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.610
tobacco cigarettes and it is easy to misinterpret
this comparison as “teens are choosing THC

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.950
over nicotine” but that is not a conclusion
that can be drawn here.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.230
In fact, we know that today’s teens prefer
their nicotine from other sources.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.820
Studies by the FDA and CDC indicate that Hookah
and electronic cigarettes are now the preferred

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.990
method of nicotine exposure and adolescent
use of both doubled between 2011 and 2014.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.689
This is a case of technology advancing beyond
the design of a scientific study and it is

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.520
this type of evolution that make data from
long term health studies like the Penn state

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.010
study so difficult to interpret.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.680
Data are just data, and it is important that
scientists and the media understand the limitations

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.819
and in some cases social context in which
that information exists.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.489
So are teens choosing the less addictive psychoactive
compound THC over nicotine?

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.939
Probably not, but I think we can all agree
that reduction in conventional cigarette use

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.519
is a universal good thing.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.519
So which is better for you?

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.209
vaping or smoking pot?

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.819
