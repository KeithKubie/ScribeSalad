00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.660
So now let's look an an example.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.814
Same peppers image.

00:00:02.814 --> 00:00:05.230
And look at the output of the median filter.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.060
Here I have applied an 11 by 11 median filter.

00:00:09.084 --> 00:00:13.747
If you notice, yes it is a little bit blurred out, but

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.140
the edges look quite good.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.756
Again, because it didn't just take the average and

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:20.367
replace it by a new pixel value.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.599
It basically took the one in the neighborhood that basically was the best,

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.396
the median score of that neighborhood and

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.160
replaced that central value with that one.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.880
Just to compare, this is the average, and this is the median.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.499
Average, median.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.870
Average, blurry edges.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.270
Median, sharp edges.
