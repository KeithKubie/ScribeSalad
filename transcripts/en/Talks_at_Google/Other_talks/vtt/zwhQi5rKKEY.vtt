00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.250
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: So thank
you, Fred, for coming along.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.175
Many of you will know--
in fact probably all

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:12.850
of you know quite a lot
about Fred, at least

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.140
from his public persona, if not
his blog, then his amazing work

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.690
in venture capital
here in New York.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.860
So Fred was a--
correct me if I get

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.250
any of this wrong-- a graduate
of MIT in engineering,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.652
then also a graduate of the
Wharton School of Business

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.960
in UPenn and then
pretty early on was

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.990
a venture capitalist in New
York City at Euclid Ventures.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.684
Then he founded his own
fund, the Flatiron Ventures?

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:39.600
FRED WILSON: Partners.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.000
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Partners.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.500
I'm sorry.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.400
FRED WILSON: It's OK.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.200
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: And then
in sort of the classic New York

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.660
City move, his next big step
was moving like nine blocks

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.580
downtown, Union Square Ventures,
which is the one, I think,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.540
we are all probably more
familiar with that funded

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.320
companies like Twitter
and Tumblr and Foursquare

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.811
and Delicious and a whole
bunch of other companies that--

00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:04.769
FRED WILSON: No one pulls
that one out anymore.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.250
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Well,
we know Josh Schachter.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.850
We, in fact, tried to
hire Josh Schachter here.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.590
So it's sort of a
bittersweet thing.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.434
FRED WILSON: Don't you
know he's unhireable?

00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:13.600
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: He
did eventually join Google.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.210
But then, did you see he's
building these robots,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.220
the whiteboard robots?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.357
FRED WILSON: He's great.

00:01:18.357 --> 00:01:19.940
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
So I'm not going

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.650
to go into much
more description,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.080
except to say that Fred is
one of the very few people, I

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.630
think, who have made a
significant individual

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.470
contribution to the
technology ecosystem

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.620
here in New York City.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.080
I think when people
around the world

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.390
think of tech in New York
City, they think of Fred

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.110
as somebody who's enabled that
and encouraged that and pushed

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.277
that forward and, furthermore,
is the voice of that.

00:01:41.277 --> 00:01:43.776
And so we're going to talk a
little bit about that, I think,

00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:45.900
today, but also about
one of Fred's passions,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.210
which is also a passion,
I think, of a lot of us

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.730
here, which is computer
science education, which

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.650
is in a fairly terrible
state and is really

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.270
standing in the way of
progress of the tech community

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.902
and the community in general
here in New York and elsewhere.

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:01.110
But with that, welcome, Fred.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.985
Thank you for coming.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:03.546
FRED WILSON: Thank you.

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:06.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.030
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: So
I'm kind of interested,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.920
first off-- you were kind
of in venture capital early,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.780
it seems like.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.930
FRED WILSON: Yeah.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.971
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: How
did you fall into that?

00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:16.340
Was that focused?

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.882
Is that something happened onto?

00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:20.840
FRED WILSON: It really
came out of the decision

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.770
that my wife and I made to move
to New York in the early '80s.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.160
And I had been at MIT
and was an engineer.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.640
I didn't major in
computer science.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.530
But I put myself through
MIT by writing software

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.120
and then got a job here in
New York writing software,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.210
but not for a start-up.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.130
And all my friends from MIT were
working in Cambridge at places

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.410
like Lotus-- now I'm dating
myself, because this is 1983--

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.170
or moving out to Silicon Valley
and working for PC software

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.730
companies, or even PC
hardware companies,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.130
which was the thing of the day.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.500
And I wanted to do that.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.445
But I was living in New York.

00:03:03.445 --> 00:03:05.790
And my wife was really
committed to staying here.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.950
And so I started trying
to think about how I

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.765
could stitch that all together.

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:13.720
And New York still
is, and certainly

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.830
was at the time, the finance
capital of the world.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.490
And so I kind of
landed on this idea

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.789
that I could marry finance
with technology and start-ups.

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.830
And then I discovered
there was this thing called

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.590
venture capital, which I
honestly never heard of before.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.170
I did a bunch of
research on that.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.260
And then I tried to get a job.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.730
And everybody said
you had to get an MBA.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.510
So then I went and got an MBA.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.290
I wrote my application
to business school

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.490
saying I wanted to be
a venture capitalist.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.634
And I managed to get a job.

00:03:46.634 --> 00:03:48.050
MBA is usually a
two-year program.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.544
I got a job the summer
between my two years

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:52.460
working in a venture
capital firm in New York.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.834
And I've basically been doing
venture capital ever since.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:55.830
That was in 1986.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.000
So I've been doing it
for close to 30 years.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.370
And you're right, I basically
didn't know anything

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.022
when I got into the
venture business.

00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:04.230
I knew how to write software.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.350
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, right.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.601
FRED WILSON: But back then,
that was less of a thing.

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.976
Now, we won't hire somebody
if they can't write software.

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:10.950
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Sure.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.930
Well, fortunately, it's a
little more common than it was.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.380
But it needs to be more
common yet by, I don't know,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.130
maybe an order of
magnitude, I don't know.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.860
FRED WILSON: Well, we have
this one young analyst

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.589
who works for us.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.150
And yesterday, he was talking
about this open source

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.600
messenger called Telegraph.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.400
And his way of doing
research on Telegraph

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.830
was to build a bot for Telegraph
on the new, launched-last-week

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.070
bot platform.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.750
And that makes so
much sense, right?

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.344
If you want to figure something
out, make something with it.

00:04:40.344 --> 00:04:42.260
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Keep poking at it, yeah.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.540
FRED WILSON: And so
I think that's why

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.032
it's so important in my business
to have those kinds of skills.

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:50.490
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, right.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.360
So how have you seen,
since the last, what

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.670
are we talking about,
20-plus years--

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.580
what have you noticed happening
in the New York tech scene?

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.830
What do you think of the
trends and where we're going?

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.900
FRED WILSON: It's night and day.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.360
I mean, it really
is night and day.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.140
If you go back 20
years to the mid '90s

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.370
when we started
Flatiron Partners,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.930
I don't think there was more
than one or two venture capital

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.190
firms that had real
focus in New York.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.450
And most technologists
would not choose

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.120
to graduate from Carnegie
Mellon or MIT or anywhere

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.010
and come to New York
and make a career here.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.410
The companies that did exist
were very vertically focused.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.640
So they were companies
that served Wall Street

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.620
or served the publishing
industry, which is

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.070
a horrible way to make money.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.170
And there weren't
that many of them.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.050
And I think today,
everybody knows

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.680
that if you want to
be an entrepreneur

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.130
or you want to be a software
engineer in a start-up,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.830
that you can do
that in New York.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.350
And that one thing, to me, is
probably 80% of what's changed.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.640
It doesn't mean that people
don't start amazing companies

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.480
in other places.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.890
And it will always be the
case that New York will only

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.624
be a part of the tech sector.

00:06:21.624 --> 00:06:23.540
But it's a meaningful
part of the tech sector.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.840
In the United
States, it's probably

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.790
the second most active start-up
hub after Silicon Valley.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.590
And that's a big deal, I think.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:35.720
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Yeah.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.600
So what is it about
New York that-- you

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.510
mentioned your wife
really wanted to be here.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.000
And you decided to
focus on New York.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.800
Even apart from
technology, what is it?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.320
And this is kind of a
self-congratulatory question

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.320
for all of us who have
chosen to be in New York.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.972
But what is it that makes
you want to live here?

00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:52.930
FRED WILSON: Well, I
think it's everything else

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.377
that you can have
outside your work life.

00:06:55.377 --> 00:06:56.960
I talked to a venture
capitalist based

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.870
in Silicon Valley quite
a few years ago now,

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.780
maybe five, seven years ago.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.980
And he said, you know, the
reason I like investing

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.060
in companies in Silicon Valley
is that there's nothing else

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.560
to do.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.190
So the engineers will work till
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.390
And he said, you
know, in New York,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.790
they all leave the office
by like 9:00 or 10:00

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.460
and then go out for beers with
their friends or something.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.590
And I said, that's why
I live in New York.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.330
I want that.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.876
I want to be able
to do other things.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:27.660
And I also think that
besides the lifestyle issues,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.380
the other thing that, to me,
is so amazing about New York is

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.550
that if you're-- well, let's say
you have kids and you're going

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.940
to a soccer game on the weekends
and you're on the sideline

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.010
cheering on your kids.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.696
Next to you will be
somebody who's a writer.

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:46.070
And then on the
other side of you

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.270
will be somebody who
owns a restaurant.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:54.070
And there will be somebody
who works in government.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.890
And then there will be somebody
who works on Wall Street.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:57.474
This is very--

00:07:57.474 --> 00:07:59.015
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
I think there's

00:07:59.015 --> 00:08:00.780
a cartoon about this,
where in the Valley,

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.929
there's the tech lawyer and
the tech writer and the tech

00:08:03.929 --> 00:08:04.470
restaurateur.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.180
FRED WILSON: No, you go on the
soccer field in Silicon Valley,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.960
you have people who
work at Google, people

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.150
who work at Facebook,
people who work on Sand Hill

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.230
Road in the venture business.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.271
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: And
they're not bad people.

00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:20.390
FRED WILSON: No, I'm not
making a negative comment here.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:27.320
It's just that there's
diversity of culture in work,

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.249
in life that you get
in New York that I

00:08:29.249 --> 00:08:30.290
think is really positive.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.030
And I think, by the
way, that does feed

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.809
into the start-up
ecosystem, as well.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.890
I think there was an
article-- I don't remember

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.480
the exact number-- but something
like 40% of the companies that

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.980
are started in New York are
started by female founders.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.260
Or maybe it was 40% of
the employees are female,

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.710
or something like that.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.640
That's because a lot
of these companies

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.790
are e-commerce-focused, or
a lot of these companies

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:01.610
are media-focused or
focused on problems

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.150
that women are
more interested in.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.550
And I think that
because of the diversity

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.550
of the kinds of companies
that get created here,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.540
you see a diversity
of employee base

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.200
that maps pretty well to that.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.590
And so that's what I think
New York has going for it.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.150
It's no more
expensive to live here

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.310
than it is to live
in Silicon Valley.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.590
That's not to say it's-- I mean,
it's ridiculous to live in New

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.090
York.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.007
That's our biggest
problem, I think, probably.

00:09:28.007 --> 00:09:29.840
The one thing that we
have here in New York,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.830
though, that I think does
mitigate a little bit

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.570
about that is that we
have the outer boroughs.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.020
So as Brooklyn gentrifies
and as Queens gentrifies

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.240
and as the Bronx
gentrifies, there

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.530
are neighborhoods in those
boroughs with good mass transit

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.310
where you can live.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.520
And I think Silicon
Valley struggles

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.490
from that because of its
topography with the Bay

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.060
and kind of constrained spaces.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.790
I think that New York,
even as expensive as it is,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.810
it's a little bit more livable.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.120
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Yeah.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.494
And we have lots of people
who commute in from out in New

00:10:06.494 --> 00:10:07.720
Jersey, for example.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.220
The hub-and-spoke
model of Manhattan

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.500
works incredibly well,
whereas in Silicon Valley,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.130
there's almost no hub.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:13.964
It's all spread out.

00:10:13.964 --> 00:10:15.546
FRED WILSON: But we
have mass transit.

00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:17.040
As horrible as
New Jersey Transit

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.115
is and Metro North is and
Long Island Railroad is

00:10:20.115 --> 00:10:22.452
and the New York City subway
system is, we have it.

00:10:22.452 --> 00:10:23.910
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, right.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:24.470
Correct.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.810
Exactly.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.934
FRED WILSON: And we take
it for granted, I suppose.

00:10:26.934 --> 00:10:30.340
It's nothing for me to think
about hopping on the subway

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.507
and going out to Citi Field.

00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:32.673
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Right.

00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:33.570
FRED WILSON: Right?

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.940
But that's kind of amazing
that you could do that.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.440
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Yeah, I agree.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.500
So what's standing in the way of
the tech ecosystem in New York?

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.860
What do you think needs to
be fixed in order for us

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.679
to get to-- I don't
know if we ever

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.970
get to par with Silicon Valley.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.540
That's also an
interesting question,

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.748
whether we need to get there.

00:10:50.748 --> 00:10:55.800
But what are the big
bottlenecks right now?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.000
FRED WILSON: I think
talent, to my mind,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.330
is the number one thing.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.520
Every one of our companies
has a voracious appetite

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.440
for, particularly,
engineering talent,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.910
but also design talent,
product management talent.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.050
I think New York
particularly suffers

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.500
from a dearth of really strong
product management talent.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.040
That may not be
true here at Google.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.080
But I find that when our
portfolio companies look

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.810
for product management
talent, they

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.630
oftentimes go hunting
in Silicon Valley

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.160
and try to relocate people here.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.460
In Silicon Valley, there was
the enterprise software industry

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.410
and the personal
computer industry

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.570
and some other industries
that taught people

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.230
how to be really good
product managers.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.590
And that discipline of
being a product manager

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.900
maps pretty well as you move
from software to web to mobile.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.549
And in New York, we can do
that with marketing people,

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.090
we can do that with
financial people.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.301
But we didn't really have this
base of product management

00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:01.800
talent.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.212
So I think that's one
area that's particularly

00:12:04.212 --> 00:12:05.420
challenging here in New York.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.440
But in general, these
technical skills-- and I

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.200
do consider them
technical skills,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.908
and I don't mean that
in a negative way--

00:12:12.908 --> 00:12:15.050
but you have to
actually really be

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.410
good at this stuff, whether it's
design or software engineering

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.070
or product management, and
really, really know your stuff

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.280
to make good products.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.670
And we still have
too little of that.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.810
And so everything
we can do to make

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.880
New York a magnet for
people to relocate here

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.900
or to create our own
organic pool of talent

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.760
is really important.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.218
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, right.

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:45.500
So drilling in maybe a
little bit to your portfolio

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.340
companies, or maybe
more generally,

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.990
to companies founded
in New York City,

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.830
what do you see
as big successes?

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.450
And how do we create
even more successes

00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:00.760
without having too many
Googlers leave and start them?

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.590
FRED WILSON: Well, the
companies that we've

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.620
been involved with here
in New York who I think

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:12.080
have gone on to build the
most solid and sustainable

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.780
businesses that are still
independent would be probably

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.403
Etsy, MongoDB, Kickstarter.

00:13:22.954 --> 00:13:24.970
I'm going to leave
somebody out, which

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.010
I'm going to feel
really badly about.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.980
Even companies like
Meetup.com and Stack

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.677
Overflow or Stack Exchange
would be in that category.

00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:36.510
People would point to
companies like Tumblr.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.750
But Tumblr got sold.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.150
So is it a great company?

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.910
Maybe.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.010
But it's not an independent
company anymore.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:48.480
So harder to really
point to that one.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.100
And I think in many of
these cases, one of the keys

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.520
was that these companies had
business models from day one.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.520
Etsy had a business model
the day they launched.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.040
Kickstarter had a business
model the day they launched.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.415
MongoDB had the open
source business model.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:12.490
Meetup moved to a paid model
relatively early in their life.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:16.180
Stack figured out how
to marry a careers

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.100
business with their platform.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.160
So I'm a big fan of, if
you're starting a business,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.300
you're in business.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.880
And you need to
build a business.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.360
And you can't just keep
making software and hoping

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.230
that revenue shows
up at your door.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.280
So that, I think, is maybe
the number one characteristic

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.440
I would point to that has
made these companies be

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.050
able to do what they do.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.640
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Right.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.077
So you mentioned the
talent problem with respect

00:14:48.077 --> 00:14:48.910
to product managers.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.350
And you were pretty
interested, in general,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.540
in, how do we create more
computer science engineering

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.840
talent within New York?

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.690
So tell us a little bit about
how you came to that as a focus

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.180
for not just your
sort of business mind,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.840
but also your
philanthropic endeavors

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.480
and what you're
working on there.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.120
FRED WILSON: Well,
for me, it started

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.800
with-- my big breakthrough
in my own professional life

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.860
was learning how to write code.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.160
And that opened up
opportunities for me that

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.820
allowed me to put
myself through MIT,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.300
allowed me to put
myself through Wharton,

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.690
allowed me to get my
first job out of school,

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.780
and even, frankly, got me into
the venture capital business.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.580
Because the first
venture firm that

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.930
hired me was attracted
to that skill,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.017
even though they didn't
expect me to write code.

00:15:39.017 --> 00:15:41.100
But they thought because
I knew how to write code,

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.300
I would be able to help them
invest in software companies.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.620
And so I guess I sort of feel
like this is something that

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.540
was a life changer for
me and probably was

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.539
a life changer for a lot
of people in this room.

00:15:53.539 --> 00:15:57.620
And also, just
looking at the trends,

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.760
it seems like it's going to
be more important than ever

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.140
going forward.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.410
And so if I'm
going to give back,

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.831
I want to give back to
something that matters to me,

00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:08.080
that made a difference for me.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.481
And I want to try to make that
available to as many people as

00:16:11.481 --> 00:16:11.980
possible.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.370
So that's where it comes from.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:19.090
There is also, frankly,
a self-interested piece

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.530
of it, which is, hey, if
we have more organic talent

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:30.660
pool to pick from, then we can
help staff the companies that

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.310
get created here in New York.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.990
And that actually came from
a couple of Google engineers.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:39.710
I wrote a blog post about-- this
is now going back at least six

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.570
or seven years ago-- about my
growing interest in computer

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.980
science K through 12 education.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.196
And a couple of
engineers here at Google

00:16:48.196 --> 00:16:49.820
left comments on my
blog and said, hey,

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.600
there's this guy named
Mike Zamansky who

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.070
basically runs a computer
science program at Stuyvesant

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:54.570
High School.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.820
You should go see him.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.925
And I did go see him.

00:16:56.925 --> 00:17:00.850
And Mike's been a
friend and an adviser.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.840
We don't always
agree on everything.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.720
But it's hard to agree
with Mike on everything.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:14.977
And that was an early
introduction to the New York

00:17:14.977 --> 00:17:16.060
City public school system.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.140
And what Mike has created at
Stuyvesant is unbelievable.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.000
I mean, literally, the kids
that come out of that program

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.990
go on to the best
computer science

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.109
programs in the country.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.710
And many of them
do come back here

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.250
because their families are
here and they grew up here

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.050
and they can now get good
jobs here, maybe right here

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:37.560
at Google.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.820
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Is
there anybody in the room

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.986
who went through Stuyvesant?

00:17:41.635 --> 00:17:42.760
FRED WILSON: We've got one.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.500
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
There's one.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.329
All right.

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.370
There are a bunch around.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.703
FRED WILSON: And so that was
like an a-ha moment for me.

00:17:47.703 --> 00:17:51.176
I'm like, yeah, we
need more of this.

00:17:51.176 --> 00:17:54.660
And then I got to the
social justice piece of it

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.440
from there, which was that there
are whole swaths of the New

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.360
York City public school system
where the kids never ever get

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.580
close to computer science.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.984
And by the way, it's assumed
that they can't learn it.

00:18:07.984 --> 00:18:09.150
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Right.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.774
FRED WILSON: And
that's the piece of it

00:18:10.774 --> 00:18:12.630
that really kind of bugs me.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.200
Because I think that if
you have the motivation

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.890
and the curiosity and the
tenacity to grind through it,

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.180
you don't need to be an
amazing mathematician.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.290
There are certain realms
of computer science

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.750
where I think that's true.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.280
But it's certainly not true
for all computer science.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.946
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
I think most of us

00:18:34.946 --> 00:18:36.410
spend our days
adding 1 to numbers.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.437
That's the extent of the
deep math that we do.

00:18:38.437 --> 00:18:39.895
FRED WILSON: But
there are people--

00:18:39.895 --> 00:18:40.330
CRAIG NEVILL MANNING:
And I think I agree,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.010
there are exceptions.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.580
But mostly--

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.955
FRED WILSON: There
are people who

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:46.181
believe that if you're not a
top achiever, if you're not

00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:48.180
a rocket scientist, if
you're not a math genius,

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.480
you can't learn this stuff.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.990
And I just don't
think that's true.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.590
And so that's the piece
that maybe really reeled me

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.560
in at the end of the day
in a most material way,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.990
is to see kids who
really don't have

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.270
strong academic credentials,
but are really curious about,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.877
how do I make a program
on my smartphone?

00:19:10.877 --> 00:19:12.210
And you teach them how to do it.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.790
And they just, boom, the
world lights up for them.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.190
And all of a sudden-- someone
called it super powers.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.440
Like, I have super powers now.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.560
I can do this thing that
most people can't do.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.860
And it gets kids motivated
to come to school.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.479
It gets kids motivated
to think about,

00:19:25.479 --> 00:19:27.770
what am I going to do when
I graduate from high school?

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.630
Am I going to go to college?

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.630
Am I going to get a job?

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.340
All of a sudden, they
start seeing opportunities.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.590
And they're excited about life.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.840
Now, there's other things
that can do that for them.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.210
It's not just computer science.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.634
If you fell in love with design,
that could do it for you.

00:19:42.634 --> 00:19:45.050
Or if you fell in love with
music, it could do it for you.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:50.750
But it lights up something
for people in themselves.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.170
And so that's the thing that
really got me completely,

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.169
totally into it.

00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:56.710
And I am completely,
totally into it.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.418
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Yeah, that's great.

00:19:58.418 --> 00:20:02.050
So given that you're an
expert on, basically,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.810
the various opportunities within
New York City to get involved,

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:11.910
I wondered if you could give
us a brief tutorial on what

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.230
the various options are
and what their aims are.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.830
Because one thing I have a
problem with is, oh, wow,

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.440
there's a new
initiative that I could

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.660
get involved in teaching
kids at this time of the day

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.140
or this time of the year.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.100
Could you sort of
map it out for us?

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.950
What are the interesting
things going on

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.280
that people should
be thinking about?

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.250
FRED WILSON: Well, the two
probably most well known

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:39.140
programs that have a
volunteer component to them

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.376
are the ScriptEd program,
which was mentioned

00:20:42.376 --> 00:20:48.390
by-- I forget his name now--
the guy who opened things up.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.486
It started out as an
after-school program

00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:51.860
and now has an
in-school program.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.330
And the cool thing
about ScriptEd

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.800
is it teaches kids
software engineering.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.480
And then the best performers
get the opportunity

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.149
to go into summer
internships that they also

00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.940
help place them in.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.050
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Wow.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:08.750
FRED WILSON: So it's not
just an education piece,

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.446
but there's also a summer
internship program piece.

00:21:12.446 --> 00:21:13.570
And they have hack-a-thons.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.520
And it's a really great program.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.950
And it's also a
little bit easier

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.590
in terms of the amount of
time that you have to put in.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.640
It's still a good
amount of time.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.147
But it's not a big
time commitment.

00:21:26.147 --> 00:21:28.230
The second one, which is
a bigger time commitment,

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.450
is called TEALS.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.340
It's a program that came out
of some Microsoft engineers

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.690
in Seattle who started going
into public schools in Seattle.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.640
And now TEALS is
available probably

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.800
in 20 cities around the country.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.120
And TEALS is, I think,
maybe in 20 or 30 schools.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.890
And there, it's a
more intensive model.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:53.320
You co-teach either an intro
CS class or an AP CS class

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.490
with a teacher.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.700
So you are co-teaching
the class with a teacher.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.530
Most of the time, you actually
have to go to the school

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:06.290
and be there for the hour or
the 45 minutes of the class.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.500
They are experimenting
with videoing

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.805
into classes, which I
think, if it can work,

00:22:10.805 --> 00:22:13.880
would be a great thing.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.760
And I think where that
model likely is headed

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.990
is probably more
into the world of AP.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.240
Because what's happening in
computer science education

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.659
is that it is now
really a growth thing.

00:22:26.659 --> 00:22:28.450
And there's a lot of
schools picking it up.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.360
And a lot of
teachers are starting

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.820
to learn how to teach intro.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.220
But the AP stuff is
still pretty hard

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.080
and could benefit a lot from
having a real software engineer

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.450
there, either there
virtually or there in person,

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.700
to help students.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.740
There's always that point
where a student gets stuck.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.320
And just being able to unstick
the student is a big move.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.670
And I think being a
real-world software engineer

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.157
makes it easier to do that
than if you're a teacher

00:22:57.157 --> 00:22:59.490
and you're still kind of
dealing in the realm of theory,

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:00.560
as opposed to practice.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.220
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Right.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.636
And I do like the
idea of teaching

00:23:02.636 --> 00:23:04.080
alongside a real,
actual teacher.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.070
Because they know how to keep
the classroom in good form.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.900
Because that turns
out not to be trivial.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.140
FRED WILSON: They do
classroom management.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.980
They do all of the
homework assignments.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.327
They do all the testing
and grading and deal

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:16.910
with the principal
and all that stuff.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.285
And all the software
engineer has

00:23:18.285 --> 00:23:20.290
to do is show up, co-teach
the class, go home.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.805
There is a little bit of
upfront professional development

00:23:22.805 --> 00:23:24.680
that has to be done just
so when you show up,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.430
you actually kind of know
what the curriculum is

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.596
and you're familiar with it.

00:23:27.596 --> 00:23:29.910
But it's not that much.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.380
So those are the
two programs now.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.630
I think there are going to
be more and more volunteer

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.280
opportunities.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.482
Because-- you know, I
can't say too much--

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:38.940
but in the next
week, New York City

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.300
is going make a big announcement
about a massive expansion

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.390
of computer science.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.580
And I don't want to get
out in front of that.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.570
So I'll stop there.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.536
But I think as part of
that expansion, I think,

00:23:49.536 --> 00:23:51.910
there are going to be more
and more volunteer activities.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.700
And the thing that
we've learned is

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.160
if we make the volunteer
activities more bite-sized--

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.565
and I heard that
Google has a 20-thing.

00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:00.690
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Right

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.700
FRED WILSON: So if
we said to somebody,

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.540
we'll take those 20 hours, and
you can give them to us an hour

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.760
at a time, or maybe
three hours six times,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.870
or something like
that, and we make

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.540
it really easy for
people to do this,

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.940
more people would opt into it.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.120
I think what we've learned is
asking a small number of people

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.280
to give us 100
hours is too much.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.622
It'd better to ask 100
people to give us 20 hours.

00:24:26.622 --> 00:24:28.080
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, right.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.538
FRED WILSON: And so I think
that's where we're going to go.

00:24:30.538 --> 00:24:31.779
We've got more work to do.

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:33.820
And one of the things that
we probably need to do

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.320
is use technology.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.040
You've got these
portals where you

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.204
show volunteer opportunities
to your workers here.

00:24:42.204 --> 00:24:44.120
We need to figure out
how to put our volunteer

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.766
opportunities into your--

00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:46.890
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Yeah.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:47.940
I think some of
them are already.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.020
But yeah, we should
definitely make

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.180
sure everything's represented.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:50.971
FRED WILSON: Right.

00:24:50.971 --> 00:24:52.910
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.780
And so the mailing lists
are great, by the way,

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.150
just to plug those again.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.070
And actually, before I
forget, I must say thank you

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.950
to Andrew Trenk, who's standing
down the back here, who's

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.890
been the energy behind a
lot of these initiatives

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.150
and also invited Fred along
and twisted his arm to come.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.380
So thanks, Andrew, for
putting us all together.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.680
FRED WILSON: Well, to
me-- my partner, Albert,

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:21.710
calls Google's New York
office team the gift

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.560
that Google gave New York.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:30.030
And I think that a lot
of what we talked about

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.030
could not have happened without
Google making a huge commitment

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.700
to New York City.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.050
Because you bring talented
people here to work here.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.300
And some of them bleed
off into other companies.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.060
But the opposite is also true.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.970
People come here and work
for start-up companies

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.910
that maybe we're invested
in with the knowledge

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.380
that if that doesn't work out,
maybe they could come here.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.410
CRAIG NEVILL MANNING:
That's right.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:55.830
Right.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.120
I think we've lowered
the risk a little bit

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.650
of coming to New York
and basing yourself

00:25:58.650 --> 00:25:59.720
in New York as a tech person.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:25:59.980
FRED WILSON: Yeah.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.646
And I think, also,
it was a wake-up call

00:26:01.646 --> 00:26:03.540
to the people who run the city.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.540
They're like, well, they
own the whole-- I mean,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.209
literally, this building is
like an embodiment of what

00:26:09.209 --> 00:26:10.250
we're talking about here.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.230
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: It
was the funniest thing--

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.180
for the longest time, we tried
to get people to pay attention

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.395
to the fact that we're running
a tech organization in New York

00:26:15.395 --> 00:26:15.610
City.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.740
It wasn't until we'd made
a massive real estate

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.280
investment that people were
like, whoa, that's interesting.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.030
FRED WILSON: Yeah.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:21.460
Well, New York--

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.960
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Sad, but true.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.100
FRED WILSON: New York
still is very much

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.410
driven by real estate.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.050
Most of the great
fortunes that have

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.260
been made in New York over
the past 300 or 400 years

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.340
were made in real estate.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:33.750
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, right.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.750
FRED WILSON: Because that
sort of was why that--

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.345
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
They're even funding

00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:36.703
a great presidential campaign.

00:26:36.703 --> 00:26:37.510
So there you go.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.020
FRED WILSON: There you go.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.395
I hadn't even
thought about that.

00:26:39.395 --> 00:26:41.247
And that's absolutely true.

00:26:41.247 --> 00:26:43.330
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: So
you mentioned government.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:49.430
So from your point of view,
how's the New York City

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.400
leadership helping, hindering?

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.890
What could they do differently?

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.120
What have they done that's
great in the last couple

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.090
of administrations?

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.400
FRED WILSON: Well, so I'm a
little bit of a libertarian.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.230
And there's a part
of me which says

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:04.980
that the best thing
that government can do

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.300
is get out of the way.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.152
And I think in large, as your
government has gotten out

00:27:10.152 --> 00:27:11.860
of the way in the
sense that they haven't

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.510
made life more difficult
for tech companies

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.050
that want to work in New York.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.850
And that's a good thing.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:23.650
I also think that the Bloomberg
administration kind of really

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.880
woke up to what was going on in
New York with the tech sector

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.370
probably about halfway through
the second term in office.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.230
And they did a great job
of amplifying all of that

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.920
and cheerleading it.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.690
And cheerleading is a big deal,
particularly from City Hall

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.427
to be able to shine a
bright light on this.

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:43.260
That's helped a lot.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.190
And that's carried over into
the de Blasio administration.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:52.110
They have, more or less,
continued every investment

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.060
that the Bloomberg
administration was making

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:59.230
in promoting the tech
sector, promoting

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.890
tech-favorable policy,
and things like that.

00:28:04.487 --> 00:28:06.570
I don't think it comes as
natural to the de Blasio

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.561
administration as it did to
the Bloomberg administration.

00:28:09.561 --> 00:28:11.060
Mayor Bloomberg was
an entrepreneur.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:11.290
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, he founded

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:11.880
a company-- a tech company.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.510
FRED WILSON: And
he kind of got it,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.490
whereas I think the de
Blasio administration,

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:21.370
they very much want to
continue that stuff.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.329
But I don't know that they
feel it in their bones

00:28:24.329 --> 00:28:25.120
quite the same way.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.786
So they maybe have
to work harder at it.

00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:29.180
But I think the large
measure of the government

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.515
has been doing the right things.

00:28:32.515 --> 00:28:33.890
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:34.950
Great.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.500
So jumping back
to your business,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.800
what are you excited about
in terms of technologies

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.960
both on the hardware side, the
software side, business models

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.730
that you think we're
maybe underestimating?

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.800
And I guess don't tell us about
the ones that are super secret

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.880
and that are still under wraps.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.980
Butt what's out
therer that we should

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.200
be paying more attention to?

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.080
FRED WILSON: You know,
our firm isn't, by nature,

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.920
very secretive.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:13.255
So if anybody reads my blog
or other writing that we do,

00:29:13.255 --> 00:29:14.630
none of this would
be a surprise.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:21.710
But we're quite interested
right now in the impact

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.310
that technology is
having on health care.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.600
We're particularly
interested in the impact

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.400
that technology is
having on education.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:38.627
We're particularly interested
in some new areas--

00:29:38.627 --> 00:29:40.210
so those are some
verticals that we're

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.400
interested in-- some
new areas that we

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.260
have been making some
toehold investments in things

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.680
like Bitcoin and the
blockchain, drones.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.350
And then one area where I
think we're sort of contrary--

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.860
although, Google is also
making a big investment here--

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.700
is in next generation broadband
internet infrastructure.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.870
It sounds like kind of a crazy
thing for a venture capital

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.010
firm to be excited about.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:13.250
But we think that the economics
of fiber and alternative

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.170
wireless infrastructure
is really quite good.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.610
We've got this really cool
company that's not here in New

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.710
York in Portugal-- well,
we found them in Portugal--

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:30.070
that is building wireless mesh
networks for cities using,

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:36.520
basically, an 802.11p Wi-Fi
device that they put on bus

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.042
fleets.

00:30:37.042 --> 00:30:38.750
And when the buses
drive around the city,

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.120
they're basically
meshing with each other

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.620
and provisioning
a wireless mesh--

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:41.870
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Wow.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.880
FRED WILSON: --over the
entire city, which--

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.660
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
What is "p," by the way?

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.000
FRED WILSON: What?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.280
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
I haven't heard of "p."

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.895
This is a different frequency
or a different protocol?

00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:48.103
FRED WILSON: It's a protocol.

00:30:48.103 --> 00:30:50.890
It's an 802.11 protocol
that's designed for mobile.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.540
It's designed--

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.706
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: I see.

00:30:52.706 --> 00:30:56.210
FRED WILSON: --for cars
and other moving vehicles.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.670
It's very tolerant of--

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.503
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, handoffs, yeah.

00:30:59.503 --> 00:31:02.260
FRED WILSON: --handoffs
and things like that.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.380
But whether or not that
company will be successful,

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.480
it's an example of an
alternative approach

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.220
to doing wireless broadband.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.600
That was very interesting to us.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.974
So those are some of the things
that we're interested in.

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:21.340
And we're particularly
interested in the blockchain

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.420
for things that have
nothing to do with money.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.420
We were talking with
a team here today

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.960
before we started who's
doing some interesting work

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.400
about saving logins
and passwords.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:42.290
And the whole issue of privacy
and security and control

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.199
and whether I'm letting
Google have my passwords--

00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:47.240
you could store all that
stuff on the blockchain.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.500
Right?

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:47.760
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Right.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.220
FRED WILSON: And
you're the only one

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.980
who has the keys to unlock it.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.180
And there are some
usability issues around that

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.140
that we have to make
this technology easier

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.007
for the average consumer.

00:31:58.007 --> 00:32:00.340
If I told my wife I was going
to store all of her logins

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.100
on the blockchain, she would
completely freak out on me.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.190
But as an underlying
infrastructure for that,

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.610
it actually is quite good.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:10.080
So that's another
area that we've

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.510
been poking around at a lot.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.720
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Right.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.970
And to your point, it seems
like one of the challenges

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.960
is making this stuff
understandable to people

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.804
and presenting it in a way
that's more consumer-friendly.

00:32:20.804 --> 00:32:22.970
FRED WILSON: Although, you
can do that with product.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:23.750
You don't have to do that with--

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:24.340
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
No, no, no.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:24.860
Right, exactly.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:25.790
FRED WILSON: You don't
have to do that with words.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.420
You could just--

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.920
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: But it
feels like the Bitcoin universe

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.250
is populated with
nerds like us, who

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.892
geek out on the nature of how
exactly the blockchain works.

00:32:33.892 --> 00:32:36.225
FRED WILSON: Yeah, the Bitcoin
world needs a Steve Jobs.

00:32:36.225 --> 00:32:39.550
It needs somebody who can see
the power of the technology

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.720
and make it just easy to use.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.470
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Right, right, right.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.780
The good and bad news, it
feels like, about Bitcoin

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.654
and the blockchain is
it's not on the evening

00:32:47.654 --> 00:32:49.530
news every evening
like it used to be.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:49.820
FRED WILSON: Right

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:49.935
CRAIG NEVILL
MANNING: FRED WILSON:

00:32:49.935 --> 00:32:52.777
And so maybe it's maturing
behind the scenes.

00:32:52.777 --> 00:32:54.360
You, presumably,
know more about this.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.970
It's becoming a more
mature technology.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.190
FRED WILSON: Yeah.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.900
But I do think that the jury
is still out on whether or not

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.660
it's going to be TCP/IP or it's
going to be token ring, right?

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.110
Is it going to be the thing
that becomes the standard

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.260
and everybody that gets
behind it, it opens up

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.670
all sorts of new possibilities?

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.910
Or is it going to be
something that ultimately

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.570
was a really great piece
of engineering that--

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.153
CRAIG NEVILL MANNING:
There's probably

00:33:19.153 --> 00:33:20.740
a couple of IBM
people sobbing quietly

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.277
when you say "token ring."

00:33:22.277 --> 00:33:23.860
FRED WILSON: Yeah,
that dates me, too.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.640
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Yeah.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.015
FRED WILSON: A
lot of people have

00:33:26.015 --> 00:33:30.447
no idea what token ring
is-- for good reason.

00:33:30.447 --> 00:33:32.280
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
And another investment

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.490
you briefly mentioned
was this drone idea,

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.590
which I don't know whether it's
a small idea or a big idea.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.410
But maybe you can
describe what the--

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:40.330
FRED WILSON: Well, the
company that we invested

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:41.630
in is called DroneBase.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.320
And it's really kind
of an obvious idea.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.090
Instead of buying
a drone yourself,

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.840
just hire a drone pilot.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.790
And they've made it
so expensive now.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.640
For $399, you can go on
the web to dronebase.com.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.950
You can pull up a Google map,
which basically their whole UI

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.930
is built on top of Google Maps.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.400
Just map out where you
want the pilot to fly.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.200
Hit Send.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.210
And give them your credit card.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.620
And about a day
or two later, you

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.860
get what is kind of like
a dropbox full of imagery.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.389
And you can do whatever
you want with it.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:23.120
And it sounds like, OK,
that's kind of interesting.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.260
But how many applications
are there for that?

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.380
It turns out that there's a
lot of applications for that,

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.816
way more than I ever, ever, ever
thought that there would be.

00:34:32.816 --> 00:34:34.190
And you tell people
about it, you

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.570
tell people who are in
real estate or construction

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:40.170
or run a manufacturing business
or run an agricultural business

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.940
or run a mine or they
run any kind of business

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.050
that has a physical
plant, and they're like,

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.790
oh, do you mean that I
could have somebody come

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.570
do a scan of my facade
to make sure that I'm

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.800
in compliance with local law 5?

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.230
And I'm like, I don't know.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.731
I think so.

00:34:56.731 --> 00:34:57.855
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Yeah.

00:34:57.855 --> 00:34:59.650
FRED WILSON: Boom,
another application.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:00.300
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Yeah.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.633
Yeah, the physical world is fun.

00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:04.190
I think we operate so much
in the virtual world and apps

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.780
on the internet and
on phones and so on.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.720
Actually, the world
is becoming more

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.840
and more interesting
as this technology

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.625
impinges on physical reality.

00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:14.583
FRED WILSON: Well, the
way I think about drones

00:35:14.583 --> 00:35:19.280
is that drones are probably
the easiest form of robotics

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.550
for society to adopt,
because they fly,

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.890
as opposed to having to
walk or something like that.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:30.360
So the number of
things that you need

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.350
to tell the drone to do
relative to a robot, I think,

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.150
are a lot easier.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.316
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Right.

00:35:36.316 --> 00:35:38.180
FRED WILSON: And
so I think drones--

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.400
I guess I already said it--
but I think drones are maybe

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:47.760
the first big mainstream
application of robotics

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.140
to hit society.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:49.480
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Yeah.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.190
That's an interesting point.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.810
Apart from vacuum
cleaners, apart

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.760
from Roombas going
around on the floor.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.070
And that's only two dimensions.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:56.426
FRED WILSON: Right

00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:58.509
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: So
clearly less interesting.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.530
So is there anything else you'd
like to share with us, anything

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.800
we haven't covered that
you're excited about

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.426
or you're worried about or--?

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:17.570
FRED WILSON: Well, you know,
I'm a professional worrier.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.210
So I worry about a lot of stuff.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:24.195
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: We've
only got another five minutes.

00:36:24.195 --> 00:36:26.170
FRED WILSON: I would
say that I worry

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:30.380
that the world we live
in-- and I'm using "we"

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.850
maybe more to speak about
the venture capital industry,

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.680
or maybe entrepreneurs, but
I think it's probably also

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.800
true for people who
work in technology--

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.460
is a very optimistic world.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.962
And we think that, oh, we
can solve that problem,

00:36:42.962 --> 00:36:45.170
we can solve that problem,
we can solve that problem,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.628
not worry about that problem,
not worry about that problem.

00:36:47.628 --> 00:36:54.580
But there are a lot of problems
that we face as a society--

00:36:54.580 --> 00:37:00.320
everything from global
warming to terrorism and lots

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.830
of other things in between.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:06.650
And I think that we, in
the technology world,

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.950
sometimes live in our
own little bubble,

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.490
where things are going
so great and there's

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:14.090
all these new technologies
coming along like drones,

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:17.000
like the blockchain,
other things that we

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.060
can get excited about.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:22.930
And so I always worry
that something's

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:27.570
going to come out of left
field and catch us by surprise

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.730
and we're going to be
having to deal with it.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.170
I mean, we've been through
that in New York with 9/11.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:38.142
and other things
that have happened.

00:37:38.142 --> 00:37:39.850
So we've lived through
that a little bit.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:47.260
So I'm not like
a crazy optimist.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.030
But I'm also not
pessimistic, either.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.330
I'm kind of in the middle.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.860
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Maybe we
should, if you're up for it,

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.560
take some questions--

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.170
FRED WILSON: Yeah, I'd love to.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.590
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
--from the audience.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.256
If you want to step
up to the microphone

00:37:56.256 --> 00:37:57.900
if you've got any
questions-- yeah,

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.102
there's somebody over there.

00:38:01.514 --> 00:38:02.680
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.080
FRED WILSON: Yeah, my pleasure.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.330
AUDIENCE: My question, I
haven't formulated it, maybe,

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:06.830
well enough.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.690
So let me know if it's
completely unclear.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.860
So in regards to computer
science education, if you said,

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.530
oh, it's very important
we teach kids Python,

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:19.112
or, it's very important we teach
kids JavaScript, you'd say,

00:38:19.112 --> 00:38:21.320
that's kind of the wrong
level of granularity, right?

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.653
Like, it doesn't really matter
which language you teach,

00:38:23.653 --> 00:38:25.590
you can always
pick up a new one.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.490
And I guess I'm
curious how you'd

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.650
respond to the
assertion that maybe

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:33.110
coding itself is the wrong
level of granularity to teach

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:33.610
to kids.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.130
I hear so much focus
around learning to code,

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.030
learning to code,
learning to code.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.872
And is there a more
general set of skills

00:38:39.872 --> 00:38:42.080
that we should be teaching
rather than coding itself?

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:42.930
FRED WILSON: Yeah.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:48.285
Coding is, in my mind, a proxy
for the basic skill of telling

00:38:48.285 --> 00:38:50.210
a machine what to do.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:53.080
That's the thing that I want
everybody to know how to do.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.420
Because I think
that we, as society,

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.810
are going to rely more and
more on machines to do things

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.800
that we want them to do.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.680
And I think that the
basic thing-- like,

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.360
I know how to tell a
machine what to do.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.900
I know how to write
a set of instructions

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.617
that a machine can process.

00:39:10.617 --> 00:39:12.450
So [? Leanne, ?] who's
here in the audience,

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:16.636
I think-- who used to
teach computer science,

00:39:16.636 --> 00:39:18.760
maybe some days still does
teach computer science--

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.950
told me that she likes to
start kids off with robots.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.670
And I said, why do you do that?

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.640
And she said, well,
because it teaches them

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.000
very quickly that the
instructions that they gave

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.290
the machine were incorrect
when the robot smashes

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.270
into the wall.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.970
And that's the
fundamental thing.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.800
The fundamental
thing that I want

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.980
to make sure people understand
is the art and science

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.000
and techniques of instructing
machines what to do.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.520
And unfortunately, that's not
as sexy as the word "coding."

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.100
So we use the word "coding."

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.780
But I think what we really
mean is whatever technique

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.380
is required for humans to
tell machines what to do,

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.290
is the thing I want
us to be teaching.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:58.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.084
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: We've
got somebody over here.

00:40:00.084 --> 00:40:00.667
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:40:00.667 --> 00:40:02.530
Thanks for coming.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.760
I have this question
regarding your views

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.860
about the Indian
start-up ecosystem.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.860
Are you involved in it?

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.860
How do you see it going?

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.474
And do you see yourself
being involved in it?

00:40:13.474 --> 00:40:14.890
FRED WILSON: Well,
so I don't know

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.790
a ton about the Indian
start-up ecosystem

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.420
because we don't
invest in India.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.680
Our general rule
is if we can get

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.379
to a company within a six
or seven-hour plane ride,

00:40:25.379 --> 00:40:26.170
we'll invest there.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.150
So that basically
is a big circle

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.600
that you draw around New York.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.640
And it kind of gets
to most of Canada

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.760
and most of Western Europe and
a little bit of Latin America

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.510
and all of the West Coast.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:45.070
And that has to
do with just being

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.870
able to visit our
investments relatively

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:51.800
frequently without having
to put people on the ground

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.830
somewhere else.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.340
But what I know is that, with
the exception of probably

00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:02.800
China, India has
the most significant

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.270
entrepreneurial community.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.810
And in some ways, I think
the Indian entrepreneurial

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:08.930
community is more
sustainable and more healthy

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.900
because it's a real economy.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.930
In China, there's a lot
of government support

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:18.950
and protection for
their companies.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.660
And that's not
the case in India.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.490
So I think Indian entrepreneurs
are building great companies

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:24.954
in the same way
that entrepreneurs

00:41:24.954 --> 00:41:26.620
build great companies
here in the States

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.110
or in Western Europe.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.330
And there's a lot
of people in India

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:36.381
who have gone back to India
and brought back lessons

00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:38.130
that they've learned
working in technology

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.770
companies in the States.

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:45.040
And that's also, I think,
generating a lot of the growing

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.830
vitality over there.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.516
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:48.516 --> 00:41:50.370
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
We have somebody here.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:54.430
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
the troubles with NJ Transit.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.030
So I live in New Jersey,
as do many people here.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.560
And between the devastation
of Hurricane Sandy and then

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.180
Hurricane Christie, I guess
in the opposite order,

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.950
we're facing a bit of a crisis
with the Hudson rail tunnels.

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.319
There are only two tubes.

00:42:09.319 --> 00:42:10.360
They're damaged by Sandy.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.190
And the ARC Tunnel
isn't happening.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:16.210
So what do you think is the
role that tech companies here,

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:20.390
who are facing a potential
housing shortage when

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.179
those tunnels go in
for repair, what's

00:42:22.179 --> 00:42:23.720
the role that you
think they can play

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.017
in helping solve this problem?

00:42:25.017 --> 00:42:27.100
FRED WILSON: Well, I think
the solution is they've

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.190
got to build another tunnel.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.360
Right?

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:28.940
I mean--

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:29.620
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.730
FRED WILSON: --that
is the solution.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.940
And I think this is
a political problem.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.310
It's not a technical problem.

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.910
And it's not a
financial problem.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.740
There just isn't
the political will.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:51.580
And part of the problem is that
the New York transit ecosystem

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.110
is not a centralized system.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.100
There are lots of
different governing bodies,

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.560
and so on and so forth.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.470
So I think what the large
employers in New York City--

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.090
and it's not just
the tech companies,

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:07.240
but certainly Google would be
an important one, along with JP

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.840
Morgan and Goldman Sachs and a
bunch of other big companies.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.740
I think that the leaders
of those companies

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:22.670
need to go to the people who are
in control of these decisions

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.010
and demand it.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:29.099
I think that decision that
Christie made probably

00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:31.390
will go down in history as
one of the dumbest decisions

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.350
ever in the history of the
development of the New York

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:35.400
metropolitan area.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.450
It's a huge problem.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:40.110
And so I think the
employers in New York

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.460
need to get involved in creating
the political will to turn

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.530
that decision around.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.810
And now we're set back,
whatever, five, seven years.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.602
But we're not set back forever.

00:43:49.602 --> 00:43:50.935
AUDIENCE: Can we have your help?

00:43:50.935 --> 00:43:53.484
FRED WILSON: I'm
happy to be a voice.

00:43:53.484 --> 00:43:55.150
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
One last question.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.330
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:57.455
So Fred, thank you so much,
again, for coming here.

00:43:57.455 --> 00:43:58.210
I'm a huge fan.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.761
I've been lurking
on AVC forever.

00:43:59.761 --> 00:44:02.260
So I love that this is my first
interaction with you instead

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.280
of actually posting a comment.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.290
So a few things that you brought
up have me really interested

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:08.886
and I'd love to get
your thoughts on.

00:44:08.886 --> 00:44:10.260
I think that it's
very important,

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.510
like you were saying, to get
children and schools really

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:15.999
interested about technology
and coding and seeing

00:44:15.999 --> 00:44:17.040
that area of opportunity.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.260
But I think there's another
way to maybe take that further.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.760
And so I'd love to
get your thoughts

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.340
on what we can do to get
incubators, accelerators,

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.230
and those kinds of things into
some of these other boroughs

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.396
that you were talking about.

00:44:26.396 --> 00:44:28.927
So Brooklyn
definitely has a few.

00:44:28.927 --> 00:44:30.510
Queens is kind of
on the edge of that.

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.980
There's a few things out there.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.620
But what we can do to drive
those ecosystems in the Bronx

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.000
and Staten Island, Long
Island, those kinds of things,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.530
and get some of those
communities and those schools

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.910
that you were talking
about more interested

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.260
because they'll have role
models in the industry,

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.689
folks who are actually getting
these jobs and careers,

00:44:44.689 --> 00:44:46.230
and also the inverse
of that question

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.792
in terms of
developing that talent

00:44:47.792 --> 00:44:50.000
and supporting that talent
in some of these boroughs.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.542
So that's kind of
a loaded one, but--

00:44:51.542 --> 00:44:52.291
FRED WILSON: Yeah.

00:44:52.291 --> 00:44:53.480
No, I really agree with you.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:45:00.690
And there are a couple of models
out there that are interesting.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:03.330
I think it's called the
Coalition for Queens

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.080
would be an interesting
model to look at.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.780
What I think is
the right approach

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.240
is to go to organizations
who are already

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.900
on the ground in these boroughs
or in these communities

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.540
and find partners who
would be willing to do

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.690
a lot of the work of
staffing up a facility,

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.650
of doing the grassroots work
in the community to make people

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:37.010
aware of it and then bringing
in the technology partners,

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:41.550
whether it's a CSNYC
or a Flatiron School

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.940
or a General Assembly
or somebody else,

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.550
who has the know how
from the point of view

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:53.420
of bringing the curriculum
to the organization.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.750
And there is also a
role in government.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:59.830
There's a pretty
large organization

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:04.520
in the New York City government
around continuing education

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.430
and adult education and
retraining and things

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.930
like that.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.429
So there are dollars that could
be leveraged there, as well.

00:46:10.429 --> 00:46:15.660
So I think that there's no
question we need to do that.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.890
And I think the
right approach is not

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:21.040
to try to spin up
a new organization

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.410
to do all this work,
but to try to figure out

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:25.975
how to get existing
organizations

00:46:25.975 --> 00:46:29.700
and bring them to places
like the Coalition for Queens

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.170
or bring them to places like
General Assembly or Flatiron

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:33.200
School.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.860
There are a lot of other coding
boot camps and accelerators

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.620
and incubators around.

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.760
Show them what's
possible that they could

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.790
build in their own communities.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:47.830
It also might be interesting
to get the New York Public

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.100
Library interested in this.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.537
Because they have
facilities all over.

00:46:51.537 --> 00:46:53.370
The thing that a lot
of people don't realize

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:55.036
is the New York Library
system is really

00:46:55.036 --> 00:46:58.230
two systems for a
bunch of reasons

00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.990
that I don't have
time to go into.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.810
But they have a
lot of facilities.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.790
And a lot of people
in the community

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:07.840
go there to access the internet
and use computers and things

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.340
like that.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:11.949
So they already have
some of the mindshare

00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:13.740
in the community as a
place that they might

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.910
go to do something like that.

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:16.510
And, obviously, libraries
have to reinvent

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:17.468
what they're all about.

00:47:17.468 --> 00:47:20.840
Because they're not going
to be about getting books.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.120
So that would be another
idea in that vein.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.230
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Great.

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:27.188
Well, let's wrap it up.

00:47:27.188 --> 00:47:28.720
Thank you again,
Fred, for coming.

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.850
If you're interested in
finding out more about CSNYC,

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:32.870
it's on the internet.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:33.620
There's a website.

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.655
FRED WILSON: Yep, csnyc.org.

00:47:35.655 --> 00:47:38.480
And pay attention next week.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.540
As I said, I don't want
to preannounce anything.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:46.500
But there's some exciting
stuff coming in the near term

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.630
that we've been working
on for a long time.

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:52.350
And so more to say
on that [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:52.990
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING:
Thank you for everything

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.990
you do in New York City.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:55.566
And thank you for
coming along today.

00:47:55.566 --> 00:47:57.641
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:57.739 --> 00:47:58.530
FRED WILSON: Great.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:47:59.080
CRAIG NEVILL-MANNING: Thank you.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:47:59.540
That was excellent.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:00.540
FRED WILSON: It was fun.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.690
It was really good.
