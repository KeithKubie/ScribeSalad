00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.090

like to introduce commander
oh, before I forget.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.350
Please turn your
phones to silent

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.510
or turn them off, thank you.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.430
[ Applause ]

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.240
&gt;&gt; Fernando Ramos: Well thank
you for the kind introduction.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.990
It is a pleasure and
privilege to be here.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.210
I'm especially happy to invited
by the Motion Picture Broadcast

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.190
and Recorded Sound Division
and also first of the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.430
by the Hispanic Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.080
Thank you very much also to the
staff at the Hispanic Division,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.590
especially to Georgette, Juan
Manuel and Catalina who had help

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.090
to make this talk possible.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.600
So, so let me start with an
example you may already know.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.890
I'm going to show you a
little scene from the film

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.740
from the 1940's its
"Skilda [assumed spelling],"

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.780
film by Sauls Vidir
[assumed spelling].

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.830
Let me talk a little
bit over it.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.620
That was a film

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.490
where [inaudible] directed
Charles Vidir [assumed spelling]

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.780
from 1946.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.670
In it Rita Hayworth
[assumed spelling],

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.840
the protagonist sings
[inaudible] while she takes off

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:06.510
her gloves and throws them
white sexy in the audience.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:22.530
[ Background Sounds ]

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:38.540
[ Music ]

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.510
Wow, that's.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.010
[ Background Sounds ]

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:51.380
So, so just after that
she's pushed off the stage

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.040
and she's escorted
out of the room.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.830
And this story just goes on.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.130
You may know it.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.060
This is a film noir.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.420
However members of the Spanish
audiences watching this film

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.220
as it premiered in 1947 seem

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.010
to have had a very
different impression of it.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.830
Apparently they thought
that the singing

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.430
and the taking off the gloves
were just the beginning

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.110
of something more,
something more interesting.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.350
Was the beginning
of a strip tease

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.460
and that more sensual images,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.930
those show when Rita Hayworth
[assumed spelling] naked have

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.530
been cut off the national
version of the movie.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.120
That of course has
never been the case.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.150
It was impossible for
our Hollywood Studio film

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.970
from the 1940's to such, to
show such explicit nudity.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.320
However in the next month some
retouched images were sold

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.840
in some Spanish cities
showing bodies of naked women

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.330
with a face of Hayworth
[assumed spelling] on them.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.930
They were presented as the
copies of this lost scene.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.430
So that of course is a fan
anecdote, but I think also

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.200
that this very telling example

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.540
that helps us illuminate
a certain aspect

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.970
of Spanish film culture under
Francoism [assumed spelling].

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.050
This is this case of social
pathology in the words

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.360
of Herman Goburn
[assumed spelling],

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.420
helps us understand
the long-term,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.500
somehow dialectical effects of
censorship under dictatorship.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.250
For this a story of Froy
vision [assumed spelling],

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.630
of censorship and
imperfect film consumption

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:21.850
of the misunderstandings due
to the vision access to films

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.870
or to an absolute lack of access

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.650
since the films were
banned altogether.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.340
It is also a story of creativity
in which cinema and culture

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.650
and the culture generated
around it,

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.940
provided a large projection
screen for the anxieties

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.280
for the fears and
the hopes of millions

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.620
of movie goers under
dictatorship.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.960
So this, my talk will
focus on these paradox

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.670
on the characteristic of a
rich a complex film culture

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.710
struggling with its
enormous limitations.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.350
Although many of the aspects
I would talk about apply

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.710
to the whole dictatorship
from 1939 till 1975,

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.060
I will focus mainly on a
period of roughly 20 years

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.370
that stretches from
the beginning

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.470
of the 1950's till
the end of the 1960's.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.110
This is an era of complex
transformation both

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.480
for Franco regime and
for the cinema history.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.390
The dictatorship starts to leave
behind the totalitarian policies

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.110
of the 1940's and develops
towards a cruel authoritarian

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.950
dictatorship opening
up just slowly

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.060
to international developments.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.980
And in cinema history,
this is the time where

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.650
and when television kicks in

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.430
and European/Latin
American new cinemas start

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.680
to question Hollywood dominance.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.240
I will focus in the periods
until, I will focus first

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.920
on the period until the
late 1950's and I will try

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.990
to eliminate the historical
and political context

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.860
where this phenomena took place.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.920
I will concentrate mainly on
the effects and censorship

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.760
of censorship sorry,
on popular forms

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.480
of cinema consumption spans
since the end of the Civil War.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.730
My argument or my main
argument here is that apart

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.810
from the [inaudible] vision
of certain films or scenes,

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.260
censorship introduced through
the modification of the works,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.470
an element of insecurity
and speculation

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.150
in the reception process

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.510
in the way films were
watched and understood.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.190
In the second part of my talk, I
would like to concentrate mainly

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.360
on some phenomena
characteristics sorry,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.280
of a later period and
other forms of consumption.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.270
Specialized film culture was
gaining a strong foothold

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.350
in Spain during the 1960's.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.470
The focus will lay
on the alternative

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.590
or alternatives articulated
through a [inaudible] firm

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.500
of film consumption or as I
call it films watched on paper.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.850
These are examples I have
been gathering as part

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.120
of an ongoing research project,
Juan Manuel already mention.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.350
A film, a research
project on film cultures

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.150
in dictatorial regimes,
I have been working

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.450
on for the last six years.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:06.290
It's a project, comparative
project that focuses

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.440
on the emergence of cinematic
sub-cultures in both in Spain

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.560
and German Democratic Republic
during the 1950's and 1960's.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.190
And I think this the
examples I'm going to talk

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.490
about now function in
my opinion are symptoms,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.420
a symptoms like symptoms
of an illness and symptoms

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.710
of in this case of
two illnesses.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.050
One political illness
like the dictatorship,

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:36.010
but sometimes also a symptoms
of a more benign illness,

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.060
which is this fascination,
this obsession to the point

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.530
of obsession for cinema.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:48.810
So talking about the 1940's
and 1950's in Spain is focusing

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.460
on a golden age of cinema going.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.620
Cinema was still seen under
the so under the introduction

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.330
of television at the
end of the 1950's,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.960
as the main favorite
pastime for the majority

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.570
of the national population.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.700
Firmly rooted as a
form of entertainment,

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.510
especially among the popular
cases, sorry, classes.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.890
It was something you used
to do with your family,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.160
but it was also a special form

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.760
of entertainment
for women and youth.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.780
And it was like in other
European countries,

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.850
mainly an urban pastime.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.460
Spectators in big and
richer cities where,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.290
went more often to the movies.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.940
For instance in 1948 each
citizen of Madrid went four

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.790
to five times to the movies.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.030
Means almost once a week and she

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.610
or he had 117 theaters
to choose from.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.010
So they could rely on a dense
network of film theaters.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.460
Spend half of the late
40's, the highest number

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.250
of film theaters per
capita in whole Europe.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.180
So cinema was a mass
phenomenon, a cultural practice

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.530
that was just everywhere.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.330
A central part of everyday life.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.280
As commanded by the film critic
Miguel Marias [assumed spelling]

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.860
and I quote: "It was the
cheapest and most popular form

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.250
of entertainment and recreation.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.770
The fastest way to leave
and satisfy in social

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.280
and vital environment.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.860
The shelter for couples escaping
the atmospheric [inaudible],

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.020
a spectacle for the
whole family."

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.500
End of quote.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:26.950
So how does this situation
relate to censorship?

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.050
Censorship under
Francoism started

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.660
to be applied already during
the Spanish Civil War,

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.810
so before the regime
kicked in in 1939

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.900
and could survive
the dictator itself.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.810
So existed until 1978.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.560
In these 40 years censorship,

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.570
these positions could
obviously reflect the certain

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.590
transformation that ran parallel

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.590
to the power struggles
in the regime.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.270
The fastest party
[inaudible], the Catholic Church

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.230
and the army, which were
the three main pillars

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.420
of the regime could
influence the evolution

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.090
of the national censorship
organs.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.450
Roughly one can for instance
assert that's the fastest

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.040
principle of the [inaudible]
and military were more permanent

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.680
in the early years
where censorship focused

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.180
on implementation of
specific political world view.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.830
While in the following
decades some of these

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.040
in these aspirations
were set aside

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.110
as Francoism partially reshaped
its iconological principles

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:33.120
around an ultra-conservative
national Catholicism.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.200
In all 4 years films were censor

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.910
on both political
and moral principles.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.800
There was thus a
transformation in time,

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.700
but it was also an
insecurity caused

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.700
by the different parties
involved in this process.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.110
Far from being a monolithic
phenomenon following clear

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.680
rules, they control
exercise over the images

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.250
and sounds took place
in different forms

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.860
and was executed by
different actors.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.510
Both the state and the
church were allowed

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:01.810
to impose their principles

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.920
through their own
censorship images,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.070
but censorship included also
certain distribution companies

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.450
prone to make some
cuts in the films

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.450
as they believed this could
secure them better chances

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.130
by the censorship authorities.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.040
Movie theaters, as well as
particular circumstances

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.080
in alternative projection
spaces,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.010
such as film clubs
or church cinemas.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.880
And third, a third point I
would also like to emphasize,

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.640
I think it's also essential
to consider the discretional

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.050
and arbitrary character
of national censorship.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.790
While the state could implement
for the first time a code,

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.270
the censorship code in 1963.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.180
So up until then
film censor had to,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.960
censors had to act along a
loose pledge of allegiance

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.350
to the regime and
the Catholic Church.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.170
And focus on such vague
attributes as morality,

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.650
good manners or decency.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:15:00.450
This strange indefinable legal
frame influences not only the

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.740
work of filmmakers
for almost 25 years,

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.100
but also it also made it
position of distributers,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.400
exhibitors and audiences very
difficult as this of victims

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.430
of this lack of coherence,
sorry.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.990
In the criteria.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.170
Audiences were in many
occasions unable to answer

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.910
such simple question
as how is the message

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.980
of the film being manipulated?

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.300
Is there, was there originally
a hidden [inaudible] I am now

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.960
missing or which part of the
original text has been cut out?

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.530
At this point it is clear that
I am not referring only to the,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.220
to when I talking
about censorship,

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.720
I'm not only referring to
certain, the prohibition

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.210
of certain works of specific
scenes, which is a phenomenon

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.550
that has already been studied

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.880
and can be easily
understood along the emergent

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.490
of the legal frame.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.790
I find more interesting to think
about its long-term consequences

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.820
in the field of film reception
about the censorship effects

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.610
on individual cinema goers.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.130
Well it is relevant to
point out censorship meant

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.750
of course the prohibition
of certain works, but also

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.550
and this is an interesting
aspect in this case.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.060
The editing of scenes
in a new way

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.060
or the modification
of its meaning.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.170
When audio tracks
were changed in order

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.960
to transform the original
message of the film.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.270
So that in for instance was of
international people titles was

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:30.550
for instance obliged
from 1941 till 1947

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:35.210
and lasted de facto until 1967.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.680
A good example of this
practice can be found

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.950
in the final scene
of "Bicycle Thief."

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.730
The 1948 new realist masterpiece

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.450
by Victoria De Sica [assumed
spelling], which premiered

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.810
in Madrid in the 1950's
which was usually screened

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:55.240
at the national film clubs
throughout the decade.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.870
Antonio who is the well the
main character in this film,

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.900
is a small worker in
post-World War II Rome

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.140
who is completely
dependable on his bicycle,

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.350
which had been stolen from him
at the beginning of the film.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.790
He and his son Bruno try

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.130
in various occasions
to get it back.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.330
In the last part of the
film Antonia even tries

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.690
to steal another
bicycle, but he's caught

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.990
and Bruno sees what
happens to his father.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.210
So this is quite a hopeless
situation, very sad,

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.570
it's very bleak ending.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:32.740
Too sad apparently for the
eyes of the Spanish censors

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.560
or for yeah or for their opinion
on the Spanish audiences.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.610
So in the last scene as Antonia
and Bruno are walking hand

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.230
in hand and disappear
in the crowd,

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.680
a new voiceover was
added to the film.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.910
So it provided a certain
comfort, but also oh sorry,

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.940
a Catholic reinterpretation
of the message of the film.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.310
So let me show it to you.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:05.680
Sorry for the quality of the
film, but you may have an idea.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.020
Okay I'm going to introduce
what's what this voiceover's

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.630
now telling.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.860
The morning, the new morning
seem full of anxieties

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.170
for this man, but he
wasn't alone anymore.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.900
He hold Bruno's warm
little hand in his own hand

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.630
and his hand told
him about faith

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:20.960
and hope in a better world.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.650
In a world where men
would understand them self

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.950
and love each other.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.700
And achieve the generous
idea of Christian solidarity.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.120
So that is the message
which was completely missing

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.920
from the original film.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:48.640
[ Background Sounds ]

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.290
Well this wasn't an
exception of course.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.830
Sometimes there were just
some words as for example

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.670
in "Casablanca" where the
main character Rick mentioned

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.750
that he had fought for
the Republic in Spain.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.000
That was of course cut it off.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.840
In all the cases it
went even farther.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.150
In [inaudible] by
[inaudible] from 1965.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:11.700
The film's distributers
added a prolog also in form

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.420
of the voiceover in order
to warn the audiences

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.510
about the revolutionary
character of this film.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.810
"Mogambo" [assumed spelling]

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.870
by John Ford [assumed
spelling] was screened

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.640
in Madrid in the early 1950's.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.430
However the film came with
a serious modification

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.610
of its original message
through dubbing of the dialog.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.570
Apparently in this case it
was the distribution company

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.780
who was afraid of possible
conflicts with censorship.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:43.000
So Grace Kelly and Donald Sinden
which are two of the protagonist

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.220
of the film, were originally
wife and husband in the film,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.980
in the original version.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.780
But they were transform
in sister

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.310
and brother through dubbing.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.570
So instead of showing something
so morally wrong as adultery,

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.220
the film was now endorsing the
incest between the protagonists.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.050
So similar effects can
be observed also in the

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:10.180
"Barefoot Contessa" by
Joseph Mankiewicz from 1954.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.200
Well this and all the
practices however different

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.340
in their origins have
a similar effect.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.900
Once known to introduce
an element of insecurity

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.670
in the reception based on a
possible shift of the meaning

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.610
or the message of the
original text of the work

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.290
as originally conceived.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:31.400
The instability of
the texts censored

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.690
in such spectacular ways
provided also perfect basis

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.780
for the speculation
among the audiences.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.010
In such cases it
seems to be impossible

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.630
to find a clear closed meaning
that could give the content

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.270
of the film a certain coherency.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.990
Therefore the censorship
is reading

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.890
with exerting certain works.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:53.650
Its long-term effects are to be
found in the gaze of an audience

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.370
that this causes, speculates,

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.880
supposes even imagines certain
original texts even in the cases

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.900
when the film they are watching
hasn't been censored at all.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.720
So until now have been
referring mentally to the films,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.020
but it this also interesting

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.160
to consider the way
audiences reflected

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.180
on their film watching
experiences.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.910
So Loge Lecho Lavange [assumed
spelling] from NYE commented

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.930
on the research project and
popular audience response

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.210
to cinema in the early Franco
dictatorship and I quote,

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:31.550
"Almost all of our
interviewees were aware, sorry,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.090
of the existence
of film censorship.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.210
Since those scenes were often
met with boos and hisses,

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:42.140
several also said that the
censorship heightened desire

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.070
as you always imagine something
more exciting that what's,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.160
that what had been cut.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.380
Several talk of their
disappointment

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.140
on seeing certain films
and censor later."

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.440
End of quote.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.010
This an important point for it
makes clear that film audiences

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.620
in the 1940's and 1950's
know when that films were,

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.450
knowing that the films they
were watching were censored,

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.170
were more active
than usually assumed.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.850
The censored parts
which were often visible

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.340
since the image could
jump or briefly go blank.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.430
Provided a gap in the text,
which the viewers could fill

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.470
in with their own imagination.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.210
Reinforcing the distance between
the images on the screens

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.510
and the images in their heads.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:29.380
So here's where the former
example of Gilda would fit in.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.970
In this regard it is relevant
to highlight the importance

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.250
of American Hollywood
pictures in the country.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.670
Spain represented in those years
the second highest [inaudible]

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.660
for Hollywood movies, which were
central in the local film diet

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.860
and also a canvas to
predict the [inaudible]

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.260
of a nation if you like.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.550
America as seen through the
images of Hollywood, represented

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:02.220
and was read as stronghold for
cosmopolitanism, sophistication,

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.290
the femme fetal, sexiness,

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.240
the political divergence,
sorry and modernity.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.210
Well for those things
and values lacking

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.150
in the local film culture.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.100
In this regard and the
part from usual comments

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.870
on the immersive attraction
excerpted by these films,

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:24.070
there was also usually a
recognition of the capacity

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.720
to open up to all the realities.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.080
These are some quotes
from the research project

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.380
already mentioned.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.810
You enter the movie
theater and you start

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.250
to leave, to leave sorry.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.540
All this made you
live something,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.300
make you live something
you didn't have.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.650
But I found especially
interesting this third one,

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.580
this idea of cinema's
a way of dreaming,

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:51.690
as a way of projecting yourself
into the movies so to speak.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:56.200
Another variation of this motive
both emergent and projection

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.020
in the screen is provided

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.070
by the writer Derency
Moykes [assumed spelling],

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.370
a caton [phonetic]
writer who belonged

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.930
to Cinefa [assumed
spelling] generation

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.990
that could influence
the Spanish literature

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.440
in the following
decades and often go back

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.950
to cinematic memories looking
for inspiration and subjects.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.890
Well first to our book
covers, the third one is

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.510
of course a movie, movie poster.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.810
Apart from Mike's,

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:20.550
this generation included Juan
Marce [assumed spelling],

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.160
which is a representative
through the first book cover.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.370
And Ricka Vilamatas [assumed
spelling] Per Inferer [assumed

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.520
spelling] even be [inaudible]
enough for x many of them.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.000
Forming at these writers
started these, sorry,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.820
their careers writing criticism
for specialized magazines.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.560
Well Mike's in the first volume

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.310
of his autobiography mentions
the first Spanish screenings

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.180
of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.590
A film by Richard Brooks from
1958, which is the film showed

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:58.300
at the right part of the screen.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:02.800
Mike thought that explicit
homosexual elements

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.410
of this melodrama had been
cut out by the censors.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.680
The local audiences,
victims of the nation

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.200
of Catholic censorship were not
allowed to watch or hear them

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.530
so it was his way of thinking.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.400
This homosexual subtext
which was of course part

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.800
of the original playwright
by Tennessee Williams,

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.330
was however not really present

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.060
in the original version
of the film.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:29.370
It would have been inconceivable
being the title was produced

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.980
under the conservative climate
of the U.S.A. in the 1950's

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.350
where film students were
still attached to the rules

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.850
of the production code
the from the 1930's

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.630
to the 1960's controlled
the possible moral

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:48.440
and ideological subversion
of studio productions, sorry.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.040
So around 1960 I would
say or during the yeah,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.710
in the late 1950's or 1960's
alternative specialized forms

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:03.250
of film consumption will or
would win momentum in Spain.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:10.470
Sorry, well this wasn't used
to a Spanish phenomenon,

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.450
this was something which that
was happening other European

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.920
countries at the time.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.080
In this sense, this social
pathology mention on the,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.040
at the beginning of the
talk regarding the case

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.450
of Gilda would transform itself

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.560
around different
reception practices.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.960
For instance in film clips

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.250
around another cultural
practices

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.220
like for instance the
[inaudible] and discussion

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.790
of film screen written
of specialized criticism

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.930
on around other references.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:48.190
European cinema modernity was
starting to be in the center

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:52.010
of the discussions instead
of Hollywood cinema.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.880
But it won't disappear,

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.840
the social pathology
won't disappear.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.610
A new cinema increasingly
consumed as high culture

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.130
in spaces and rituals that
remind us of our religion,

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.660
could have its own forms
of speculation born

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:10.070
out of enthusiasm,
misinformation and censorship.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:14.150
So the movie theater
was packed comment

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.020
for instance I was told
Torres [assumed spelling]

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.570
on a screening in the film
club from Madrid in 1963.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.320
Torres [assumed spelling] was
a film critic at the time.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.610
The film screened in this
occasion was a little a title

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:31.140
by the Shred This Altar Ingmar
Bergman [assumed spelling]

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.530
who was an apostle of
the modernity of new way

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.700
of making movies and
thinking about them.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.980
Who was during those
years very admiring Spain,

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.970
but also rarely known.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.010
Torres [assumed spelling]
continues his description

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.680
with the following words.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.950
The lights went out,
the projection started

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.730
and a stony sorry, stony
silence settled in.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.000
Nobody understood a
word from the dialogs,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.910
but no one said a word.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.810
No one commented the scenes as
if we were in a [inaudible] mess

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.860
and to some laughs
could be heard.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.990
These were rapidly silenced
by the rest of the audience,

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.160
but someone kept
laughing causing a growing

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.640
public outrage.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.970
Well the funny part
is the next one.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.160
So it was only sometime later
that I watched this film

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.550
with subtitles, then
I understood

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.160
that Smiles Was Summer Night was
one of Bergman's best comedies

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.460
and that the ones laughing

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.970
in the movie theater were
the only Swedish people

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.970
or Swedish speaking
people in the room.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.190
So this may be a very
striking example,

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.850
but was surely not
an exception in 1964

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.010
as the film club starting
importing new films

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.160
and the new censorship rules.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.390
The titles included "The
Criminal" by Joseph Losey

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.150
of [inaudible] by Jean Luco
Dark [assumed spelling] as well

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.950
as the Polish film, "Like
Siberian Lady Macbeth"

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.250
by Fida [assumed spelling]

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.790
or "Posiac" [phonetic]
by [inaudible].

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.790
All these films circulated

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.040
through the film club
network in the next years.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.250
However and considering
the experience described

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.780
by Torres [assumed spelling],

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.690
it's worth questioning how
these titles were received

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.940
or if they were even understood.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.030
The bridges in the
French film were screened

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.440
in original versions
without subtitles.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.490
"Siberian Lady Macbeth"
came with English subtitles.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:16.040
"Posiac" [assumed spelling]
remind you was a Polish film

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.600
with French subtitles
and the part from "Smile

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.900
of the Summer Night" previously
mentioned in description

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.200
by Torres [assumed spelling],

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.500
another of Bergman's
[assumed spelling] film

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.160
"Summer Interlude" was also seen

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.950
in the Spanish film
clubs in a confusing way.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.250
Both titles were shown

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.930
in original Swedish
version without subtitles.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.010
So Bergman [assumed spelling]
in this case also symptomatic,

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:38.670
it talked [inaudible]
function as touched

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.750
on for different film
critical approaches

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.790
of the beginning of the 1960's.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.410
Those were on one side.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.750
A new criticism around new
[inaudible] interested in more

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.640
than this to persistent cinema.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.710
And on the other side
the representatives

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.590
of the cultural establishment
who control some

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.620
of the old strongholds of
debate and we're still trying

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:02.230
to present a certain profile of
the Swedish author or director.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.240
More defined the
message of his films

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.200
through the dubbing and editing.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.090
So from the perspective
of the new critique

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.500
and especially among new
alternative magazines

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.800
such as [inaudible]
or [inaudible].

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.250
People would react in rage

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.710
against this interested
modification.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.450
So [inaudible] who was a left
wing critic commented this

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.160
situation in article published
for the magazine [inaudible]

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.370
in 1963 with some irony.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.050
He noted there is a
Bergman [assumed spelling]

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.350
Spanish style.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.410
Where does this such, where does
such a phenomenon come from?

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.020
From where they say that
nothing has been cut off,

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.320
but it has been.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.620
Why they say the Bergman
[assumed spelling] is a

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.570
religious film maker and
sometimes a Catholic one.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.060
And to prove the point
dialogs are changed

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.600
and important parts just vanish.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.350
So this curious to
see how the work

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.150
of international
well-known film makers

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.580
like Michelangelo Antione
[assumed spelling],

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.170
Ingmar Bergman [assumed
spelling],

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.470
Francois Duforg [assumed
spelling]

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.770
and Luco Dark [assumed
spelling],

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.290
et cetera et cetera et cetera.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.810
Is thoroughly sorry analyzed in
the news, specialized magazines.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.290
Even when most of these
films couldn't be seen

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.560
by the readers of
the publications.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:17.180
This paradox doesn't escape the
authors writing for these film,

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.290
writing about these
filmmakers sorry.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.880
In an anonymous text for
film [inaudible] published

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.170
in the 1959 and the
usual [inaudible] known.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.650
Caulfield [assumed
spelling] [inaudible],

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.950
Ingmar Bergman [assumed
spelling]

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:32.590
or Robert Aldridge [assumed
spelling] are mentioned before

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.970
the author explains the maybe
so good as the book tells.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:42.910
Maybe this opinion we may never
have the chance to verify it.

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:47.060
In these small specialized
publications the debate

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.160
benefited from a censorship
that was more permissive

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.830
with magazines than with the
films, which were supposed

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.470
to reach broader
audiences aware there

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:00.170
for consider more dangerous
in the eyes of the state.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.800
Well we think to consider
censorship dispositions

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.070
as monolithic, in fact
they were also adaptable

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.990
or were continually been adopted
to the potential audiences both

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.920
in quantitative and also
in a qualitative way.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.410
Specialized smaller groups
like for instance readers

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.550
of magazines, people at film
festivals and film clubs were

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:22.690
in fact much better off
than the mass audiences

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.440
in the commercial
movie theaters.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.190
Beyond this confusion and these
cautions, once the effects

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:33.040
of this mixture of fascination
and censorship was the emergence

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.530
of a film culture which was more
focused on the written text,

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:40.390
a cinema on paper that
was particularly partially

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.330
accessible than in the
cinematographic text usually

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:48.030
missing, particularly for a vast
majority of spectators unable

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:52.570
to go abroad, visit film
festivals or enjoy the titles

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.950
in the most selected film clubs.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:01.600
On the basis of these
differences debate was being

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.380
encouraged, that
was by necessity,

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.270
speculative [assumed
spelling] discussion more based

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.600
on the written word than on
the images interested not only

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.840
in recovering the fleeting
images in the movie's theater,

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.710
but also in drawing attention
at you those works this that due

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:23.540
to the censorship could not
have or could not be seen

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.550
on the national screens or
only in selected circles.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.470
Noest Cocina [assumed spelling]
could complain it in a editorial

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.200
from 1967 where the Madison
[assumed spelling] looked back

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.110
at his work for almost
seven years and reflected

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.860
on the implications of hardness
spread discourse on films,

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.460
on the film criticism
on cultural life

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.640
which was becoming less
and less significant

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.250
for most of its readers.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.360
For its references, the
references of the discourse,

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.750
had nothing to do
with the films they,

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.660
I mean the readers usually
watch in the theaters.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.580
Jesus Cathia Luenas [assumed
spelling] who was one

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.990
of these bookish cinefiles
[assumes spelling] dependent

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:05.390
on the magazines who was student
of the state film schools in the

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:09.300
since the beginning of the
1960's and also contributed

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.780
to journals such as
Nuestrafine [assumed spelling],

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.590
commented his personal
experience in following terms.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:19.070
Our cinematic education was more
based on books than on films.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.880
I will give you very
graphic sample.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.540
Back then Strohan [assumed
spelling] was my favorite

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.200
director, but I hadn't
seen any of his films.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.060
My knowledge of his films was
limited to what I had read

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.350
on him and to this or over
him unto the scripts published

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:37.430
in Lavan Scenes Cinema [assumed
spelling], which I devoured.

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.750
This form of cultural
consumption,

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.570
reading films instead
of watching them,

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.360
was not only possible
through the reading

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.060
of international magazines,
Spanish most wrote on titles

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.840
like the aforementioned cinema,

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.140
Universitadio [assumed
spelling],

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.520
Film Medial [assumed spelling],
Nuestra Fina [assumed spelling]

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.820
or Cine Studio [assumed
spelling].

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.290
Those were all new
Madisons [assumed spelling]

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:58.130
who started their careers at
the beginning of the 1960's,

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.850
would quite often publish
scripts or transcriptions

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:07.950
for dialogs as well as the verse
forms of literary adaptations.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:12.040
This [inaudible] didn't work
always without problems however.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.410
The publication of scripts was
also censored so this happened

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.440
for instance as Nuestra Fine
[assumed spelling] planned

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.710
to publish the script of
Jewel a Jim [assumed spelling]

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:24.960
by Drufo [assumed spelling]
in 1962, which was banned

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.050
by the censorship based
on moral consideration.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:34.170
So the lack of the direct
references could have very

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.820
picturesque effects even among
these selected more specialized

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.890
circles, which were
the come first

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.420
between a theoretical
discourse with certain level

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.740
of elaboration and the lack
of films was even bigger.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.080
Just imagine the absurdity
of studying in Spain the work

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.670
of Doschenko [assumed spelling],
Eizenstein [assumed spelling]

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.760
or Digavert of said
Cadorsabra [assumed spelling].

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.490
We watched none of the
films of these guys

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.380
and we knew their
theories by heart.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.620
It was complete nonsense
commented Sarah who was

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:09.610
at the time was teacher of
the, who was first student

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.340
and then teacher at the
Spanish film school at the end

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.230
of the 1950's and 1960's

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:18.730
as he was starting
his own film career.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.380
He also added to that.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:25.220
Occasionally that he also added
that and then it happened to me

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.760
that I watched Eisenston's
[assumed spelling] films

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.840
and I was completely
disappointed so.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:38.100
So, well sometimes it's the
prohibited fruit is tastier

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.990
than the real one.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:43.290
So the debate generated

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.930
in the magazines could be
reached certain points capable

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:50.270
of generating [inaudible]
and discussions,

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.420
but was also damaged
in its core.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.280
It was a discourse without
references usually based

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.520
on versions that had to be
mutilated or [inaudible] up

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.510
and that couldn't disguise
the lack of knowledge

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.450
and basic information.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:09.330
Even the good or the
history of study of the Fine

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.200
by Roman Gubern [assumed
spelling], which is one

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.460
of the first serious enterprises
of this kind in Spain

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.370
and which was republished
in 1969.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:24.680
Even this book I say we
still find a lot of films

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.130
with that are wrongly summed up.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:33.350
So it's clear that
they are writing

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:37.730
about films they have nevers
have the chance to see.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:43.330
The reality was that despite
the bookish consumption I quote

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:48.820
for these or other
reasons this cinema fan

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.120
in Spain doesn't know the French
novel Bach [assumed spelling],

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.610
the British free cinema
the American new wave,

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:56.010
the renaissance of Italian
cinema, the new schools coming

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.110
from Poland or Czechoslovakia
[assumed spelling].

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.800
That is to say they do not
know the main movements,

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.000
the half shaped contemporary
cinema.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.960
Lamented Garcia Duenos [assumed
spelling] in their article

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.190
for the magazine
[inaudible] in 1967.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.100
In this regard Rosary
Squarner [assumed spelling]

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.690
who was a cinefa
[assumed spelling] member

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:15.690
of different film clubs
writer in magazines.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:17.810
Even focus on this dialectical,

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:21.810
on this dialect dialectical
effect of the situation

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:26.240
and ask himself if the critical
activity during the 1960's

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.790
concentrated increasingly, an
increasingly smaller circles

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:33.270
and therefore quite different
from those early forms

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.560
of popular film consumption
already commented

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.960
at the beginning, was not
the consequence of the fact

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.210
that because there was no films,

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:45.290
we have to that invent
them in writing.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.730
Without being aware of
it, a [inaudible] peril

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.350
of universe was being created.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.370
The outcome of this
[inaudible] in a period

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:57.950
of cultural restrictions was

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.540
in many cases cinefas [assumed
spelling] without films,

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.290
cultivated without culture,
marked by a kind of knowledge

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.760
of free and by the will and
not the fact as commented

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.240
by his colleague Joels Oliver
[assumed spelling] while talking

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:15.420
about the way Roberto Rosalini
[assumed spelling] was unknown

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.820
by Spanish cinefile, in
Spanish cinefile quarters

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.780
up until the late 1960's.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:28.260
So given our time constraints
I'm going to stop here.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.150
I think I have already
prove my point.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:34.800
In spite of the limitations due
to censorship, the modifications

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.710
of some of the great works
of international cinema

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:40.880
or the errors and
omissions in the discourses,

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.140
both film consumption and
specialized film culture enjoyed

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.570
up until the end of the
1960's, considerable vitality

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:50.890
and that reflect the
[inaudible] transformation

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.140
of the country and the media.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.970
Some of this observation may
also apply to other countries.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.050
Spain was truly not
the only place

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.870
where active censorship
words were doing their job

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.130
in the in this years.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:08.050
But this particular case
presented an intense example

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.130
that served to illuminate the
cultural life of the country

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.690
for almost 20 years to show

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:17.290
that censorship usually goes
beyond the simple provision

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.380
that if all is activated
alternative forms of reception

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.540
which were surly no
intended in the first place.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.490
And that spectators were
usually involved in forms

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.870
of decoding much more complex
and active as usually accepted.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.620
And that apart from a
mere history of films,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.360
film history can also provide
an interesting timely analysis

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.570
of some unexpected
corners of cultural life.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:42.870
Thank you very much
for [inaudible].
