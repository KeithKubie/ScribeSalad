00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.500
 so in this capsule we will define 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.569
 more specifically what we mean 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.849
 by an agent of people then we will approach 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.840
 the concept of analysis 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.699
 so what do we mean by a 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.500
 agent an agent in a general way is going 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.740
 match to do any 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.869
 entity that can do two things can 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.869
 perceive his environment using 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.720
 sensors and can also act on his 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.680
 environment using shareholders in 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.660
 English will talk about censorship and so 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.950
 it's a very very general definition 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.770
 so we can include the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.989
 several types of agents finally under 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 this definition there for example a 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.300
 human would obviously be an agent in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.250
 this case if these censors would correspond 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 his eyes his ears and so on 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.070
 assas and his other senses so that's 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.050
 shareholders correspond to his hands and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.059
 his legs his mouth our way 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.250
 to interact and communicate in his 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.290
 environment 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.570
 now a robot for is also a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.070
 agent specifically ccam error or 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.710
 other types of sensors like 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.790
 infrared sensors instituted him 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.280
 would allow to perceive his 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.130
 environment while its wheels if one 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.710
 talking robot with legs wheels 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.140
 synthetic or articulated arm ben that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.909
 it would allow the robots to interact 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.720
 with its environment that would correspond 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.880
 to its shareholders is also a 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.540
 agent could actually correspond to a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.009
 software or keyboard or access reading 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.049
 in hard disks would correspond to his 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.540
 how to perceive his environment 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.729
 then the screen and write access to 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.799
 hard disk could correspond to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.350
 shareholders for the environment of a 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.180
 software as we see the notion of 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.180
 agencies a notion that is very general 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.210
 so maybe a little more 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:05.820
 mathematics we will design an agent 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.580
 as being an agent process is crazy 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.390
 a function that takes input from a 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.500
 observation sequence and who is going 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.460
 actually return 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.830
 an action to perform given these 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.930
 seven observation sequences so it has to 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.570
 more mathematical way it looks like f 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.090
 is a function that takes input from a 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.910
 sequence of any order so that's 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.240
 what the star means a number 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.530
 perception variable and he associates 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.530
 an action that is part of a set 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.030
 the finite or infinite set of action and 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.750
 really more practical way in fact the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.420
 process 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.480
 we will finally implement it with a 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.709
 program on really an architecture 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.709
 the specific material 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.720
 so here is a very very rough draft 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.360
 general code agent 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.690
 so what agents would take over in 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.950
 input an observation and should 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.850
 return to expect that 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.970
 some actions 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.489
 we could have a static memory 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.940
 which would be variable therefore accessible by 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.739
 the function and then two very reasons 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.290
 general one would expect that the agent 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.830
 firstly from his perception 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.500
 his observations updates his memory 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.739
 which would give its new value for 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.739
 his part even eymery afterwards from her leaving 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.930
 of his memory would take what would be 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.840
 according to the agency the best action to 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.959
 take this would be the action that would have 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.700
 returned by the agent here at the end 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.739
 obviously we make sure that the agent gets 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.470
 reminiscent of his time armed action at jo 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.380
 his memory from the action that has 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.450
 been chosen that went back to the all 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.400
 end and so that's a very draft 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.579
 very general 2 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.879
 which actually corresponds to many types 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.560
 implementation of money for so 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:09.629
 implement an agent the other in a 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.540
 specific context so see example 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.489
 a very very simplified example for good 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.940
 understand so need a vacuum cleaner 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.519
 robotic one would have a vacuum cleaner that 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.190
 would be in an environment with two 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.630
 only pieces the room the room b and 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.310
 then in every room but he could 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.190
 to have 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.260
 if we leave the dust in this case 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.780
 observations so the data 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.080
 sensory that would be given as input 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.760
 to the agent that would be the position so the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.639
 room in which the robot is located 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.250
 then the inventory then we could 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.260
 have a combination of I'm at 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.270
 the room supports the own where I get 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.120
 finds room from the rooms or 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.470
 well I'm at room b then she 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.800
 is clean where I was at the piece 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.270
 b then the rooms and all the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.160
 possible actions in what if that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.470
 could be to move left 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.830
 so piece b to the piece moved to 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.590
 parts right by the aspirate psb 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.620
 in the room in question to pass 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.780
 from a dirty room to clean rooms or 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.780
 do nothing then not move or sucked 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:22.289
 so in this context our function f 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.810
 implicitly it would correspond to a 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.539
 series of associations of associations 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.090
 pardon between what is the series of 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.310
 observations given to me and then 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.090
 what is the action taken by this agent 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.900
 there you have here an example of a few 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.900
 actions that would be taken in 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.650
 specific contexts among others 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.120
 possibly that the agent if our robot 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.220
 this was in a room in the 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.479
 pop piece which was clean but in 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.970
 what if he will decide to go right 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.419
 to see if the room on the right the room 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.419
 b and then hall if it's dirty anymore 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:00.599
 you rather decided to draw inspiration for the 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.849
 break up and dense only if our process 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.740
 agents in fact he can act in a 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.840
 context where there 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.639
 life arbitrarily long so there is a 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.599
 long-term observation man in long and 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.009
 down in this case we have an example 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.440
 agents or in fact considering 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.810
 only the last observation for 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.389
 take his action so as in the 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.080
 case here where we had a single 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.180
 observation 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.669
 the action will be conditioned only 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.069
 on the last to know if the piece to 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.280
 and well room we breathe and then if the 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.930
 room is clean 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.300
 according to the last observation but I 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.949
 I'll rather move to the right so 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.069
 make the function we can see it as 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:43.500
 a very long list of all 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.270
 actions taken possibly by the agent 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.180
 in different contexts depending 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.919
 different observations 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.120
 but when you see it implement it's going 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.180
 really being implemented by a 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.740
 function that will not necessarily li 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.330
 explicitly mentioned all the 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.880
 possible observations so 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.139
 and that's a concept we do not see 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.509
 qualify as we go 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.669
 explore different types of algae 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.580
 to learn from intelligence 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.900
 artificial but conceptually 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.780
 really behind all these algorithms 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.460
 and yet this notion of a function that 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:19.590
 takes into account more observations 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:21.930
 that they return actions which 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.280
 leads us to talk about a rational agent 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.409
 we were talking about an agent until now 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.300
 but ideally we would like agents 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:31.650
 which are are rational so so 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.419
 general we will think an agent and 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.360
 rational as an agent that acts 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.969
 correctly depending on what he 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.620
 then perceives his abilities to action 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:46.490
 and the action determine if an action 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:49.409
 again and it will obviously depend on 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.150
 a measure of performance in some 

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:53.219
 thing that tells us how much is this 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.020
 that the agent behaves well 

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:57.750
 specifically the performance measure 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:01.229
 to take the form of a function 

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:03.810
 objective that will measure the quality of the 

00:08:01.229 --> 00:08:05.310
 agent behavior so often 

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.110
 in the different algorithms the 

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.509
 objective function it's going to be a 

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.900
 function that honors me turning a species 

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:14.820
 scores are seen or a value that 

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.800
 identify how much what the agent 

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.230
 succeeds well in a dangerous context 

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.960
 it could be 

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:23.510
 is the agent won or not a 

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.430
 part in the context of the robot 

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.830
 vacuum cleaner which we have just 

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:31.310
 talk about it could be the amount of 

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:33.400
 waste suck it could be notion 

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:37.100
 more general about the cleanliness of places 

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.600
 is instituted and therefore from a 

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.950
 performance measure we can define a 

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.740
 little more specifically what is 

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.080
 told me by rational agent an agent 

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.670
 rational we're going to be an agent 

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.190
 which from a sequence 

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.730
 observation and knowledge 

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.850
 own 

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:57.560
 an agent who will choose an action that 

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:59.030
 maximizes the measure of performance so at 

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.290
 the rational agent some agents who 

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.560
 takes all the editing time that 

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:06.380
 maximizes this measure as much as possible 

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.980
 of performance there is such that if he had 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.090
 took other actions lauret - he would have 

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.980
 finally got a measure of 

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.570
 lower performance which so that's 

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:18.310
 really the goal of swimming to ration 

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.310
 to maximize this measure of performance 

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.640
 some notes on the case 

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.620
 means by rationality rationality that 

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.620
 does not mean who it is 

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.120
 might not know the agent 

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.160
 fully his environment 

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.570
 he might not know which 

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.640
 are the effects of these actions seth 

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.130
 godin swimming in a game where there is a 

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.530
 random aspect for example rolling 

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.570
 dances that if we do not know with 

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.990
 certainty that will happen after having 

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:52.100
 launched a said rational does not mean 

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:53.720
 perfect either where does it by 

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.600
 rationality we see as we said 

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.130
 sometimes we'll talk about maximizing 

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.260
 the expected performance 

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.090
 while perfection finally that 

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.310
 is maximizing the performance 

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:07.140
 actual or current for example 

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.580
 perfect jean that fertilizes all 

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.870
 parts of which I gave even if a 

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:15.210
 random appearance and therefore perfection 

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.650
 somehow not really in 

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.600
 this context laurent too often there is 

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.680
 a random aspect in a game is 

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:25.230
 not something that is really 

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:28.200
 reaching in a context between 

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:30.060
 others where one in agent who does not have access to 

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.250
 all information association 

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.830
 environment but an agent could 

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.900
 so decide techniques it's more 

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.520
 rational rather than doing 

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.570
 actions to influence his 

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.220
 environment to do actions 

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:45.350
 just to perceive his environment 

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:47.820
 and then pick more information ok and 

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.890
 finally one last note 

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.040
 when we will be interested in 30 in 

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.150
 agents who in a certain autonomy to 

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.980
 know that they will be able to 

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.680
 adapt to adapt their behavior in 

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.620
 function of his own experience because 

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.690
 that it will not be an agent who is the 

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.220
 even from the beginning to the end of his life 

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:10.250
 but who will really improve as 

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.250
 and as of his life film 

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.400
 finally we will conclude with what we 

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:19.220
 call the model pes it's a model 

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.410
 who will facilitate who will concretize 

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.170
 finally what is an agent 

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.190
 in a given context 

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.080
 so this is a model in excess that allows 

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:31.450
 makes it easier to design 

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.470
 diaries in different contexts so 

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.720
 older newer models our 

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:38.030
 four things one to the extent of 

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.370
 performance we talked about until 

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.200
 now we also have what are the 

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.810
 elements that are part of 

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.790
 the agent environment then has it 

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:50.990
 what are the actions that the young 

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:53.930
 can perform and finally what are 

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:57.410
 types of perception observations 

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.670
 what can or can 

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.600
 other agent so they are among others 

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:04.040
 the sensors the licenses therefore use to 

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.870
 because of these four elements the water the 

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.270
 ps model actually it's an acronym for 

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:16.330
 the four elements know performance 

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:19.100
 by an actor and sincere so let's see 

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:22.940
 we are going to have two examples of a 

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:25.010
 model for example imagine that we 

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.650
 is in a context where a robot that 

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.900
 must do the taxi for different 

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.990
 people 

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:34.400
 because if arranged their robot taxis 

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:37.690
 examples of performance measures 

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:42.380
 Well, it might consider security 

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:44.240
 people in the taxi or the speed that 

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.750
 could also consider the respect of 

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:51.230
 road code obviously instituted in 

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:53.330
 its environment b the notions of voting 

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.550
 there is traffic so other 

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.600
 cars there are pedestrians and 

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:02.390
 ama the customers we moved 

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.370
 among the shareholders so the way that 

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.800
 robot to influence its environment 

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.560
 there is obviously the flight to consult of 

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.590
 change speed to accelerate and 

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.000
 to stop flashing to signal these 

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.780
 traveling to other cars and 

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.180
 and so on 

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.700
 then among the censors we will count 

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.680
 not just cameras or 

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.070
 sound 

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.750
 the speedometer gps institute is 

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.910
 so everything that brings 

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.680
 information to robots versus 

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.480
 its environment that allows for better 

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.650
 finally identify the configuration 

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.650
 of its environment 

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.990
 another example in this case too 

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:45.080
 rather first of all a robot we really have a 

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.530
 software that makes the diagnosis 

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:50.060
 automated in a medical context 

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.800
 so in that if it would be money 

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.810
 would be the medical diagnostic system 

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.360
 performance measurement that to be 

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:59.240
 the health of patients who are treated at 

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.340
 the system distortion there maybe a 

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.440
 certain minimization of the costs of 

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.720
 treatments that we will recommend to 

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.210
 our patients the environment will contain 

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.400
 obviously the patients at the hospital the 

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:13.970
 staff that could be invoked by 

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:16.100
 a given diagnosis the shareholders 

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:18.530
 but in this case it will be between 

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.780
 other the monitor to display 

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.790
 questions then the results made the 

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:26.680
 way for the diagnostic system 

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:28.820
 medical to communicate these diagnoses 

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.430
 maybe they could even give 

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.440
 a treatment explicitly and 

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.570
 finally the censors it could be 

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.700
 the keyboard the mouse that would allow 

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:41.000
 to enter between the symptoms of the 

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.590
 sickness of a patient is disemboweled 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.680
 answers to questions and so of 

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.680
 after
