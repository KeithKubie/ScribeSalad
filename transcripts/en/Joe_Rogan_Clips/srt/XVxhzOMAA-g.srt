1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello freak bitches. Do you want to
really go down the rabbit hole though?

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,760
Let's do it. Alright, so, uh, do you
know Thomas soul? I know that name.

3
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:13,450
Why don't we do that name? Thomas
soul is a big uh, famous conservative.

4
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:17,230
He's at Stanford. Um, he's at the
Hoover Institute, I think. Anyway.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,730
So you know, within this, I mean
first just to set all of this up,

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,820
we should set up briefly how
does culture work? Right?

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,390
And the way culture works is
that it like genetic evolution.

8
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:31,600
It works based on blind copying.
So what ends up happening is,

9
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:34,000
is that you are in all of people, right?

10
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:37,720
You look up to people and so you
blindly copy the things they do.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,370
And specifically you start by blindly
copying from the outside and then you work

12
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:45,490
in. So the first thing you do is
you see someone in, you're like, Oh,

13
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:48,850
that person's fucking amazing, that
rock star, that sports star or whatever.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,500
And you start dressing like them.

15
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:53,320
You start walking like them
and all of that sort of stuff.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,960
Now in a Hunter gatherer
context that would be, you know,

17
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:59,800
somebody who is a Hunter or is a
gatherer and you're like, man, you know,

18
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:02,710
she finds all the best
guavas how does she do that?

19
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:07,330
And then UNG fucking eats
them. Right? Yeah. Um,

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,000
and so, you know, you would, you
would like hang out with her.

21
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,470
You'd sort of like shimmy up to her.

22
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,170
You'd be seeing what she'd be
doing or she's like, Oh, okay.

23
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,680
She looks for a very particular
color of guava. She, you know,

24
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:21,580
squeezes them in a certain way and over
time you learn what she's doing and then

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,860
ultimately you even
learn how she's thinking.

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,550
But in a large scale society like ours,

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,490
I don't meet Michael Jordan, right?

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,030
Michael Jordan just becomes this sort
of distant person that I idolize.

29
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,230
And so advertisers have figured out how
to hijack these mechanisms and they know

30
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,250
if you put a burger next to Michael
Jordan's face that I'm like, Oh,

31
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:45,910
I want to be like Michael Jordan, so
I'm going to eat a big Mac. Right?

32
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,930
And little children are dumb. And
so they blindly copy that or Oh,

33
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:52,540
I want to be like James Dean.
He has a cigarette in his mouth.

34
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,070
I want to blindly copy that.

35
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,900
And we don't understand that the burger
or the cigarette is not actually the key

36
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,300
to being as successful or as cool as,

37
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:04,510
or as good at basketball as Michael
Jordan or James Dean. Right.

38
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:06,670
We don't understand that.
That's where that comes from.

39
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:10,780
So we have this tendency to
blindly copy anything we can write.

40
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,080
Does that make sense? Yeah.
Yeah. And in, in a mass society,

41
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:17,530
we never work our way in. We
never learn the mastery, right?

42
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,200
We just sort of remain at this
sort of very superficial level.

43
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,480
So what that means is that
we're, where did this all start?

44
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,960
It's a good question. Yeah. Where
were you going with this? Well,

45
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,170
we are starting a culture. How culture
works, how culture works. Oh, okay.

46
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:35,290
So now we're going to talk about
black people. Okay. Christ is Christ.

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,180
So Thomas, Thomas soul, Thomas
soul is black guy, right?

48
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,540
And Thomas soul has for years and years
and years been trying to fight racism,

49
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,440
but he's been trying to fight racism
by having a conversation about culture.

50
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,210
Right? And the fact that
there are essentially two
different sort of, you know,

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,400
we're speaking broadly here, right?

52
00:02:57,401 --> 00:03:00,120
But this is for the purposes
of communication. Um,

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,060
we're gonna tell a simple story to start
off with, right? So broadly speaking,

54
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:09,061
he puts two different cultures of people
with dark skin next to each other and

55
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:13,630
one culture is these people from the
West Indies and one culture is this group

56
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,720
of people who grew up in the South with
slavery and all that sort of stuff.

57
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,830
Now what one group, the West
Indies group does really well.

58
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,290
So a lot of the successful black people,

59
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,560
people like Colin Powell are
originally from that cultural heritage.

60
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,420
The other group is the group
that you find in ghettos,

61
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,830
in African American communities
and all of that sort of stuff.

62
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,190
They don't do well, right? They don't
get good education. The, you know,

63
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,500
shoot each other. They're
all these sorts of things.

64
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,340
And the reason why Sol has been telling
this story is because he's been trying

65
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:47,200
to say, you know, when liberals look
at the people in ghettos, they say,

66
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,810
ah, racism. That's why they're not
succeeding. And soul is saying, no,

67
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:56,170
it's not. Because if you look at
this group from the West Indies,

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,720
they also came from the
experience of slavery.

69
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,510
There was slavery in the West
Indies. They are also black.

70
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,660
So they also face racism
and yet they do well.

71
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,880
So it has to be something else.

72
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,800
And that other thing is the fact that
these black people who are in the South,

73
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,270
there's always been a big question,

74
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:17,620
were black people robbed of their culture
or did they preserve their authentic

75
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:18,550
African culture?

76
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,780
And what Seoul is saying is that
they were robbed of their culture.

77
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,320
And so they picked up the culture of
the people around them and the people

78
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,730
around them were rednecks.

79
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,560
And if you look at the white redneck
culture and the black redneck culture,

80
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,160
they have a lot of the same values. They
don't particularly respect education.

81
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,660
They love Jesus. They use
violence in their conflicts.

82
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,220
And, um, they, you know,
there's, there's just, you know,

83
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:48,600
a lot of the same values and a lot of
the same outcomes. And even at Bonox,

84
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,910
which is, you know, black English is
actually all from the West of England.

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,050
So it's actually this, it's from
the West of England. So for example,

86
00:04:56,051 --> 00:05:00,460
if you go to places like Cornwall,
um, there used to be this amazing, um,

87
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,420
uh, these amazing ads on
British TV, right? For this, uh,

88
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:07,630
this Devin custard or whatever. And
they would always say, Devin knows, Oh,

89
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,420
they make it so creamy and they
would talk like this. Right?

90
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:13,630
And so it doesn't sound like black
English, but they do say things like,

91
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,430
OEB do in that and we be doing this
and you be doing that and they be doing

92
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:22,510
that. And so there's the use of that
copula B, right? Where instead of saying,

93
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:24,550
I am you are, he is, she is,

94
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:28,030
they are they just say
IBU be we be, they be,

95
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,250
which is the classic
feature of black English,

96
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:35,170
African American vernacular
English. Right? Now the point is,

97
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:38,350
is that how in blower mindblower
now let's imagine that.

98
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,920
How do you think that Thomas soul
has been received by liberal America?

99
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,050
Not well. Try not well.
And so for example,

100
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,400
Seoul has a book called black
rednecks white liberals. Okay.

101
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,720
And his whole point is that,
you know, if you actually,

102
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,010
and you know again like soul is, you know,

103
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:01,790
he researches the shit out of this
stuff. He really does his work.

104
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,080
Now if you,

105
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:08,081
if you look at the experience of African
Americans after slavery after slavery,

106
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,900
they do really, they, they start
to make real progress, right?

107
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,740
And a large part of the reason why they
make progress is because you start to

108
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:18,320
get a lot of people from new
England, either, you know,

109
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:22,190
black people from new England or white
people from new England who come down and

110
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:23,420
sort of reshape the culture.

111
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,900
They create these schools and they're
teaching those new England values, right?

112
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:30,260
It's those Puritan values of hard work,
tenacity, all of that sort of stuff.

113
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,540
And so there's all this progress
and you have people like Booker T,

114
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,810
Washington and Booker T
Washington was an actual slave.

115
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,630
And then after he got his freedom,
he got to go work in a salt mine,

116
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,430
which is literally the worst job ever.

117
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,220
And in Booker T Washington's
up from slavery,

118
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:47,330
he tells this great story about seeing a
schoolhouse, right? And that, you know,

119
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:51,320
he thought that going into a school house
was about as close to heaven on earth

120
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:55,790
as you could get. Like this is a
dude who wanted an education really,

121
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,760
really badly. And that's a lot of
what you find in the, you know,

122
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,870
early black experience in, you
know, the posts slavery period.

123
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,510
And in fact, you know, blacks, you know,

124
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:09,170
before sort of world war II actually had
higher rates of marriage than whites.

125
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,860
All of these sorts of things that you
know, are now supposedly a problem.

126
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,320
And then there's this turnaround, right?

127
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,650
The black experience starts to go
South, right? It starts to get worse.

128
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:23,570
And what year is this around? This
is post world war II, right? So, um,

129
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,640
so post slavery, black people
experience a, a rebounding,

130
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,210
they're starting to make some progress.
There's ambition and I mean, you know,

131
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:36,260
if in terms of books to read like w you
know, just to cause a large, you know,

132
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:40,670
a large part of what I'm trying to do
in general is really let's move to the

133
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,860
place of all people are created equal.

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,770
Like let's remove all these
stupid distinctions, right?

135
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:49,150
And really live that
principle. And the problem is,

136
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,500
is that in order to really
live that principle,

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,580
you need a new narrative that beats
slavery. So, you know, it's not,

138
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:59,870
if you go and talk to racist, you
can't just say, uh, racism is bad.

139
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,270
Like that doesn't destroy
racism, right? Right.

140
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:06,200
What destroys racism is when you make
sense of the things that they know, right?

141
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:06,981
They see, you know,

142
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:10,820
people who are violent in the ghettos
or they see crime or they see a lack of

143
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:14,660
education where they see that Africa is
poor and you're able to tell a better

144
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,270
story that makes sense of
the things that they know,

145
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,030
but also comes out with
the conclusion, Oh,

146
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:23,120
we actually all have the
same potential. Right?

147
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,010
But if you have this issue with
people imitating their atmosphere and

148
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:31,440
maintaining their environment and
this Southern style talk with a,

149
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,460
the Southern redneck influence
on the African American slaves,

150
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:40,340
former slaves, how do you, how do you
stop that and how do you turn that around?

151
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,250
Well, in general for humanity, I mean,

152
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,500
this is sort of a big problem
for humanity in general,

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,730
is that there is not a culture alive today
that is well suited to the world that

154
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,490
we're living in. And
that's because, you know,

155
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,010
culture is adapted to environment and
the same way as any evolutionary thing,

156
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,640
right? So for example, you
know, if you look at, uh,

157
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,500
like let's talk about these
Hunter gatherers, right?

158
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,270
The Yana Mamo or something like that.

159
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,400
So there's a great story in the lost
city ofZ , um, where, you know, uh,

160
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,950
Percy faucet, who was an
Explorer, comes across, you know,

161
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,420
all these tribes in the Amazon.

162
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:16,260
And one of the examples that the
author gives in there is David Grann.

163
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,660
He talks about how, um, you know,

164
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,920
there's this group of tribesmen in the
Amazon and what they'll do is there's

165
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:26,670
this special leaf and they go and
they squeeze this leaf, right?

166
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:31,170
They crush it up and this Milky substance
runs into the water and then all of a

167
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,920
sudden the fish float up to
the surface upside down, right?

168
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,070
They've been anesthetized by this,
this whatever substance in the leaf.

169
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,880
And this little boy goes into the river
and he plucks out all the fattest fish.

170
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,290
And then as the Milky cloud dissipates,
the other's fish swim away. Right?

171
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,730
Impressive as fuck. Like how the fuck do
these tribesmen who don't have science,

172
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,160
don't have any of these
things, figure this thing out.

173
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,980
And it's cultural evolution.
That's what happens is that,

174
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,470
that's the nature of evolution.
That's the nature of markets.

175
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,080
Because markets are an
evolutionary process, you know,

176
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:05,790
intelligent and answers and intelligence
solutions can emerge from just sort of

177
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,960
competing forces.

178
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,190
And so all of these cultures are well
adapted to a particular environment.

179
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,350
So if, you know, if you,

180
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,380
like we talked about American culture
and we talked about Russian culture,

181
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,120
Russian culture selects for pessimism,

182
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,200
American culture because you had to move
all the way across the ocean, right?

183
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,280
If you've got villages in Italy,
you know, Vietnam, whatever it is,

184
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,530
who is the person in
that village who says,

185
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,590
I'm going to go across the ocean to a
country I know nothing about and you know,

186
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:38,040
make a fortune. Right. It's
the most optimistic individual.

187
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,910
And so it's basically a magnet for all
the most optimistic individuals in the

188
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:45,540
world. The analogy I always use
is, do you ever see American tale,

189
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,950
the like old animated movie from like
the must be the nineties or whatever?

190
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,290
Probably. I don't think I saw that.
Well, it's about a group of us animated.

191
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,270
It's animated. Yeah. Um,
who made it? I don't know.

192
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,520
I'm trying to remember. Um,
it's not Disney. That's it.

193
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
No, I don't think I saw that. Oh,
Steven Spielberg. Well, anyway,

194
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,620
it's sort of about the,

195
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:14,040
it's about the immigrant experience more
generally and then specifically sort of

196
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:18,240
about the Russian Jewish experience.
Um, and it's about this family.

197
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:22,030
The mouse Kovitz is, um,

198
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,870
and right there on that,
on that, uh, trunk,

199
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:29,850
there's a five Moskovitz and five
Oh five. Oh Moskovitz um, you know,

200
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,690
in the first part they're in Russia and
there they're all being persecuted by

201
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:34,770
cats, right?

202
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:39,771
Cause they're mice and five O Moskovitz
sings a song with all of the other

203
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:43,980
Moskovitz is called. There
are no cats in America. Right.

204
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,060
Which is so much of what the American
immigrant experience is about. Right?

205
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:50,880
You're like, Oh, it's all gonna
be perfect land of opportunity.

206
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:53,950
The streets are paved with gold,
except in an American tale.

207
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,020
The streets are paved with cheese.

208
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,920
A American T. a. L. yeah,
exactly. Or T a I. L. T. a.

209
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,440
yeah. TA. All right. Exactly.
Still, um, so, so the,

210
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,210
these different environments, right?

211
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:13,690
Just as you have different environments
select for different, uh, different,

212
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,450
you know, beaks or wings or
you know, whatever it is,

213
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,390
select for different mindsets,
different ways of thinking,

214
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:23,230
different cultural traits. Right?
And what ends up happening is a weak,

215
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:25,780
become well adapted to a
particular environment.

216
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,520
So what happens to the point of the
lost city ofZ is what happened to all of

217
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,060
these European explorers who
went into the Amazon? Well,

218
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,650
a lot of them fucking died.

219
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,010
And that's because they're doing
things that are well suited to England,

220
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:41,770
like walking around and will suits
and eating cans of chip beef.

221
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,300
But suddenly when you're in the a hundred
degree heat of the Amazon and there's

222
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:48,430
all these animals you don't understand,

223
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,480
and you don't know how to use the
plants that you squeeze and have the

224
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,200
anesthetic in them and all that sort
of stuff, you can't survive. Right.

225
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,800
And what they called in the lost
city ofZ , all the explorers,

226
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:04,330
they called it the Amazon counterfeit
paradise. It looked like a paradise.

227
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:06,970
It was so lush. It was so
tropical, but there were like,

228
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:11,890
there's nothing to fucking eat except
clearly there was because Amazonian people

229
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,490
had been living there for tens of
thousands of years. They just did.

230
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,180
The Westerners didn't have the cultural
software that was well suited to

231
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,483
surviving in that environment.

232
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,170
So how does this translate
into African-Americans?

233
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,290
So what is the environment that created
that Southern redneck culture and the

234
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:32,920
environment it turns out is
hurting, right? So raising sheep,

235
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:34,300
raising goats and all that sort of stuff.

236
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,990
Cause most of the people
who are in the South, um,

237
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,700
originally came from the Scots Irish.

238
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,790
And when you look at hurting
cultures around the world,

239
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,570
they all have certain traits in
common, right? So if you're a herder,

240
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,440
well you have a big, big problem. And
that big, big problem is property rights.

241
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,520
So if you're a farmer, there
are clear boundaries on my land.

242
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,320
Now there are ways you
can try and fuck me.

243
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,610
You can try and move the boundary stones
on my land slowly inch your field over,

244
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:02,650
over, over, over. But you know,

245
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,930
what we usually have is we
have some sort of government,

246
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,190
there's a local town official that we
go to and he is responsible for policing

247
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:12,070
the boundaries. And so towns
would do things where, you know,

248
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:15,040
you would essentially all get together
and we'd go walk the boundary stones and

249
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,380
we make sure that none of those
boundary stones had moved.

250
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,440
So the intuition of people
from the North Puritans,

251
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:23,700
people like that is if we have a
problem, we go to the government,

252
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,450
we resolve it through the government,
right? In the environment of hurting,

253
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,800
you can come over and you can steal my
sheep and you can mix the sheep in with

254
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:36,790
your flock. And I have no way to prove
which my sh which sheep are my sheep.

255
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,970
So we evolved things like branding,
right? Where I have a brand,

256
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:41,740
I put it on my sheep and
all that sort of stuff.

257
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,270
But there's another strategy that is
used that evolved before branding.

258
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,900
And that earlier strategy is
being a crazy mother fucker.

259
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,110
You establish a as the kind of guy that
you don't fuck with you come on my land,

260
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,320
I kill you. You touch my sheep
or my women, I fucking kill you.

261
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,560
And I use such an aggressive level of
violence that you know that you know,

262
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,790
there is no point in fucking with,

263
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,770
I mean this is not plausible
cause I'm saying it,

264
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:13,040
but let's imagine a much tougher
person. Connor McGregor for example,

265
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,460
is a great example. You don't
fuck with Connor McGregor, right?

266
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,150
He has a reputation as just being a bad
ass mother fucker who will fuck you up.

267
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,910
Right? Right. So that's how you keep
people off your land. That's right.

268
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,450
And if you look at, let's look
at a couple of herder cultures.

269
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,030
So herder cultures include the
Scots, Irish, who are the rednecks.

270
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,380
A herder cultures include the
Mongolians, right? The Mongols,

271
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:36,820
notoriously a very gentle
peace loving people, right?

272
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,010
And they include the Bedouins
who are the Arabs, right?

273
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,080
Who had camels and all
of that sort of stuff.

274
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,840
And you'll notice that there
is that same use of violence.

275
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:48,380
And mostly they fight amongst themselves.
There's this inter clan warfare,

276
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,510
but periodically a charismatic figure
emerged is who unites the clans.

277
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,160
So Gangas Kahn manages to
unite the Mongols and then
one of the Mongols proceed

278
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:01,310
to do, they proceed to go use
that aggressive use of violence.

279
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,730
They have those horses which
allow them to move quickly, right?

280
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,780
And they're really effective. And they
go and they fuck everybody up, right?

281
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,500
Because you know, the gentle farmers
of China aren't prepared for that.

282
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,330
And the gentle farmers are
Persian, aren't prepared for that.

283
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,780
What happens with the Arabs, the arms
are mostly fighting amongst themselves.

284
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,490
But then along comes this charismatic
figure with the new belief system that

285
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:26,210
unites the Muhammad and he unites them
and suddenly they fuck everybody up and

286
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:28,640
they create this great
empire, the caliphate, right?

287
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:33,290
That spreads all across central Asia
and the middle East and all across North

288
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,670
Africa. Right. And in many ways that
is what Donald Trump is. They've been,

289
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:41,240
you know, the rednecks have been fighting
amongst themselves for a long time.

290
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,630
And then Donald Trump, the
Gangas Kahn of America,

291
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,890
the Mohammad of America has succeeded
in uniting the clans. And you know,

292
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,150
in our time you don't do it by going
out and like raping and pillaging.

293
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,660
You go and you seize the ballot
box and you vote and you know,

294
00:16:56,661 --> 00:17:01,220
you really like take back power.
And so that's what they've done. Um,

295
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,990
but there are, if you look,

296
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:06,440
there are certain problems that
occur across these herder cultures.

297
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,210
So if you're, you know,

298
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:12,330
as a friend of mine who you're saying
essentially saying that the South is that

299
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,140
the reason why Donald Trump has
been elected because of the South,

300
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,600
because of the herder
culture. Well, and it's also,

301
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:22,460
so if you've read hillbilly Elegy, JD
Vance's book, it's, it's excellent,

302
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,650
right? But he's really talking
about this hillbilly culture.

303
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,240
And so it's not just the South,
right? So what happened is,

304
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:32,660
is that it's redneck rednecks, which
is [inaudible] or you know, whatever,

305
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:35,180
or hillbillies or whatever you
want to call them folk. Well,

306
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,200
it's not even simple folk.

307
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:38,840
It's just a particular culture and
they have certain values. And I just,

308
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,980
it's also worth clarifying because of the
way that I sound and where I come from

309
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,590
and the fact that I went to Harvard. Yeah.

310
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:49,590
And vitamin then that I'm not a
part of that tribe that you, uh,

311
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,860
Americans owe a tremendous
debt to the hillbilly culture.

312
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,890
And that tremendous debt is that
overwhelmingly they're the people who have

313
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,160
served in the military and they are
overwhelmingly the people who have fought

314
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,890
our Wars and bled and died
and all that sort of stuff.

315
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:04,920
And that's not a stuff that, you
know, I may sound like a liberal,

316
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:07,650
but I don't really sit in
either of those cultures. Right.

317
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:11,770
I can could critique the liberal
culture and I can critique the, uh,

318
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,910
hillbilly culture, right?
And, you know, white liberals,

319
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,460
the whole reason why I started this
thing off is because white liberals have

320
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:20,580
their own weird things
that are dysfunctional and
that aren't helping black

321
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:22,650
people and all that stuff.
If you just wore a bow tie,

322
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:24,930
people would think you were
conservative, so you have to do well.

323
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:28,590
Then there you go. Or maybe you have it
too. The maximal bow tie, a BOLO tie,

324
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:31,470
100%. Actually, I would
like to do that. Like,

325
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:35,010
I like the texting culture rancher,
rancher, like a Jade, right?

326
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,640
Their main polo at George W. Bush B from
Connecticut, but dress like a cowboy.

327
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:40,890
He was from Maine. Even more crazy.

328
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:48,780
[inaudible].
