00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.380
JAMES CLEWETT: I mean, the
important point is that the

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.690
internet is full.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:05.400
That's the tabloid headline.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.490
The internet is full.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.380
There's now so many machines
attached to the internet that

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.810
there is no way that
they can all have

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.870
their own unique address.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.580
Not the way we're currently
addressing them.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.950
All right.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:32.020
Well, the number is
4,294,967,296.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.250
A packet is what happens to the
information that you're

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.610
trying to send on
the internet.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.170
Your computer breaks it down
into bit-sized chunks, and it

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.340
sends it off bundled up.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.010
It's like putting it
in an envelope.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.830
And on the front of the
envelope, it writes this

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.270
unique number, which is the IP
address, and sends it off

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.200
across the internet.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.222
And then every router, every
switch that it encounters as

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.080
it travels down the internet,
looks at the number on the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.960
front and goes, ah, I know
where to send that.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.180
And it weaves its way, not
in any unique manner--

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.930
actually, it's a very random
process-- but it weaves its

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.840
way through the internet routers
and eventually finds

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.600
your machine.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.000
So essentially, every machine
is addressed by a unique

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.680
number, because computers
cannot, they don't have

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.630
written addresses.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.970
And they're all designed in
such a way that they are

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.800
stored in a 32-bit number.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.590
Now what that basically means is
that you've got 32 lines of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.080
1 or 0, the binary value.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.240
And that means that there must
be some limit to how big a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.940
value you can store.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.470
And that value-- well, if you
remember, we did in the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.250
Pac-Man video the biggest value
you can store in an

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.220
8-bit number.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.270
OK, well, that's 2
to the power 8.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.730
The biggest value you can store
in a 32-bit number is 2

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.860
to the power 32.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.890
So I mean, that's the headline
The internet is full.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.630
And what I mean by that is that
on the 3rd of February

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.920
last year, the authority that
hands out numbers to the

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.250
agencies that then manage who
gets what address handed out

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.620
their last value.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.990
So there are no more.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.669
So if you're now a new company,
and you want to set

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.300
up a business and have your own
website and have your own

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.160
address for people to come and
see you, there's none left.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.920
Simple as that.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.880
It's full.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.040
Well, I mean, there's various
things that are being done to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.650
mitigate the problem.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.090
They're going back through the
addresses that they've handed

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.010
out in the past, and they're
looking to see if they're

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.860
being used.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.890
And if they're not being used,
then they're harvesting them

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.420
to hand them out again.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.720
It's not really going to solve
the problem for very long.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.680
So we need to take a wholly
new approach, and that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.940
approach is to throw away the
32-bit solution-- as always

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.900
with computers.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.840
You throw away the small ones.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.775
Remember when we used to have
8-bit computers, and we could

00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:50.150
count up to 256, and
that was fine?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.830
But eventually, we wanted to
count to more than 256.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.090
So we threw those away, and
we got new computers.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.010
And they could count
up to 65,536.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.180
And then we wanted to count to
bigger numbers than that, so

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.600
we threw those ones away, too,
and we brought in 32-bit

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.930
computers, which is what most of
our viewers will be using.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.650
And 32-bit computers can count
up to 4 billion, which is

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.630
quite a big number.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.490
But even that is beginning
to reach its limit.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.590
So now we're starting to build
computers that can count up to

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.880
2 to the 64.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.360
And I've just realized that
you're now going to ask me

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.250
what that number is,
and I don't know.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.125
So down here we've got the
32-bit computers that we're

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.660
now throwing away in
our laboratory,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.160
because we've moved on.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.020
We're on to 64-bit computing
now, so we can count to really

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.230
big numbers.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.040
Around your home, there's an
awful lot of things connected

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.940
to the internet--

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.220
primarily your phone and your
computer, at the moment, or

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.130
your tablet computer.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.840
And then there's crazy people
who want to connect your

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.560
washing machine and
your fridge and

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.490
your house's heating.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.350
There's all sorts of ideas about
things you could connect

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.100
to the internet.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.950
And every one of those
needs to be addressed

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.810
in some unique way.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.470
Because if it's not got a unique
address, then that

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.130
introduces confusion.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.440
If two things have got the same
address, and I want to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.030
talk to them, if I'm
a computer--

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240
which, you know, some
people think--

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.530
and I want to send information,
then if two

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.570
things have got the same
address, I don't know which

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.760
one of those two I'm trying
to communicate with.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.570
Most businesses, like the
University of Nottingham,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.240
where we are, have dynamic
allocation of addresses.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.310
So you switch your machine on,
and some server somewhere

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.880
says, ah, yes, you'll
need an address,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.730
and hands it an address.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.580
And that's only valid for
while it's switched on.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.100
But of course, the server can
only hand out a certain amount

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.690
of addresses.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.160
It's only got maybe
65,000 addresses

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.140
that it can hand out.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.860
Probably fewer than that.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.810
Obviously, at some point,
it runs out.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.430
And that tends to be
what's happening.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.070
The biggest problem that we're
seeing at the moment is just

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.460
dynamic allocation of IP
addresses, a thing called

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.180
DHTP, failing because companies
are running out of

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.490
their own IP addresses.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.840
And so they have to
go back for more.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.252
BRADY: So for example, the
university here can only hand

00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:04.190
out from a finite number
of addresses

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.450
that it already owns?

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.810
JAMES CLEWETT: That's right.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.280
It has to request addresses
from a regional authority.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.200
And the regional authority here
covers Europe and about

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.900
half of Asia, Russia,
and the Middle East.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.830
And then there are regional
authorities for Oceania and

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.950
China and Africa and Latin
America and North America.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.770
And the regional authorities
request addresses from an

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.040
international authority.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.350
And if you trace it all back,
eventually this is all funded

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.980
by the US Defense Department,
which is a little bit sad.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.700
No, I like the US Defense
Department.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.600
They're good people.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.110
And, I-- oh dear.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.260
They've handed out the last
of their IP addresses.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.440
They've handed out this many to
the regional authorities.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.980
The regional authorities
are expected to run out

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.060
sometime this year.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.900
Problem.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.850
The solution to this problem is
that we are going to change

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.450
from IP version 4, which has
been around since I think

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.790
about 1981, sometime around
then, and we're going to

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.990
change to IP version 6.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.440
I don't know what happened
to IP version 5.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.730
Now IP version 6 is based
on 128-bit number.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.810
Now 128 bits, just to put that
in some sort of perspective,

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.470
what that means is that every
person can have billions upon

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.480
billions upon billions
of devices each.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.590
So we're not going to run out
of space any time soon

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.640
with IP version 6.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.880
The problem now is
a human problem.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.000
There's a whole bunch of
companies out there who are

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.750
running the routers and the
switches around the internet,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.540
which are passing information
from one machine to another

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.390
machine, that need to upgrade
their routers to IPv6.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.900
And they're not doing it.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.040
There's a very, very slow
uptake, and purely for

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.300
economic reasons, I presume.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.590
It's an effort.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.900
And you've got to pay somebody
to make that effort.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.060
And so it's just not
getting done.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.690
The adoption's appalling.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:06.680
The 8th of June, 2011 and the
6th of June, this year, 2012,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.030
were test days for IP version
6, where there was a certain

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.250
amount of uptake.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.150
Companies were encouraged to
switch on their IPv6 and

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.770
provide their material
through IPv6.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.830
And it all went smoothly.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.640
Nobody noticed.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.010
Brilliant.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.040
So we're getting there,
slowly but surely.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.170
BRADY: The web address
of Numberphile is

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.410
www.numberphile.com.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.810
JAMES CLEWETT: Right.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.700
BRADY: What's going on there?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.000
JAMES CLEWETT: That's
not its web address.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.670
That's some human-readable
form.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.510
So as well as providing you
with a unique number, what

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.180
your internet service provider
is doing is using a thing

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.300
called domain names.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.810
It has a table which ties
that domain name

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.640
to the unique number.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.470
Because if we were all having
to wander around remembering

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.050
the unique 32-bit number for all
of our favorite websites,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.490
whether that is Sixty Symbols
or Numberphile

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.210
or Test Tube, or--

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.690
you choose which one
you like the most.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.230
We'd forget them, right?

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.600
Because that's too many.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.110
So at some point-- and I don't
know when-- somebody had the

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.130
bright idea of just tying a
meaningful name to these
