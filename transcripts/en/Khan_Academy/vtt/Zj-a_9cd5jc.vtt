00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.350
The question we're given asks
us, how many students attended

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.370
Einstein School in 2006?

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.000
And in this little table, they
tell us how many attended in

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.480
2001, 150 students, and in 2002,
225, 2003, we had 300

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.170
students, but they don't
tell us 2006.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.600
So what I think they want us
to do is to see the pattern

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.520
and how many students the
population of students grew by

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.650
every year, and just assume that
that pattern continues

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.530
through 2006.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.570
So we need to figure out what
the pattern is from one year

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.360
to the next, and then we're
going to figure out 2004,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.980
2005, and then 2006.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.340
So the assumption that we're
making in this problem, and I

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.880
think that the problem wants us
to make, is that whatever

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.000
the pattern of growth was in
these three years, that they

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.090
continue all the way to 2006.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.940
So let's see what's
happening here.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.290
When we go the first year, what
happens to our student

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.920
population?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.370
We go from 150 to
225 students.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.390
And the easiest pattern to think
about is, well just how

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.500
much are we increasing
by every year?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.270
So how much do we have to
go to from 150 to 225?

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.100
We increased.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.290
Well, if you increase by 50,
you get to 200, so we

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.600
increased another 25.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.270
So we increased by
75 students.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.970
And then they go from
225 to 300, how many

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.270
did we increase by?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.450
Looks like 75 again.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.700
75 plus 225 is 300.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.330
So it looks like we increased
by another 75.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.570
So the pattern here is that each
year, 75 more students

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.720
attend the Einstein School.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.560
So let's just continue
that pattern.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.290
So let's add another 75.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.060
Let's add another 75
to the 300 in 2003,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.420
and we'll get 375.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.440
In 2004, if we assume the
pattern continues, let's add

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.070
another 75.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.120
And then what will
that give us?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.450
That'll give us 450 students
in 2005, if we assume the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.760
pattern continues.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.550
And we're almost there.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.870
Let's add a final
75, 75 plus 450.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.440
If you add 50, you get
to 500, so it's

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.140
another 25, so it's 525.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.300
So that would be the answer to
our question, if we assume the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.820
pattern continued, that 525
students attended Einstein

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.500
School in 2006.
