What's your name?

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.640
Just the Jew I guess.
- Nice to meet you, Moshe.

What are you doing
at the psychedelic conference.

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:11.744
- I'm a psychedelic researcher.
- When did you first realize

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:14.447 align:end position:100%
that tripping balls
would be your life's work?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.616 align:start size:69% position:31%
Obviously, you already
kinda look like a dude

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:17.984
that is pre-ready to...
- Yeah.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.919
- Think psychedelics will help.
- Thank you.

- Have you ever had
actual experience

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:23.589 align:end position:100%
of a psychedelic
healing you from something?

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:24.657 align:start position:0%
- Yes, I have.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.125 align:start position:0%
I've been suffering
from Shingles.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:27.293
Went down to the jungle...
<i> [audience laughing]</i>

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:29.162 align:start position:0%
And I had
an Ayahuasca experience.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.898
I'm getting completely cured.
- Do they do anything with, um--

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.100 align:end position:100%
Can you shut the cameras off?
Do they do anything with,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.302
uh, erectile stuff? Like--
- [laughs]

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.772 align:start position:0%
- Did you have the, like,
barbarian collar pre-Ayahuasca

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.341
or is this a new identity?
- You mean this here?

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:44.010 align:start position:0%
- Were you already
a bit of a hippy beforehand?

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.445 align:end position:100%
- No, dear.
I wasn't a hippy, actually.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.612
- No?
- I was a police officer.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.982
- No!
- I found 45-50% of people

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.485
communicate with some
non-human entity

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:54.353
when they smoke salvia.
- So where you doing the study?

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:57.723 align:end position:100%
Like some learning annex?
Like Hippy Dippy University?

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.226
- Oh, it's at Harvard.
- Harvard what?

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.462
- These human beings--
or protohumans,

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.064 align:end position:100%
have these ineffable
mysterious experiences...

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:07.600 align:end position:100%
That attempt to reach
and communicate...

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:08.935 align:end position:100%
There's a boundary

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.104

Cosmic portrait of the world.
- Okay, that was great.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.376
Could you just repeat everything

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.911
that you said?
- Yes.

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:20.646 align:end position:100%
- Why are psychedelics
important?

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:21.948 size:88% position:56%
Why shouldn't they be taboo?

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:25.585 align:start position:0%
- Because they're incredibly
valuable tools

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.487 size:78% position:39%
to heal the human psyche.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.389
So to get down there
and open it up and shake it out.

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:31.657 align:end position:100%
- Have you heard
of a Shake Weight?

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.326
- No.
- It's one where you just

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.027
shake it and it's a weight.
- Yeah?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.362 align:end position:100%
- I don't know if it works,
but...

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.464 align:start position:0%
- That's really what
psychedelics do to the psyche.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:39.866 align:end position:100%
- Oh, it's like a Shake Weight
for your brain?

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:40.967
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.369 align:start position:0%
