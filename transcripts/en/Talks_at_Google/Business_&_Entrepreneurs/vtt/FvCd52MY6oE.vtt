JORGE CUETO: Hi everyone.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.730
Welcome to Talks
at Google, and it's

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.230
great to have Sandy Jen,
co-founder and CTO of Honor

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.059
here with us today.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.740
Sandy founded Honor in
2014, and prior to that,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.350
she was co-founder
and CEO of Meebo,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.410
which is a customer
internet company that

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.450
focused on connecting publishers
and consumers socially.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.730
And she led their
engineering team

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.610
and then joined
Google, actually,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.220
in the social team when
Meebo was acquired in 2012.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.810
And before that, she also got
her BS from Stanford University

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.092
in computer science.

00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:50.050
So it's great to have
you with us today, Sandy.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.820
SANDY JEN: Great to be here.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.320
JORGE CUETO: I'd
like to get started

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.410
by having you tell us about
what Honor is in your own words.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.670
SANDY JEN: Sure.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.980
So Honor-- our
mission, basically,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.980
is to change the way
that our parents age.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.620
I think aging is a
topic that a lot of us

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.510
don't talk about with people,
especially our own parents.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.140
There's a bit of
sort of child fear

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.480
when talking about
issues like that.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.770
And so Honor's goal, really,
is to remake the way that folks

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.470
can age at home specifically.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.460
So we really focus on
non-medical home care,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.220
which means that we help
folks with what we call ADLs--

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.640
so Activities of Daily Living--
things that you and I take

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.840
for granted--

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.990
brushing your teeth, getting out
of bed, going to the bathroom.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.560
And we have a whole host
of really awesome care

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.251
professionals that
go and do that work.

00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:39.250
JORGE CUETO: And what
inspired you and your team

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.930
to start Honor?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.980
SANDY JEN: Good question.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.690
So three of the four founders
are multi-time entrepreneurs,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.030
and so we all kind of cut
our teeth on social media.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.150
I've obviously been at
Google for a little bit.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.769
And once we sold those companies
and took a little time off

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.560
and we really wanted
to do another venture,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.310
we really wanted to
think about, OK, well,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.529
what would make us really
want to work hard--

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.570
like really, really hard?

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.450
Because startups
are a lot of work.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.117
And we ended up thinking
about what's important to us,

00:02:11.117 --> 00:02:13.450
and we were a little bit older
a little bit more mature.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.030
Some of us were having
kids, and we really

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.200
wanted to have impact.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.030
That was the biggest thing.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.010
And so when we were
getting together,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.580
we thought about, OK,
what are big problems

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.030
that we could solve?

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.200
And we thought about
unemployment, poverty, labor,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.820
childcare, health
care, elder care.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.490
And then my
co-founder from Meebo

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.550
went home one day to
Connecticut to visit his mother.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.910
And he likes to tell the story
that she gets speeding tickets

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.960
in Montana, which
you just don't get,

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.720
because there's
nobody monitoring

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.830
the freeways in Montana.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.630
And she was driving
really slowly,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.170
so he started to get a
little freaked out about,

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.900
wait a minute, why are
you driving so slowly?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.380
And she was like, well, it's
just getting a little harder.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.338
And so he was like, well,
I live in California,

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:01.480
you live on the East Coast.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.780
When you're older,
what am I going to do?

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.010
I don't want to pluck
you away from your house.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.320
And so that sort of
spurred the idea.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.760
We really started to do some
research in caring for seniors,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.800
and it's a really,
really big space.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.160
And then we really honed
in on the non-medical home

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.574
aspect of it, because
it was very broken.

00:03:21.574 --> 00:03:22.990
And when you find
something that's

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.010
really broken as
an entrepreneur,

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.176
you kind of get really
excited, because you're like,

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:28.320
what can I do to fix this?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.490
And so we started to
explore that idea.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.864
JORGE CUETO: How do you feel
like your experience working

00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:35.380
on Meebo in the social space
has influenced your work here

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.970
with Honor?

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.690
SANDY JEN: So I would
say doing a prior startup

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.200
to doing Honor was
definitely a pre-req

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.870
to do this type of venture.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.400
Honor is complicated.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.940
Home care-- you're
touching people directly.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.600
It's a very, very
hands-on experience.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.890
And so in order to solve
such a big mission,

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.092
you need to know how to execute,
how to gather resources, hire--

00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:06.550
a lot of the sort
of nuts and bolts

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.650
that I learned in
my first startup.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.960
And so my experience
at Meebo really

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.590
taught me generally how
to form organizations,

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.880
how to run a team, how to hire.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.300
There were a lot of mistakes
we made at Meebo, which,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.519
as an entrepreneur selfishly
for a second venture,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.307
I want to be able to not
make the same mistakes twice.

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:26.890
So it was a good opportunity to
take all the learnings that we

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.360
had gathered in our
previous experiences

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.640
and then really
consolidate all that

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.400
learning into a new venture.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.067
And so far, it's
worked out really well.

00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:39.691
JORGE CUETO: And how
long have you guys

00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:42.010
been available to
consumers actually?

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.960
SANDY JEN: So we're
about three years old,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.510
but we've been giving
care for about two.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.240
And so the first year,
obviously, a lot of us

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.355
didn't know much
about home care.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:55.450
I had some personal experiences
with my grandparents,

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.330
but really digging into the
industry-- it's been around

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.300
for a really long time.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.000
It hasn't changed
much in 30 years,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.700
but there are a lot of
nuances and complications

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.270
and considerations in home care
that, without really doing it,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.790
you don't really
get exposed to it.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.220
And so the first year for
us was a ton of learning,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.011
and then we started to
take those learnings

00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:17.890
and execute on them.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.390
JORGE CUETO: Prior
to the interview,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.150
I was just reading
on this market.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.110
And it's actually a huge
business opportunity

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.150
in terms of how much
money people spend

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.780
on home care and
elderly care every year,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.430
but it's something that I don't
think tech has addressed up

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.520
to this point.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.959
Why do you think that is?

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.750
SANDY JEN: It's
interesting, because people

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.166
think technology, they think
old people, and they're like,

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:38.590
they just don't mix.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.690
And the way we
thought about it is--

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.120
if you think about your
grandparents or your loved

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.120
ones who are older, they
use microwaves and toasters

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.760
and TVs and cars.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.950
And that's all
technology, but it's not

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.980
in their face as technology.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.350
And so you have
to sort of rethink

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.550
about how you use
tech to address needs

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.050
for that kind of audience.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.470
And so for us, I think
there's just been that stigma

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.510
in Silicon Valley-- and
just generally in technology

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.280
as a whole--

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.640
that seniors don't do
well with technology.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.710
I think it's a mistake
to kind of over-cater

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.220
to a senior audience by having
giant buttons and giant font

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.550
and basically treating them
as children without really

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.780
understanding the problem
you're trying to solve.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.770
And so we definitely
don't think of ourselves

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.820
as a technology company.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.236
Honor specifically positions
itself as a services company,

00:06:32.236 --> 00:06:34.785
because at the end of the
day, our product is a person.

00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:37.620
And I say this very often,
that we are a human services

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.120
company.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.960
The person that we
send to your home

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.680
to help you do your
activities and daily living--

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.650
that's our product.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.270
And so all the technology that
we build is in service of that.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.930
So a lot of stuff that we build,
the end consumer never sees,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.932
but it's completely built to
deliver the best care possible.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:58.140
JORGE CUETO: What was the
hardest part of the process

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.931
as you were starting
out with this company?

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.440
SANDY JEN: I think
as technologists,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.910
you have this sort of want
to automate everything

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.860
and make everything
really efficient.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.450
And so you come up with
a bunch of assumptions.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.950
And so as engineers,
we're like, OK.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.990
We're just going to
build this thing,

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.680
we're going to build that thing.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.530
This is the way it works.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.330
You just go to visit,
you do this, you do that.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.680
And then when you
actually start to do it--

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.310
we all ended up volunteering
in your homes to help out.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.120
And you're like, wow,
that's not how it is.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.530
And so we had to basically
learn to strip away

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.270
all of our assumptions.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.390
And in the very
beginning, we had

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.780
folks who were running care
and delivering care and working

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.610
with our care professionals.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.499
They were doing one thing, and
the engineers and product team

00:07:44.499 --> 00:07:45.540
were doing another thing.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.456
We were trying to build
things for each other,

00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:50.480
but we weren't really in sync
as much as we should have been.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.689
And I think that's a common
problem, because you make

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:53.938
assumptions, you work one way.

00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:55.590
You make assumptions,
you work one way.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.240
But at the end of
the day, you really

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.730
have to work together-- like
really, really together--

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.770
to understand what's going on.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.630
And so once we figured
out that we were not

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.872
building the right
thing, that changed

00:08:06.872 --> 00:08:09.330
the course of how we did product
development, which I think

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.200
is different than what you'd
find in a more traditional

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.950
software or technology company.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.084
We really had to sort of
rethink how we did that.

00:08:17.084 --> 00:08:18.750
JORGE CUETO: You
mentioned that you went

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.610
to visit some senior homes.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.680
What else did you do in
terms of use of research

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.260
or validating the product
and getting feedback

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.990
on the product?

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.920
SANDY JEN: Yeah, so we knew we
didn't know anything, really.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.260
And if you think about home
care, it's basically two-sided.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.710
Actually, it's multisided.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.740
You have the person receiving
the care-- so the care

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.440
recipient who could
be older or have

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.950
different medical conditions.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.390
You have usually a family
member, sometimes not,

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.180
who might be the one
responsible for helping care

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.214
for the senior.

00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:51.630
And then you have
the person who's

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.900
actually doing the care--
the care professional.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.566
They're traditionally
called caregivers,

00:08:55.566 --> 00:09:00.290
but we really wanted
to raise their profile.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.840
The work they do is
really difficult,

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.230
so we actually call them
care professionals--

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.640
and then care pros for short--

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.840
to give them more of the respect
that they actually deserve.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.537
And so we had to basically
talk to everybody.

00:09:12.537 --> 00:09:14.370
So we plucked ourselves
out of the Bay Area,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.042
because the Bay
Area's kind of weird.

00:09:16.042 --> 00:09:18.000
As you all know, it's a
little bit of a bubble.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.640
So we went to different areas,
talked to different care pros,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.700
asking them, what is it you do?

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.830
What's hard in your life?

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.100
Why do you do this work?

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.840
A lot of folks who
at this wage level

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.695
could literally make more
flipping burgers at McDonald's,

00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:36.070
but they choose to do this
work because they really care.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.640
So it's like, why are
you making that decision?

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.830
What are the hardships
in your life?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.570
Why do you work for this
agency and not that agency?

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.840
So just really being
open to understanding

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.639
how they're thinking.

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:54.180
And then when you start to get
the same answers over and over

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.810
again, then you
start to think, OK,

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.540
now I'm seeing a
pattern and a trend.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.180
And that can then inform
the product that you build

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.362
and how you want to
create that interaction.

00:10:03.362 --> 00:10:05.070
JORGE CUETO: Your
comment about the wages

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.110
that the caregivers
are earning reminded me

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.860
that I saw the CNN article
that mentioned that in 2016 you

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.730
transitioned from a contractor
model to an employee model.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.075
Is that something
that continues today,

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.090
and why did you
choose to do that?

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:19.780
SANDY JEN: I think
in the beginning,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.520
we were like, all
right, we're just

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.936
going to try the
contractor model,

00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:25.260
because that seemed easiest.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.970
And so we started
recruiting people.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.040
And then it turns out that
there are certain restrictions

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.000
in a contractor model, that
you, for example, can't

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.340
train your folks very well.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.370
There are certain
limitations on the amount

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.420
of personal interaction
you can have with them.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.380
And so one of our core
tenants has always been,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.785
if you could treat the care
pro better and put them

00:10:48.785 --> 00:10:50.160
in a better place
in their lives,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.826
they'll be able to
do their jobs better.

00:10:51.826 --> 00:10:53.891
Because if you're
not happy at home

00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:55.390
and you're trying
to make ends meet,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.610
you're not going to be able
to care for people very well.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.680
And so one of the things that
we heard over and over again

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.290
from care pros was
that they might

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.880
get a $0.25 increase
in their hourly wage

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.510
after staying with an
agency for three years.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.544
There's no
performance-based reward.

00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:19.210
There's no way to
know who's a good care

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.899
pro, who's a bad care pro.

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:23.440
And so one of the things that
we thought would be really cool

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.230
and that they were
asking for was some way

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.364
to develop your career as a care
professional-- as a caregiver.

00:11:30.364 --> 00:11:31.780
And so the only
way you can really

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.906
do that, though, is to give
them signals as to what

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:35.321
they're doing
really well and what

00:11:35.321 --> 00:11:36.469
they're doing not so well--

00:11:36.469 --> 00:11:37.510
what they can improve on.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.830
And then you can train.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.720
And so one of the key
reasons we decided

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.810
to make the switch
to an employee model

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.435
is that with employees
you can actually

00:11:44.435 --> 00:11:47.110
train and develop and
really invest in them

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.620
as people and as workers.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.390
And so that was one
of the primary reasons

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.431
we decided to make that
change, and they're still

00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:55.867
employees today.

00:11:55.867 --> 00:11:57.700
JORGE CUETO: So then
you mentioned the value

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.630
to caregivers.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.280
So if we look at
this in comparison

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.500
to traditional senior care
centers or senior care models,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.480
what value do you add to
the other key players--

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.160
so then in this case, maybe
the seniors themselves

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.560
or also maybe the
family members who

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.830
are buying the care for
their senior family members?

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.000
SANDY JEN: Yeah, so the current
industry is very fragmented.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.890
So if you think about--

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.200
I think nationwide,
there's something

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.490
like 40,000 or 50,000 agencies.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.090
It's not because no one's ever
tried to make a large agency,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.710
it's just really hard.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.430
You have a bunch of people
on the demand side--

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.980
so all of your
seniors needing care.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.200
Let's say your
grandmother might have

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.080
a bad hip and this
chronic medical condition,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.030
and she's allergic
to dogs, and she

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.040
requires someone who
can lift someone out

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.240
of bed every morning.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.530
Or my mother or grandmother
might need to speak Mandarin,

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.120
and she's allergic to cats.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.209
And she has three
sets of stairs,

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:59.500
so you need somebody to be
able to lift her downstairs.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.280
So the requirements for people
are super heterogeneous.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.000
And then on the
supply side, care pros

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.445
are also very heterogeneous.

00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:10.320
This person might be
able to lift 200 pounds,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.446
but this person may not.

00:13:11.446 --> 00:13:12.820
This person speaks
this language.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.555
This person can only drive
five miles outside of her home,

00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:16.930
because she has
two kids that she

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.700
needs to pick up after work.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.500
And so there are all these
stipulations on both sides,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.650
and so doing a match is
actually really difficult.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.630
And so if you are a small
mom and pop agency--

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.150
which lot of these places are--

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.225
you don't have the logistical
operational technology

00:13:35.225 --> 00:13:36.850
brain to do that,
because you're trying

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.000
to do it all in your head.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So you might have a staff
of a few people trying

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.020
to match all these things.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.730
And so a lot of it
is also very analog,

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.766
so care pros will
literally have to take

00:13:47.766 --> 00:13:49.390
a telephone in the
morning and say, OK,

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.660
where am I going to go?

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.170
They'll literally take
their notes per visit

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.840
on a spiral bound
notebook with a pencil,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.210
and they'll leave
it on the desk.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.290
And so we also
talked to folks who

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.070
run agencies-- they'll
literally drive around

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.030
to all their clients,
pick up those notebooks,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.340
transcribe some of those
notes into their own system,

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.620
and then return all
the notebooks back.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.840
So it's just very manual.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.520
And so one of the
things that we hoped

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.610
to bring and have been bringing
is a more technology bent

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.567
on this for that rote work.

00:14:20.567 --> 00:14:22.150
And so one of the
key learnings for us

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.524
was that you could try
to automate everything,

00:14:24.524 --> 00:14:26.440
but we're not going to
send robots to do care.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.032
That's not going to work.

00:14:28.032 --> 00:14:30.490
And so what we can do, though,
is have computers do as much

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.330
of the rote tasks--

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.790
the matching algorithms,
the GPS tracking stuff--

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.610
and then let the humans
do the really human stuff.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.560
And so we can get
there about 80%,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.400
and then let the
humans do the rest.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.800
And so one of the things
that we've been trying to do

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.175
is actually just give more
transparency into the process.

00:14:50.175 --> 00:14:53.410
So if I live in California,
but my parents are on the East

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.144
Coast, and I have a
caregiver going every day,

00:14:57.144 --> 00:14:59.060
I can't go and find that
spiral bound notebook

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.100
and have someone read
that to me every day.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.926
So we have given an
app to the care pro.

00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:04.300
We've given an
app to the family.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.920
They can see notes right away.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.750
They can call in any time.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.750
Scheduling is a lot easier.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.020
The technology we use
to then be able to track

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.540
and give you progress notes
on how the visit is going

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.560
is amazing in this industry
for a lot of folks.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.540
And so just trying to up
the quality and transparency

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.320
of care itself has been
a huge goal for us--

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.250
and definitely the ability
to use technology to scale.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.220
Because we have all
this technology,

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.734
we might require one human
to do this instead of 10.

00:15:38.734 --> 00:15:40.150
And so when you
have that, you can

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.500
save a lot of that time to go
do other interesting, innovative

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.190
features to help
with care delivery.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.350
Technology is definitely
used to scale,

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.851
to make better care,
better quality.

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:53.600
But at the same time,
we have to recognize

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.030
that it can't replace humans.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.860
And so at the end of the day,
the human to human experience

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.579
is still the end product.

00:15:59.579 --> 00:16:01.370
JORGE CUETO: You
mentioned that you provide

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.590
training for your
care pros, so what

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.930
does that training encompass?

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.680
SANDY JEN: It can vary
to basic skill sets.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.290
Like how do you
lift and transfer

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:17.570
someone who's bedridden
out of bed into a chair?

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.860
How do you take someone
from their bed to a toilet?

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.430
There are things
like, OK, what is

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:31.030
the best way to assist someone
in this particular task?

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.560
And so we can also do things
like, oh, if this person has

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.190
Parkinson's, these are
specific tools and techniques

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.400
you can use to help
maneuver them physically.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.070
If someone has dementia,
here are techniques

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:49.940
and generally accepted ways
to communicate or to elicit

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.810
feedback from those folks.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.120
And so a lot of it is
skill-wise, but also,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.150
how do you basically interact
with different types of people?

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.700
Because a lot of our clients--

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.760
their conditions vary
greatly, so it's not

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.397
like one bucket fits all.

00:17:07.397 --> 00:17:09.980
JORGE CUETO: And in terms of the
composition of your audience,

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.220
are you looking at mainly
people who are soliciting care

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.250
for their family members, or
actually seniors themselves

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.720
who are asking for
services for themselves?

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.940
SANDY JEN: Yeah, it's both.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.690
We thought in the very
beginning that we'd

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.460
have more what we
call adult children.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.660
It's sort of a child or a
nephew or a family member

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.235
then responsible for
someone who is older.

00:17:29.235 --> 00:17:31.610
But we also have folks who
just want care for themselves.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.894
They recognize that they
want to stay at home.

00:17:33.894 --> 00:17:36.060
They don't want to go to a
nursing home or facility.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.934
And so having a little
bit of additional help

00:17:37.934 --> 00:17:39.690
is actually really useful.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.090
So yeah, it just really varies.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.202
But we definitely
have more folks

00:17:43.202 --> 00:17:44.660
who are getting
care for themselves

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.895
than we originally thought.

00:17:45.895 --> 00:17:47.270
JORGE CUETO: So
that, again, goes

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.471
to debunk that myth that
seniors don't really

00:17:49.471 --> 00:17:50.720
engage with technology, right?

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.928
Because they need to have
some understanding in order

00:17:52.928 --> 00:17:54.200
to reach you in some ways.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.970
SANDY JEN: Yeah, they
do have to find us.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.610
But at the same time, we
don't require any technology

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.210
to use Honor.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.640
That was a very conscious point.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.390
So if you don't want
to touch a computer,

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.490
you don't want to use an
app, you don't have to.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.040
Most of our customers call us.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.940
JORGE CUETO: So then you're
also seeing how maybe you

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.910
can leverage old
technology using

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.505
new technology for the
platform, but for the interface,

00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:20.380
relying on the older.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.380
SANDY JEN: Yeah, and so those
trends will change as well.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.100
So our current demographic-- a
lot of folks just want to call.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.950
And also, you think about
if you're an adult child,

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.330
and let's say your mom falls--

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.980
which is a very common
entryway into home care--

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.810
you go from knowing
nothing about home care

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.260
to someone saying your mom
needs eight hours of care a day.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.724
And you're like, oh my god,
what the hell is home care?

00:18:41.724 --> 00:18:43.640
And so you need to figure
out what's going on,

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.755
and you're in a very
emotional state.

00:18:45.755 --> 00:18:47.630
And so when you're in
a very emotional state,

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.140
you're not going to pick
up your iPhone and be like,

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.660
OK, I want care,
click click click.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.310
You're going to want
to call somebody.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.810
And so we have a
dedicated team of people

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.210
who answer those calls to
make sure that people can walk

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.880
people through that process.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.440
At same time, though, if you
have gotten care for a while,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.570
you know what home
care is, and all

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.111
you want to do is
press some buttons,

00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:05.250
you can do that as well.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.910
So there are different options.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.995
And that will probably change.

00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:10.370
One of our goals
is to make Honor

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.870
take care of us when we're old.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.185
So obviously, when
we're older, the times

00:19:14.185 --> 00:19:16.060
may be that no one wants
to call and everyone

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.100
wants to use an iPhone or an
Android phone or whatever.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.930
So we can kind of see the trends
coming into the industry, which

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.870
is a nice side
effect of not working

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.324
in younger social media stuff.

00:19:29.324 --> 00:19:31.490
Because I don't know what
the next 17-year-old wants

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.620
on her phone, but I do kind of
know what the next 50-year-old

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.220
wants.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.057
So that's been kind of
an interesting change.

00:19:37.057 --> 00:19:38.640
JORGE CUETO: And in
terms of scaling--

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.570
so I see this
in-home elderly care

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.632
as being something that requires
a lot of trust built over time

00:19:44.632 --> 00:19:47.090
and something that people really
have to open themselves up

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.890
to and be comfortable with.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.380
So how, as you're
scaling, do you

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.710
maintain that sense
of trust and comfort?

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.550
SANDY JEN: Yeah.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.050
I think the biggest
thing you can do

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.789
is also always
frame your product

00:19:58.789 --> 00:20:00.080
and your team in the right way.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.670
So when I said we don't think
of ourselves as a tech company,

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.670
but we think of ourselves
as a services company,

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.140
that's the core.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.930
That's the mission.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.455
And so trust is huge.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.640
I think a lot people are
like, oh, why don't you

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.720
just do childcare too?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.345
Unlike childcare,
where there's usually

00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:18.380
a hand-off where you're
physically present,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.750
you give your child to
a babysitter or a nanny,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.130
and then at the end of
the day the nanny returns

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.710
the child to you, that doesn't
always happen with senior care

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.334
because you generally don't live
with your parents at this age,

00:20:27.334 --> 00:20:31.310
or you're across country, or
you're not in the same area.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.480
And so the trust part--

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.437
it's kind of both
human and tech.

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:39.770
So on the human side, you
have to have a great care pro.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.772
If the person coming to
your home is terrible,

00:20:41.772 --> 00:20:43.730
obviously the trust just
goes down the toilet--

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.300
so being really good at
hiring really good care pros,

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.770
having the right kind
of vetting process,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.190
the right kind of training
process, interview process.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.450
The other part is
just supplementing

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.325
that with technology.

00:20:54.325 --> 00:20:56.562
So we have GPS turned
on for our care pros

00:20:56.562 --> 00:20:57.520
when they use the apps.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.721
We can tell if
they're there, right?

00:20:59.721 --> 00:21:01.220
That's also to
protect the care pro,

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.247
because we do have a
lot instances where

00:21:03.247 --> 00:21:04.830
the client's like,
oh no, the care pro

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.030
never showed up, because they
didn't want to expose something

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:08.870
to a family member.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.810
But they were like, well,
no, they were there.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.530
And so it's a
dual-sided thing, where

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.840
if you just come with
tech, it's too robotic.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.430
It's too cold.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.380
But if you just
come with humans,

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.250
there are a lot
of non-verifiable,

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.229
anecdotal things that--

00:21:26.229 --> 00:21:27.520
JORGE CUETO: Or inefficiencies.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.940
SANDY JEN: Yeah, or
inefficiencies or he

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.000
said she said things.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.208
And so you can kind of couple
those together and then

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:36.357
have a better package to then
improve on that trust metric.

00:21:36.357 --> 00:21:37.940
JORGE CUETO: Also
related to scaling--

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.330
so I saw that you guys are
available in California, New

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.100
Mexico, and Texas right now.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.590
How did you pick which
cities to go into first?

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.290
And then how do you
think about a new city

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.160
that you want to go into?

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.407
SANDY JEN: So a fear of ours is
actually just going too fast.

00:21:54.407 --> 00:21:56.240
You hear these stories
about other companies

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.150
who have really expanded,
and they had to retract.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.580
And we don't want to do
that, because if you retract

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.620
your service-- this
is a thing that's life

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.540
critical for a lot of people.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.390
And so every new market
that we did currently

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.600
was an experiment.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.010
So LA was like an
hour flight away.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.640
Can we do that?

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.190
Texas was, OK, it's a
couple hour flight away.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.330
Can we do that?

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.060
Different time zone, and I'm
sure all the engineers are

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.130
like, oh, time
zones, that sucks.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.560
So we had to kind of
figure out how to do that.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.830
And then Albuquerque
was a smaller area--

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.190
a less sort of
dense urban region.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.940
So we're like, OK,
can we handle that?

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.050
And so we definitely
wanted to learn,

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.850
and the best way to
learn is by doing.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.210
And so we really
carefully figured out

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.000
what markets would give
us the best learnings

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.460
to then be able to take
our model and scale out.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.970
So yes, eventually, we'd
love to be nationwide.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.930
In terms of the next
market we'll go to, again,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.820
it will probably
be a combination

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.710
of are there good
partnerships, what's

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.110
the demographic look like,
services level, what can we

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.450
learn from that
particular market--

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.172
things like that.

00:23:04.172 --> 00:23:05.630
JORGE CUETO: And
you were at Google

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.720
for about a year in 2012.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.800
Maybe you could tell
us if there's anything

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:15.206
that you learned while at Google
that has helped you with Honor.

00:23:15.206 --> 00:23:17.330
SANDY JEN: I learned I
didn't want to be at Google.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.276
But it was really
interesting, because I

00:23:20.276 --> 00:23:21.650
think from the
outside, Google is

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.700
this big, amazing, monolithic
technology company.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.920
And so it was very
interesting for me personally

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.870
to learn how that worked.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.799
When you come in, it's
like, OK, how do they

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:32.840
form their organizations?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.380
How do they make a product?

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.980
How do they make decisions?

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.570
What are the roles
that they hire for?

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:39.410
How do they hire?

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.300
And so for me, that was
really enlightening,

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.580
because it gave me a
different perspective

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.480
on how I did my team building.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.900
And so just being here
learning, OK, well, this team

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.480
operates this way, and
they set goals this way.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.050
Or they hire this way, or they
structure this team this way

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:02.000
in order to create
these incentives to get

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.470
this goal done.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.930
That was really useful so that
then I can incorporate that

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.010
into Honor and think about, OK,
when I'm building the team now,

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.094
how do I want to do it?

00:24:11.094 --> 00:24:12.260
I have learnings from Meebo.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.880
I have learnings from Google.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.487
How can I combine
those the right way?

00:24:16.487 --> 00:24:18.570
JORGE CUETO: And throughout
these first few years,

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.520
what do you see as something
that your team has done really

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.580
well at Honor?

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.089
SANDY JEN: We execute a lot
and crank out a lot of stuff.

00:24:29.089 --> 00:24:31.130
I think one of the things
that we did really well

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:38.900
was not rush the build, and
also having the realization

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.630
that we needed to be completely
open-minded, because none of us

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.640
are from health care.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.670
And so because the team
stayed small and nimble

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.770
and we were very focused--

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.290
I think focus for
startups is key.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.667
Most startups die from
suicide, not homicide.

00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:56.750
And so for us, we just had
to stay laser focused--

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.970
OK, what are we building?

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.100
And because some of us
have worked together before

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.350
and we were very
picky about hiring,

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.780
having really
high-bandwidth communication

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.170
really excels your timeline
to be able to build something.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.620
So most home care
agencies tap out

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.810
at a certain scale, which
is why the industry is

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.620
very fragmented.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.420
And so within three
years of our inception,

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.400
we are probably one the largest
home care entities in the Bay

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.079
Area-- maybe the largest.

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:27.620
It took us three years to get
there when it usually takes 15.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.690
So it kind of speaks
to a combination

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:35.169
of good teamwork, the right
technology, cutting edge stuff,

00:25:35.169 --> 00:25:37.460
and then really understanding
how to learn from things.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.890
I think one of the
downsides of the industry

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.110
is that there are so many
well-intentioned people,

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.480
but they don't have the
means and the technology

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.330
to learn and iterate.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:49.240
And so getting data is
really hard for them.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.430
Everything is in spiral bound
notebooks and things like that.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.050
And for us, we can
get a lot of data.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.860
We have so much data
about how care works,

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.660
how do you do matching, what are
the trends, what are we seeing

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.530
in terms of shift lengths, and
days, and areas, and markets,

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.630
and pricing, and wages.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.480
And so all of that you can
use to learn and improve

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.180
the service, when I think
the current industry

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.784
has a hard time accessing that.

00:26:12.784 --> 00:26:15.200
JORGE CUETO: And as you were
deciding whether to jump back

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.965
into doing a
startup or not, what

00:26:16.965 --> 00:26:20.730
were some factors that
you were considering?

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.360
SANDY JEN: That decision
is always very personal.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.962
So obviously, I was at the age
where I wanted to have kids.

00:26:26.962 --> 00:26:28.336
And so I was like,
well, it would

00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:29.919
be really nice to
just stay at Google,

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:32.600
because they have really
good maternity leave

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.810
and it's really comfortable.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.480
And I can have a very
routine schedule.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.940
At the same time,
though, I think

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.820
I had that need to do more.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.446
I think Meebo was great.

00:26:46.446 --> 00:26:47.570
I mean, I had a great time.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:51.570
But it didn't have the impact
that I think when we got older

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.930
we really wanted.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.596
And a startup's
average lifespan--

00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:58.220
I say this a lot--
is about seven years

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.490
to some sort of event or pivot.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.020
And so I was like,
well, do I really

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.910
want to dedicate
another seven years

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:09.220
and have kids while I do
that and all that stuff?

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:15.140
And so the allure of working
with my co-founders again,

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.812
it was just really good timing
in terms of the senior space.

00:27:19.812 --> 00:27:21.770
No one had really made
a big play in it before,

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.956
and we were like, we
can really solve this.

00:27:23.956 --> 00:27:26.330
I use this analogy a lot, and
my co-founder does as well.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.400
But a lot of problems
that entrepreneurs

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.461
run into that are big, if you
think about it like an onion,

00:27:31.461 --> 00:27:33.460
is that you peel back one
layer and you're like,

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.295
oh, I could solve that.

00:27:34.295 --> 00:27:35.260
You peel back
another layer, you're

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.350
like, I could solve that.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.700
And then at some point,
you keep peeling,

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.658
you hit this hard core.

00:27:38.658 --> 00:27:40.305
And you're like, crap.

00:27:40.305 --> 00:27:41.096
I can't solve that.

00:27:41.096 --> 00:27:43.400
There's a regulation,
or it would

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.454
take like 10 years
to build, or I

00:27:45.454 --> 00:27:47.120
had to get government
approval, and take

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.800
would take like six
years or whatever.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.934
But in the home care
space, we kept peeling.

00:27:51.934 --> 00:27:53.850
We couldn't find anything
that was super hard.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.120
We were like, oh, we could
solve that, we could solve

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.203
that, we could solve that.

00:27:56.203 --> 00:27:57.800
And that was just
really exciting.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.170
And so jumping back in,
we're like, all right.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.370
Let's just do this.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.190
Because you basically have
to commit 100% or zero.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.350
You can't half do it.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.870
And so we all kind
of said, all right,

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.060
let's just buckle up and do it--

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.590
have kids all along the way.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.110
And so the decision to do it was
actually a quite easy one when

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.940
we thought about it that way.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.530
And so far I've seen no regrets.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.960
JORGE CUETO: Yeah, that was a
really comprehensive answer.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.820
I think now we have
time to open it up

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.770
for the audience questions.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:31.650
AUDIENCE: Hi, Sandy.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.680
I have a question about--

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.860
I think what you're
doing is fantastic.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.660
I think you have a great
product and everything you're

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.270
doing for the senior community.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.710
A couple of years ago, I went
to the National Association

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.180
for the Deaf conference.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.500
It was in Atlanta.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.600
They also had one
in Phoenix as well.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.850
And I met a lot of members
from the deaf community

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.350
who are aging--

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.270
specific groups of
seniors helping people

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.870
find a place to go.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.160
Do you have any involvement
with the deaf community

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.290
with your product
or your services--

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.970
something that
would be accessible

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.530
for the deaf community?

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.750
SANDY JEN: So
specifically, we don't

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.090
have anything specifically
targeted towards the deaf.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.070
But like I said
before, our audience

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.425
and the client demographic,
it's very heterogeneous.

00:29:12.425 --> 00:29:16.100
So we have people with
all sorts of conditions.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.590
And so we don't say,
OK, just because you

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.890
have this condition or that
condition, we can't serve you.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.510
It's really dependent on the
kind of care the person needs.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.530
And so let's say someone is
deaf, they have a bad hip,

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:31.027
they require more lifting
and transferring out of bed,

00:29:31.027 --> 00:29:33.110
then we would just try to
find the right caregiver

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.740
to then service that person.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:40.970
So we do have partnerships
with more disease-specific

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:44.450
organizations-- so the
National Parkinson's Foundation

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:50.010
and cancer organizations.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.500
But in the future,
obviously, we'd

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.100
hope to partner
with more people.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.410
But again, there's no
specifically targeted service

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.060
for deaf, but just
because you're deaf

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.850
doesn't mean you
can't have home care.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.275
JORGE CUETO: Here's a
question from [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:04.275 --> 00:30:07.100
Besides Honor, what are key
technological improvements

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.470
that you believe have
improved elderly care?

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.090
What other technological
improvements

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.650
would you like to
see in the space

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.480
to improve the
experience for both

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.790
the caretaker and the elderly?

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.040
SANDY JEN: Yeah, I think the
biggest thing is probably

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.230
just access.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.540
There are a lot of
devices in market,

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.400
a lot of technologies that
are, like I said, really

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.100
specifically
targeted for seniors.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.860
But they're taking a
very non-granular stance.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.820
So like I said, the bigger
buttons, the big fonts.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.117
And if you talk to a
lot of older adults,

00:30:38.117 --> 00:30:39.950
they don't like things
dumbed down for them.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:42.290
They're like, I'm
perfectly capable of using

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.250
a regular device.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:48.140
So I think there needs to
be a change in the attitude,

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.080
I think, more than
the actual devices.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.560
Because if you sort of rethink
the way you frame technology,

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.060
you can--

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.250
I know plenty of seniors who
use iPhones and Android phones

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:02.700
in a very expert manner, and
there are some folks who don't.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:08.570
And so I think if you change
the way that you target seniors,

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.316
I think that will
be a big difference.

00:31:10.316 --> 00:31:12.815
Things that I think have been
really helpful for folks are--

00:31:18.872 --> 00:31:23.360
more educational tools
for folks who help seniors

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.500
is probably a good step.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.500
So the fact that we have
an app for care pros

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.090
is actually a huge, novel
thing for the industry.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.440
But it makes them
better enabled to help

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.940
people who require help.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:43.550
I would say one thing is that
a lot of the physical access

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.680
things that you and
I take for granted,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.474
like walking upstairs,
going through a door,

00:31:48.474 --> 00:31:50.390
remembering a lock code,
those kinds of things

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:54.050
could probably be improved
as the senior population gets

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:55.340
larger.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.180
So basically, I think that my
biggest thing is not specifics,

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.770
but more of the
attitude change I

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:05.120
think is probably more important
than the actual physical things

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.510
that are being built.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.885
JORGE CUETO: And
related to that,

00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:10.670
have you thought about maybe
expanding your sphere of care

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:15.140
into providing support services
for the family members who

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.280
are maybe learning about working
or supporting their family

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.550
members who are becoming
elderly and maybe

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.970
developing additional needs
that they didn't have before?

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:25.636
SANDY JEN: Yeah.

00:32:25.636 --> 00:32:27.560
So home care--
generally speaking,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.220
people don't think about it
until they really need it.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.720
So home care is
usually triggered

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.960
by an acute event, usually a
fall or a surgery or something

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.570
medical.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.430
If we had the conversation
a lot earlier,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.880
we could actually then introduce
care in a more lightweight

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.150
manner, so then that way the
transition into home care

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.700
is less jarring.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.610
In terms of family members, we
do have a lot of family members

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.070
who get home care
for their spouses

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.110
or their parents
as respite care.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.730
So they are the
primary caretaker.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.390
They live with the
person receiving care.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.040
But they might need
a day off, or they

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.230
might need three
days off every week,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.210
because it's kind
of a full time job.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.940
And so they supplement
with Honor or home care

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.480
to help with that.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.380
And I think the
other part of it is

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.650
that a lot of people who are in
this situation feel very alone.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:22.262
There aren't social networks
for people who are giving--

00:33:22.262 --> 00:33:24.470
who are receiving home care
for their family members.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.480
And no one talks about this
on Facebook or whatever.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.771
It's not like you're saying,
oh, my mom got care today.

00:33:28.771 --> 00:33:29.730
No one talks about it.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.970
So opening up the
conversation, having

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.480
more community around that
is one of our goals as well.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.190
And also, just the transparency.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:40.059
It's like having the peace
of mind to get home care,

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:40.850
because it's scary.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.200
It's like you're letting
a stranger into your home

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.870
and take care of your mom or dad
and doing very intimate things,

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.170
like going to the bathroom
or getting out of bed.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:53.130
And so the support network,
I think, needs to be there.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:57.200
Because almost everybody we
talked to has a personal story,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.620
but they never share it,
because it just doesn't come up.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.703
It's a very taboo subject.

00:34:00.703 --> 00:34:05.960
So hoping to open
up that dialogue

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.920
is one of the things
that we're trying to do,

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.389
which is why I think we frame
Honor in a very positive light.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:16.489
A lot of agencies or senior
related products on TV

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.739
you see are the help, I've
fallen, and I can't get up,

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:21.139
or it's very fear-based.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:25.138
We chose amber as a very bright
color, very positive color.

00:34:25.138 --> 00:34:26.929
We talk about it in a
very positive manner.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:31.670
We have positive images,
not images that instill fear

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:36.172
or the more scary side of that.

00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:37.880
JORGE CUETO: How do
you reach new clients

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.940
and convey values of trust
and safety in non-tech cities

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.800
where people have
not heard of Honor

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.017
and may rely on word of
mouth or local searches?

00:34:45.017 --> 00:34:47.600
SANDY JEN: Yeah, so health care,
traditionally, is very local,

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.170
so word of mouth is
extremely powerful.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.969
And you can't just win
home care market share

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.739
by advertising on
Google or Facebook,

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.660
because that's not
how you reach people.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.480
And like I said, a lot
of times, home care

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.879
is triggered by an acute event.

00:35:01.879 --> 00:35:03.295
And so you're not
paying attention

00:35:03.295 --> 00:35:05.820
to anything in home care or
in the elderly space or health

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.460
care space until
something happens.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.870
And then our job is to be
there when that happens.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.794
So addressing the
part where someone

00:35:13.794 --> 00:35:15.710
who's not very tech savvy
or they don't really

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.480
know much about Honor--

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.590
the one thing that we have to
portray is that we are human.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:26.210
And so prior to any
home care set of visits,

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.850
we send a person, one
of our care advisors,

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.219
to your home to
do a consultation.

00:35:31.219 --> 00:35:32.510
They talk you through the plan.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.260
They talk you through
what your needs are.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.190
They listen to what you need,
because a lot of times, people

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.030
just don't know.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.155
It's like, OK, my mom fell.

00:35:39.155 --> 00:35:39.950
What do I do?

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:42.408
You need someone to actually
walk you through that process.

00:35:42.408 --> 00:35:45.770
And so basically instilling
trust via a person

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:48.550
is still a great way to do
it, and so that's something

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.600
that we do definitely employ.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.040
And then also just being
a knowledge expert.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.499
So again, when you're
emotional, and you're scared,

00:35:55.499 --> 00:35:57.040
and you don't know
what you're doing,

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.970
you want someone to
tell you it's OK.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:59.930
I've done this before.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.220
I've seen this before.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.120
Let me listen to you.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.100
I can help you
through this process.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.250
And so that's a very,
very serious thing

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.760
that we take very seriously to
make sure that when people come

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.130
into Honor and when people
think about home care,

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:18.070
they think about Honor as a
very calming, expert voice.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:21.165
That's something we
strive to propagate.

00:36:21.165 --> 00:36:23.540
JORGE CUETO: You mentioned
that a lot of the seniors that

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.210
solicit care for themselves
reach out to you via phone.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.850
So how do they find you?

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:32.330
Do you also advertise in
traditional media as well--

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.364
Yellow Pages, all those?

00:36:33.364 --> 00:36:34.030
SANDY JEN: Yeah.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.050
So it's been a bit of
a challenge to find out

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.380
where those things are.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.310
A lot of times, like I said,
word of mouth is most powerful,

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.320
so reaching the influencers
within a community--

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:52.280
so like a local pastor, a
local senior organization,

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.770
a discharge nurse at a
facility happens to know all

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.560
the community
members, the mayor--

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.650
whoever is sort of a
community influencer.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.220
So that's one way to do it.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.960
The other way is just basically
to provide care and then have

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.575
referrals.

00:37:06.575 --> 00:37:08.450
So if someone has a
great experience with us,

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.722
they will tell their friends.

00:37:09.722 --> 00:37:11.930
Because generally speaking,
if you were getting care,

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.690
you probably know other
people that are getting care.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.720
And then, obviously,
you try to advertise

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.920
in the normal channels.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.669
But those are a little
bit less effective,

00:37:20.669 --> 00:37:23.330
just because it can be generally
not in your frame of mind

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:24.830
when you need to.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.110
And then the other
part is to partner

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.780
with other people who
deal with seniors.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.150
So we opened up
a partner network

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.820
to work with existing
home care agencies.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.470
We work with systems-- so
hospitals and facilities,

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.530
nursing facilities, discharge
facilities-- to help spread

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.290
the word so that they know
that Honor is an option

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.750
and that we're
differentiated from the rest

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.460
of the other agencies
around, because we

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.825
have all these benefits.

00:37:51.825 --> 00:37:54.200
JORGE CUETO: So then even
these traditional organizations

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.190
are willing to work with you?

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.780
They're not scared
that somehow you're

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.506
going to take over or encompass
some of what they're doing

00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:00.880
and take business
away from them?

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.900
SANDY JEN: Yeah, so
it's been interesting

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:07.070
with that particular
partnership network.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.170
Like I said, a lot of
current home care agencies

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.430
have a hard time growing,
because they're like,

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:12.897
I have two people.

00:38:12.897 --> 00:38:13.730
It's all in my head.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:14.790
I don't have technology.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.600
It's really hard for
me to wrangle care pros

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.360
and hire care pros
and match care pros.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.580
I get calls at 2:00 AM when
a care pro can't make it,

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.306
and I have to go and
do the care of myself.

00:38:25.306 --> 00:38:26.930
And so they have to
deal with all that,

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.346
and they don't
tend to grow a lot.

00:38:28.346 --> 00:38:32.300
So one of our benefits is that
we're really good at the care

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:32.980
pro part.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.010
We're really good at
the recruiting part.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.050
We have technology to
help us do all that stuff.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.540
And so if we can take
that burn away from them,

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.550
they can actually grow.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.758
And so it's actually a really
good partnership, where

00:38:41.758 --> 00:38:44.810
we both benefit from that.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.100
We both have the same mission.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.630
We're trying to help people.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.620
But they're good at one part,
we're good at another part.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.620
So if you put it together,
it's actually really good.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:54.120
JORGE CUETO: So I think this
is actually really cool to see,

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.040
because I think so much of the
newer service-based economy--

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.120
you look at maybe Uber
or these other startups--

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.840
people see them as supplanting
an existing industry.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.590
And there's a lot of
pushback and conflict

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:11.060
between the traditional industry
and the new tech company.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.250
Whereas here, I think
it's sort of you're

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.860
trying to work
together and make it

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.060
more of a mutual relationship.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.835
SANDY JEN: Yeah, definitely.

00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:21.710
Initially, people are
a little bit skeptical.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.293
They're a little bit
like, wait, what?

00:39:23.293 --> 00:39:26.120
You're from Silicon Valley,
what are you guys doing?

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.995
But when you explain how we
work, why we're doing this,

00:39:29.995 --> 00:39:31.370
why we're mission
focused, things

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:33.170
like that, then they
start to be like, oh, wow.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.550
If I really partner
with you, we can really

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.680
make a better difference,
a bigger difference,

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.150
and help more people.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.490
Because a lot of these
people who come into

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.010
the industry are genuinely
there just to help people.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.119
They could make more
money doing other things,

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:46.910
but they really like
the work, because they

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.868
get to interact with
clients and talk to people

00:39:48.868 --> 00:39:51.000
and help them
through these things.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.330
And so when they find
a willing partner

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:57.860
like Honor who has all these
skills and tech and teams

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.290
that they don't have, it's
actually pretty exciting.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:04.760
So it's a new way to innovate
on an existing model, I think,

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.651
that both sides are
pretty excited about.

00:40:07.651 --> 00:40:09.650
JORGE CUETO: Another
question from [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:12.094
What are some key technology
or product decisions

00:40:12.094 --> 00:40:13.760
that had to be made
to ensure that Honor

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.620
is friendly both to the elderly
users and also to the family

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:24.140
members who are on different
panes of technology

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:24.930
familiarity?

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:25.596
SANDY JEN: Yeah.

00:40:25.596 --> 00:40:27.690
So like I said before,
we don't require anybody

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.310
to know anything
about apps or phones

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:30.930
or websites to use Honor.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:33.270
So they could completely
do everything by phone

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.070
if they wanted to,
because we know

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.020
that's a huge part
of our audience.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.640
At the same time,
though, we do want

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.050
to push the envelope
a little bit

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:42.630
and give folks the option
of using technology

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.010
to see the benefits of it.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:49.380
So all the technology is
optional for the care team

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.680
of a particular care recipient.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.300
So if the family member
chooses to use the family app,

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:55.800
they can.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.720
If they don't want to,
they don't have to.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.960
If they want to log into the
website and see all their bills

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.604
and see the care notes
and get emails, they can.

00:41:03.604 --> 00:41:05.520
But if they don't want
to, they don't have to.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.060
So we are trying to be
very respectful of the way

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.460
the current industry works
and how some people just

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.780
don't want to touch--

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.480
it's just too complicated
to touch tech.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.900
At the same time,
though, if there

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.290
are folks who really
want to take that leap,

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:21.340
we're there with them as well.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:25.797
The one thing we do require
our care pros have is the app,

00:41:25.797 --> 00:41:26.880
and they actually love it.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.575
So we do push the
technology on the workforce.

00:41:29.575 --> 00:41:32.470
But it definitely makes
them more effective,

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:35.310
more aware of what's
going on, better

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:37.290
enable them to find more
jobs, find more work,

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.130
and earn more money.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.180
So that's sort of our balance.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.180
But yeah, if you don't
know anything about tech,

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.310
you can just use a rotary
phone and call us every day

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:46.710
if you wanted to.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.910
JORGE CUETO: Elderly care
by non-family members

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.660
is common in the US, but
in some other countries

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.360
like the Ukraine, it is
not culturally accepted.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.380
But there is a
huge market for it.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.780
I wonder your thoughts on how to
help make a service like Honor

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.890
be acceptable in such a culture.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:04.350
SANDY JEN: Yeah.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:08.040
People have reached out
to us from different care

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.870
organizations from
different countries

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.800
wondering when we're going
to expand to their country.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.216
Obviously, we'd love to do
that one day, but obviously not

00:42:14.216 --> 00:42:15.120
right now.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.620
Culturally, you have to respect
the way that care works.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.220
But I think the trend of
more and more people moving

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.950
to more urban areas, more
and more people moving out

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.800
of their city that
they're born in,

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.690
tends to consolidate a lot
of the same types of concerns

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:34.680
around senior care.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:39.720
So if you don't live in the
same place as your parents,

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.250
moving your parents
to where you are

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.730
can be rather expensive if
you live in a more urban area.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:48.060
Real estate is tighter,
houses are smaller,

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.460
transportation is harder,
especially in accessibility.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.782
So if someone has a 90-year-old
mother who can't do stairs

00:42:54.782 --> 00:42:57.240
very well, but you live on the
sixth floor of an apartment,

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.430
that's a really difficult
thing to have to deal with.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.180
And so even though
culturally, people

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.850
may have different expectations,
I think a lot of the trends

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.710
are moving towards
the same direction.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:10.680
And so I think in
the future, we have

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.520
to just find that balance
of obviously respecting

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.690
the current tradition,
but also pushing folks

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:19.810
to understand the reality
of what's happening.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.954
And then maybe
all the caregivers

00:43:23.954 --> 00:43:26.370
in the particular country are
very different from the ones

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:26.869
in the US.

00:43:26.869 --> 00:43:28.980
Maybe they're different,
maybe they're not.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.100
If we can introduce a
way of doing things,

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:36.220
maybe that spurs a new
kind of trend or movement.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.070
But at the end of the day,
I think, generally speaking,

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:42.450
a lot of countries are migrating
towards the same problems.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.720
JORGE CUETO: Words matter
in the space that you're

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.650
working in right now.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.900
How does your messaging
change between the patient

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.170
versus the family member
or caregiver to communicate

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.750
your value proposition?

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.220
What has resonated the
most and the least?

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.765
Who's usually making
the purchase decision?

00:44:01.765 --> 00:44:03.140
SANDY JEN: So
generally speaking,

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.598
it's usually the
adult child that's

00:44:04.598 --> 00:44:08.810
making the purchase
decision, and so it's

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.970
an interesting conversation.

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.040
So the most effective
communicator

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.210
is usually the family
member to the senior.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.410
But sometimes it's not.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.662
So we do have care recipients
who are resistant to care.

00:44:21.662 --> 00:44:23.370
So they don't want
someone in their home,

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.470
they don't want care
even though they need it.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:28.640
And sometimes they would rather
talk to us than their family

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.756
member, because they don't want
to expose some of their needs

00:44:32.756 --> 00:44:33.630
to the family member.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.780
Because what happens is
that when you expose that,

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.370
you are exposing
a lack of control,

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.720
and that's really scary.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.880
And so a lot of times, we'll
have this interesting dynamic

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.390
where a person getting care
doesn't want to tell the family

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.470
member all that happened.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:50.670
But they're willing
to tell the care pro,

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:51.961
because the care pro's helping.

00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:56.540
So again, it's all
dependent on the situation.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.330
For the most part, we do
do a lot of communication

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.970
through the family
member who is the one

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:05.450
responsible for the care or
the billing relationship.

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:07.400
But a lot of times,
when the care recipient

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.410
is the actual account
owner, then we directly

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.650
communicate with them.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.530
JORGE CUETO: Can you
tell us about how

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:13.610
you train your care pros?

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.760
Is it in-person training,
or mostly online?

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.920
SANDY JEN: So most of it
right now is in person.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.753
That's usually most
effective, because a lot

00:45:20.753 --> 00:45:24.050
of it's physical stuff
that we're teaching.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.600
We are hoping to expand
to more online things,

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.410
but for now, a lot of it
is physical in the office,

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:36.020
on the job, and also through
the app or phone or text

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:36.920
communication.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.314
We talk to our
care pros a lot so

00:45:38.314 --> 00:45:40.230
that they're in constant
communication with us

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.686
on what they need to do.

00:45:41.686 --> 00:45:43.310
JORGE CUETO: And then
how many families

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.170
are you currently helping?

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.510
SANDY JEN: So that's not a
number we'd generally expose,

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:51.380
but our canned answer
to that is that we

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.310
serve the entire bay area,
LA, Dallas-Fort Worth,

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.360
and Albuquerque.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.124
And we started in
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

00:45:58.124 --> 00:46:00.290
so it kind of gives you a
general idea of the market

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.790
sizes.

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:03.590
But we don't actually
expose the actual number.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.650
JORGE CUETO: And then related
to the idea of expanding

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:10.430
potentially to areas
where it's not culturally

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:15.590
common for non-family members
to take care of the elderly,

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:20.760
how do you think about not just
expanding into those areas,

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.580
but maybe creating materials to
help people in those areas who

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.550
maybe don't necessarily
interface with your business

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.340
directly, but maybe you
just provide resources?

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.911
SANDY JEN: Yeah,
so that goes back

00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:34.910
to the point where just
being a knowledge expert

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.140
is actually really helpful.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.570
And not just having
an online presence,

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.517
but going and getting
into the communities

00:46:41.517 --> 00:46:43.350
is actually a really,
really positive thing.

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.500
So when you go to
a senior center,

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:51.900
or you go to a local event,
you can just be there and then

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.380
be a familiar face.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.590
So then when people have
questions, they're like,

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:56.048
oh, you should talk
to this person.

00:46:56.048 --> 00:47:00.080
They kind of have a better idea
of how the elderly space works.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.970
Then you start to
embed yourself better.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:09.890
And so part of the way to
get better word of mouth

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.390
is just taking
advantage of the fact

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:13.807
that health care and
home care is very local,

00:47:13.807 --> 00:47:15.140
and so you have to respect that.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.940
You can't just be like, I'm
this giant national entity.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.160
I'm just going to go and
spread ads everywhere.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:19.970
That doesn't work.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:23.390
You have to really go in and
participate and talk to people

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:27.260
and actually be in the
community to really make a dent,

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.812
so that's generally the tack
that we'll probably take.

00:47:29.812 --> 00:47:31.520
AUDIENCE: So what's
the pricing structure

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.680
look like in this industry, and
where does Honor place itself?

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.870
SANDY JEN: Yeah, so pricing
generally is by shift length.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:42.710
So it's hourly, because the
care pros get paid hourly.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:46.490
We're kind of right
smack in the middle

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:50.070
with most of the industry
in terms of our pricing.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:52.280
Certain areas are a
little harder to serve.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.970
So for example, if you
are a care pro making

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.740
minimum wage or a
little bit above,

00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.790
a $6 bridge toll from the
East Bay to the peninsula

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:03.170
is a lot of money for you.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.440
And so it's much harder for
you to get from East Bay to,

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.700
let's say, Palo Alto.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:12.170
And so in certain harder to
reach areas-- so Palo Alto,

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:13.940
parts of San
Francisco-- prices can

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.690
be a little higher
because we have to be

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.660
able to pay the care pro more.

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:21.830
That's generally more of a
common trend with home care.

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:25.832
But generally speaking, we're
very much market prices.

00:48:25.832 --> 00:48:27.290
And our hope is
that because we can

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:32.300
take a lot of the manual
work out the process,

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.730
we can maybe at some point
charge a little less,

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.430
pay a little more, and be able
to take those gains because we

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.919
have a little more
efficiency within our system.

00:48:39.919 --> 00:48:42.210
JORGE CUETO: And since you're
using the employee model,

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.080
does that mean
that care pros have

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.220
to work a certain number
of hours or certain shifts

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.580
during the week?

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:47.310
SANDY JEN: No.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:51.050
With W-2s, you don't have
to enforce a certain hour.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:55.070
We have some folks who work
with us on more of a part time

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:57.379
basis, or they just pick
up shifts in the evening

00:48:57.379 --> 00:48:59.420
or on the weekends because
they have another job.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.370
We have other folks who use
this as their primary gig.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:02.911
And so we are their
primary employer,

00:49:02.911 --> 00:49:05.440
and they take most of
their work from us.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.720
It's more flexible, I think,
than people think about when

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.090
thinking about employee model.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:14.570
But we do realize
that care pros have

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:18.710
a lot of restrictions in terms
of what they can and can't do.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.996
Folks at Google
generally don't have--

00:49:20.996 --> 00:49:23.120
when you have trouble with
your car, it's like, oh,

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:23.994
it's really annoying.

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:26.360
But when your car
is the only thing

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:31.470
that is really providing
your work conduit,

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:32.780
it's a lot harder.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.390
And so we just make sure
that we're respectful of that

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:38.300
and we provide enough
options of types

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.439
of work for our care pros.

00:49:39.439 --> 00:49:41.480
JORGE CUETO: And wrapping
up, I have one question

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:44.690
about any specific
technology or product

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.790
that you're excited
about in the near future.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.079
SANDY JEN: I would say the--

00:49:50.079 --> 00:49:51.620
JORGE CUETO: It can
be more than one.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:52.286
SANDY JEN: Yeah.

00:49:52.286 --> 00:49:55.010
I guess just related to Honor,
there's much more attention

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:56.660
now to seniors.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.260
I think that's awesome.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.390
Before Honor, there was no
funding in the senior space.

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:06.350
And now we have
companies really,

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:09.510
really focusing on how
to cater to seniors--

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:11.270
not just building
devices or technology,

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:14.620
but really thinking about it
from an offerings perspective,

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.970
just because the baby boomers
and the senior population

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:20.970
is just going to explode
in the next 10 to 20 years.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.940
So I would say maybe
nothing specific,

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:28.850
but anybody really investing
in not just seniors,

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.520
but demographics of audiences
that are not traditionally

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.400
invested in I think is awesome.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.170
And that's what I'm
really excited about.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:35.570
JORGE CUETO: Great.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.980
Thank you so much, and
thank you for coming today.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:38.850
SANDY JEN: Thanks for having me.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:40.849
JORGE CUETO: Thank you
everyone for coming here.

00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:45.550
