00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.530
Let's say I have a position
vector function that looks like

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:12.202
this. r of t is equal to x of t
times the unit vector i plus y

00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:15.075
of t times the unit vector j.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:18.030
And let me actually graph this.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.580
So let's say, r of t, I want
to draw it a little bit

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.875
straighter than that.

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:28.630
So that's my y-axis, that is my
x-axis, and let's say r of t,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.900
and this is for t is less
than, let me write this.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.810
So this is for t is
between a and b.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.220
So when t is equal to a, we're
at this vector right here.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.170
So if you actually substitute t
is equal to a here, you'd get

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.070
a position vector that would
point to that point over there.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.670
And then, as t increases, it
traces out a curve, or the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.210
endpoints of our position
vectors trace a curve that

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.730
looks something like that.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.190
So when t is equal to b, we get
a position vector that points

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.510
to that point right there.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.800
So this defines a path.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.570
And the path is going in
this upward direction,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.950
just like that.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.770
Now let's say that we have
any another position

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.440
vector function.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:27.630
Let me call it r of t.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.220
It's a different one.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.970
It's the green r.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.350
r of t.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.950
Instead of being x of t times
i, it's going to be x of a plus

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.890
b minus t times i, and instead
of y of t, it's going to be y

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.470
of a plus b minus t times i.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.640
And we've seen this in
the last two videos.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.310
This, the path defined by this
position vector function is

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.020
going look more like this.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.640
Let me draw my axes.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.820
This is my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.430
Maybe I should label
them, y and x.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.710
This path is going to
look just like this.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.390
But instead of starting here
and going there, when t is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.780
equal to 1, let me make it
clear, this is also true for

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.840
a is less than or equal to
t, which is less than b.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.750
So t is going to
go from a to b.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.900
But here, when t is equal
to a, you substitute it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.660
over here, you're going
to get this vector.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.520
You're going to start over
there, and as you increment t,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.600
as you make it larger and
larger and larger, you're going

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.010
to trace out that same path,
but in the opposite direction.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.750
And so when t is equal to b,
you put that in here, you're

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.550
actually going to get x of a
and y of a there, right, the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.300
b's cancel out, and so you're
going to point right like that.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.480
So these are the same, you
could imagine the shape of

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.310
these paths are the same, but
we're going in the exact

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.750
opposite direction.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.180
So what we're going to do in
this video is to see what

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.390
happens, how, I guess you could
say, if I have some vector

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:17.010
field f of xy equals p
of xy i plus q of xy j.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.220
Right?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.250
This is just a vector
field over the x-y plane.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.800
How the line integral of this
vector field, of this vector

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.640
field over this path, compares
to the line integral the same

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.500
vector field over that path.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.280
How that compares to this.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.770
We'll call this
the minus curve.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.020
So this is the positive
curve, we're going to call

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.910
this the minus curve.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.400
So how does it, going over
the positive curve, compare

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.330
to going over the minus
curve? f of f dot dr.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.640
So before I break into the
math, let's just think

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.310
about a little bit.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.540
Let me draw this
vector field f.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.720
So maybe it looks, I'm just
going to draw random stuff.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.540
So you know, on every point in
the x-y plane, it has a vector,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.560
it defines or maps a vector, to
every point on the x-y plane.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.800
But we really care about the
points that are on the curve.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.600
So maybe on the curve, you
know, this is the vector field

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.685
at the points on the curve.

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:21.150
And let me draw it
over here, too.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.520
So all the points on the curve
where we care about, this is

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.120
our vector field, that
is our vector field.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.030
And let's just get an intuition
of what's going to be going.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.990
We're summing over the dot,
we're taking each point along

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.440
the line, and we're summing,
let me start over here.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.153
We're taking each point along
the line, let me do it

00:04:43.153 --> 00:04:45.450
in a different color.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.035
And we're summing the dot
product of the value of the

00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:53.910
vector field at that point, the
dot product of that, with dr,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.430
or the differential of our
position vector function.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.770
And dr, you can kind of
imagine, as an infinitesimally

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.620
small vector going in the
direction of our movement.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.080
And we take this dot product
here, it's essentially, it's

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.340
going to be a scalar value,
but the dot product, if you

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.530
remember, it's the magnitude
of f in the direction of dr,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.350
times the magnitude of dr.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.750
So it's this, you can imagine
it's the shadow of f onto

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.040
dr. Let me zoom into that,
because I think it's useful.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.880
So this little thing that I'm
drawing right here, let's

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.070
say that this is my path.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.470
This is f at that point.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.260
f at that point looks
something like that.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.500
And then dr at this point
looks something like that.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.840
Let me do it in different
color. dr looks

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.230
something like that.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.930
So that is f.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.300
And so the dot product of these
two says, ok, how much of f is

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.670
going in the same
direction as dr?

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.940
And you can kind of
imagine, there's a shadow.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.800
If you take the f that's going
in the same direction as dr,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.410
the magnitude of that times the
magnitude of dr, that

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.400
is the dot product.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.170
In this case, we're going
to get a positive number.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.360
Because this length is
positive, this length is

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.030
positive, that's going to
be a positive number.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.180
Now what if our dr was going
in the opposite direction,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.600
as it is in this case?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.445
So let me draw maybe that
same part of the curve.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.500
We have our f, our f will
look something like that.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.520
I'm drawing this exact
same part of the curve.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.470
But now our dr isn't
going in that direction.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.470
Our dr that at this point
is going to be going in

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.730
the other direction.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.800
We're tracing the curve in
the opposite direction.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.540
Our dr is now going to be
going in that direction.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.430
So if you do f dot dr, you're
taking the shadow, or how much

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.550
of f is going in the direction
of dr, you take the shadow

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.550
down here, it's going in the
opposite direction of dr. So

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.840
you can imagine that when you
multiply the magnitudes, you

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.930
should get a negative number.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.870
Our direction is now opposite,
they're not going in the-- the

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.320
shadow of f onto the same
direction is dr is going in the

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.540
opposite direction as dr.
In this case, it's going in

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.090
the same direction as dr.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.010
So the intuition is that maybe
these two things are the

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.480
negative of each other.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.490
And now we can do some
math and try to see if

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.090
that is definitely,
definitely the case.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.170
So let us first figure out,
let's write an expression for

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:29.830
the differential dr. So in this
case, dr, dr dt is going to be

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:40.990
equal to x prime of t times i
plus y prime of t times j.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:48.130
In this other example, in the
reverse case, our dr, dr

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.350
dt, is going to be, what's
it going to be equal to?

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.540
It's the derivative of
x with respect to t.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.530
The derivative of this term
with respect to t, that's the

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.260
derivative of the inside, which
is minus 1, or minus, times

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.840
the derivative of the outside
with respect to the inside.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.080
So that's going to be,
derivative of the inside is

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.350
minus 1, times the derivative
of the outside with respect to

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:15.260
the inside. x prime of a
plus b minus t times i.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.640
And then same thing
for the second term.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.930
Derivative of y of this term
with respect to the inside,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.960
which is minus 1, times the
derivative of the outside with

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.470
respect to the inside, which is
y prime of a plus b minus t.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.240
So this is going to be the
derivative of the inside,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.650
times y prime of a
plus b minus is t j.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.660
So this is dr dt in this case,
this is dr dt in that case.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.620
And if we wanted to write the
differential dr in the forward

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:51.510
curve example, it's going to be
equal to x prime of t times i

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:58.870
plus y prime of t times
j times the scalar dt.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.220
I could multiply it down into
each of these terms, but

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.060
it keeps it simple, just
leaving it on the outside.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.150
Same logic over here.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.510
dr is equal to minus x.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.850
I changed my shade of green,
but at least it's still green.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:21.100
a plus b minus t i minus y
prime a plus b minus t j,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.320
and I'm multiplying
both sides by dt.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.940
Now we're ready to express
this as a function of t.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.870
So this curve right here, I'll
do it in pink, the pink one is

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.340
going to be equal to the
integral from t is equal to a

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:53.630
to t is equal to b of f of f of
x of f of x of t y of t dot

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.820
this thing over here, which is,
I'll just write out here, I

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.002
could simplify it later.

00:09:59.002 --> 00:10:06.260
x prime of t i plus
y prime of t j.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.930
And then all of that
times the scalar dt.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.230
This'll be a scalar value, and
then we'll have another scalar

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.190
value of dt over there.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.490
Now, what is this going
to be equal to if I take

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.630
this reverse integral?

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.275
The reverse integral is going
to be the integral from, I'm

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:26.880
going to need a little more
space, from a to b, of f of not

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.220
x of t, but x of a plus b minus
t y of a plus b minus t.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.550
I'm writing it small
so I have some space.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.160
Dot, this is a vector, so dot
this guy right here, dot dr.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:53.800
Dot minus x prime of a plus b
minus t i, minus y prime of,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.110
I'm using up too much space.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.770
Let me scroll, go
back a little bit.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.680
Actually, let me take it
make it even simpler.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.690
Let me take this minus
sign out of it.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.400
Let me put a plus, and
then I'll put the

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.790
minus sign out front.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.260
So the minus sign is just a
scalar value, so we could put

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.710
that minus sign out, you know,
when you take a dot product,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.180
and if you multiply a scalar
times a dot product, you could

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.680
just take the scalar out,
that's all I'm saying.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.880
So we take that minus sign
out to this part right here.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:30.030
And then you have x prime of a
plus b minus t i plus y prime

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:39.970
of a plus b minus t, scroll
over a little bit, t j dt.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.130
So the this is the forward,
this is when we're following it

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.930
along the forward curve, this
is when we're following it

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.490
along the reverse curve.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.230
Now like we did with the
scalar example, let's

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.990
make a substitution.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.100
I want to make it very
clear what I did.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.330
All I did here, is I just
took the dot product,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.600
but this negative sign,
I just took it out.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.290
I just said, this is the same
thing as negative 1 times this

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.200
thing, or negative 1 times this
thing is the same

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.230
thing as that.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.610
So let's make a substitution on
this side, because I really

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.900
just want to show you that this
is the negative of that, right

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.880
there, because that's what
our intuition was going for.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.220
So let me just focus
on that side.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.980
So let me make a substitution.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:21.530
u is equal to a plus b minus t.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.720
Then we get du is equal
to minus dt, right?

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.770
Just take the derivative
of both sides.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.230
Or you get dt is
equal to minus du.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:37.890
And then you get, when t
is equal to a, u is equal

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.050
to a plus b minus a.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.070
So then, u is equal to b.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:49.140
And then when t is equal to
b, u is equal to a, right?

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.530
Which is equal to b, a
plus b minus b is a.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.230
u is equal to a.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:57.813
So this thing, using that
substitution simplifies to, and

00:12:57.813 --> 00:13:03.380
this is the whole point, that
simplifies to minus integral

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.010
from u is, when t is a, u is b.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.570
From b, when t is b, u is a.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.930
The integral from u is equal
to b to u is equal to a of

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:21.140
f of x of u y of u, right?

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.000
That is u, that is u.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:39.330
Dot x prime of u times i,
that's u right there, plus

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:44.240
y prime of u times j.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.360
And then, instead of a
dt, I need to put a du.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.970
dt is equal to minus du.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.190
So I could write minus du
here, or just to not make it

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.780
confusing, I'll put the du
here, and take the

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.900
minus out front.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.230
I already have a minus out
there, so they cancel out.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.730
They will cancel out,
just like that.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.480
And so you might say, hey Sal,
these two things look pretty

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.320
similar to each other.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.770
They don't like they're
negative of each other.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.080
And I'd say, well, you're
almost right, except this guy's

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.240
limits of integration are
reversed from this guy.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.810
So this thing right here, if
we reverse the limits of

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.730
integration, we have to
then make it negative.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:29.390
So this is equal to minus the
integral from a to b of the

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:40.920
vector f of x of u y of u dot
x prime of u i plus

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.540
y prime of u j du.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.900
And now this is identical.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.510
This integral, this definite
integral, is identical to

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.620
that definite integral.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.870
We just have a
different variable.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.620
We're doing dt here, we have du
here, but we're going to get

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.220
the same exact number for any a
or b, and given this

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:06.050
vector f and the position
vector path r of t.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:11.430
So just to summarize everything
up, when you're dealing with

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.500
line integrals over vector
fields, the direction matters.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.530
If you go in the reverse
direction, you're going to get

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.520
the negative version of that.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.610
And that's because at any point
we take the dot product, you're

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.060
not going in the, necessarily,
you're going in the opposite

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.330
direction, so it'll be the
negative of each other.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.730
But when you're dealing with
the scalar field, we saw on the

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:37.430
last video, we saw that it
doesn't matter which direction

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.100
that you traverse the path in.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.490
That the positive path
has the same value as

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.210
the negative path.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.600
And that's just because we're
just trying to find the

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.590
area of that curtain.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.670
Hopefully you found
that mildly amusing.
