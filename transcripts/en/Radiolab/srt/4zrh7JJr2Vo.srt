hey, it's Molly Webster from radio
lab. Before we get into the show today,

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,670
I wanted to tell you something and that's
it. Radiolab has a newsletter we do.

17

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,073
Okay.

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,160
You're listening to radio lab from New
York public radio, public radio, W,

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,900
C, n, n. P. R.

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,613
[inaudible]

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,513
[inaudible].

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,220
Some people go to therapy, some to church,

27
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,770
others come here to the northwest
corner of a parking lot on fire island,

28
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:56,390
where most nights you'll find
a handful of people looking up.

29
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,900
I come down here quite often.
It's a great place to stargaze.

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,930
You've got the sound of the ocean in
the background with the crashing waves,

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,830
stash the relaxation of it. You
know, the night I visited this guy,

32
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:11,750
Ron was about one of 20 enthusiasts,
huddled over astro maps,

33
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,580
staring through telescopes of all
sizes is quite a quite a telescope,

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,410
some so big and needed a ladder. Wow.
That's a big cluster of stars. Yes,

35
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:26,390
it certainly is. Do you get
attached to certain stars? Oh yeah.

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,760
Yeah, yeah. You did. You get begin.

37
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,710
You know the first one
she ever found and stuff.

38
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,170
Do you remember your first walk?
Yeah. Beerio was one of my,

39
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,480
I really like Ron's gonna show
it to you at MCAP. You can do it.

40
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,170
I didn't catch your name actually. John,
what it is that to the naked eye yet?

41
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,600
A just those like a
really famous single star.

42
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:51,110
But when you look at it through a
telescope, Zen look in there. Yeah.

43
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,160
Oh my God, they're so bright.
Lights like through the telescope.

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,500
Al Berio looked like a headlight. Bright
and flat and close. Very immediate.

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,800
But that was nothing compared to
what happened next. A woman walks up,

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,020
points her finger at the
star. Okay, so is it,

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,090
is that the one up here and
touches it? That one right

48
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,150
touches the star. That's really cool.

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,850
That was one of the things. It's
describe what you just did please.

50
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,750
I a turned on my green laser
and I pointed at the store.

51
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,600
It was one of the coolest things
I have ever, ever, ever seen.

52
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,320
Her name was Linda. She had a pen that
was a laser. When she turned it on,

53
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,650
a focused bright green beam of light
sprung from her hand to the star like a

54
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,750
long green finger.

55
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,780
She literally touched the star and for
a moment I forgot the ground underneath

56
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:56,800
my feet. And at that star Iberia
was 50 million light years away.

57
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,120
It seemed right.

58
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,363
[inaudible]

59
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,500
so tell me what you mean. What do you
see when you look up besides you know,

60
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:11,870
nebulous and and stars and star clusters?

61
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,160
Well what do you sort of look for exactly?

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,720
Well can really see sorta like where you
are in the universe or at least in our

63
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,554
own galaxy.

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,900
And it makes like a very interesting
perspective for yourself.

65
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,351
You know,

66
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:30,150
and like what life is like here and what
life must be like in other worlds and

67
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:33,330
whether or not there's other planets
out there with people or different life

68
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:34,710
forms that we came to comprehend.

69
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,070
This is radio lab on Janet
from Roger Today on a program.

70
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,720
We're going to project our minds out
there to the great beyond and asked some

71
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,790
basic questions here to help.

72
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,820
As always a hi is Robert Krulwich
and in this hour we discover how big,

73
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,480
oh sorry we and in this hour
we find ourselves in space.

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,340
We discover how immense, how huge
space is and then we ask ourselves,

75
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,170
now where does that leave
us? We are a Spec on a Spec,

76
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,550
on a Spec, on a speck,
and his astrophysicist,

77
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:11,130
Neil digraphs Tyson will
remind us later in the program.

78
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:15,180
It is difficult for little
specks like us to find walking,

79
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:18,390
talking intelligent spec
somewhere else in the universe,

80
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,940
but say what you will be, are
trying, speaking of which,

81
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,380
let's begin by rewinding the
clock back to 1977. Okay.

82
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,590
This is the big year for the space
program because in August of that year,

83
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:33,420
NASA launched a spacecraft carrying
a gold record. You remember this,

84
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:37,780
right? I remember the record carried a
message from us to them. Our story now,

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,790
it was Carl Sagan,

86
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,890
cosmos is all that is or
ever was or ever will be.

87
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,930
Who led the team that made the record.

88
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:50,931
And that team included actually was headed
by Annie Druyun and visited Annie at

89
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,560
her home in Ithaca, New York.

90
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,550
And we sat in the backyard near a
waterfall in the same spot. She says,

91
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:57,740
where Carl would sit

92
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,970
and become so absorbed in what he was
reading that he would not notice a deer

93
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,560
standing right next to him. My
name is Annie Durian. And, um,

94
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,550
it was honored to be the
creative director of the voyager.

95
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,580
It just stellar message project
which began in early 1977.

96
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,270
But now how does this come about?

97
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,580
I think about the project now and
it's so exciting to think about,

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,770
I mean it's such a romantic idea
that you know, that at the time,

99
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,450
absolutely we felt,

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,560
first of all that this was
a kind of sacred trust that
here we were half a dozen

101
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,390
very flawed human beings with the huge,

102
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:45,800
a huge holes in our knowledge
of all of these subjects.

103
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,490
Building a cultural Noah's Ark.

104
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,330
It was the chance to tell something of
what life on earth was like two beings of

105
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,560
perhaps a thousand million
years from now because the,

106
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,810
the voyager engineers were saying this
record will have a shelf life of a

107
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,070
billion years. That didn't race goosebumps
then you'd have to be made of wood.

108
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,860
Uh, it was also the, the, the,

109
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,390
the season that Carl Sagan and I fell so
madly in love with each other and here

110
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:22,391
we were taking on this mythic challenge
and knowing that before it was done,

111
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,150
two spacecraft would lift off from the
planet earth moving at an average speed

112
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:35,630
of 35,000 miles an hour for the
next thousand million years.

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,800
And on it we'd be a kiss,

114
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,170
a mother's first words to her
newborn baby. Come on now,

115
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,153
Mozart

116
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,240
[inaudible]

117
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,073
NATO.

118
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,640
Greetings in the 59 most
populous human languages.

119
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,480
Hello for your children or planet earth

120
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,020
as well as one non U in language,
the readings of the humpback whales

121
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,400
and it was a sacred undertaking because
it was saying we want to be citizens of

122
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,680
the cosmos. We want
you to know about that.

123
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:30,720
[inaudible]

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,850
tell me about the moment you
fell in love with Carl Sagan.

125
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,290
You said it was during the
voyager compilation? Yes, it was.

126
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,750
It was on June 1st,

127
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,470
1977 I had been looking for some time
for that piece of Chinese music that we

128
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:47,640
could put on the voyager record and not
feel like idiots for having done so.

129
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,200
And um, I was very excited
because I'd finally,

130
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,200
I found a ethnomusicologist at Columbia
University who told me without a

131
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:02,940
moment's hesitation that
this piece slowing streams,

132
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,890
which was represented to me as one of
the oldest pieces of Chinese music,

133
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,790
2,500 years old was the piece
we should put on the record.

134
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,920
So I called Carl who was traveling,

135
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,540
he was in Tucson,

136
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:23,541
Arizona giving a talk and we had been
alone many times during the making of the

137
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,930
record and his friends for three years.

138
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,850
And neither of us had ever
said anything to the other.

139
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,440
We were both involved people.

140
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,370
We'd had these wonderful
story in conversations,

141
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,260
but we hit both,

142
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:45,261
been completely just professional about
everything in his friends and he wasn't

143
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,130
there. Left a message.

144
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Our later phone rings pick up the
phone and I hear this wonderful voice.

145
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,170
Then he said,

146
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,170
I get back to my hotel room and I
find this message and it says any cod.

147
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,770
And I say to myself, why didn't you
leave me this message 10 years ago?

148
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,750
And my heart completely skipped a beat.

149
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,750
I can still remember it so perfectly.

150
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,540
And I said, for keeps. And he
said, you mean get married?

151
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,370
And I said, yes. And we had never
kissed. We had never, you know,

152
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,640
even had any other kind of
personal discussion before.

153
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,980
We both hung up the phone
and I just screamed out loud.

154
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,400
I remember it so well because
it was this great Eureka moment.

155
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,710
It was just like a scientific discovery.

156
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,580
And then the phone rang and I was
thinking, oh gosh, you know, like,

157
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,760
and a phone rang and it
was Carl. And he said,

158
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:48,000
I just want to make sure that really
happened. We're getting married, right?

159
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,790
And I said, yeah, we're
getting married. He said, okay,

160
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,860
just wanted to make sure. And um,

161
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,020
spacecraft lifted off on
August 20th and August 22nd,

162
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,910
we told everyone involved.

163
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,990
And we were together from that moment
until his death in 1996 and December.

164
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,640
Wow.

165
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,990
Talking about romantic Michael Magic
and part of my feeling about voyager

166
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:13,591
obviously,

167
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:18,591
and part of what I was feeling in
the recording of my brainwaves,

168
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,200
my heart, my eyes, everything in
that meditation on the record,

169
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,860
I had asked Carl whether or not would it
be possible to compress the impulses in

170
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,480
one's brain and nervous system into sound
and then put that sound on the record

171
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:46,710
and then think that perhaps
the extraterrestrials of
the future would be able to

172
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:50,520
reconstitute that data into thought.

173
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,510
And he looked at me and beautiful
May Day in New York City and said,

174
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:00,730
well, you know, that was a million
years is a long time. You know,

175
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,460
why don't you go do it?
Because who knows, you know,

176
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:06,880
who knows what's possible in a
thousand million years. And so, um,

177
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,060
my brainwaves and rem,

178
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,240
every little sound that my body was making
was recorded at Bellevue Hospital in

179
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,414
New York.

180
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,790
This was two days after Carla and
I declared our love for each other.

181
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:29,611
And so what I often think is that
maybe a hundred million years from now,

182
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,630
he goes, somebody flies that record down,

183
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,680
and I always wonder it because part of
what I was thinking in this meditation

184
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,530
was about the wonder of love and of being
in love and to know it's on those two

185
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:46,000
spacecraft. Even now in my,
whenever I'm down, you know,

186
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,620
I'm thinking it's still, they
move 35,000 miles an hour,

187
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,770
leaving our solar system for the Great
Wide Open Sea of interstellar space.

188
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:07,920
[inaudible] [inaudible]

189
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,060
billions of years from now,

190
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:13,110
the Sun will have reduced this
planet to a charred ashy ball.

191
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,240
But that record with Andrew,

192
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:20,160
Ian's brainwaves and heartbeat on it will
still be out there somewhere intact in

193
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,750
some remote region of the Milky Way,

194
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:26,751
preserving a murmur of an
ancient civilization that
once flourished on a distant

195
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:31,860
planet. Two hearts on a wing. Very
nice. It's lovely, right? Yeah,

196
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,490
it is.

197
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,490
Although there are six plus
billion earthlings right
now and what the best thing

198
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,880
I think about earth is that
bridge so various, right.

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,420
So you can get six plus billion versions
of being an earthlink. Yeah. Like,

200
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:47,190
if you were any join in Carl Sagan,

201
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:50,760
what would your recipe of us be?

202
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,650
So we asked a bunch of people
who, a comedian Margaret Show,

203
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,090
uh, you know, her, um, Neil
Gaiman, this graphic novelist,

204
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,470
Michael Cunningham and author, very famous
chef Alice Waters. They all sort of,

205
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,740
you know, told us what they
would send. I'll play you one,

206
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,680
not gonna play all because one, I don't
want to hear it. It would take too long.

207
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,000
You can hear all of them on our website,
actually radiolab.org. But here is, um,

208
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,800
one guy, we asked,

209
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,340
well, this week, you make tiny
little man really surrounded by

210
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,860
thousands upon thousands of people
leading this March. And, uh,

211
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,070
it was so moving.

212
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,020
I think what you'd have to do
is get that piece of footage.

213
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,910
It articulates in this very
simple act, how society's changed,

214
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,980
how people that appear to be powerless
and insignificant can bring about huge

215
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:55,430
changes.
