00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.130
MAX PAPPAS: Good afternoon.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.260
Thank you for taking time out
of your busy days inventing

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.379
amazing, world-changing
stuff here are Google.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm Max Pappas.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.560
I'm in town from the
Washington, D.C. office

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.540
where I'm on the
public policy team.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.500
There, I manage Google's work
with think tanks and policy

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.200
organizations like the
American Enterprise Institute,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.130
AEI for short, which
is one of the oldest

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.830
and most influential
and well-respected

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.710
think tanks in the country.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.550
So today I'm thrilled to bring
to Google AEI's president, Dr.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.170
Arthur C. Brooks.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.860
Arthur Brooks has been
president of AEI since 2009,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.840
where he's also the
Beth and Ravenel Curry

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.340
scholar and free enterprise.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.950
Before joining AEI,
Dr. Brooks, who

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.040
has a PhD and an
MPhil from RAND,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.300
was a professor at Syracuse,
where he taught economics

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.060
and social entrepreneurship.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.760
It's also worth noting
that before pursuing

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.040
his work in public
policy, Arthur

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.140
spent 12 years as a
classical musician

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.660
in the United States and Spain.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.420
Dr. Brooks is also a
regular contributor

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.730
to "The New York Times,"
best-selling author

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.597
of 11 books.

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:23.930
And his books include topics
from the role of government

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.380
to economic opportunity,
happiness, and the morality

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.670
of free enterprise.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.340
And his latest book is "The
New York Times" bestseller,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.120
"The Conservative Heart: How
to Build a Fair, Happier,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.640
and More Prosperous America."

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.940
He's also published dozens
of academic journal articles.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.150
And he wrote the textbook,
"Social Entrepreneurship."

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.246
Today he's going to speak about
how to lead a startup life.

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:49.700
With that, please join me
in giving a warm welcome

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.290
to Dr. Arthur C. Brooks.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.540
ARTHUR BROOKS: Thank you, Max.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.238
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.200
Thanks a lot.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.700
Thanks.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.417
I appreciate it.

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:56.750
It's great to be here at Google.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.051
I'm always-- I've
been looking forward

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.050
to this for a long time.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.590
Good to see you.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.620
And good to see folks who
are on a live stream--

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.910
I actually can't see
you, but you can see me.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.980
And I know that there
are a couple hundred

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.270
folks that are watching us.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.970
Also later on YouTube,
I'm looking forward

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.520
to having some interaction
with these people where

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.750
people are watching us later.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.690
We have a big
commitment to the work

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.240
that we do in our
YouTube channel at AEI.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.630
We have a pretty large-- for
think tank-- a pretty large

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.010
following in our
YouTube channel.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.790
So if you like what
you're seeing here

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.373
and what we talk
about here, please go

00:02:28.373 --> 00:02:31.167
subscribe to our
YouTube channel at AEI.

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.500
As you heard from Max, I'm
the president of the American

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.055
Enterprise Institute.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:35.780
That's a think tank
in Washington, D.C.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.430
It's been around since 1938.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.240
We do work on public policy.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.640
But what we really try to do
in all our work, all 250 of us

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.790
in Washington, is to think
about old problems in new ways.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.420
I mean, as you know
since you're at Google,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.090
you know that when you're
trying to solve an engineering

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.000
problem, trying to make
a big breakthrough,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.120
the way to not solve a problem
that you've had for a long time

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.660
is to simply think harder
in the old ways about it.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.880
You have to find a new
way to think about it.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.830
That's why you go out
and walk around sometimes

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.080
and you come back and
you find oh, I can

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.610
think about that in a new way.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.040
Now, we don't have
engineering problems

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.840
per se in public policy.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.530
But we have old problems
that need new solutions.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.910
We have problems in policy.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.470
We have problems in politics.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.860
And everybody seems to think
that we don't have solutions

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.390
to these problems.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.250
I want to talk to you
in just the next half

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.330
hour about how to think
in a new way about policy

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.111
and how to think in a
new way about politics.

00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:38.360
Now what am I not going to do?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.200
I'm not going to tell you how
you should feel politically.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.386
Everybody has their own
opinions on politics,

00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:45.760
so I'm not going to tell you
what I think about politics.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.690
I'm not going to
tell you what you

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.140
should think about politics.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.270
I'm going to talk about thinking
differently about old problems.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.640
Now when we talk about
thinking differently,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.570
I want you to think
of a time in your life

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.670
where you had an experience
of suddenly having

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.919
an epiphany of thinking
in a different way

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.960
about an old problem, even
in your personal life,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.870
and how it changed things.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.180
I was trying to think about
a good example of that.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.269
And I did think of one.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.860
And I'll give you an example
just from my ordinary life,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.250
not from my work life at all,
of an inflection in my thinking.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.230
It was recently, relatively
recently, a year or so ago.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.520
One of my kids--

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.240
I have three teenage kids,
not to tell you my problems.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.400
And one of them--

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.379
I was having a parent-teacher
conference for one

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.170
of my teenage kids.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.300
And it wasn't going
very well, which

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.170
is pretty normal for teenagers.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.340
If you don't have kids,
you probably will.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.200
And it was a grades problem.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.390
And so my wife and I, we left.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.585
And we were in the car
and we weren't talking.

00:04:56.585 --> 00:05:00.090
And it was uncomfortable
and we were kind of unhappy.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.722
And my wife said, we're
thinking about this problem

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:06.430
in the wrong way.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.220
We need to think
about this problem

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.600
in a totally different way.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.162
And I was like, I'm all ears.

00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:12.370
How should we think about it?

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.200
She said at least we
know he's not cheating.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.830
So OK, why do I bring that up?

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.330
That is a different
way of thinking.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.540
And in that spirit,
I want to find out

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.980
how the problems that we're
having in policy toward poverty

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.760
in America can be seen as
an opportunity for renewal

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.620
for our country.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.030
And then I want
to talk about how

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.840
politics, which is really bitter
and polarized and divided,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.620
is an opportunity for us
actually to come together.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.440
So this is subversive and
pretty radical thinking.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.695
It's not how to make
problems go away.

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:49.070
It's how to think
in a new way so

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.861
that the problems that
we have are actually

00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.520
opportunities for the country.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.050
That's my job.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.320
So let's start with what's
actually tearing the country

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.260
apart with respect to policy.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.820
It's the haves and have nots.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.950
It's the polarization
with respect

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.960
to income and opportunity.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.410
It's the fact that income
and inequality, we believe,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.380
is higher than it's
been in generations.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.510
How do we solve
that in a way that

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.512
helps us have greater
solidarity as a country?

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:21.080
I was thinking about
this and trying

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.300
to actually figure
out a way to describe

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.420
or to come up with a
new kind of thinking.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.010
And I was listening to
a friend of mine who was

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.570
giving a lecture about poverty.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.021
A friend of mine-- he's the
assistant Archbishop in Los

00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:40.520
Angeles--

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.560
Catholic Archbishop
in Los Angeles.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.980
And he was actually
quoting his great mentor

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.670
from the Archdiocese of
Chicago, a great cardinal,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.760
a great Catholic cardinal
named Francis George.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.440
And this visionary cardinal was
talking to his richest donors

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.230
about poverty and
basically telling them

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.290
why they should give
their money to support

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.030
poor people in Chicago.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.570
And here's what he said.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.610
He said the poor need you
to pull them out of poverty.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.230
And you need the poor
to keep you out of hell.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.772
It's like, gutsy move, right,
with your riches donors.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:22.230
I'm not going to use that to
fundraise for my organization,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.810
by the way.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.202
But why is that an epiphany?

00:07:25.202 --> 00:07:27.660
Why does that actually lead to
a breakthrough, breakthrough

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.170
thinking?

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.753
Because I was thinking
about it later.

00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:34.320
And I thought, do we need
poor people in our society?

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.405
I mean, I understand we
want to help poor people

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:38.310
and understand that
we want to have

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.445
some sort of a sense of
charity toward poor people.

00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:43.170
I got it morally.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.380
But do we actually need them?

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.260
And the answer to
that question--

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.080
here's how I want you to
think about it for yourself.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.320
Here's the thought experiment
that answers that question.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.500
There are a lot of poor
people right in our midst

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.020
in Mountain View, California
right now, not very far away

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.570
from us.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.220
I mean, further away
certainly than 20 years ago,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.650
because of the way that the
real estate market has worked.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.200
But if you go even as
far away as San Jose,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.120
lots of people who are really
at the margins of society

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.540
and they're poor.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.210
If all of the poor people
within 50 miles of where

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.910
we are right now--
really poor, the bottom

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.850
of the socioeconomic spectrum--
if they suddenly disappeared

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.550
just like that, would you know?

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.520
How long would it
take you to know that?

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.080
Would you-- if you're
downtown, would you say,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.890
oh wow, fewer homeless people.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.740
Or if you're looking
like a policy wonk

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.230
like I am at the data,
would you say well,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.690
policing and welfare services
have just gotten cheaper.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.620
I don't know, maybe.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.314
But would you know
it for your life?

00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:43.980
Would you know it
with your friendships?

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.270
Would you know it
in your social life?

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.160
I bet you wouldn't,
not for a long time.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.090
Why is that a problem?

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.600
Because it's weird historically.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.560
It's an unusual thing in
America that we actually

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.580
wouldn't miss poor people.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.080
Why?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.590
Because poor people are
who we are as a country.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.890
This is a country that was
literally built by poor people.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.710
This is a country
that was built largely

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.950
by immigrants who were poor.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.810
It's an amazing thing.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.470
I don't have to remind you
that the quintessential, sort

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.460
of the iconic image of
immigration in this country

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.980
is Ellis Island and the
Statue of Liberty, right?

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.850
Well, the Statue of Liberty
has a poem at its base by--

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.205
it's a pretty bad poem actually.

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.830
You had to memorize it when you
were in high school if you went

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.440
to high school in the states,
which if you're an immigrant

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.450
you didn't--

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.500
by Emma Lazarus.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.819
But there's one line in it.

00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:44.860
This is the Statue of
Liberty and the first thing

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.810
that immigrants
would see starting

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.360
in the late 19th century.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.150
The poem says "give
me your poor."

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.970
It didn't say give
me your rich people.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.330
Don't give me your high-skilled
engineering immigrants,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.770
although that's good.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.520
Give me your poor.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:00.910
Why?

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.326
Because this is a
country that had

00:10:02.326 --> 00:10:07.300
to be built by the refuse
of other countries,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.565
of the outsiders
from other countries.

00:10:09.565 --> 00:10:12.190
We were supposed to be a magnet
for people from other countries

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.110
who were basically
ambitious riffraff.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.190
Here's the amazing thing.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.870
If you're born in
the United States,

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.300
you descend from
ambitious riffraff.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.440
And you're proud of it it's the
only country in the world where

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.330
we're proud of the fact
that our ancestors were poor

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.330
and we tell the stories.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.871
Like, oh yeah, my
great grandfather--

00:10:31.871 --> 00:10:33.090
he came and got nothing.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:33.715
He had nothing.

00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:36.180
I mean, he was like living
on the bus or something.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.310
And then my grandfather--
he went to high school.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.160
And my dad, he went to
college for the fir--

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.350
this is the story of every
American family, right?

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:49.110
But it starts off not with my
great grandfather was a Duke.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.114
That's a European story, man.

00:10:52.114 --> 00:10:53.530
We're actually
kind of embarrassed

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.660
if your great grandfather
was really, really rich

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.530
and you're not.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.220
Something happened
along the way, right?

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.680
So OK, what does this mean?

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.330
This is in the DNA
of this country.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.820
And yet we've divorced
ourselves from any relationship

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.670
with poor people, even
though almost literally,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.800
at least in the
intergenerational sense,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.370
they are us.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.490
So what happened?

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.650
We can't fix that unless we--

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.970
and we can't figure
out how to make

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.020
poor people necessary
in our lives

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.900
unless we figure
out what went wrong,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.160
or at least what happened.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.220
So sometime between when
my parents were kids

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:40.010
and all of their friends were
poor and when my kids are kids,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.120
we've become a society that's
divided on socioeconomic lines.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.070
And we don't know
each other anymore.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.609
When did that happen?

00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:50.150
I think I actually know the date
when that started to happen,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.900
believe it or not.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.020
I mean, this is sort of
artificial and bear with me.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.140
I think it was April, believe
it or not, April 24, 1964.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.390
That's really, really precise.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.860
What happened on that day?

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.110
The answer was the
United States--

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.670
the President of
the United States

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.260
declared the war on poverty,
which is a great thing.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.100
That day was actually a photo op
when President Lyndon Johnson--

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.140
he went to this little
town in Kentucky

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.050
in Martin County,
Kentucky, a place

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.936
called Inez, which is
really super hard up.

00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:22.310
It was the heart
of coal country,

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.810
but the mines had closed.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.880
And there had been mills
and they had closed.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.920
And people were out of work.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.200
And it was poor.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.150
So he went there with
a bunch of reporters.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.250
He was a master, by the
way, of the photo op.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.510
We think that President
Obama and President Trump are

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.676
really great with the press.

00:12:37.676 --> 00:12:38.210
Huh-uh.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.980
Lyndon Johnson.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.987
He was the master.

00:12:39.987 --> 00:12:41.570
And so he went with
a bunch of writers

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.130
from Time Magazine
and photographers

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.720
from Life magazine--

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.010
rest in peace.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.230
And they went to this
little town in Kentucky.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.240
And they went up--
here's the beauty of it

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.246
Johnson takes the reporters
to a random guy's house.

00:12:54.246 --> 00:12:55.495
It's a guy named Tom Fletcher.

00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:57.030
He's sitting on his porch--

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.520
tar paper shack with like a
bunch of kids up on the porch.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.110
And he walks up and
says, tell me your story.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.130
His name's Tom Fletcher.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.100
So Tom Fletcher--
it's a terrible tale.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.600
He's a 38-year-old
father of eight

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.070
who has a first grade education.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.480
He hasn't worked in years.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.130
And his kids are malnourished.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.910
And he has no hope
of finding a job.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.150
OK, that's what Johnson
was looking for,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.720
because he comes down off the
porch and he's walking away.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.053
And he says to the reporters--
this is the beauty of it.

00:13:26.053 --> 00:13:26.810
He's so great.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.410
He said, today I declare
a war on poverty.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.984
And our goal is total victory.

00:13:32.984 --> 00:13:35.150
And you would have cheered,
because he was basically

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.108
saying look, third-world
poverty is right here.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:37.940
It's in America.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.930
Just look.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.610
But there's a solution.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.070
We're declaring war
and we're going to win.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.380
He gets back to
Washington, D.C. And he

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.480
puts a general in charge
of the war on poverty,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.090
a great American patriot
named Sargent Shriver, who

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.910
also created the Peace Corps.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.930
And when he was asked
what the goal was,

00:13:53.930 --> 00:14:00.260
Sargent Shriver said our
goal is dignity, not doles.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.760
I don't care what
your politics are.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.070
You're totally down
with that, I know it.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.380
Not making people
dependent, making people

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.430
have a sense of
their own dignity.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.980
That's really what
we're all about.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.350
Isn't that what we want?

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.250
OK.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.367
So the question is
how did it turn out.

00:14:15.367 --> 00:14:17.450
That word dignity I want
you to have in your head,

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:22.500
because what is the essence
of a life of dignity?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.110
It's not being helped.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.250
It's not being a charity case.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.860
It's earning your own success.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.850
It's having meaning and purpose.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.640
It's to be needed.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.940
Like I said, I've got a
house full of teenage kids.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.670
They don't always like me.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.870
But they need me.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.900
And that's a source
of dignity for me.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.280
That's a source of meaning
and purpose in my life.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.280
And the reason that after
I leave California I'm

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.860
going back to
Maryland where I live.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.440
And I'm looking forward
to that, because I

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.974
want to go where I'm needed.

00:14:53.974 --> 00:14:55.140
It's really important to me.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:55.990
It's important to you, too.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.156
It's important to all of us.

00:14:57.156 --> 00:14:59.730
Now what happens in
society when something

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.230
has gotten so
blinkered in the way

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.850
that we take care
of poverty that we

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:07.000
tell generations of people that
they're not necessary anymore?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.230
We're going to help you.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.350
But we don't need you.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.500
That's actually what's
happening today.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.150
The data are overwhelming.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.200
When I was a kid, about
7% of men-- able-bodied,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.082
working age men--

00:15:20.082 --> 00:15:21.165
were out of the workforce.

00:15:21.165 --> 00:15:23.380
And I grew up in Seattle in
a working class neighborhood

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:23.970
in Seattle.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.190
And we would see kind of
guys, certain guys who

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.140
would not work.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.370
And it would be a pity.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.230
And you'd say that's not right.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.660
So what is it today?

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.170
It's closer to 18%
of working age,

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.730
able-bodied men aren't
in the workforce.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.310
That's what happens
when we do help,

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.160
but we don't think
seriously about how to make

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.960
people needed in our society.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.440
That's what we need to
do in public policy.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.570
The solution is not how
to help people more.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.000
It's how to need people
more in public policy.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.210
If you want to know what
the dysfunction comes

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.495
from when we don't need people,
look at the data on this.

00:16:00.495 --> 00:16:01.760
This is really incredible.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.511
There's a paper--
an academic paper

00:16:03.511 --> 00:16:05.760
in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.800
last year, published by two
economists at Princeton.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.430
It's a paper about demography.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.200
And most of it is good news.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.140
Every group, every age group,
every demographic group

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.020
in society has been getting
richer for 100 years,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.690
has been dying later, and
had better public health

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.950
for 100 years.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.880
Here's the bad news.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.700
One group has turned
against that trend.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.670
From 1999 until
today, one group has

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.690
been dying younger with
greater health pathologies

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:35.250
than they were before.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.040
That group are white men 45 to
54 without a college education.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.360
They are dying younger and
younger for three reasons.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.490
Number one is a 46% increase
in cirrhosis of the liver,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:53.100
a 78% increase in suicide, and
a 323% increase in drug overdose

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.850
deaths.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.810
These are guys my age, but
without a college education.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.350
That's an epidemic.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:06.030
It's a problem of despair,
which is the inverse of dignity.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.450
And the lack of dignity
comes from whole generations

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.740
of people who are not needed.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.020
OK, so what's the
solution to all this?

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.730
To think differently.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.807
If you want to solve
the problems of poverty

00:17:19.807 --> 00:17:21.390
and you want to solve
them permanently

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.130
and you want to
solve them in a way

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.160
that you would
deserve to be treated,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.760
don't think about better
ways to help poor people.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.190
Think about better ways
to need poor people.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.340
I'm at Google right now.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.080
You solve problems.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.890
You solve hard problems.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:45.080
If you're a social activist,
if you want permanent solutions

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.440
to greater justice, think
about how that one gets solved.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.990
Don't think about
just how we can

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:55.010
make people with high
educations and high spending

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.350
capability more
productive-- the top 10%

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.030
of the income distribution.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.420
I'm already productive.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.306
And so are you.

00:18:01.306 --> 00:18:02.930
I don't need to be
any more productive.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.390
I'm maxed out, man.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.150
Think about how we can
bring greater productivity

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.660
to the bottom third of the
population socioeconomically.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.434
What are we doing for
them to bring them

00:18:14.434 --> 00:18:15.350
into full citizenship?

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.600
Because when we make
people more productive,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.820
they are needed more.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.730
Stop thinking about poor
people as charity cases.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.270
Start thinking of poor people
as potentially productive

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.100
human assets, the
same way that we

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.380
talk about rich people's kids.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.590
How do we do that?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.110
I don't know.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.060
But that's what I'm
thinking about these days.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.922
And the way to think differently
is to move from help to need.

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:46.300
Now, before I move
on, it's easy--

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.340
I'm talking a little
too much about them.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.010
But let's think about you,
too, about how much it's

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.600
important for you to be needed.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.090
And let's put a real
face on it, about what

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.810
happens to people's lives
when they're needed.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.879
I do a lot of work
as president of AEI.

00:19:03.879 --> 00:19:05.670
When we're doing work
in a particular area,

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.950
I like to talk to the
people that we're affecting.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.540
Looking at a data set
is not sufficient.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.800
So fairly recently I was
at a homeless shelter

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.690
in New York City that
has amazing outcomes,

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.690
because all of their
incomes are based on work.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.606
They take these guys.

00:19:19.606 --> 00:19:21.980
And they've been in prison
and they've been drug addicted

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.300
and they're homeless and they've
abandoned their families.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.536
And it's just like the worst
situation, the situation

00:19:26.536 --> 00:19:27.660
that you can't really help.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.839
And they put them to work
sweeping the streets.

00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:31.380
And then they have
minimum wage jobs.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.820
And they learn skills.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.230
And there are amazing outcomes.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.130
So people don't go back
to prison very often.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.950
And they don't go back and
live on the streets very often.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.033
So I want to know what
their success is all about.

00:19:40.033 --> 00:19:42.660
I'm meeting these guys.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.580
And I meet this guy who--

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.610
he went to prison when he was
18 for murder, of all things.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.770
And it was a weird thing.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.391
He had smoked a lot of dope
when he was in junior high

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:53.640
and then went to harder drugs.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.140
And he was running
with a bad crowd.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.400
And one thing led to another.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.590
And there was a robbery
and somebody got killed.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.050
And he went to prison.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:01.950
He gets out.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.810
By the grace of
God, 22 years later

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.400
he's on parole when he's 40.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.180
And he's basically
starting his life at 40.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.740
And I meet him.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.450
I see him nine
months after he's out

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.339
of prison and off the streets.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:15.630
And he's working in this thing.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.254
He sweeps the streets
for three months.

00:20:17.254 --> 00:20:20.140
And then he gets a job at
an exterminator agency--

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.420
what fancy people call a
dead-end job, but is not.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.940
It's a job, just
like all of our jobs.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.740
And I ask him how
his life is going.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.910
And he says I'll show you.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.950
And he takes out his iPhone,
which is pretty cool.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.270
But that's not the
secret to happiness.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.700
But what he's showing me is
he's got an email from his boss.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.450
And here's what it says.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:45.300
It says emergency bed bug
job, East 65th Street.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.980
I need you now.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.190
I said so what?

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.950
He said look at it again.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.840
He just said I need you.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.030
That is the first time
in my life anybody

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.580
has said those words to me.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.960
That, my friends, is
the source of meaning.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.105
You want to make people--

00:21:00.105 --> 00:21:01.980
you want to bring them
into full citizenship,

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.438
you want to give
them happier lives

00:21:03.438 --> 00:21:08.410
you, want to permanently solve
the moral problems of poverty,

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.240
make people needed.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.720
That's principle number one.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.485
Now let's think about-- from
policies, let's go to politics.

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:22.080
So let's get a
little rougher here.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.310
Max and I live in Washington.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.440
Think of it that Max
lives in Washington so you

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.510
don't have to here at Google.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.880
And you should be very
thankful to Max for doing that.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.490
It's fine.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.460
But it's probably not where most
of you would choose to live,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.770
particularly if you're not
obsessed with politics.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.859
It's very tough.

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:42.400
And it's particularly
tough right now

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.870
because of the polarization.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.589
You can't go any
place or do anything

00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:47.630
where you're not having
a political conversation.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.480
And frankly, it's exhausting.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.520
And in many cases,
it's unpleasant.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.270
And you're watching
yourself all the time.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.769
Why?

00:21:53.769 --> 00:21:55.330
Because we're in
a period of almost

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.060
unprecedented polarization.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.190
The left is the left and
the right is the right.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.250
And they don't overlap.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.250
And we feel like we've
got nothing in common.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.030
Don't believe it?

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:08.250
Go on social media,
which I know you all do.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.150
You find that it's almost as
if we inhabit different planets

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.550
or we have different
DNA or something,

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.070
because there's so much
separation between these two

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.940
groups of people.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.450
What's the solution
that could actually

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.360
bring us back together,
bring us really

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.520
back together as Americans?

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.780
That's what I want to
talk about right now.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.230
Now, if you're
watching the debates

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.217
that we had in the last
presidential campaign,

00:22:33.217 --> 00:22:34.800
you watched Hillary
Clinton and Donald

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.290
Trump talking to each
other, you know that it's

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.400
unbelievably unpleasant.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.830
I was talking to my
14-year-old daughter.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.420
I remember having this
conversation where I said,

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.780
don't forget the things
that those people are

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.950
saying to each other--

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.690
that's not consistent
with our values.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.010
So I actually had
to apologize as

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.560
if I were sitting with
her watching "Breaking

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.520
Bad" or something.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.410
It's a presidential
debate, for Pete's sake.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.910
We should be proud of this,
of the working of democracy.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.120
Instead I'm apologizing
for the fact

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.320
that neither one of these
people is saying something

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.616
that reflects my values.

00:23:06.616 --> 00:23:08.490
They're saying terrible
things to each other,

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.140
treating each other
with contempt.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.122
Now first of all, you
have to ask yourself,

00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:16.580
how did we get into
this situation?

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.240
Because it's deeply suboptimal
from a practical standpoint.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.340
You all know, because
you're normal people walking

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.180
the earth, that you will never
insult anybody into agreement.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.320
It's never happened
in human history.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.180
An impossible.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.450
Like listen you moron, I'm
going to refute all your facts.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.700
And somebody is going to go
hey, you know, he's right.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.509
I am a moron.

00:23:35.509 --> 00:23:36.800
I never thought of it that way.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.640
It's never happened.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.848
Never going to happen, right?

00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:41.494
It's very impractical to argue
the way that we're arguing,

00:23:41.494 --> 00:23:43.910
because politics are supposed
to be the art of persuasion.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.160
Nobody's persuaded.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.990
But also there's kind of
a moral problem with it.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.060
I do a lot of these talks for
very ideological audiences,

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.070
sometimes very left-wing
audiences, sometimes

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.750
very right-wing audiences.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.210
So yesterday I was
at Cal-Berkeley,

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.810
which is not known as a stalwart
right-wing audience, of course.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:10.772
But sometimes I am in these
very conservative crowds.

00:24:10.772 --> 00:24:12.230
Two years ago,
before the election,

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.320
I was doing a talk for
a Tea Party Patriots

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.660
rally in New Hampshire.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.050
I do like 175 talks a year, so
I get a lot of opportunities

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.000
to share ideas with people.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.650
But this one was really
arch conservative people--

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.010
three-cornered hats
and the whole thing.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.100
And I was making a point.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.660
And by the way, the people
were talking about tax policy.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.680
And I agree mostly.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.310
I agree.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.290
I'm a free enterprise warrior.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.822
I want more
capitalism, because I

00:24:44.822 --> 00:24:46.280
want to lift up
people who are poor

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.450
and I want to make
them needed, which

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.699
means you need the right
kind of policies, to be sure.

00:24:49.699 --> 00:24:52.610
But I'm down with this
stuff, really a lot.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.830
This is a friendly crowd.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.010
And I'm talking to them.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:56.900
And I made one point.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.810
I was talking about
political divisiveness.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.690
And I was talking about
political progressives.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.120
And here's a point that I made.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.730
I said my friends, I
want you to remember

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.980
that political
progressives are not stupid

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.520
and they're not evil.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.820
And I meant that.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.280
And this lady raises her hand.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.785
And she says actually, I
think they're stupid and evil.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.193
And you know what I
thought at that moment?

00:25:22.193 --> 00:25:23.180
AUDIENCE: Did she
actually say that?

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.013
ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah.

00:25:24.013 --> 00:25:24.670
Yeah, for sure.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.719
I mean, it's not
mixed company, right?

00:25:27.719 --> 00:25:29.010
This is people who think alike.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.054
And people are empowered
when they're in-- right?

00:25:32.054 --> 00:25:33.970
And here's what I was
thinking at this moment.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.790
This was actually a
breakthrough moment for me,

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.720
because it was funny.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.150
I mean, she was trying to
be-- it was funny, right?

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.910
But I told you I
grew up in Seattle.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.760
I grew up in a liberal
family in Seattle,

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.510
which is totally
redundant because they're

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.020
all liberal families
in Seattle, right?

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.830
And when she said that,
you know what I thought?

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.740
She's talking about my family.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.940
And I took it personally.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.360
It doesn't matter that I
actually probably agree

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.220
with a lot of her politics.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.500
I love my family.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.390
It's like they're not
super political or anything

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:07.890
like that.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.500
But they're not Tea Party
Patriots, for Pete's sake.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.630
And when somebody
says progressives

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:17.370
are stupid and evil, they're
talking about my mom and dad.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.164
And I resent that actually.

00:26:19.164 --> 00:26:20.830
Now, why was that a
breakthrough for me?

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.590
Because actually,
let me ask you.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.127
Here's why.

00:26:26.127 --> 00:26:27.710
Look, we're all from
different places.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.240
We all have different
backgrounds.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.130
We all have different
views on politics.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.440
How many of you love
somebody with whom

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.050
you disagree politically?

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.120
Like, 100%.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.620
Come on.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.800
It's 100%.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.390
We all do.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.030
If you want to know the secret
to political reconciliation,

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:47.900
if you want more solidarity,
you have a responsibility

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.840
to stand up to
people on your side

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.170
because they're
insulting your family.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:55.250
That's how you do it.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.740
That's courage.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.690
And that's the
secret of the problem

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.900
that we're trying to
solve in this country.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.970
Banding together with
people with whom you agree,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.070
effectively insulting
people with whom

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.610
you disagree but have a personal
relationship is not courageous.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.110
It's not even loyal.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.670
So how do we do that?

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:16.420
How do we do that?

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.850
How can I-- I can't
just say do that,

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.308
because I have to
be more specific.

00:27:19.308 --> 00:27:22.320
I've got to give you some
tips on how to get that done,

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.580
because you know what?

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.496
You're going to have an
opportunity to do this

00:27:25.496 --> 00:27:26.820
within the next 24 hours.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.440
And you're going
to think of this.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.690
So let's make it a little
more specific, a little more

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:31.408
practical.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:39.860
When you think about the problem
that we have today in politics,

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.335
I mentioned a word a little
bit earlier that's contempt.

00:27:43.335 --> 00:27:45.960
People often say that there's a
lot of anger in politics today.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.418
It's actually not
an anger problem.

00:27:47.418 --> 00:27:49.910
It's a contempt problem
in politics today.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.890
Contempt is defined by
social psychologists

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.950
as the conviction of the utter
worthlessness of another human

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.120
being.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.499
And that's how Hillary
Clinton and Donald

00:27:58.499 --> 00:27:59.540
Trump talk to each other.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.370
That's how their supporters
talk to each other.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.453
That's how people in the
press talk to each other.

00:28:03.453 --> 00:28:04.440
Look at Twitter.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.320
It's the contempt machine, where
people talk to each other--

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.840
anonymously, by the way, because
when people are not anonymous,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.380
they tend to behave better.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.300
Never be anonymous.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.050
If you want to have a
happy life and treat

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:21.110
other people with more
respect, always give your name.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:24.200
Your handle should have your
real name in it, in my view.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.820
Again, advice-- unsolicited
advice, I might add.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.160
So how do we see contempt
manifest all the time?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.210
It's how people treat each
other in the political sphere as

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.360
utterly worthless.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.460
Now why does that matter?

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.500
Anger-- simple anger resolves
in reconciliation, just

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.270
naturally dissipates.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.370
Contempt never resolves.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.710
When somebody treats you
with contempt, blows you up--

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:49.681
what an idiot.

00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:51.430
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard--

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.045
you never quite forget it.

00:28:54.045 --> 00:28:56.420
Remember when you were in a
class in college and somebody

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.440
treated you with contempt
and just burned you, right?

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.820
It gets worse, by the way.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.959
There's a guy at
University of Washington.

00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:05.000
His name is John Gottman.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.900
He's a social psychologist.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.560
I've never met him.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.476
But he's kind of an
intellectual hero of mine,

00:29:08.476 --> 00:29:12.350
because he's dedicated his
life to marital reconciliation.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.780
He has a laboratory where he
brings couples together that

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.460
are on the brink of divorce.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.980
And he has all of the
best scientific techniques

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.420
for getting people
to not divorce.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.590
That's a huge deal.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:25.970
There's no society in
history that's successful

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.560
that has not been
based on the idea

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.650
of successful, intact families.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:34.170
So anybody who keeps families
intact, in my view, is a hero.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.420
And that's what this guy does.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.336
I don't even know him.

00:29:36.336 --> 00:29:40.050
I'm sure he's a great guy
because of what he's doing.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.370
And so John Gottman--
he has this experiment

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.830
where he takes couples
that are quarreling, maybe

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.320
going to get divorced,
and he puts them

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.370
in front of the camera.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:53.210
And they have an argument about
what they're disagreeing about,

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.970
whether it's how you raise
the kids or about money

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.220
or whatever.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.970
And then he'll watch the tape.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.950
His assistants will film it.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.230
He'll watch the tape later.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.830
And he'll turn
the sound to zero.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.480
He's just looking at this thing.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.410
And he can predict
with 94% accuracy

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.710
which couples will be
divorced within five years

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.670
just by looking for five
seconds at the tape.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.130
So what's he looking at?

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.640
Max is married, so
he wants to know

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.015
what's he looking at, right?

00:30:21.015 --> 00:30:21.890
What's he looking at?

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:25.880
And the answer is signs
of contempt, most notably

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.435
eye rolling.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.502
Teenage kids-- I see like
eye rolling all day long.

00:30:33.502 --> 00:30:35.460
They practically fall
backwards in their seats,

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.080
they roll their
eyes so hard, right?

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.190
That's fine.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:42.420
But you know when it really bugs
you is when your coworker does

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.970
it or somebody with whom
you're having a discussion who

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:49.031
owes you respect or at
least some civility does it

00:30:49.031 --> 00:30:51.030
and worst of all when
somebody you love does it.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.780
It's like a physical
attack practically.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.920
It's bad for you.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.170
It's bad when you do it.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:00.347
But I bet you can kind of
catch yourself from now on.

00:31:00.347 --> 00:31:02.430
You're never going to be
the same after this talk,

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:03.510
let me tell you.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.760
You're going to go into your
next political discussion

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.390
and you're going to say, oh,
I'm acting with contempt, right?

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.980
And I'm hurting somebody.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.880
And I'm going to
have a permanent foe

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.090
as a result of this,
unless I fix it,

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.770
because that's the truth.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.180
Contempt is the problem.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.240
What's the solution?

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.514
OK, now to begin with,
it's not your fault.

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:24.930
If you treat people
with contempt,

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.880
it's not your fault
because that's the habit.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.850
That's what you see even from
the President of the United

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:34.170
States is contempt and all
of the social media and all

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:34.780
the press.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.240
It's all contempt all the time.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.530
You can be forgiven for behaving
like everybody else, right?

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:43.447
It still doesn't make it
OK or acceptable to others.

00:31:43.447 --> 00:31:44.780
But I understand why it happens.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.110
It's a habit.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.730
So how do you break a habit?

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.490
Any kind of habit?

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.040
For years I made my living
in [INAUDIBLE] as a musician.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.180
I was a French horn player.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.490
I played in the Barcelona
Symphony for a long time.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.440
And like everybody in
the Barcelona symphony,

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.140
I was a smoker.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.340
It's so gross, so terrible.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.480
It's such a bad habit.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.070
It made my mother sad.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.590
So I decided I had
to quit, right?

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.880
But I didn't-- I mean,
how do you quit smoking?

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.600
The answer is don't
just quit smoking.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.860
You got to do something
instead of smoking.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.000
That's the way the
brain works, by the way.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.810
There's a lot of good
neuroscience on habits.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.910
And habits can
only be broken when

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.440
you put something in
place of the bad habit,

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.850
so I took up drinking.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.590
No, kidding.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.760
So the habit of
contempt, therefore,

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.520
can only be broken if you do
something instead of contempt.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.430
So catch yourself--
you're going to be

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.700
in a conversation on
social media or in person,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.370
at the dinner table or with
a friend or with a colleague

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.572
or even with a stranger.

00:32:44.572 --> 00:32:46.280
And before you do
something contemptuous,

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.720
you're going have to do
something else instead of it.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.940
What do you do when
you feel contempt?

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.410
This was a research
project for me, by the way,

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.820
a few months ago.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.560
It's like so I got to
be practical about it.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.990
I want to break
this habit myself.

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:01.656
And I want to help
you break this habit.

00:33:01.656 --> 00:33:02.960
So what do we do instead?

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.510
What's the equivalent of when
you want a cigarette going

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.280
for a walk around the block?

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.661
What do you do?

00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:09.410
I asked everybody.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.618
I asked social psychologists.

00:33:10.618 --> 00:33:12.410
I asked brain scientists.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.090
I asked people that
I really respect.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.880
But here's the best answer
that I got from the person

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.900
that I really respect.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:24.170
One of the people I respect most
on the Earth is the Dalai Lama.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.650
It's a weird truth that I have
a relationship with the Dalai

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.370
Lama, because he does stuff
with my organization, with AEI.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.540
He's come to AEI
a bunch of times.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.830
I interview him.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.840
We made a documentary
film together.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.450
We've written for "The
New York Times" together.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:42.100
It's the weirdest, most kind of
counter-intuitive thing ever.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.640
But I just love him
because he's helpful

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.700
and he's a good
teacher and he's kind.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.580
And so I'm always just all ears.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.820
Well, a few months
ago, we were in India

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.190
in Dharamshala, which is
in the Himalayan foothills

00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:59.540
where he has his monastery.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.880
And we were making a film
and doing some conferences

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.750
together.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.150
And I was thinking about this
problem, contempt, contempt.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.700
What do I do when
I feel content?

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.429
So I asked him.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:11.030
I said, Your Holiness, when
I feel contempt, what should

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.330
I do?

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:17.860
And he said practice
warmheartedness.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.500
And I said you
got anything else?

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:25.300
Because, you know, that
sounds sort of soft.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.489
But then I thought about it.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:29.290
I thought about the
man I was talking to.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:30.130
And for those of
you who don't know,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.713
the Dalai Lama is the spiritual
leader of the Tibetan Buddhist

00:34:32.713 --> 00:34:34.760
people.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.280
He has been the
Dalai Lama, or he

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.920
has been identified as the
Dalai Lama since he was a kid.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.530
And he's been the leader of
the Tibetan Buddhist people

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.030
for many years, for decades.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.000
Well, something happened
to him fundamentally.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
He was exiled from Tibet
when he was 17 years

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.130
old by the Chinese government.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.870
And he took his people into--

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:58.870
or the leaders of the Tibetan
people-- into exile in India.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.840
Now, he's poor.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.080
The Tibetans are poor.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:07.170
It's 6 million people
in this vast territory.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:07.850
So what happens?

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:09.800
Gone, forgotten.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.390
It's done.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:14.210
But no, because the Dalai Lama
has used, over the last seven

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.410
decades, his position as
the world's most respected

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.280
religious leader to treat the
contempt of the people who

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.560
exiled him with warmheartedness.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.535
And in so doing, he's actually
created a world-wide following.

00:35:28.535 --> 00:35:29.660
What does he say basically?

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.618
He has this old saying.

00:35:30.618 --> 00:35:34.430
The Dalai Lama says
that I defeat my enemies

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.870
when I make them my
friends, because they're no

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.830
longer my enemies, of course.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.370
He told me he actually
starts every day praying

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.380
for the Chinese leaders,
not that they'll

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.004
give him his homeland
back, but they'll

00:35:47.004 --> 00:35:48.339
live happy and good lives.

00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:49.880
That, my friends,
is warmheartedness.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.310
I don't know if I'm
strong enough for that.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.790
But when I thought that-- here's
the point I'm trying to make--

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.730
it sounds like warmheartedness
is sort of weak, right?

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.550
It's actually for
tough, strong people.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.370
Contempt is for people
with no discipline.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:07.850
Contempt is for people who
have bad habits, people

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.360
who have mental tics, people
who can't control themselves.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.160
That's what contempt is for.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.620
Warmheartedness is for
disciplined people.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.440
It's for people who
can control themselves.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.730
Contempt is for sissies.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.360
Warmheartedness is
for strong people.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.140
So question, how strong are you?

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.674
Next time you have
this opportunity,

00:36:28.674 --> 00:36:29.840
how are you going to use it?

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.756
OK, let me be more
specific, because I'm still

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:34.450
not being helpful enough.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.890
How can you turn contempt
to warmheartedness

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.770
in your own life?

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.460
I asked that question, too.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.769
Give me some tips,
Your Holiness.

00:36:42.769 --> 00:36:43.810
I need some lessons here.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.226
He said-- it was
very interesting.

00:36:45.226 --> 00:36:48.194
He said think of a time when
you have done this by accident,

00:36:48.194 --> 00:36:49.860
when you've turned a
conversation around

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.360
and you made an
enemy your friend.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.370
Remember that.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.030
Remember that feeling.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.910
Remember that occasion.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.910
And that will be your teacher.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.440
So I went back to my little
room where I was sleeping.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.570
And I thought about it.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.970
And I did have an
experience where I did this.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.475
And I want to tell you about
it, because it actually-- now

00:37:11.475 --> 00:37:12.600
I remember it all the time.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.641
And it's changed my life.

00:37:13.641 --> 00:37:14.730
I mean, I just--

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.100
I don't write angry
tweets, because here's

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.030
what I think about.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.120
And again, you know
my position where

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.036
people are pretty
contemptuous, because we're

00:37:23.036 --> 00:37:25.410
in the middle of public policy
and we're Washington, D.C.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.980
And sometimes there's
controversy and all that.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.070
What do I think about?

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:36.090
I think about an experience
that I had 11 years ago.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.750
So before I came to AEI--

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.880
I've been president for
almost 10 years of AEI.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.060
Before that, for a decade
I was a college professor.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.494
I taught most of that time
at Syracuse University

00:37:46.494 --> 00:37:48.410
at the Maxwell School
of Public Affairs, which

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.480
is a wonderful public
affairs school.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.100
And I had a good thing going.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.720
I had a happy life.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.260
I was working in
professorial obscurity,

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.170
writing my books and
articles and teaching

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.200
my graduate students.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.250
And life was sweet,
I'm telling you.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.410
And then a weird
thing happened to me.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.920
I wrote a book right after
I became a full professor,

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.180
so I had tenure.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.615
And I was completely protected
from ever being fired.

00:38:13.615 --> 00:38:14.990
I could have killed
a guy and not

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.760
gotten fired, because I
would have had tenure, right?

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.140
And so I thought, how
am I going to use this?

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.639
Well, I'm going to
write a book that

00:38:19.639 --> 00:38:21.230
maybe is more controversial.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.664
So I wrote a book about charity.

00:38:22.664 --> 00:38:24.330
I wrote a book about
philanthropy, which

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.770
was my main area of research.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.450
But I asked the question, who
actually gives to charity?

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.797
Who thinks they give
to charity but don't?

00:38:32.797 --> 00:38:34.880
And I looked at the
difference between poor people

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.772
and rich people and religious
people and secular people.

00:38:37.772 --> 00:38:39.230
And I also looked
at the difference

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.790
between conservatives
and liberals.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.400
And that, of course, was going
to be really controversial.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.710
And the book comes out.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.380
And it hits the news cycle
in just the right way.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.380
And my life changed,
because as sometimes happens

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.570
to obscure college
professors, my book

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.962
started selling hundreds
of copies a day.

00:38:56.962 --> 00:38:58.420
And my life just
changed overnight.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.730
I went from obscure college
professor to being on the radio

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.880
and on the television
just within days.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.860
It was crazy, because I was
getting all this feedback

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.620
from people.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.170
I was not ready for this, right?

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.080
I mean, my wife was like you've
got to get a better haircut.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:12.900
You're on TV all the time.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.858
It was stuff like that.

00:39:13.858 --> 00:39:16.310
It was like-- it was different
times for me, obviously.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.980
11 years-- a lot has
happened in 11 years.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.870
And here's the weirdest part.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.836
I was getting letters and
mostly e-mails from people

00:39:23.836 --> 00:39:26.210
I'd never met, because when
you have a book that's really

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.220
selling a lot, people
will write to you

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.150
and tell you their opinions
even though they don't know you.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.470
I love your book, I hate
your book, whatever.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.560
So I get an email from a guy two
weeks after the book comes out.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.990
I'm just sitting at my
desk, my office in Syracuse.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.050
And an email pops up-- ding.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:48.095
Dear Professor Brooks, you
are a right wing fraud.

00:39:48.095 --> 00:39:50.470
And that's not a great way to
start an email, by the way.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.870
That's not very inviting.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.270
But I keep reading,
because I'm game.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.410
I'm a good sport.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.160
And the first thing I
notice is this email

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.930
is like 5,000 words long.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.620
It's going to take me 20
minutes to read this email.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.820
But I'm reading through it.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.940
I'm well into it.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.920
Here's the second
thing I notice.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.140
Every single point in my book
is being refuted by this guy.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.090
It's a guy from Texas, right?

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.900
I mean, in the most
vitriolic terms, in detail--

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.540
the insults are
detailed, like you

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.750
know the columns in table 3.1?

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.980
They're reversed, you moron.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.660
You know, stuff like that
where it's like, wow.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.580
And every piece of data, every
conclusion, every paragraph,

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.682
detail.

00:40:32.682 --> 00:40:34.640
And you know what I was
thinking the whole time

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.160
I was reading this email?

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.530
Thought kept coming to
me over and over again.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.900
He read my book!

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.150
Because nobody
ever read my books.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.400
I couldn't believe this
guy had read my book.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.479
And I was just filled
with gratitude,

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.270
because it had never
happened to me before.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.430
I mean, it was like
my life was changing.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.429
And it was because people
were reading my stuff.

00:40:53.429 --> 00:40:54.940
So I thought to
myself, you know,

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.962
I think I'm going to tell him
what's on my heart right now.

00:40:57.962 --> 00:40:58.920
So I wrote back to him.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.590
Dear so-and-so, I know
you think I'm terrible

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.760
and you think my
book is terrible.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.790
But it took me two years
to write that thing.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.200
And I put my whole
heart into it.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.480
And you read every word.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.910
I am so grateful
to you for that.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.120
Thank you.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:14.620
Send.

00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:19.060
And then I waited,
because I was thinking

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.630
I wonder if this guy will
actually write back to me,

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:21.130
right?

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.892
And sure enough, 15
minutes later, ding.

00:41:23.892 --> 00:41:26.100
I'm working on a data set
or something and I look up.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.120
And this e-mail has come in.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:27.828
And I open it up.

00:41:27.828 --> 00:41:29.620
Dear Professor Brooks,
next time you're

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.140
in Dallas, if you want to get
some dinner, give me a call.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:39.110
I defeat my enemies when I
make them my friends, remember?

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.690
This guy went from
wanting me dead to wanting

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:45.810
to buy me dinner in the
matter of just like that,

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.101
almost the blink of an eye.

00:41:47.101 --> 00:41:47.600
Why?

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.370
Because I accidentally
treated him

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.770
with warmheartedness in
response to his contempt.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.710
It was a case study of
the Dalai Lama's principal

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.260
that I learned only
some years later.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.600
OK now, that's what I think of.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.210
And you have something
that you've done, too.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.410
I'm not so virtuous.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.040
I was just being honest at
this one particular moment,

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.040
a little bit vulnerable.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.690
And look what happened.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.190
You can think of
these things, too.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:11.500
That's your case study.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.440
That's your teacher.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.460
That's your guide.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.050
That's what you
need to think of.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.490
What was the key
ingredient in that thing

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.050
that just happened, by the way?

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.675
Let me hone in a
little bit more on it.

00:42:19.675 --> 00:42:20.480
It was gratitude.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.330
Gratitude is the
contempt killer.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.580
If you can remember to be
grateful for the things

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.897
that you really should be
grateful for, because think

00:42:28.897 --> 00:42:30.480
of all that we should
be grateful for.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.271
Think where we are.

00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:32.150
It's a beautiful day.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.780
We're in Mountain View.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.821
You're working at Google.

00:42:33.821 --> 00:42:36.050
There's a lot to
be grateful for.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.759
Remembering gratitude
will kill contempt.

00:42:39.759 --> 00:42:41.300
There's a wonderful
principle of this

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.240
in this-- there's a book
that your parents probably

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.840
read called "How to Win Friends
and Influence People" by Dale

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.590
Carnegie.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.490
Go get it.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.840
It was a big best
seller in the '30s.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.340
Go get it.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.354
It's a beautiful book.

00:42:53.354 --> 00:42:55.520
It sounds like it's how to
bend people to your will,

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.460
but it's not.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.360
It's actually a guide to
courageous, ethical living

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.860
where you treat
others with respect.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.790
Very beautiful book.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.820
And in the book,
Dale Carnegie was

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.020
this early
self-improvement writer.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.670
And he's traveling
around America

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.230
to find the most successful
people and find their secrets.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.460
And so he gets to New York City.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:18.110
And he goes to Broadway to see a
magician named Howard Thurston.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.490
Howard Thurston was the most
famous magician of his age.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:21.560
He was a celebrated guy.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.460
For 40 years he'd been doing the
same tricks night after night

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.620
after night on Broadway.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.460
And so Andrew--

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.640
Dale, not Andrew Carnegie.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.450
Dale Carnegie goes to see
Howard Thurston to find out

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.190
why he's so great.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.560
Now the tricks are all
really conventional.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.100
It's rabbits out of hats and
card tricks and all this stuff.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.650
But he figured out that
what was really going on

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:46.800
was Howard Thurston's
relationship to his audience.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.680
He would tell a joke
and people would laugh

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.450
and he would laugh, too.

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:55.040
And he was super into it
like it was the first night.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.220
Now, he'd been doing this for
40 years, same tricks, 40 years.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.150
That was the secret.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.580
First night, same
spirit every night.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.981
So he goes back to Howard
Thurston's dressing room

00:44:04.981 --> 00:44:05.480
afterwards.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.477
Mr. Thurston, I understand
now why you're so popular.

00:44:09.477 --> 00:44:11.060
You made it look
like the first night.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.430
How did you do that?

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:14.639
He said, oh it's very simple.

00:44:14.639 --> 00:44:16.846
Every night before I go out,
I'm in my dressing room,

00:44:16.846 --> 00:44:18.440
I say the same thing to myself.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.180
I am truly grateful
for the people

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:23.600
in those seats who make it
possible for me to do something

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.230
that I love.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.680
That's pretty important.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.510
That's now what I say, because
I get to do that for a living,

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.010
too.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.660
I get to do something
that I love.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.080
I get to talk to
you about truth,

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.630
truth that brings
solidarity and brotherhood

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.710
and love to other people.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.064
This is my job.

00:44:44.064 --> 00:44:44.980
What an amazing thing.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.760
I'm so grateful to you
that I get to do it.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.130
That gratitude, of
course, kills any contempt

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:55.240
when you display it while
you're talking to somebody

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.410
else about politics.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:58.630
Why should you?

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.270
Why should you be
grateful at that moment?

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:04.360
Because you're living
in a free country where

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.670
because you have a
difference of opinion,

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.400
nobody's going to come and
knock on your door at night

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.630
and haul you off.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:13.090
That is historically
unprecedented.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:16.450
God bless America, that
even if we display contempt,

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.680
we're not going to
get arrested for it.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.680
That's something that we
should be grateful for.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.250
Furthermore, if you join me in
believing that we should not

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:28.000
be living in a one-party
state, that by construction

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.450
means you feel grateful to
people who disagree with you,

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.730
who are not from your party.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.000
You should be grateful.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.090
And you should
express that gratitude

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.890
for people who are
on the other side

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:41.480
in the competition of ideas.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.900
Remember that and
prosper from that.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.750
OK, sum it up.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.690
I've tried to give
you two new ideas.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:51.500
I don't care what
your politics are.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.830
I don't care what
my politics are.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:57.490
If you want to have policies
that help people more,

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:58.720
don't think about helping.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.250
Think about needing them.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.820
If you want to put
that into practice

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:06.010
to try to solve political
polarization and contempt,

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:10.840
remember that you actually need
people with whom you disagree.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.680
That's how we put
these things together.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.680
If you do these
two things today,

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.470
you'll be thinking
differently about your work

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:19.900
and about your life and
about your relationships.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:21.970
And money back
guarantee, you're going

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.090
to be happier before
you go to bed tonight.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:27.740
These are tips to better living.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.750
And they're tips to making other
people live better as well.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.005
I'm really grateful for this.

00:46:33.005 --> 00:46:34.630
I'm really grateful
for the opportunity

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.860
to talk to you, as I just
mentioned a second ago.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.540
And I would love to hear
how this works for you.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:45.520
So give me feedback,
spread the ideas around,

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.630
write me an email at
Arthur.Brooks@AEI.org.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.910
If it works for you, I
want to hear about it.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:53.810
And I want to share that
with others as well.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:54.740
Thank you for your time.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:55.948
Thank you for your attention.

00:46:55.948 --> 00:46:56.629
Thank you.

00:46:56.629 --> 00:46:59.383
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.110
MAX PAPPAS: Thank you, Arthur.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:02.630
And if--

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:03.270
ARTHUR BROOKS: Thanks, Max.

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:04.853
MAX PAPPAS: --there
are any questions,

00:47:04.853 --> 00:47:07.630
we have time for maybe one
or two quick questions.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.590
I'll pass the mic.

00:47:11.219 --> 00:47:13.760
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you think that there's something

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.820
fundamental to human dignity,
human flourishing that's

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.050
tied up with human labor.

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:21.860
And if so, what that
means for us in an economy

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.840
that's more
productive than ever,

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.180
but in which human labor is
an increasingly diminishing

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:26.680
component.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.513
ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah.

00:47:27.513 --> 00:47:28.850
What a wonderful question.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:32.900
What is the inherency of dignity
that comes from human labor?

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.780
I mean, there's really a
lot of philosophy on this.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.680
I mean, the idea of
sanctified ordinary work

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.260
is a very common theme for
philosophers and theologians.

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:48.250
And what many people
have written about this,

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.510
just throughout the
ages, is that when

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.950
people have a sense of
their own self-worth,

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:55.560
it comes from
meaning and purpose.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.290
Meaning and purpose
only comes when

00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:00.160
you are serving others as
opposed to being served.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.850
This Is the paradox of it.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.814
When you're feeling
lousy about your life,

00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:05.480
you want other people
to serve you more.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.190
You want to stop feeling lousy?

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:08.870
Go serve other people more.

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:11.840
That paradoxical kind
of turning of the tables

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.120
actually is one of the
great secrets to happiness.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.370
How can you do that
on a systematic basis,

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:19.460
is by seeing your work
as service to others

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:23.040
and making your work
into service to others.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.110
That's how no matter
what you're doing--

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.890
whether you're coding or
you're building a wall

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:30.140
or you're running a think tank--

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:33.050
you can get greater joy from
it by remembering the people

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:35.255
that you are trying
to serve, whether it's

00:48:35.255 --> 00:48:37.550
your coworkers or your clients.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:39.020
That's really hugely important.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.990
And this is a robust social
psychological finding

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:45.530
and a theological finding and a
philosophical finding as well.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:49.070
Work brings happiness as long
as it is tied to purpose.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:51.680
And purpose comes from
serving other people.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.630
That's your job is to figure out
how to serve other people more.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:59.757
So what does it mean
when people work less?

00:48:59.757 --> 00:49:01.340
Let's not talk about
just service jobs

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.980
where people have less
robust human labor

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.350
or where people are even
cutting down on hours.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.840
Let's talk about an economy
where fewer and fewer people

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.780
are needed in the workforce.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.310
You've created almost
perfect storm, a formula

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:14.704
for unhappiness in doing that.

00:49:14.704 --> 00:49:17.120
So this is connected to what
I've been talking about here,

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:17.620
right?

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.510
We basically say--
anytime you say look,

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:23.210
I don't think people should
have to take dead-end jobs,

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:24.740
you basically said
you're not going

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.999
to get dignity from work
because I've defined dignity out

00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:28.540
of your work.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.980
What an arrogant,
terrible thing to say.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.230
Who treats their brothers
and sisters that way?

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:34.970
Everybody should
be able to work.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:36.560
Everybody should
have dignified work

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.330
and get dignity from their work.

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:39.680
No such thing as a dead-end job.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.910
That's critical.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:44.150
But what we're basically doing
in our economy, of course,

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:45.740
is loading more
and more and more

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.630
of the value on the
workforce onto you

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.399
and onto me, the
people who are trying

00:49:50.399 --> 00:49:52.440
to get more and more and
more and more productive

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.220
in the top 10% of the
income distribution.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.720
That's what we're actually
trying to do, in which case,

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.450
we're basically saying
these things have

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:01.560
more dignity than other people.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.080
What we should be
thinking about is

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.620
finding ways for other
people to earn their way

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.072
and not just in public policy,
in private industry as well.

00:50:10.072 --> 00:50:11.780
And in doing that,
we'll have the formula

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.570
for passing on the blessings
that we take for granted.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:17.540
For you, for me, the
one thing for you

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:19.640
to take away from
what I just said

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.580
is that meaning comes from work
when work provides service.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.420
And service is all
about other people.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:29.186
How am I serving my fellow
men and women more today?

00:50:29.186 --> 00:50:30.560
I'm going to find
a way to do it.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.240
On your way to work
in the mornings,

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.460
say I'm going to
serve more today.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.920
I'm going to find a
better way to serve today.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.937
And you go home happier with
a better appetite for dinner.

00:50:39.937 --> 00:50:41.520
Thank you for that
wonderful question.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.130
Yeah.

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.260
AUDIENCE: How do you
incentivize the private sector

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:50.450
to need the poor, especially
if it's less financially viable

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:52.917
than say serving the top 10%?

00:50:52.917 --> 00:50:53.750
ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:57.080
I'm asking the private sector to
be more creative in doing that,

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.730
because I think that
we're passing up

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.020
all sorts of opportunities.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:04.010
And here's how I'd like to
ask you to think about it.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.210
As an historic matter, every
prosperous and successful

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:12.470
society has made a major
inflection as prosperity

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:16.770
on the basis of energy and
of an energy source, right?

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.670
And sometimes it's
like finding oil.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:24.560
But usually energy sources are
tied up in human ingenuity.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.760
So the United States had a
major inflection of prosperity,

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.300
of productivity when we figured
out that universal education is

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.290
a really good thing.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.540
Universal public education
is a great thing.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.130
It's a huge public good.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.890
It unlocked massive
amounts of human energy

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.530
and turn America into
a really great country.

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:44.390
It wasn't that long
ago, by the way.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.150
It was like in the late
part of the 19th century was

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:48.620
when this started to happen.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.330
It went along with
Industrial Revolution.

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.490
But it unlocked the
human capital revolution

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:53.870
in this country.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.600
Energy sources are
a really big deal.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.910
What we need to do to
be more creative about,

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:02.690
in the idea of part of the
private sector in particular--

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.530
we can talk about
manufacturing if you want.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:05.930
But basically look,
this is Google.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:07.310
This is the idea
part of the world.

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:09.435
And I'm in the American
Enterprise Institute, which

00:52:09.435 --> 00:52:11.400
is an idea factory as well--

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.670
is finding better ways
to unlock the next wave

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.440
of human potential.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.810
The most productive
areas of human potential

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:21.810
are going to be where it's
currently lying fallow,

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:25.530
not where it's already at its
highest degree of utilization,

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:26.400
right?

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.800
You've all heard the
old axiom that if you

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.500
want to get something
done, go to a busy person.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.450
That is true as far as it goes.

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:34.892
But if you want
an army of people

00:52:34.892 --> 00:52:36.350
who are going to
do new things, you

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:38.910
have to find people
who have free time.

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:43.200
And if you want to find ways to
radically inflect productivity

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.360
in this country, you
have to find the places

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.310
where we're simply
not asking people

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:49.110
to put their oar
in the water enough

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:51.480
and find ways to help
them get that done.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.570
What is Google doing to
enhance the productivity

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:58.080
and the productive capacity
of people who are currently

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.000
behind the curtain
of how technology

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.830
can enhance effectively
their intelligence

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:05.970
and their productivity?

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:08.205
I mean, Google has made
me-- it's unbelievable

00:53:08.205 --> 00:53:10.140
what this company has
done for me, by the way.

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.348
I'll tell you what it's done.

00:53:11.348 --> 00:53:14.940
I mean, it's given me the
capacity at my fingertips,

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.400
with just me and devices.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.710
It's given me the
imagination, creativity,

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.460
and the effective intelligence
far beyond the dreams

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.340
of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.960
That's what it's done in just
the last few years, right?

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.350
But why is it that the people
we're adding to in this way

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.630
are the people who
needed it the least?

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.660
And why do we keep finding
ways to make people at the top

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:40.006
more productive, more
creative, more prosperous?

00:53:40.006 --> 00:53:41.880
Why are we not looking
for people who are not

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.921
at that particular place?

00:53:42.921 --> 00:53:45.074
That's my challenge
to you, my friends.

00:53:45.074 --> 00:53:46.740
That's what we should
be thinking about,

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:50.700
not just as social justice
warriors, but as people

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:54.480
who are trying to be
economically savvy, who

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.140
are looking for the next great
post-industrial revolution.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.290
That's the answer that
we need to come up with.

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:04.430
And that's the answer we need
to come up with together.

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:05.720
MAX PAPPAS: Thank you, Arthur.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.400
Thanks for everybody who came.

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.324
Thanks to everybody
who watched online.

00:54:10.324 --> 00:54:11.490
Thanks for coming to Google.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:11.990
ARTHUR BROOKS: Thanks, Max.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.590
Thanks a lot.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.640
[APPLAUSE]
