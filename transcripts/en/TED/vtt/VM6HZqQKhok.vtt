00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:18.188
My journey away from violent extremism
began 22 years ago,

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:20.159
when I denounced racism

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:22.967
and left the American white
supremacist skinhead movement

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:24.351
that I had helped build.

00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:29.769
(Cheers and applause)

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.365
I was just 22 years old at the time,

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:37.442
but I had already spent eight years,
from the time I was 14 years old,

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.680
as one of the earliest
and youngest members

00:00:39.704 --> 00:00:44.233
and an eventual leader within
America's most violent hate movement.

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.659
But I wasn't born into hate;

00:00:47.683 --> 00:00:50.694
in fact, it was quite the opposite.

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:55.118
I had a relatively normal childhood.

00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:57.469
My parents are Italian immigrants

00:00:57.493 --> 00:01:00.583
who came to the United States
in the mid-1960s

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:03.296
and settled on the South Side of Chicago,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.724
where they eventually met,

00:01:05.307 --> 00:01:07.219
and opened a small beauty shop.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:11.634
Right after I was born,
things got a little bit more difficult.

00:01:11.658 --> 00:01:16.350
They struggled to survive with raising
a young family and a new business,

00:01:16.374 --> 00:01:18.768
often working seven days a week,

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.057
14 hours a day,

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.556
taking on second and third jobs
just to earn a meager living.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.612
And quality time with my parents
was pretty nonexistent.

00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:31.557
Even though I knew
they loved me very much,

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:34.395
growing up, I felt abandoned.

00:01:35.297 --> 00:01:38.256
I was lonely, and I started to withdraw,

00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:43.379
and then I started to resent my parents
and become very angry.

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:47.506
And as I was growing up,
through my teenage years,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.572
I started to act out to try and get
attention from my parents.

00:01:53.032 --> 00:01:55.566
And one day, when I was 14,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.134
I was standing in an alley,
and I was smoking a joint,

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:04.834
and a man who was twice my age,
with a shaved head and tall black boots,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.721
came up to me,

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:09.583
and he snatched the joint from my lips.

00:02:10.893 --> 00:02:14.810
Then he put his hand on my shoulder
and he looked me in the eyes,

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.060
and he said,

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.952
"That's what the communists
and the Jews want you to do

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:21.345
to keep you docile."

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.512
I was 14 years old,

00:02:24.536 --> 00:02:27.410
I'd been trading baseball cards
and watching "Happy Days" --

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:29.208
I didn't really know what a Jew was.

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:31.002
(Laughter)

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.177
It's true.

00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:36.176
And the only communist that I knew
was the bad Russian guy

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.068
in my favorite Rocky movie.

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:40.723
(Laughter)

00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:42.978
And since I'm here
baring my soul with you,

00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:46.994
I can reveal that I did not even know
what the word "docile" meant.

00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:48.819
(Laughter)

00:02:48.843 --> 00:02:50.048
Dead serious.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.411
But it was as if this man in this alley
had offered me a lifeline.

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:59.711
For 14 years, I'd felt
marginalized and bullied.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:01.910
I had low self-esteem.

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:06.428
And frankly, I didn't know
who I was, where I belonged,

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.457
or what my purpose was.

00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:09.655
I was lost.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.522
And overnight, because this man
had pulled me in,

00:03:14.546 --> 00:03:19.151
and I had grabbed onto that lifeline
with every fiber of my being,

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:23.027
I had gone from "Joanie Loves Chachi"

00:03:24.264 --> 00:03:26.258
to full-blown Nazi.

00:03:26.826 --> 00:03:28.004
Overnight.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.773
I started to listen to the rhetoric

00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:33.952
and believe it.

00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:38.880
I started to watch very closely
as the leaders of this organization

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:44.059
would target vulnerable young people
who felt marginalized

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:48.633
and then draw them in
with promises of paradise

00:03:48.657 --> 00:03:49.861
that were broken.

00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:54.256
And then I started to recruit myself.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.883
I started to do that by making
white-power music.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.564
And soon, I became the leader
of that infamous organization

00:04:05.588 --> 00:04:08.216
that was led by that man in that alley

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.989
who recruited me that day,

00:04:10.013 --> 00:04:14.744
who was America's first neo-Nazi skinhead
and who had radicalized me.

00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:17.732
For the next eight years,

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:20.664
I believed the lies that I had been fed.

00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:24.648
And though I saw
no evidence of it whatsoever,

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:28.895
I didn't hesitate to blame
every Jewish person in the world

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.052
for what I thought was a white,
European genocide

00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:37.336
being promoted by them
through a multiculturalist agenda.

00:04:38.553 --> 00:04:40.551
I blamed people of color

00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:44.610
for the crime and violence
and the drugs in the city,

00:04:45.737 --> 00:04:49.628
completely neglecting the fact
that I was committing acts of violence

00:04:49.652 --> 00:04:50.897
on a daily basis,

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.230
and that in many cases,

00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:56.224
it was white supremacists
who were funneling drugs

00:04:56.248 --> 00:04:57.732
into the inner cities.

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:01.263
And I blamed immigrants

00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:04.803
for taking jobs from white Americans,

00:05:04.827 --> 00:05:09.798
completely neglecting the fact that
my parents were hardworking immigrants

00:05:09.822 --> 00:05:11.907
who struggled to survive,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.771
despite not getting help
from anybody else.

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:19.442
For the next eight years,

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:22.064
I saw friends die,

00:05:23.096 --> 00:05:27.213
I saw others go to prison
and inflict untold pain

00:05:27.237 --> 00:05:30.320
on countless victims
and their families' lives.

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:35.114
I heard horrific stories
from young women in the movement,

00:05:35.138 --> 00:05:40.084
who'd been brutally raped by the very men
they were conditioned to trust,

00:05:41.957 --> 00:05:45.115
and I myself committed acts
of violence against people,

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.667
solely for the color of their skin,

00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:49.028
who they loved,

00:05:49.052 --> 00:05:51.680
or the god that they prayed to.

00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:57.186
I stockpiled weapons for what I thought
was an upcoming race war.

00:05:57.746 --> 00:05:59.165
I went to six high schools;

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:00.866
I was kicked out of four of them,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.319
one of them, twice.

00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:08.544
And 25 years ago, I wrote
and performed racist music

00:06:10.044 --> 00:06:12.714
that found its way
to the internet decades later

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:16.027
and partially inspired
a young white nationalist

00:06:16.051 --> 00:06:20.552
to walk into a sacred Charleston,
South Carolina, church

00:06:20.576 --> 00:06:24.683
and senselessly massacre
nine innocent people.

00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:29.919
But then my life changed.

00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:35.825
At 19 years old, I met a girl
who was not in the movement,

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.593
who didn't have a racist bone in her body,

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:41.207
and I fell in love with her.

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.030
And at 19, we got married,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.885
and we had our first son.

00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:52.073
And when I held my son in my arms
in the delivery room that day,

00:06:52.784 --> 00:06:57.280
not only did I reconnect
with some of the innocence that I had lost

00:06:57.304 --> 00:06:58.730
at 14 years old,

00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:01.649
but it also began to challenge

00:07:01.673 --> 00:07:05.882
the very important things that drew
me to the movement to begin with:

00:07:05.906 --> 00:07:08.376
identity, community and purpose --

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.914
things that I had been
struggling with as a young boy.

00:07:11.938 --> 00:07:17.106
And now, I struggled with the concept
of who I was again.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.740
Was I this neo-Nazi hatemonger,

00:07:22.674 --> 00:07:25.430
or was I a caring father and husband?

00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:30.588
Was my community the one
that I had manufactured around me

00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:32.213
to boost my own ego,

00:07:32.982 --> 00:07:37.493
because I felt self-hatred for myself
and I wanted to project it onto others,

00:07:38.597 --> 00:07:42.617
or was it the one
that I had physically given life to?

00:07:43.918 --> 00:07:46.874
Was my purpose to scorch the earth

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.689
or was it to make it
a better place for my family?

00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:57.077
And suddenly, like a ton of bricks hit me,

00:07:57.101 --> 00:08:02.481
I became very confused with
who I'd been for the last eight years.

00:08:04.026 --> 00:08:07.350
And if only I'd been brave enough
to walk away at that moment,

00:08:07.374 --> 00:08:12.942
to understand what the struggle was
that was happening inside of me,

00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:16.956
then maybe tragedy
could have been averted.

00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:19.835
Instead, I did compromise.

00:08:19.859 --> 00:08:23.204
I took myself off the streets
for the benefit of my family,

00:08:23.228 --> 00:08:27.204
because I was nervous that maybe
I could go to jail or end up dead,

00:08:27.228 --> 00:08:29.321
and they would have to fend
for themselves.

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:31.668
So I stepped back as a leader,

00:08:31.692 --> 00:08:34.331
and instead I opened a record store

00:08:35.092 --> 00:08:39.243
that I was going to sell
white-power music in, of course,

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:41.388
because I was importing it in from Europe.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:46.545
But I knew that if I was just
a racist store selling racist music

00:08:46.569 --> 00:08:49.591
the community would not
allow me to be there.

00:08:49.615 --> 00:08:54.264
So I decided I was going to also
stock the shelves with other music,

00:08:54.288 --> 00:08:56.744
like punk rock and heavy metal

00:08:56.768 --> 00:08:58.015
and hip-hop.

00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:01.456
And while the white-power music
that I was selling

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.891
was 75 percent of my gross revenue,

00:09:03.915 --> 00:09:07.233
because people were driving in
from all over the country to buy it

00:09:07.257 --> 00:09:09.396
from the only store that was selling it,

00:09:10.435 --> 00:09:15.198
I also had customers come in
to buy the other music.

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:18.345
And eventually, they started
to talk to me.

00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:23.842
One day, a young black teen came in,

00:09:23.866 --> 00:09:25.605
and he was visibly upset.

00:09:27.076 --> 00:09:29.406
And I decided to ask him what was wrong.

00:09:30.213 --> 00:09:34.156
And he told me that his mother
had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:38.155
And suddenly, this young black teenager,

00:09:38.716 --> 00:09:43.281
who I'd never had a meaningful
conversation or interaction with,

00:09:43.305 --> 00:09:45.024
I was able to connect with,

00:09:45.048 --> 00:09:49.053
because my own mother
had been diagnosed with breast cancer,

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:51.503
and I could feel his pain.

00:09:52.712 --> 00:09:56.452
On another occasion, a gay couple
came in with their son,

00:09:56.476 --> 00:10:01.393
and it was undeniable to me
that they loved their son

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:04.961
in the same profound ways
that I loved mine.

00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:11.077
And suddenly, I couldn't rationalize
or justify the prejudice

00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.535
that I had in my head.

00:10:13.869 --> 00:10:16.681
I decided to pull the white-power
music from the inventory

00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:20.064
when I became too embarrassed
to sell it in front of my new friends.

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:23.284
And of course, the store
couldn't sustain itself,

00:10:23.308 --> 00:10:24.619
so I had to close it.

00:10:25.343 --> 00:10:29.974
At that same time, I lost
nearly everything in my life.

00:10:30.484 --> 00:10:32.988
I used it as an opportunity to walk away

00:10:33.012 --> 00:10:35.870
from the movement that
I'd been a part of for eight years,

00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:40.296
the only identity, community and purpose
that I'd really known for most of my life.

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:42.535
So I had nobody.

00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:46.327
I lost my livelihood
because I closed the store.

00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:50.337
I didn't have a great relationship
with my parents, even though they tried.

00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:52.888
And my wife and children left me,

00:10:52.912 --> 00:10:56.577
because I hadn't left the movement
and disengaged quickly enough.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.224
And suddenly,

00:11:01.117 --> 00:11:03.048
I didn't know who I was again,

00:11:03.072 --> 00:11:04.332
or where I fit in

00:11:05.044 --> 00:11:07.414
or what my purpose was supposed to be.

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:10.351
I was miserable inside,

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:13.914
and I often woke up in the morning

00:11:13.938 --> 00:11:15.422
wishing that I hadn't.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.330
About five years in,

00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:23.200
one of the few friends that I had
was concerned about my well-being,

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:25.107
and she came to me and she said,

00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:28.490
"You need to do something,
because I don't want to see you die."

00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:33.610
And she suggested that I go
apply for a job where she worked,

00:11:33.634 --> 00:11:35.433
at a company called IBM.

00:11:37.158 --> 00:11:39.211
Yeah, I thought she was crazy, too.

00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:40.920
(Laughter)

00:11:40.944 --> 00:11:45.519
Here I was, a closeted ex-Nazi
covered in hate tattoos.

00:11:45.543 --> 00:11:46.775
I didn't go to college.

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:50.874
I'd been kicked out of multiple
high schools multiple times.

00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:53.670
I didn't even own a computer.

00:11:55.384 --> 00:11:56.640
But I went in,

00:11:56.664 --> 00:12:00.294
and somehow, miraculously, I got the job.

00:12:01.636 --> 00:12:03.202
I was thrilled.

00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:06.855
And then I became terrified to learn

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:10.440
that they'd actually be putting me
back at my old high school,

00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:12.939
the same one I got kicked out of twice,

00:12:13.892 --> 00:12:15.341
to install their computers.

00:12:16.483 --> 00:12:19.990
This was a high school
where I had committed acts of violence

00:12:20.014 --> 00:12:22.466
against students, against faculty;

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.630
where I had protested out in front
of the school for equal rights for whites

00:12:26.654 --> 00:12:29.733
and even had a sit-in in the cafeteria

00:12:29.757 --> 00:12:32.251
to try and demand a white student union.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:36.647
And of course, as karma would have it,

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:39.124
within the first couple of hours,

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:43.598
who walks right by me
but Mr. Johnny Holmes,

00:12:43.622 --> 00:12:47.008
the tough black security guard
I had gotten in a fistfight with,

00:12:48.016 --> 00:12:50.056
that got me kicked out the second time

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.494
and led out in handcuffs from the school.

00:12:53.763 --> 00:12:55.378
He didn't recognize me,

00:12:56.251 --> 00:12:57.483
but I saw him,

00:12:58.404 --> 00:12:59.806
and I didn't know what to do.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.473
I was frozen; I was this grown man now,
years out of the movement,

00:13:03.497 --> 00:13:05.578
and I was sweating and I was trembling.

00:13:06.533 --> 00:13:08.687
But I decided I had to do something.

00:13:09.902 --> 00:13:13.701
And I decided I needed to suffer
under the weight of my past,

00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:16.396
because for five years
I had tried to outrun it.

00:13:17.105 --> 00:13:20.409
I'd tried to make new friends
and cover my tattoos with long sleeves,

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:21.600
and I wouldn't admit it

00:13:21.624 --> 00:13:23.446
because I was afraid of being judged

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.711
the same way I had judged other people.

00:13:26.862 --> 00:13:30.846
Well, I decided I was going to chase
Mr. Holmes out to the parking lot --

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.373
probably not the smartest
decision that I made.

00:13:33.397 --> 00:13:34.668
(Laughter)

00:13:34.692 --> 00:13:37.206
But when I found him,
he was getting into his car,

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.203
and I tapped him on the shoulder.

00:13:39.227 --> 00:13:42.383
And when he turned around
and he recognized me,

00:13:42.407 --> 00:13:44.974
he took a step back because he was afraid.

00:13:46.907 --> 00:13:48.534
And I didn't know what to say.

00:13:50.088 --> 00:13:54.128
Finally, the words came out of my mouth,
and all I could think to say was,

00:13:54.152 --> 00:13:55.313
"I'm sorry."

00:13:56.096 --> 00:13:57.572
And he embraced me,

00:13:58.391 --> 00:13:59.820
and he forgave me.

00:14:01.877 --> 00:14:04.843
And he encouraged me to forgive myself.

00:14:06.073 --> 00:14:12.163
He recognized that it wasn't the story
of some broken go-nowhere kid

00:14:12.187 --> 00:14:15.203
who was going to just
join a gang and go to prison.

00:14:15.227 --> 00:14:19.750
He knew that this was the story
of every young person who was vulnerable,

00:14:19.774 --> 00:14:22.582
who was searching for identity,
community and purpose,

00:14:22.606 --> 00:14:24.012
and then hit a wall

00:14:24.036 --> 00:14:25.758
and was unable to find it

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.529
and went down a dark path.

00:14:29.482 --> 00:14:31.575
And he made me promise one thing,

00:14:31.599 --> 00:14:34.827
that I would tell my story
to whoever would listen.

00:14:34.851 --> 00:14:36.433
That was 18 years ago,

00:14:36.457 --> 00:14:38.255
and I've been doing it ever since.

00:14:38.737 --> 00:14:43.611
(Applause)

00:14:49.309 --> 00:14:51.277
You might be asking yourself right now:

00:14:51.301 --> 00:14:54.323
How does a good kid from
a hardworking immigrant family

00:14:54.347 --> 00:14:57.190
end up going down such a dark path?

00:14:57.214 --> 00:14:59.894
One word: potholes.

00:15:00.508 --> 00:15:02.226
That's right. Potholes.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.783
I had a lot of potholes when I was kid.

00:15:05.582 --> 00:15:07.127
We all had them --

00:15:07.151 --> 00:15:10.021
you know, the things in life that we hit

00:15:10.045 --> 00:15:12.971
that invariably just kind of
nudge us off our path,

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:14.677
and if they remain unresolved

00:15:15.442 --> 00:15:16.681
or untreated

00:15:17.697 --> 00:15:19.118
or not dealt with,

00:15:19.792 --> 00:15:23.555
sometimes we can get dangerously lost
down pretty dark corridors.

00:15:24.228 --> 00:15:26.411
Potholes can be things like trauma,

00:15:26.435 --> 00:15:28.852
abuse, unemployment,

00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:30.826
neglect,

00:15:31.652 --> 00:15:33.844
untreated mental health conditions,

00:15:33.868 --> 00:15:35.059
even privilege.

00:15:35.942 --> 00:15:39.090
And if we hit enough potholes
on our journey in life,

00:15:39.696 --> 00:15:43.436
and we don't have the resources
or the help to navigate around them

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.677
or to pull us out,

00:15:46.184 --> 00:15:49.357
well, sometimes good people
end up doing bad things.

00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:55.165
One such person
who had potholes is Darrell.

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:56.980
Darrell is from upstate New York.

00:15:57.495 --> 00:15:59.620
He had read my memoir,

00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:02.341
and he was really upset about the ending.

00:16:02.365 --> 00:16:04.271
You see, I'd gotten out of the movement

00:16:04.295 --> 00:16:05.725
and he was still in.

00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:09.456
And he emailed me and he said,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.818
"I didn't really like the way
that turned out."

00:16:11.842 --> 00:16:13.556
And I said, "Well, I'm sorry."

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.209
(Laughter)

00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:18.224
"But if you want to talk about it,
we could certainly do that."

00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:21.466
And after a couple of weeks
of going back and forth with Darrell,

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.570
I learned he was a 31-year-old
military veteran who had been injured

00:16:26.594 --> 00:16:30.333
and was really angry about
not being able to go to Afghanistan

00:16:30.357 --> 00:16:31.658
to kill Muslims.

00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:34.066
And one day on the phone,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.279
he told me that he had seen
a Muslim man in the park praying,

00:16:38.303 --> 00:16:42.190
and that all he wanted to do
was kick him in the face.

00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:45.126
I flew to Buffalo the next day,

00:16:45.968 --> 00:16:47.642
and I sat down with Darrell,

00:16:48.515 --> 00:16:49.707
and I asked him,

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.548
"Have you ever met
a Muslim person before?"

00:16:54.168 --> 00:16:55.714
And he said, "No!

00:16:55.738 --> 00:16:57.569
Why the hell would I want to do that?

00:16:57.593 --> 00:17:00.142
They're evil. I don't want
anything to do with them."

00:17:01.067 --> 00:17:02.497
I said, "OK."

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.943
So I excused myself,
and I went into the bathroom

00:17:04.967 --> 00:17:07.201
and I took my phone out in the bathroom,

00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:09.118
and I Googled the local mosque,

00:17:09.977 --> 00:17:12.264
and I called them very quietly
from the bathroom,

00:17:12.288 --> 00:17:16.246
and I said, "Excuse me,
imam, I need a favor.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.421
I have a Christian man

00:17:17.445 --> 00:17:20.251
who would really love to learn more
about your religion."

00:17:20.275 --> 00:17:22.960
(Laughter)

00:17:22.984 --> 00:17:24.722
"Do you mind if we stop by?"

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:28.992
Well, it took some convincing
for Darrell to go,

00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:31.018
but finally we got there,

00:17:31.042 --> 00:17:32.548
and when I knocked on the door,

00:17:32.572 --> 00:17:35.662
the imam said he only had
15 minutes left for us,

00:17:35.686 --> 00:17:38.236
because he was preparing
for a prayer service.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.457
I said, "We'll take it."

00:17:40.252 --> 00:17:41.410
We went in,

00:17:41.434 --> 00:17:46.617
and two and a half hours later,
we came out after hugging and crying

00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:50.613
and, very strangely,
bonding over Chuck Norris for some reason.

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:51.687
(Laughter)

00:17:51.711 --> 00:17:53.643
I don't know what it was about that,

00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:55.059
but that's what happened.

00:17:56.459 --> 00:17:59.559
And I'm happy to say now
that Darrell and the imam,

00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:02.019
you can often find them
at the local falafel stand,

00:18:02.043 --> 00:18:03.658
having lunch together.

00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:07.447
(Applause)

00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:14.959
You see, it's our disconnection
from each other.

00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:17.226
Hatred is born of ignorance.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.329
Fear is its father,
and isolation is its mother.

00:18:21.353 --> 00:18:25.330
When we don't understand something,
we tend to be afraid of it,

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.073
and if we keep ourselves from it,

00:18:27.097 --> 00:18:30.244
that fear grows, and sometimes,
it turns into hatred.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.119
Since I've left the movement,
I've helped over a hundred people

00:18:34.143 --> 00:18:37.461
disengage from extremist movements,
from white supremacist groups --

00:18:37.485 --> 00:18:41.295
(Applause)

00:18:46.278 --> 00:18:47.804
to even jihadist groups.

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:52.385
And the way I do that
is not by arguing with them,

00:18:52.409 --> 00:18:53.926
not by debating them,

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.239
not by even telling them they're wrong,

00:18:56.263 --> 00:18:58.496
even though, boy, I want to sometimes.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.794
I don't do that.

00:19:00.334 --> 00:19:02.862
Instead, I don't push them away.

00:19:02.886 --> 00:19:04.521
I draw them in closer,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.583
and I listen very closely
for their potholes,

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:12.014
and then I begin to fill them in.

00:19:12.657 --> 00:19:14.913
I try to make people more resilient,

00:19:14.937 --> 00:19:16.441
more self-confident,

00:19:16.841 --> 00:19:20.870
more able to have skills
to compete in the marketplace

00:19:20.894 --> 00:19:23.566
so that they don't have
to blame the other,

00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:26.588
the other that they've never met.

00:19:27.758 --> 00:19:31.558
I'd like to just leave you
with one last thing before I go.

00:19:32.915 --> 00:19:36.438
Of all the people I've worked with,
they will all tell you the same thing.

00:19:36.462 --> 00:19:40.054
One, they became extremists

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:43.912
because they wanted to belong,
not because of ideology or dogma.

00:19:44.787 --> 00:19:47.415
And second, what brought them out

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.192
was receiving compassion

00:19:50.216 --> 00:19:52.559
from the people
they least deserved it from,

00:19:53.247 --> 00:19:54.900
when they least deserved it.

00:19:54.924 --> 00:19:57.021
(Applause)

00:19:57.045 --> 00:19:59.355
So I would like
to leave you with a challenge:

00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:03.307
go out there today, tomorrow --
hopefully every day --

00:20:04.052 --> 00:20:08.724
find somebody that you think
is undeserving of your compassion

00:20:08.748 --> 00:20:09.932
and give it to them,

00:20:10.694 --> 00:20:12.083
because I guarantee you,

00:20:12.107 --> 00:20:14.015
they're the ones who need it the most.

00:20:14.554 --> 00:20:15.866
Thank you very much.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.853
(Applause)
