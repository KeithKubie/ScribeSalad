00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
thinking like the big action scene with
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
thinking like the big action scene with
you<00:01:13.710><c> know</c><00:01:13.860><c> the</c><00:01:14.010><c> trucks</c><00:01:14.310><c> and</c><00:01:14.520><c> everything</c><00:01:15.000><c> and</c>

you know the trucks and everything and
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.090 align:start position:0%
you know the trucks and everything and
I'm<00:01:15.330><c> thinking</c><00:01:15.720><c> that</c><00:01:15.960><c> was</c><00:01:16.110><c> the</c><00:01:16.259><c> best</c><00:01:16.500><c> thing</c><00:01:16.830><c> in</c>

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that was the best thing in
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that was the best thing in
the<00:01:17.310><c> movie</c><00:01:17.430><c> yes</c>

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.490 align:start position:0%
 
yeah<00:01:21.150><c> it's</c><00:01:21.299><c> twice</c><00:01:21.780><c> that</c><00:01:22.200><c> uh</c><00:01:22.799><c> I</c><00:01:23.369><c> mean</c><00:01:23.670><c> I</c><00:01:23.820><c> I</c><00:01:24.500><c> guess</c>

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
yeah it's twice that uh I mean I I guess
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.289 align:start position:0%
yeah it's twice that uh I mean I I guess
this<00:01:25.710><c> isn't</c><00:01:25.860><c> technically</c><00:01:26.280><c> MCU</c><00:01:26.880><c> but</c><00:01:27.060><c> it's</c><00:01:27.210><c> a</c>

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
this isn't technically MCU but it's a
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719 align:start position:0%

because of that sort of keeping their

because of that sort of keeping their

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:40.170 align:start position:0%
connection minimal makes sense at the

think<00:14:08.160><c> if</c><00:14:08.280><c> you</c><00:14:08.400><c> approach</c><00:14:08.700><c> it</c><00:14:08.760><c> more</c><00:14:09.390><c> as</c><00:14:09.600><c> a</c><00:14:09.630><c> dark</c>

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
think if you approach it more as a dark
 

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.530 align:start position:0%
think if you approach it more as a dark
comedy<00:14:10.650><c> yeah</c><00:14:11.550><c> it's</c><00:14:11.730><c> kind</c><00:14:11.940><c> of</c><00:14:11.970><c> so</c><00:14:12.090><c> people</c><00:14:12.330><c> have</c>

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
