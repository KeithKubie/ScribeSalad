00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.660
Earlier, we found that
when there are two terms,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.400
addition follows
the commutative property.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.980
But, what about when
there are three terms?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.060
What if Katy bought two cameras
from an electronics store and

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.240
then ordered five cameras from
an electronics website, and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.310
then ordered three more cameras
from a different website?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.460
We can use parentheses to
group Katy's online purchases.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.200
So, Katy bought two cameras in person
and then 5 + 3 cameras online.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.060
Is that different than if Katy purchases
two cameras at an electronics store

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.440
five at an electronics wholesaler and
three online?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.010
Here, I'm going to use
parentheses to group

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
the cameras that Katie
purchased in person.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.750
True or false, 2 + 5 + 3 is
the same thing as 2 + 5 + 3?
