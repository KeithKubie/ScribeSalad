00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
got a pack of cards, I'll give you a quick look through them

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.360
you can see, they're kind of just in random order there

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.280
but this trick is about shuffling anyway

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.560
so we're gonna try to make them even more of a random order

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.700
and I'm not even gonna shuffle them, you're gonna shuffle them.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.720
What I'm gonna ask you to do in a second

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.240
is deal out onto the table, as many as you like

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.440
let's try and make it roughly half, so between twenty and fourty

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.420
although it deosn't matter, and then you're gonna riffle shuffle the together

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.080
BRADY: Now this is me doing it for real everyone

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.400
JASON: There's your cards so you can deal

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.380
BRADY: Deal like this, like...

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.060
JASON: Yea, just deal that onto the table, as many as you like

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.000
BRADY: **counts mumbling**

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.180
twenty-two, tewnty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.860
JASON: so they sell it...

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.500
BRADY: tewnty-eight!  twenty-eight!

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.460
JASON: twenty-eight? okay, and I'll just order the up for you, so... ,  nice

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.740
and then you're gonna riffle shuffle those together

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.760
BRADY: hang on...

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.020
JASON: it's important to show you, Brady didn't do a perfect shuffle

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.180
even after all this practise youve been having and you've been telling me about.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.020
So I'm gonna shuffle them in. Happy?

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.820
BRADY: Yep.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.700
JASON: in they go

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.700
would't it be weird if, after the random number of cards you counted

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.200
after the riffle shuffle you did, you actually shuffeled them back into order

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.240
wouldn't that be strange?

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.640
ah, this is not quite where -

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.260
I mean you got two red, two balcks, I mean it doesn't...

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.780
look like you actually have, Brady, does it?

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.960
BRADY: No, they are not in order

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.220
JASON: mhh, not at all, except for unless...

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.400
unless I could maybe convince you, that actually, you did

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.980
shuffle them into order

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.600
'cos actuallly what you did, without realizing...

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.820
you shuffled it every two cards - every pair of cards, has one of each colour

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.260
the first two is a red and a black, the next two - red and a black

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.520
read and a black, every two cards...

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.800
has one of each colour, all the way through,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.680
even if there's points , where there's a double red together, if we deal the off in twos...

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.460
strangely, each pair of two...

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.020
has one of each color, which, surely, you'd agree,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.140
that's quite improbable

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.120
BRADY: Amazing!

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.780
JASON: But it get's much more

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.840
interesting than that because wouldn't it be
strange if every four cards had one of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.660
each suit

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.100
there's a heart, a club, a spade, a diamond there.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.280
the next
four cards

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.340
is a heart, club spade, diamond

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.940
even though they're in a different order
they're still definitely one of each

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.250
suit again a different order every four
cards to different order but it's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.980
definitely one of a series four strains
and maybe you are better suffering then

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.030
he sought is quite impressive but you
know well Brady Joey done even better

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.760
than that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:34.239
you shuffled its every 13 cars as one of
each value 123456789 10 11 12 13 have a

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:44.180
checkered restarting is definitely one
of each value NACE 23456789 10 Jack

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.959
Greene King's crazy 123456789 10 Jacques
Greene King one of each other again

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.070
isn't that strange again one of these
order and you'll notice it's weird

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.260
because the orders different in each set
of teen fantasy which he was allowed to

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.860
know some of the math behind there now
you can do to you can so that I K

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.600
rice I'm gonna show you the properties
of a permutation you go through when you

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.730
do that shuttle so the shuttle bay neat
deal out a certain number of cars and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.310
then you whistle shuttle amend it
doesn't matter if it's not partly what

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.950
properties does that permutation have to
demonstrate it i've

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.349
numbered the cars just with the natural
counting numbers 1 to 2 52 and we're

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.390
gonna do that subtle to these cars to
see what happens asserting was you dealt

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.840
out some cars again it doesn't matter
how many Delta I think I think he did

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.590
you did you did a surprising what's
important here is when you deal and how

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.870
you were in the order was a crucial
saying so those are the ones at the top

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:55.790
now it's going to be the bottom 23456 28
says your turn to rate cards when you

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.750
order reversed now we're gonna riffle
least two together and the only thing we

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.329
can guarantee that this card is going to
get settled in above this card above

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.980
this card and so on its okay shes gonna
get riffle together in a second when we

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.359
put these together we're going to get a
new string of numbers day where we put

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.239
it together we're going to get a new
string of numbers and we're gonna look

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.700
at the crucial properties always occur
in this permutation so the first thing I

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.940
want to try and convince you is that
when we pushed together if we take the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.650
first let's say 10 cards or 11 cause of
12 cause they will be a set of

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.380
consecutive numbers for example let's
say the first ones that I this first

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.180
again this time from this spot and this
one may be another 15 from this problem

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.300
maybe another one you can see what
happens whenever I add one to the bottom

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.060
of the policy shuttling together the one
I add is always going to be one smaller

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.310
than the small Escada house 001 bigger
than the biggest con how safe is here

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.130
I'm kind of counting down here and
counting now so I'm gonna be adding one

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.610
smaller than the smallest cause I have
641 bigger than the biggest card that

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.169
means that the cars I collect here we'll
all be consecutive just built and built

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.750
them up by taking one from one side or
the other side of this side the side so

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.510
obey consecutive string of No

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.290
others 36 27 28 29 30 so they are
consecutive even though the mixed up and

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.790
it didn't matter how many I take are
still get a string of consecutive

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.940
numbers even though that makes that day
as a guaranteed

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.710
and next thing I want to convince you of
is that the first K numbers will

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.730
different module ok to just in case we
don't know what modulo is modular is

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.960
essentially the remains you get when you
divide by the number so 605 is one that

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.860
has a remainder of 10 and 11 muslim
fighters also 125 is to go out to eat at

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.520
2525 and then we got the two alleged
look at will look at 54 now if you look

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.730
at the first five cards their
consecutive numbers and not in the right

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.700
order but these numbers are consecutive
we have five consecutive numbers is

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.750
actually a guaranteed that they'll be
all be different modulo 52 let me try to

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.520
explain that live there so I have
written out the first 16 counting

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.940
numbers and if I take the first five you
can see they're all different modulate

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:46.770
5/5 I get remained 2012 2-3 made it 4-0
and if I shifted up the next five

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:53.730
consecutive numbers of lost this July 15
game this one here they even have lost

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.210
his mother 1 I've gained this one city's
five consecutive numbers are still all

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.270
different level 85 and I could do it
again each time I shift up I lose this

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.630
modular five-game the equivalent value
at the top and you can keep on doing

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.340
that each time losing value but gaining
the equivalent modulo value at the top

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.220
so that means any five numbers will be
different if I actually any six numbers

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.290
will be different muslims 64 whatever
value we take and the sad fact that here

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.260
has taken out the first head of US
shuttle now we know that these numbers

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.280
are all different modulator if they're
all different modulo hair and then there

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.720
must be two of each value modulo five
can you see that here there's to

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:45.450
modulate 2721 Muslim 52 equipment to
2345 and so on so we got 10 numbers all

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:51.880
different on July 10 but two of each
module i-five says these five all

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.720
different module 05 and that means that
the next five also going to be different

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.560
Muslim thought and that if we continue
that on the next flight would be

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.100
different

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.350
slow fire and so on and so on continue
indefinitely

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.850
each SAT 05 has one of each value each
equivalent value modified that is all we

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.440
need to know about this trick because in
this trip we haven't actually use

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.180
numbers we've used as the values of
cards because these numbers starting

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.590
counselor they naturally cycle through
the different values each module a

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:29.840
separate set of 4 10 42301 mostly for
230 and so on

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.270
we can look at modulo 30 mins which
relate to the different values and so on

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.860
so to do this trick we need some of the
cars a cycle through the different

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.580
values just as the counting numbers
cycle through the different modalities

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:52.640
ok so maybe I can relate their clubs 21
months or maybe I can relate their

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.460
hearts to to mod for the spades

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:05.200
just three months for diamonds 2014 ok
so we know we're going to have a say

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.380
goes clubs hearts spades diamonds clubs
that space divers that also goes black

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.300
red light red light red so kind of
alternating modulo 2 as well and because

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.540
he wanted to do this thing with our use
of the cars the AC three kings we want a

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.850
system that cycles through the A three
kings and repeating cycle as well but

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:27.760
just having a 23456789 10 queen king
looks like it's an order parts or we do

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.140
we have us we have US tax system so it
looks mixed up but actually is a

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.150
repeating order to the very start when I
sobre the cars at first glance maybe a

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.560
look around them actually it was
completely or the completely set gonna

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.580
get them so they cycle through clouds
spades diamonds and also sell a cycle to

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.120
one of each value every searching cars
here is a pack of cars we got it

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.270
completely ordered

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.040
I'm going to use a very famous we're
stuck in the cards that uses a ride

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.820
eight kings threatened to save nine
ladies 416 knife I say why me

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:12.430
we're gonna go to website states that
eight kings the rat 310

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:33.510
say ladies 41 sick and we just do it
again but now we're starting the heart

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:50.560
we started reading the club now has
eight kings and to save nine ladies for

00:10:50.560 --> 00:11:06.680
10 days he's sick I've got two more 816
see not only cycles just how the county

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.640
number of cycles

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.750
even so different values modulate to
this also cyber see black red black red

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.260
black grey black red just how the
counting numbers cycle through different

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.459
values modulate for space Diners Club
cards spades diamonds club hearts based

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:26.860
on his by the way the distance you to
use is chased see the club's 80 hearts

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:32.270
and then you can see just how the
counting numbers cycle three different

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.850
values modulate team we saw those two
different certain possible values of a

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:43.839
car's eight kings 310 2795 queen for a
six shot and then you can just start the

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:49.149
trek but I you can actually I just want
more convinced to do you can say is a

00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:55.709
pack of cars all different cards and you
can let them give them a cuts you can

00:11:55.709 --> 00:12:00.750
say to them I wanna I wanna let you
start the packet and ecology likes you

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.140
can cut the park anywhere any way you
like and then they can start from that

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.199
and I'll be fine because it was still
cycle through the different values in

00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:14.500
order and the different suits in order
and read like where you can start with a

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.470
cut if you like

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:20.380
even more convincing this number further

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:35.350
magic why not try Jonathan strange and
Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke it's a

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.600
great alternative history tale about
