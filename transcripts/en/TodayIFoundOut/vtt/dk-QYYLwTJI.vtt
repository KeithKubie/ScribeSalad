00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.379
Why the Adam’s Apple is Called the Adam’s
Apple

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.950
The origins of this term go all the way back
to the Biblical event where Eve gave Adam

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.230
a forbidden fruit, which is commonly misrepresented
as an apple.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.689
The term then basically comes from the legend
that when he ate of the “apple”, the piece

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.009
got stuck in his throat and made a lump.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.669
Now, of course, according to the Bible story,
it wasn’t an apple Adam and Eve ate of,

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.010
it was a fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge
of Good and Evil, of which there was apparently

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.010
only one.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.190
Besides the obvious fact that I don’t know
anyone who’s felt particularly more knowledgeable

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.770
in the ways of good and evil when they ate
an apple, an apple tree is not self pollinating;

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.100
so you’d need more than one to have it produce
more of itself, which pretty firmly kills

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.200
the whole “apple tree” theory.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.010
To make the origins of the term even more
ridiculous, even if it was an apple and it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.900
got stuck in his throat, his children wouldn’t
somehow miraculously also have apples stuck

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.150
in their throats.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.480
This is about as absurd as the age old “Well
if Adam had a rib taken out to make Eve, why

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.090
aren’t men missing a rib?”

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.969
Or the equally ludicrous corresponding claim
by many that men are somehow missing a rib.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.689
Both sides of the argument seem to have suspended
all logic while arguing over this triviality.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.590
The real irony here is the “rib” translation
was actually a mistranslation.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.030
For more on that, see the Bonus Factoids.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.090
So this all begs the question, why do most
people think the Bible says Adam and Eve ate

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.149
an apple to get them tossed out of the Garden
of Eden?

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.770
Why not an orange or a peach or why not just
call it like it is stated in the Bible story?

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.219
Well, Aquila Ponticus, who was a second century
translator translating the Old Testament from

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.159
Hebrew to Greek, took the liberty of translating
it as an apple tree, even though the original

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.760
text doesn’t say that.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.509
It’s likely that he chose this due to the
fact that he was translating it into Greek

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:21.500
for Greeks and that in Greek mythology apples
were seen as symbols of desire 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.639
and destruction.
