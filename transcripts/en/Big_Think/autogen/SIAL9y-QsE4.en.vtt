00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
the capacity or no that the the tendency
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.830
the capacity or no that the the tendency
to accept evolutionary theory is of

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840
to accept evolutionary theory is of
 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.370
to accept evolutionary theory is of
course not just judged on the merits of

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
course not just judged on the merits of
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.140
course not just judged on the merits of
evolutionary theory it's judged because

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
evolutionary theory it's judged because
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.620
evolutionary theory it's judged because
it is seen as being in opposition to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
it is seen as being in opposition to
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.769
it is seen as being in opposition to
religious belief and religious belief

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
religious belief and religious belief
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.829
religious belief and religious belief
carries with it not just the belief

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:30.839
carries with it not just the belief
 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.869
carries with it not just the belief
itself in a particular set of facts and

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879
itself in a particular set of facts and
 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.660
itself in a particular set of facts and
ideas but all of the huge social and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
ideas but all of the huge social and
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.970
ideas but all of the huge social and
political I associations so in in the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
political I associations so in in the
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.650
political I associations so in in the
United States if you don't believe in

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
United States if you don't believe in
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.930
United States if you don't believe in
evolutionary theory or if you do believe

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
evolutionary theory or if you do believe
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.669
evolutionary theory or if you do believe
in evolutionary theory then it means

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679
in evolutionary theory then it means
 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.290
in evolutionary theory then it means
it's harder for you to commit yourself

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
it's harder for you to commit yourself
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.090
it's harder for you to commit yourself
to a religious group that has huge

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
to a religious group that has huge
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.939
to a religious group that has huge
significance and so I think the answer

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
significance and so I think the answer
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.229
significance and so I think the answer
to why it is that evolutionary theory is

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239
to why it is that evolutionary theory is
 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.579
to why it is that evolutionary theory is
difficult for people in the States to

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589
difficult for people in the States to
 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.530
difficult for people in the States to
believe is that religious systems are so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
believe is that religious systems are so
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.290
believe is that religious systems are so
incredibly prevalent and why is that I

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300
incredibly prevalent and why is that I
 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.300
incredibly prevalent and why is that I
guess I think it's something to do with

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
guess I think it's something to do with
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.540
guess I think it's something to do with
the United States being a rural country

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550
the United States being a rural country
 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.250
the United States being a rural country
and there's a lot of association between

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260
and there's a lot of association between
 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.870
and there's a lot of association between
rural living and the importance of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
rural living and the importance of
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.670
rural living and the importance of
religious systems you see it in the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
religious systems you see it in the
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.710
religious systems you see it in the
Middle East you see it in Iran I suspect

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
Middle East you see it in Iran I suspect
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.310
Middle East you see it in Iran I suspect
that as the world becomes more urbanized

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
that as the world becomes more urbanized
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350
that as the world becomes more urbanized
you know we've just passed the point

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
you know we've just passed the point
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.390
you know we've just passed the point
where 50% of the world's population live

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
where 50% of the world's population live
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.540
where 50% of the world's population live
in cities I think as this tendency

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550
in cities I think as this tendency
 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.930
in cities I think as this tendency
increases probably the importance of

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940
increases probably the importance of
 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.210
increases probably the importance of
religious belief systems will start

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
religious belief systems will start
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.280
religious belief systems will start
declining or will continue to decline

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
declining or will continue to decline
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.910
declining or will continue to decline
and that one of the consequences will be

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
and that one of the consequences will be
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950
and that one of the consequences will be
that there will be increasing

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
that there will be increasing
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.150
that there will be increasing
willingness to accept even those aspects

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160
willingness to accept even those aspects
 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.550
willingness to accept even those aspects
of science that challenge religious

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
of science that challenge religious
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.830
of science that challenge religious
belief
