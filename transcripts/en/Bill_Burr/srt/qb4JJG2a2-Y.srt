1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,790
Is this on? Is this all right? Here we
go. Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,060
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for gay Monday?

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,220
Yes.
October.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,520
What's Today the 28th 29th the 30th it's
going to be the 30th this is my first

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:21,190
live. Whenever I'm sitting
on, I'm at the very best.

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,430
Very metro sexual couch.
This looks like a lot of guys blue.

7
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,170
Other guys on this thing.
This is,

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,820
this is sort of the reverse w hotel.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,250
The way they have this
thing like the w hotel.

10
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:39,300
It just looks like everything's been just
on and that a bunch of Yolo Douche has

11
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:41,940
had a threesome.
There is something this looks like.

12
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,480
Is there like a gay chain of hotels
that just caters to gay people?

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,571
You don't see.

14
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:51,210
This is why this is going to be weird
with the live crowd because to me that was

15
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,600
no big deal. Everybody got
real quiet. They're like,
it's like that was a problem.

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,350
Is he trashing gay people or why is he
saying that there should be segregated

17
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:02,460
hotels? No, I am not. Okay.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,270
I'm just saying that it would be nice
if you could separate them from the

19
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:10,890
general population in the hotels.
Okay. That's what I'm running on.

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,160
I'm going to out hate Trump and fucking,

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,510
whenever the next stupid election is
going to be, I'm going to out hate him.

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm just going to start calling him a
pussy and I'm just going to fucking,

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,390
I'm going to hate even more than him.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,540
Then I'm going to get elected and then
I'll tear down whatever part of the wall

25
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,374
he made,

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,660
which I know is a hot button
issue here in Arizona. Oh yeah.

27
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,960
They should have the wall. Oh,
they should. They shouldn't. Um,

28
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,550
that's what I would run on a platform.

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,170
I would run on a platform that gay
people should have their own hotels.

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,490
I'm so sick of walking into lobby,
seeing men holding hands with other men,

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,740
and it just started off on
something bizarre like that,

32
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,600
just so I can watch my opponent going,
wait a minute,

33
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,720
I never even thought about hating this.
You know,

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,480
why won't Hillary Clinton go away?

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,410
Why can't you just understand
that nobody likes her?

36
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,990
She just fucking hanging around just
like that fucking kid who just shows up

37
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,360
like nobody tells her there's a party
and then she shows up. You know,

38
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,990
you know what happened with her and no
one ever poured blood on her in a fucking

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,160
prom. That's what they should have
done to finally fucking get rid of her.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,080
You know, she just keeps hanging
around like she's a winner. You know?

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,930
Did Jim Kelly hang around after losing
four fucking super bowls? He didn't.

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,880
He fucking disappeared.

43
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:40,740
And every once in a while in NFL crew
finds the fucking guy and goes, hey Jim,

44
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:44,430
let's talk about your career. Yeah, I
don't want it. I really don't want him.

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,170
I did have a great career, but all
you want to dwell on is the negative.

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,230
Oh my God. She says she's just, I mean she
tries to, you know, she's gonna fucking,

47
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,570
she's going to take volume.
You still can't hear it

48
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,170
louder. What? All right,

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,760
this was the dumbest for you guys
listening at home who can hear this?

50
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,600
Totally fine.

51
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,040
There's like 500 people staring
at me right now bitching
that they can't hear it.

52
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:17,020
So I'm holding a microphone with a yellow
windscreen and a little fucking lapel,

53
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,760
Mike. All right. As far as I can tell,
only the foreigners for some reason,

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,790
can't fucking hear me. Everybody
has some sort of Australian x six

55
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,720
fucking people. Foreign
is coming their way. Look,

56
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:34,420
the fuck did you come here for to
tell us how fucked up our country is.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,750
I love when people come here and they can,

58
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,980
they start bitching about this
country. It's just like, dude,

59
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:40,630
I don't do that when I go to Australia.

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,550
Talking about how fucked up your
country is that only around the edges?

61
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:49,360
Is it livable?
It's fucking unbelievable.

62
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,900
If you can't see the ocean, you just
completely, you're in no man's land.

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,400
No Man's land. 200 the most
poisonous fucking snakes ever.

64
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,680
Do I say that when I go to Australia?
No, I don't. I just go, oh,

65
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,920
look at the surf. Oh my God. It's
gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful.

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,400
Look at that sad Tanguy
blowing into that giant horn.

67
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,550
I bet he used to own this view way back
in the day. He bet his ancestors did.

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,750
What is the, what is the call
on that? You know what I mean?

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,270
I never understand that. When I was
in fucking Canada, the rule was they,

70
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,560
what did they say? Like I ice, I
called them the, uh, the natives,

71
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,010
the natives of, of Canada, and they
got all fucking offended. They said,

72
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:36,640
we're called the originals,
the original everything with Canada's,

73
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,390
the original six, the original
people, you know what I mean?

74
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,230
The original recipe of whatever fucking
syrup they're trying to sell you.

75
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,150
You know what I mean? John?
Everybody loves Canada.

76
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:51,800
Like they're a bunch of friendly people.
They're not,

77
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:56,801
they're all a bunch of fucking racist
sticky people and they're in a bad mood

78
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:00,500
from gag in that SAP out of the fucking
trees. And then what do they do?

79
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:04,160
They kick all the indigenous people
all the way up north, you know,

80
00:05:04,161 --> 00:05:07,460
to give him a perimeter between them and
the polar bears. That's what happened.

81
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,870
You know, you ever see any of these
big Hollywood types talking about them?

82
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:16,100
Meryl Streep, you know,
I dunno, I picked her.

83
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,410
I'm still pissed at her that she said
the martial arts are not the arts.

84
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,680
Oh really? What would you
know about that? Oh, I get it.

85
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:25,560
You wear a wig and you pretend to
be other people. Like by all means,

86
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,480
let me listen to you about social issues.

87
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,220
You get your fucking Goddamn car
to go back to your gated community.

88
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,580
When does she ever see minorities?
Huh?

89
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,090
When she looks into the front
seat of whoever's driving

90
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:43,730
[inaudible]

91
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,050
by all means Merrill.
Tell me,

92
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,670
tell me what society is like
from behind your gated community.

93
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,950
Um, somebody told me today
that it's, it's there,

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,020
this legislation right now going through.
I don't,

95
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,360
where does it go through the government?
Um,

96
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,410
right now I'm thinking of schoolhouse
rock songs, right? I'm just a bill. Yes.

97
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,850
I'm only a bill

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,750
[inaudible] off to the White House where
there's something something and then it

99
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:19,751
comes back to a bunch of white men and
they vote to see if it will be a low,

100
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,100
um, how I hope and pray. Normally
I wouldn't sing in public,

101
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,390
but I feel like I'm in my bedroom.

102
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,610
I have plush furniture
like this in my bedroom.

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,950
Looking at one with the fucking overhang.
Sorry to this go out again with the,

104
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:38,660
sorry, sorry. I'm sorry to each and every
one of you, especially the millennials.

105
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm sure you're fucking heard about it
and you're going to Hashtag some sort of

106
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:45,410
me too. Me Too. I couldn't hear either.

107
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,040
Meet to meet too.
I also had something bad happen.

108
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,320
Hey, here's something you
can say in this country.

109
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:59,321
Three fucking meals a day may to
May to first world country me,

110
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,030
Joe, flat screen TV, Mito,

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,400
everybody dwelling on the
negative is fucking feminist, man.

112
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,460
I swear to God I want to go to one of
their events and just get up to that

113
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,950
microphone and just be
like, excuse me, can I,

114
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,010
is there anything good about being a
woman at any point during your day?

115
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,420
Are you like, thank God I'm a woman? All
right. What to add to step in that muddy,

116
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,730
that mud puddle.
Whatever the fuck I'm supposed to do.

117
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm supposed to take my
fucking coat off, you know? Oh,

118
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,120
a little more respect for these feminists
when they care a little bit more about

119
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,890
guys, jackets, you know,

120
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,050
it's always a fucking issue
that they care about. You know

121
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:42,950
it.

122
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,950
In the 70s we were forced to wear clogs
and a lot of our mothers blew out their

123
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:50,030
ACO,
so gives a shit.

124
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,400
I'll listen to a feminist,
but not if she's white. You
know what I mean? It's like,

125
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,650
you know, I won't. Okay.
At the end of the day,

126
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,000
you were a white woman in
the United States of America.
What is the problem? Huh?

127
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,850
Did someone take away your
rosy for the afternoon?

128
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,920
Did they shut down the fucking
trolley down at the mall? What?

129
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:14,730
What is happening in your world?
No, seriously. All right. Look,

130
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:17,040
if you live in some honey
booboo lifestyle, right?

131
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:21,900
You're living off the
appellation. Somebody got
rickets in Lyme disease, right?

132
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,050
Husband never wear a shirt.
You know what I mean?

133
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,340
It is. Where's that long underwear
with the trap drawer behind the back.

134
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,180
You know what I mean? You know he's going
out when he puts on his best overalls.

135
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,830
Right? Those guys have it right.
Those guys know how to live out there.

136
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,920
If you truly want to get along with the
woman you've got to live on right off

137
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,090
the Appalachian trail,

138
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:53,150
you know you gotta be off the grid and
you just have to have no television. Okay.

139
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,180
And then you can slap her around all
you want and she's never going to know.

140
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,490
This is just how it is.

141
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,263
Okay.

142
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,330
You know what I mean? If you have a
dirt floor, like taking a beating,

143
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:09,510
it's not the big, it just seems like
part of your life. It's like seamless.

144
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,060
Where's the you could we ever did for

145
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,110
women as linoleum and like wall to wall
carpet. Then we lost all of our power.

146
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,930
Yeah, you've seen it. When
Twitter first came out,

147
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:27,360
women were just hashtagging
whatever you say and

148
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,430
no, somebody going to take a snippet of
that and put it on a fucking new show and

149
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:38,450
then I'm going to get in trouble.

150
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:42,770
Are you trying to say that women
deserve to be beaten on dirt floors?

151
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,650
And at that point you just gotta
go with it. Just be like, yes,

152
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,610
and I'm running for
president and fucking 20, 20.

153
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,910
It don't even get me started
with the gays in the hotels.

154
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,350
That's right. You run the most
hateful fucking campaign Ebert.

155
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,240
You don't wear the confederate flag, but
all of your suits, if you look quickly,

156
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,530
you have all the colors of it.
Alright.

157
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,660
And then in the end you just
totally flipped the whole thing.

158
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,270
You flipped the whole thing.

159
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,550
You have an openly gay guy is a fucking,
uh,

160
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,180
like sit-com level gay, you know what I
mean? Not like real gay, like TV, gay,

161
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,253
you know what I mean?

162
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,540
TV, gay. It's kind of like
when you watch wrestling,

163
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,840
how they enhanced their personalities.
That's what they do with good

164
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,260
gay people on TV. They got to just go
fucking through the roof with the SAS.

165
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,550
You know what I mean? Rather than just
having it coming out. Surprisingly,

166
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:47,270
every once in awhile, um, I don't know
what I'm talking about. It feels like,

167
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,270
what does this feel? And they
come along. If I'm a donor up you,

168
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,720
oh 10 minutes and 48 seconds.
There you go.

169
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,410
This is my world. This is my life.
This is what I do. This couch is not,

170
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,780
this couch is, feels like it
was made out of old coats. Look,

171
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,740
a couple of old tarps or some shit like
that. I hate, I was trying to be plush.

172
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,170
This was considered like right here.

173
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:13,460
This was considered fancy in the 70s if
I could just get this lapel Mike up here.

174
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:14,294
This,
this,

175
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,950
anytime there was a button that was sunk
all the way in it to try and make this

176
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:19,784
look plush.

177
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,450
You know even though it feels like
fucking week old bread that you lay in on.

178
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,673
Yeah,

179
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,420
honey. All I want is that legally.
This is what I literally have to do.

180
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,190
I have to fucking put the mic down here.

181
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,670
It just won't clip on in any fucking area.

182
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,430
That is acceptable.

183
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:41,600
Now the people at home can't hear
probably cause I clipped it onto the,

184
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,730
this was like the biggest lapel
ever. There we go. Jesus still going.

185
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,350
Got a bumblebee thought is supposed to
be like barely noticeable, isn't it? Um,

186
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,760
all right. You know what? I don't give
a fuck. Let's, let's read about some,

187
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:56,200
let's up some Phoenix news here.
Phoenix News, Ladies and gentlemen.

188
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,270
Let's see what's going on

189
00:11:59,690 --> 00:11:59,790
and

190
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,830
greater Phoenix. You know what,
this shows reminding me up.

191
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:07,490
Do you guys remember when cheers went
off the air and Jay Leno tried to do it

192
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:10,850
live and the whole cast got shit faced.
Do you remember that?

193
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,240
And he had nobody to talk to.
Fuck it.

194
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:19,050
We'll do it live. All right, let's
look up Phoenix News. All right,

195
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:22,680
what do we got here?
All right. Update woman.

196
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:26,850
Critically injured in West Phoenix.
Shooting has died.

197
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,900
Uh, let's see. A woman shot killed
in Phoenix early Saturday morning.

198
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
Standard that standard.
Okay.

199
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,220
Homeless man beat cvs worker for sunblock.

200
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,133
That's a new one.

201
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,080
Suspect is designed,

202
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,560
is described as looking like
if Che Guevara fucked a lizard.

203
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,783
No.

204
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,690
Phoenix police arrest. Suspected deadly
shooting. What is going on out here?

205
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,880
Stolen truck from Phoenix.
Captured on speeding hot.

206
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:12,100
Why don't they have anything nice.

207
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,300
Phoenix wedding invitation
designers must serve. L, G,

208
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:20,650
B T oh Arizona. Here we go.

209
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:23,500
They don't like mark and Luke Martin
Luther King. They don't like the gays.

210
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:28,210
All Jay Jay's, oh the goddamn
gays. What are they gonna do?

211
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,920
They're going to walk around
and enjoy themselves. Good.

212
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:36,840
Back in the house where God wants you.
Phoenix woman,

213
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:40,920
21 accused of abusing three year old boy.

214
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,970
See ladies, it goes both
ways. Women also beat men.

215
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,170
Let's read that one. This
is always uplifting, Huh?

216
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,250
I don't know why this, there it is.
Alright, there we go. Okay. Phoenix woman,

217
00:13:58,251 --> 00:14:01,880
21 accused of abusing a three
year old boy. All right.

218
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,580
My first question is a juror would
be like, well what did the kid do?

219
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,280
You know what I mean? Can the kid
walk? Is it big enough to make a fist?

220
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,720
You know what I mean?
There's no excuse to hit a woman.

221
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,750
So if this kid was punching on her,
you know,

222
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,700
cause it wanted to
breastfeed or some shit,

223
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,170
then I think she had every right to just
pick him up by his osh gosh bikash's or

224
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:27,320
whatever.
Push them right off that plastic party.

225
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,650
A Phoenix woman who's been,
who has,

226
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,320
who had been reported
missing earlier this month,

227
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,190
along with the three year old boy now
faces child abuse charges in a case.

228
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,590
Court documents says,
I'm not gonna say her name,

229
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,410
but I swear to got her first
name. Looks like Tequila. Uh,

230
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,720
21 was arrested Thursday on suspicion of
one count of child abuse in connection

231
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:52,610
with injuries to the toddler.
Oh, shake it off. Investigation

232
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,600
set in a court dog.

233
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,090
I'm just to see how far into the
beating of a child I could go.

234
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,710
Just how quiet this crowd's going to get.

235
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,123
Yeah.

236
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,170
Uh,
the child was beaten on its birthday

237
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,670
because it wasn't happy with the cake.

238
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,110
The suspect said, well, if
you didn't like the cake,

239
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:16,750
you're surely not going to like
this lit candle. All right,

240
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,060
I'm not reading the rest of this.
I'm not reading the rest of this.

241
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:22,390
This is too sad.
I don't know what is wrong.

242
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,760
I take this back. This is fun making
you guys fucking really uncomfortable.

243
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:32,020
I'm enjoying the shit out of this.

244
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,270
Let's read some more sad news in Phoenix.
Let's see how far down we can.

245
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,330
By the way, you can feel the downtown
area. It's about ready to blow up.

246
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,070
I'm telling you, you got a great food
area down the street. You got, uh,

247
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,920
you got an arena is a cvs. Come on man.

248
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,880
I can feel it. I sensed this in
Cleveland and it turned around.

249
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:57,580
I knew it was going to happen in Detroit.
And who's kidding?

250
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,720
Who Phoenix is the Detroit
of the southwest. It is.

251
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,390
You just never had a riot because you
don't let African Americans in your state.

252
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,830
That's what, yes, that's what
it is. Who Says No to a day off?

253
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,480
You guys ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

254
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,713
Yeah.

255
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,430
All right. What else? Okay. Local
headlines. This is, look, I'll,

256
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,330
I'll end it with this here. I don't want
to shit on you guys too much. All right.

257
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,750
Uh, valley traffic closures.
That's not exciting. Uh,

258
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,760
thank you for backing that
up, man. No, it isn't.

259
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,960
I did not pay money to come out and
listen to you to do the traffic report.

260
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,420
I can listen to it on my am radio.
Thank you very much.

261
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,790
County offers free dog adoptions to ease
the crowding. All right, let's talk. Okay,

262
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,290
we already got to fucking beat up kid.

263
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,270
Let's talk about abused animals or not.
There is my dog.

264
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,480
Where in there? No,

265
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:58,590
my dog lives in a house out here that
I bought for it. So go fuck yourself.

266
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,910
What was happening is the amount of money
that I was spending to board the dog

267
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,450
was less than a mortgage out here.
So I said fuck it.

268
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,570
And I set up like a Hugh Hefner lease

269
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,640
with my trainer. It's like, all right, as
long as the dog's alive, you live here,

270
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:21,270
rent free and you take care of it.
And I come out and visit whenever I want.

271
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,490
He's like, cool. I go when the dog dies,

272
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,300
uh then you know you either buy the house
so you believe it. You start renting.

273
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,170
He was like,
cool.

274
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,170
So you know damn well that dog's
getting fucking sirloin every night.

275
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,770
It's clear the dog's name is Cleo and
she barely remembers me now cause she's

276
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:43,310
getting treated so well.
Fucking house is nicer than my one in La.

277
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,220
Um, so there you go, Mr. Guilt trip over
there. Now let's talk. Let's talk about

278
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,210
this shit over here.

279
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,230
Let's talk about what you
guys do to dogs in this state.

280
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:59,610
What is with this fucking
advertising. Yeah. Am I on Netflix?

281
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,513
What happened?

282
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,053
Huh?

283
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,870
Coca Cola. We are so much
more than Cola. Yeah,

284
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,820
you're fucking gum disease.
Where's Nia?

285
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,100
She's right backstage.
She'll be out in a minute.

286
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,650
I'm fucking with you. She's at home
taking care of our child. Ah Huh.

287
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,350
Ah Huh. Not going to happen.
It's not going to happen sir.

288
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:30,080
Just like your dreams,
that is not going to happen.

289
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,410
Your dreams won't come true
in Nia is not coming out here.

290
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,400
Anybody watching that Texas
tech, Oklahoma Game. Jesus.

291
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:46,260
It was like no fucking defense
in that man. None whatsoever. Um,

292
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,710
by the way, thank you to everybody here.
Thank you. Thank you to everybody here.

293
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,700
That is, that has come out to the
all things comedy podcast network,

294
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,900
our first ever podcast festival.

295
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:01,740
It's been a smashing success. Did you
guys see when you walked in? We had the,

296
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,900
we had caddy shack playing outside.

297
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,820
You can play that a corn hole fucking
game. You can drink a bunch of beers.

298
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:11,790
This is what it's all about. It's all
about hanging out, getting fucked up,

299
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,940
listening to morons who don't
know how to read, do podcast.

300
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,830
That's what this entire thing
is all about. All right.
What do you guy, all right,

301
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,560
you still are about those fucking
Houston Astros going up two to one,

302
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,820
two to one against the La Dodgers.
I don't know who to root for in this one.

303
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,300
Cause you know I live in Los Angeles,
you know,

304
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,670
I know Houston just had that
hurricane, but it's over, right?

305
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,780
Everything dried up.

306
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,750
Those fans look all happy and dry when
you watch the gay me almost almost to the

307
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:44,670
point I was just go look
how nice this looks.

308
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:48,510
What was all the fucking
complaining about? Jesus Christ.

309
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:52,530
It rains a little bit and everybody out
in Houston starts losing their fucking

310
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:56,760
minds. You know? Do you think one of
them has ever sent a postcard to Seattle?

311
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,030
Those poor people sit in rain for
like 360 days out of the fucking year.

312
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:07,620
I will guarantee you not a fucking peep.
Not a peep from Houston,

313
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,230
Houston, Jesus. What is shady
city? That is, Huh? NASA.

314
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,980
How many people down there do you think?
I bet that whole fucking Houston,

315
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,440
that whole fucking hurricane.
I bet it didn't even happen.

316
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,140
I bet they just let some damn water go
down there when it was all only excuse to

317
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,690
kill the last few people alive that,
that were part of the,

318
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:31,620
the fake lunar landing
reenactment at NASA.

319
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,750
So they got rid of them

320
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,340
and uh,
what

321
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,420
else goes on in Houston?

322
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:41,570
They got the clan right outside
there that drags people to death,

323
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,830
which I'm suppliers didn't get an
applause break here in fucking Arizona.

324
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,023
MMM.

325
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,773
Yeah.

326
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,780
There was one other thing.
What the fuck was I talking about?

327
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,670
It was talking about no.
Then they got Halliburton.

328
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,930
Halliburton had changed their
fucking name. I know, I know. I know.

329
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,300
We're over there to fucking, what are
we doing over there? We're, we're,

330
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,530
we're concerned about their freedom.
We've got to get these Iraqis to be free.

331
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,880
Um, oh, I want it gets awkwardly silent
here. Um, oh, you know what I did at, Oh,

332
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,360
so anyways, I think I'm going
to be, I think I'm going to,

333
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm going to tell you right now why
the fucking Astros are going to win the

334
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:25,080
world series. Okay? I'm going to
tell you why it's going to happen.

335
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,850
It has nothing to do with baseball.

336
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:31,410
It has to do the fact with that Jason
Law head is rooting for the Dodgers.

337
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,890
He's here tonight. Jason, lie
ahead. Grew up in Cleveland.

338
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,230
All right. He's fucked. Okay. Like
the second you come out of the womb,

339
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:47,220
that curse of that city just in Gulf,
Tim and everywhere he goes,

340
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:52,020
he's like the mush and a a Bronx tale.
Just tear up your fucking tickets,

341
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:56,430
la. It's over. You're not
going to win another game. Um,

342
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,520
no, I have no idea. I'm actually
rooting that there's going to be a,

343
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,310
there's got to be seven games.
I hope it'll be seven games.

344
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:06,960
Give me something to do. Um, I don't know
that there's going to be seven games.

345
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:10,590
Do you know that there's going to be
seven games, sir? Does somebody know? Oh,

346
00:22:10,591 --> 00:22:12,630
because of the money.
You're thinks it's all about the money.

347
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,080
That's why it'll give. That's why
I don't give to charities anymore.

348
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,520
I'm done with fucking charities. I didn't
give one fucking dime to Houston. Okay.

349
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,870
Do you want to walk up to me w
up to your neck and water with a,

350
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:27,330
I live in Houston hat.
Then I'm going to give you money.

351
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:30,870
Yeah.

352
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,111
All right,

353
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:34,470
but I'm not giving to any of these
fucking things anymore cause that these

354
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:38,190
fucking organizations, they keep the,
I'm convinced that the most of them,

355
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,050
they just, they just keep the
fucking money. That's what's,

356
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:43,200
anytime you see a tragedy, just know that
there's a bunch of people going like,

357
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,180
I can make a bunch of fucking money
off of that Hashtag I care too. Right.

358
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,410
And then he'd give him $20 you feel like
you did your part. You know what I mean?

359
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,160
Like how much money would think Trump
collected before he went over there with

360
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:59,730
those bounty paper towels?
It just handed them out in Puerto Rico.

361
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,440
He must've made a fucking killing.
Yeah.

362
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,830
Probably spent the rest
on hair plugs and fucking,

363
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,850
I don't understand how he became a redhead
as he got older. I don't understand.

364
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:13,220
He had brown hair.
Six.

365
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,160
Somebody transitioning like I don't get
somebody like changes religions. Um,

366
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,160
not all of this is gonna
make sense? Everybody. Um,

367
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,830
you can still can't fucking hear me.
I don't know what to do.

368
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:29,590
Should I stick this in my fucking
mouth? Thank. Could you hear me

369
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,180
all right. How's that? Is
that good? Does this work?

370
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,840
Is this working for both of you?
Maybe if I clip this onto the,

371
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:41,320
onto the microphone. Um, Jesus Christ.
You know what this feels like right now.

372
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,930
This feels like when I was in summer
school and I was just staring at the

373
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:46,070
fucking clock,
like 23 minutes,

374
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,570
23 minutes.
Jesus Christ.

375
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,080
Why did I wear a sweatshirt
out here? Um, oh,

376
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:58,490
by the way, I gotta do I gotta do a
promotion? I got to do a promotion. I saw,

377
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:02,660
I went to a movie premiere,
uh, of the 30 for 30.

378
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,230
The nature boy,
ric flair is coming out.

379
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:08,980
Oh,

380
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,220
I have to tell you this right now.
Might be the best 30 for 30.

381
00:24:12,221 --> 00:24:14,560
I have a fucking saw.
Um,

382
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,360
it should be not it actually it
is 90 minutes. It is 90 minutes.

383
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:21,820
I thought it was only 30 minutes.
So it was 90 minutes, sir.

384
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,950
It wasn't your dream came true.
See that everybody,

385
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,880
I'm going to start a charity for this
guy and a portion of the proceeds are

386
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:35,140
going to go to towards him.

387
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,170
The rest of them are going to go
to me in a new fucking drum kit.

388
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,020
I'll put his picture
on the bass drum head.

389
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,740
Yeah.

390
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,450
Each day, thousands of people are
dying of cancer and I want a boat.

391
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,310
If you call this number,

392
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,750
we can put a slight dent in it and I can
get the boat of my fucking dreams and

393
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:04,560
finally get rid of my wife and start
living openly with my mistress.

394
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,140
Please take the number down.
The first 300 people that call in,

395
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,260
we'll get a free tee shirt with a
donation of over three times the cost to

396
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:16,590
produce this tee shirt.

397
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,600
No one will check to see if the
t shirts were actually sent out.

398
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,220
That's the move people,
these two fucking,

399
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,320
this three moves to making
this country at this point.

400
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:29,850
If you want to exist in the future one,

401
00:25:29,851 --> 00:25:34,500
you either grow weed in anticipation
that it becomes legal at a federal level

402
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,060
and he can get it out of
your fucking state. Cause I
know when Colorado, they're,

403
00:25:39,061 --> 00:25:43,230
I guess they're drowning in the shit.
They got more weed than they got hippies.

404
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,800
They got more,
oh my God,

405
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,300
I got to tell you that the dirtiest look
and white people you're ever going to

406
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,140
see in your life

407
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,650
or in Colorado,

408
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,660
I can't imagine being a
minority in Colorado looking
at the white people there.

409
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,930
You gotta be thinking like, how the fuck
are we working for these people? How?

410
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,520
How are these people
running? Shit. I mean,

411
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:14,140
everybody just looks like they
fell into a vat of Po Chuli. Right.

412
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,140
You know, they're always inner tubing
and shit. They just live outside.

413
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,670
They're just, I don't know that that's
like in the Denver area, you know?

414
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:28,000
Then you get out in the western part of
the states and then then it gets better.

415
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,710
You know, you got the Illuminati is in
the rocky mountains, you know what I mean?

416
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,950
They make sure it stays
nice and cold up there.

417
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:39,880
So the body of their first wife never, it
never melts away. You know what I mean?

418
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:40,714
That's where they keep doing.

419
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,110
That's the code word. W you're going
skiing with your third wife today? Yeah,

420
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,170
but going on the double black diamond,
that's code for,

421
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:51,270
I'm going to fucking steer or into a tree.

422
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,920
Wow.

423
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,640
You know,

424
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,550
that's what's going to happen when global
warming really hits and all the snow

425
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,530
melts up in fucking aspen and Vail.

426
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,500
The amount of dead women that
are going to be underneath there,

427
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,260
the amount of first wives,

428
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,270
the before I made my first million love.
You know what I mean?

429
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,570
When I was at the college level,
before I went pro, you know,

430
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,000
I dunno. Sometimes I think you ought to
be able to kill your first wife though

431
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:20,740
because

432
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,550
there's like too many people on the planet
and then also can maybe like put them

433
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:26,410
on their heels.
That's saying you do it,

434
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,770
but just the fact that she
would know it was okay.

435
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,530
I think from where I sit would
have a really positive effect

436
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,230
on the relationship. I think the reality
television viewing would go down,

437
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,633
mmm,

438
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,700
I should do these more because with you
guys laughing, I won't get in trouble.

439
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,860
You know what I mean? It's when I'm
by myself and there's dead silence.

440
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:58,860
It stops sounding like a fucking around
and it sounds more like is this guy

441
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,390
reading from his own manifesto?

442
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,170
Yeah. The [inaudible] come up with
creative ways to get rid of people.

443
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:12,340
I guess the optimal number,

444
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:15,220
according to something that somebody
sent me is 500 million people on this

445
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:19,210
planet and we're up to 6.5 billion.
So I think that there's,

446
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,560
there's things that you could do,

447
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:26,200
like a stop rescuing pit bulls.
You should just set them free

448
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,390
and let them wander the streets in packs.

449
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,080
And then everybody has a cyanide pill,
you know, so if you get, you know,

450
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,450
if he wants to be ripped
apart by a pack of wild dogs,

451
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:46,860
you can just eat it every once in a
while. Or maybe you do that like, I dunno,

452
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,280
like there's some sort of incentive
for your family if you off yourself.

453
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,033
You know what I mean?

454
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,290
And I figure if you offer yourself
that's an even better way.

455
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,200
Cause then they can like prepare rather
than just have a bunch of carcasses on

456
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:03,720
the side of the road that'll
cause diseases, which is good.

457
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,380
But after a certain point, you'd
be, once we get under 500 million,

458
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,670
now you just killing the chosen
once the blue chips. Right.

459
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,600
They should have like an NFL combine
to find, you know, you gotta get your,

460
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,430
like every country has to get their roster
down to what? Down to a number. Right?

461
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,860
Like you're allowed to
have 100,000 people.

462
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,840
You're not allowed to judge
it by race, religion, sex,
or anything like that. Right.

463
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,790
And you just have the
best of the best of race,

464
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:39,240
sex, religion, all of that fucking
shit that we care about. Right.

465
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,040
You just have that cruise

466
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,840
ships now. No cruise ships.
That's not gonna work.

467
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,730
Cause that's also an
environmental disaster. I, I,

468
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,770
I regret doing that bit
on my last special. Yeah.

469
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,600
I never thought of all the oil
that was going to be seeping there.

470
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,660
So my new one is that you just let
him pull into port and then you just,

471
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:00,230
you just mowed them all down.

472
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,140
They die happy with his silly
hats in their flip flops.

473
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,273
MMM.

474
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,040
I know. None of that's right.
This is insane. A time like this.

475
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:26,160
Don't you think this
should be more caring?

476
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,800
Somebody told me today that they're
actually selling land on Mars.

477
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,990
Can I somehow get in on that?
Can I,

478
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:36,600
I'll sell you the whole
fucking planet for 15 grant.

479
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,770
You can get out there and figure
out there's no atmosphere,

480
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,720
then you're going to die. Oh, it's a
shame. I mean, it's there. You can see it.

481
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,310
Look right through the telescope.
I sold you that.

482
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,830
If you can get there and breathe,
it's going to be all yours.

483
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,660
It's going to be all yours.

484
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,363
MMM.

485
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,290
That's the way you know
something right there.

486
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,060
That'd be the first way of
how you get rid of people.

487
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,860
You Sell Land on Mars in anybody that
goes to buy it. You Go, okay, you won.

488
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,100
You got a a bit, a little bit of
land come down here to claim it,

489
00:31:13,101 --> 00:31:17,360
and then they walk into a room like
Joe Pesci in good fellas, right?

490
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,210
You put a gun to their head. You're
like, Hey, wait a minute. What the fuck?

491
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,850
It's like, well dude, you
obviously don't want to be here.

492
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,690
You'd rather go to Mars is too crowded.
You know

493
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:31,910
I'm going to send you to heaven,
man. You can see all the planets.

494
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,673
All right.

495
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,830
I like it when people wonder if there's,
if there's life on other planets,

496
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,100
you know what I mean? Like why would you,
you know who gives a shit if there is,

497
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,370
you can't talk to them.
They're too far away. You know?

498
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,350
And what if they're
smart enough to get here?

499
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:54,690
Do you really want to wave your arms?
You don't,

500
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,740
why don't you just hitchhike down the
fucking highway and see what happens.

501
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,890
All right. I gotta do some reads here
for this week. I'm okay. Here we go. Uh,

502
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,970
oh look. It was oh,
Indochino in dope and dope.

503
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,130
Cito uh, talk about how every man
looks better in a suit. You know,

504
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:18,290
when I'm having gay thoughts, you
know, if I was going to fuck a man,

505
00:32:18,291 --> 00:32:20,960
I would, I would prefer that
he was in a suit because

506
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,300
I don't want to feel dirty afterwards.

507
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:27,030
I'd like to feel that I was with
a gentleman that was raised right.

508
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,290
Last thing I'd want to do is fuck a gay
guy from Denver in his flip flops and

509
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,820
his fucking Hawaiian shirt.

510
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,780
It's probably be the last
read for these guys. Um,

511
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,070
uh,

512
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:51,070

perfectly tailored suit at an incredible

513
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:52,550
price.

514
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,930
You can choose from hundreds of top
quality fabrics and personalize your suit

515
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,910
just the way you want it.
Whether,

516
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:03,590
whether it's for work or a wedding
or another spouse or other spin.

517
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,020
Another special occasion.
I can't read people.

518
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,390
Indo Chino has suited up hundreds of
thousands of men and are now the largest

519
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:12,990
made to fucking mash

520
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,460
mens wear brand in the world
play.

521
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:24,350
She'll order and wait for it to arrive
just in a few weeks. Don't go to work.

522
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:29,030
Sit there creepily staring at your front
door like that crazy Asian chicken,

523
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:34,031
that fucked up movie where she stares
at the phone before she pukes in a bowl

524
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:37,970
and mix the guy. Eat it. Do you ever see
that one? Yeah, it's called the audition.

525
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,930
Check that one out,
but not before you get a great soup.

526
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,680
Now Bill burr listeners and whoever
the fuck else they advertise with,

527
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,390
I love other ways.
Try to act like it's exclusive.

528
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:53,460
Like they haven't heard themself out to
anybody who could. The microphone can.

529
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,560
This probably some homeless guy outside
reading the exact same fucking copy.

530
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,420
You know, fucking empty refrigerator

I'll let you guys hit the high notes,
right?

539
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,520
Like one of those hair metal guys who
can't fucking hit the high notes in it and

540
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,040
he just fucking sit and nod
net yet with that devil. Look,

541
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,780
it's an incredible deal for a soup that

542
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:48,320

[inaudible] B undies.
I hope someone kills you tonight.

574
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,400
All you had to do was listen to me. I
don't have two mikes. I should have three.

575
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,320
I don't know this fucking windscreens is
soft as your tank when you were repair

576
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:27,300
of this fucking shit.
They make them for the ladies dry and out.

577
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,380

Your Butt will be proud to wear.
I hate that fucking word.

580
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,050
It's either your ass, you know,
but it's just to, you know,

581
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,720
I'm going to ask man, I just,
that word never just bought.

582
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,720
That's if you have a flat ass,
you have a button over,

583
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,840
lower back down to your ankles.
You know what I mean?

584
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,830
That's how I'm built naked.

585
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,070
I have the exact same
silhouette is the pink panther.

586
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,540
Big Head.
Big Feet.

587
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,140
Just fucking straight right down.

588
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:12,510
I swear to God you can hang
average Tizen off my backside. Um,

589
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,803
all right.

590
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,170
[inaudible] makes undies your butt will
be proud to wear and check this out.

591
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,300
I'm not the only one who loves me undies.

592
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,890
Listen to my longtime listener
and me undies enthusiasts.

593
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,930
George has to say,
is this George Michael,

594
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,840
did he write this from beyond the grave?
Maybe he wore the first month me on.

595
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:34,290
Do you remember that when he was shaking
his ass? Yeah, I think it will be nice.

596
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:40,030
I can touch your body and fucking
jerky. Bob in a bucket. Porta potty.

597
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,983
MMM.

598
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,010
Dan Get rested with Jeezy Busta.

599
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,383
MMM.

600
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,500
Where my fucking cowboy boots. I liked
that guy and now he's dead. All right.

601
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,530
A note from George N m a bill
burr listener and me on Ds Fan.

602
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,690
I decided to try out me undies because
I love beef bill burrs, me undies.

603
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,580
Jangle I smile every time he sings it.

604
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:12,900
This reeks of being rewritten by the
advertising. What kind of man says that?

605
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,330
I just look out the window and smile.

606
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,680
Do you, do you just smile when you,
I don't believe a word of this,

607
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,800
although it's so easy to
skip ads in a podcast.

608
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:29,830
I always listened to bill's reads and
I'm so glad me undies has stuck with it.

609
00:39:29,961 --> 00:39:34,610
Al Gore, right? This, this
is about as sincere as him.

610
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,270
If I told you guys my theory on why
Hilary keeps fucking losing, um,

611
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,560
even though she only lost once,

612
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,540
it's cause she has Mike
Dukakis is charisma and she's
isn't comfortable in her

613
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:45,950
own skin is Al Gore.

614
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:51,190
And you combine those two and what you
have is a dope that loses to an even

615
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:55,640
bigger dope. Um, Oh man, this
is a Trump state. I can feel it.

616
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,830
Oh yeah. Is he making it
better for you? It's too late.

617
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:04,850
It's too edit chance. You had a
chance at a day off and you said, no,

618
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,620
this is the fucking candidate
you've always been waiting
for. Uh, just coming in,

619
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:14,621
wearing his red tie and his fucking
silk underwear telling you how it is.

620
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,020
Alright.
Although it's so easy to scale.

621
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,430
Who gives a shit about
this fucking guy smiling,

622
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,210
looking out the window with
silky balls before me undies.

623
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,260
I used to buy a three pack of underwear
it retail stores until I realized that I

624
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:29,680
wanted to treat my junk to
something more comfortable and it,

625
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,810
and that starts with a
great pair of me undies,

626
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:37,811
cradling the family jewels to get 20%
off the best and softest underwear and

627
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:42,710
socks you will ever own for free
shipping and 100% satisfaction guarantee.

628
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:47,080
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash
bird. That's me, undies.com/burr.

629
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,830
All right. I started to hype
something here. 40 minutes.

630
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:56,150
Everybody just like that. Just like debt
40 minutes that you'll never get back.

631
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,330
Um,
I thought he was going to be standing up.

632
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:03,890
I thought there was going to be more of
a show. I thought they'd be showgirls.

633
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:09,250
Um, I saw I might as well stand up.
It's so fucking hot in here. Um Oh,

634
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:12,530
he's standing up. He's, he's standing up.

635
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:17,780
He wants the world to know
that the fucking podcast.

636
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,580
What do you mean speaking up?
I got to fucking microphones here.

637
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:27,320
How much more can I speak up, sir?
Are they canceling each other out,

638
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:31,280
but the amplification or they both
polite? No, you go. No, you go.

639
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,690
We were both born in the 90s.

640
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,840
I want to offend you with my
yellow skin and your black skin.

641
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,630
Yeah.

642
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,260
I want to sit in this big chair cause
I feel like I would think that I know

643
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:47,500
something over here. Here we
are. Ladies and gentlemen,

644
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:52,340
welcome to another episode of
masterpiece podcasting. Um,

645
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,680
wow. This is weird. Now I got in here.
There's a whole new sound in here. Um,

646
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,860
I hate that I'm at the fucking old age
where I have to cross my legs when I sit

647
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:01,450
down. I don't know what
happens. Remember as a kid,

648
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:05,020
you just fucking sat down and I got to
sit there constantly stretching out my

649
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:08,620
fucking hip. Um, this couch
was supposed to be nailed down.

650
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:14,740
Um, so I saw the premiere of
the ric Flair, nature boy. Dude,

651
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,220
I don't think I've ever fucking
laughed that hard. I mean,

652
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:23,080
I have to go back to like
a Richard Pryor special.

653
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:26,860
That guy is arguably one of the
funniest fucking human beings ever.

654
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,510
And I have to tell you something,

655
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:31,270
what I can commend about
that guy in this nature, boy,

656
00:42:31,271 --> 00:42:36,271
30 for 30 that you have to fucking
see is he did not run from anything.

657
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,900
He owned up to everything
good or fucking bad.

658
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,270
They were sitting there
talking about like,

659
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:47,110
you know him fucking around on his
wife and he was just gone. Yet you go,

660
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:50,500
how long were you faithful for in
your marriage? He just goes one day

661
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,720
and he was like, I couldn't
do it. I couldn't do it.

662
00:42:55,721 --> 00:43:00,721
I came home and I spent a day with my
family and I was like bored out of my

663
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:04,300
mind. I was in hell and it
was so fucking refreshing

664
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:11,250
to hear a married guy talk about how
badly he wants to continue fucking as many

665
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:14,740
women as he possibly could right now.

666
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:19,180
I know the laughs are going to go down
because there's too many women here and

667
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:23,170
every guy has to sit there and
act like he was, you know, like

668
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,740
probably thinking about it right fucking
now. I don't know. But, uh, yeah,

669
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,840
he talked about everything just being
like just all the women he was with and

670
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,990
then at one point they cut back to
his first wife. We calls number one

671
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,290
though.
This guy is a fucking legend

672
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,740
and she just cuts back to him and she's
just like, yeah, Rick wasn't a family man.

673
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,610
I was doubled over
laughing and then you know,

674
00:43:56,611 --> 00:43:59,190
it definitely has its sad points
but he doesn't run from it.

675
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:02,820
You can say he's a bad father or
if he's maybe like an alcoholic.

676
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,940
I don't want to ruin too many of the
lines, but he was just saying like,

677
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:08,760
I don't know if I'm an alcoholic.
I knew I never tried to quit.

678
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,690
It was just one fucking closing
bit after another with this guy.

679
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,570
It's like I would close with that.
I would close with that.

680
00:44:18,571 --> 00:44:21,720
I would close with that
and he just kept going.

681
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,520
He did tell this one story. I'm all
twisted up in my 20 fucking microphone.

682
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,700
He did tell this one story
to the crowd that was there.

683
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,220
He talked how we want night.

684
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:34,770
He was on the road and he
was out partying and he goes,

685
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,010
and I woke up with a couple of those.
I woke up next to an alien,

686
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:43,310
which is what he calls being like blackout
drunk and just waking up next to some

687
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:46,260
woman, you don't even know her
fucking name. So he goes out, woke up,

688
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:50,220
and it was an alien alien on one
side and an alien on the other.

689
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,040
And I looked down at my Rolex was missing.
So I wake the women up and I go, why?

690
00:44:56,041 --> 00:45:00,330
Hey, where's my, where's my watch? And
they go, you don't remember. They go,

691
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:03,060
you don't remember? And he
goes, no. He goes, yeah.

692
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:07,200
Last night you through your watch
into a bowl of spaghetti and you said,

693
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:08,640
I got 15 of these fucking right.

694
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,513
Thanks.

695
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:23,200
This was just a throwaway story.
I mean, this is a comedy club.

696
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:27,070
This is a packed house. I'm killing
just remembering lines that he said.

697
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,190
I'm telling you have to
fucking watch this guy is,

698
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,570
it's like I'm telling you, they ought
to give him like the Mark Twain Award.

699
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,580
They're always given it to
like these, these fucking
people, you know. Um, you know,

700
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,960
they give it to some people that are
funny, but then other times they just,

701
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:44,290
you know, sometimes it's like that guy,
he's not as funny as fucking ric flair.

702
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,100
You've got to get him in
there, you know? You know,

703
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:51,070
they wouldn't know cause it's always like
the, uh, you know, the, the arts admin,

704
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,460
Meryl Streep and Blah, blah, blah,
blah. The fuck out of here. You know,

705
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,120
you think she could fucking be that good
and actress after a couple of Beck body

706
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:58,954
drops.
Yeah.

707
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,853
You know,

708
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,290
you think she could do the flare flop
and kip that keep that period correct wig

709
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:09,280
that she has on, I dunno why I'm trashing
Meryl Streep. I have no idea what,

710
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,920
you know why? Because she's always
getting awards, you know? Yeah.

711
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,080
Fuck her for doing such great work.

712
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,133
MMM.

713
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,430
This is the dumbest shit. You
know, this business works.

714
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:27,640
If you trash anybody, you, you
inevitably you end up working for them.

715
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,790
I can't tell you how many times that's,
I haven't gotten a lot of acting work,

716
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:34,390
but every time I've ever gotten acting
work and I'm in the fucking a hair and

717
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,700
makeup, I always get to skip
the hair part. Of course,

718
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,710
I go over to the makeup
side of the trailer.

719
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,950
Inevitably somebody comes walking in,
I'm like, Oh shit, I trashed that person.

720
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,230
I hope they didn't hear that podcast.
All right. Um, I think that was it.

721
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,010
You guys want to listen to some reeds
here for this week? Can you hear me?

722
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:55,360
Is Everything fine? Is this, is this
working? How has this been so far?

723
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,540
If you guys enjoyed this,
is this something I should do more of?

724
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,063
All right.

725
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,510
I've already have one guy, but there's
always gonna be one guy. Boring.

726
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,130
I didn't like it. All right. Uh,

727
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,250
on Monday I discussed silkworms and how
they take the spittle from a silk worm

728
00:47:12,971 --> 00:47:17,560
and that's how they make a silk shirt.
Um, somebody goes silkworms, hey,

729
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:19,960
you ugly red faced fucking Twat.

730
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,540
You really think silk shirts are
made from silk worms. Really?

731
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,010
Jesus fucking Christ,
Dude. Just think about it.

732
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,080
Just think about that for a second. Bless
your heart bill. But sweet. Fuck man.

733
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,620
Get your act together and go fuck
yourself. You know it's funny.

734
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,860
Yes I did and I still do until
I was thinking like, wait,

735
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:46,610
well how would they turn
that spittle into thread?

736
00:47:46,611 --> 00:47:50,420
But I also used to think that a
fucking, uh, I used to take a pony.

737
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,530
It was just a little hoarse.

738
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,450
I did. And I remember these people
down the street. They had, they had up,

739
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,470
they had a little pony and
I just remembered, I just
remember thinking, why won't,

740
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,220
when is that thing going to
fucking grow up and become a horse?

741
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:08,721
And I finally,

742
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:12,770
one day I asked my mother when I was
like 15 and she just looked at me like,

743
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:14,870
how did you come out of me?

744
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,573
Yeah.

745
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,850
What do I Google here? What is silk made
out of? It's just going to say silk.

746
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,320
Well, what they shouldn't call
it a fucking silk warm. Then

747
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,490
what is silk made at?
What is silk?

748
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,840
Oh fuck you sir. This shit I know
that you don't know. Okay. Oh,

749
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,100
everybody likes to feel so Goddamn Smart,
Huh?

750
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:46,590
What is silk made of?
This right here.

751
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,320
If there's ever a hunger
games, I'm definitely not
going to make it right here.

752
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:55,700
The protein fiber of silk is comprised
mainly of fibrin and is produced by

753
00:48:56,491 --> 00:49:01,050
certain insect larvae to form cocoons.
All right. I was kind of right.

754
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:07,010
The best known silk is obtained from
the cocoons of the larva of the Mulberry

755
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,660
Silkworm. Wait a minute. Was I right?

756
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:16,040
What the fuck? Well, it
wasn't spitting it out.

757
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:20,700
I thought it was basically a silkworm
spider web. Why would it work?

758
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,690
Make a spider web built?
Maybe suicidal, I don't know.

759
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:27,643
MMM.

760
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:34,090
There's another way to make money off
of suicidal six silkworms each year,

761
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:39,091
over 30,000 silk worms commit suicide.

762
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,710
And I would like to buy a Tesla.

763
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,920
So please send your money in.

764
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,010
All right. Fat But fit,
uh, Billy, no roles.

765
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:56,623
Uh,

766
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,830
a study just came out that speaks to
everything you've said about being fat

767
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,070
almost automatically.
Meaning you're not healthy today.

768
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:07,940
There were a lot of people who say, you
can be in good health while carrying fat,

769
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,020
but that's just to soften the blow
to people who can't lose the lard.

770
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,670
All right. Anyways, thought I'd share.

771
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,370
You're not as dumb as Naea says you are,

772
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,870
but maybe still a bit of a moron.
Just kidding. Go Fuck Yourself.

773
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,350
I had no idea how much you guys laugh at
these people shitting on me. I thought,

774
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,100
I thought you were all sitting at
home as offended as I was going. Hey,

775
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:41,170
don't say that about bill.
Bill was my podcast friend.

776
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,120
Well, well, well,

777
00:50:43,121 --> 00:50:46,060
well I guess you get to see all your
fucking friends are when you do something

778
00:50:46,061 --> 00:50:49,680
live. All right. I don't even,

779
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,570
this is how short bear
my short term memory is.

780
00:50:51,571 --> 00:50:54,750
I don't even know what the fuck I just
said. I didn't want to just read that.

781
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:58,920
You can be a fed. Yeah. Oh yeah, no. Yeah,
you're not. You don't want to be fat.

782
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,620
Like that's a big thing now to be
fat and be proud of it, you know,

783
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,700
and they talk about fat shaming and all
that Shit. It's just like, you know,

784
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:08,430
you should just ignore what everybody
says and you should listen to your heart.

785
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,030
Go and for the love of God, lose the
weight. I'm going to conk out here.

786
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:20,070
Ah, that was a cheap joke. That was an
easy one. I set you up, you know, easy.

787
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:22,380
I took you to the left and then
I went right. That's what I did.

788
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:26,580
That was the old misdirection. Yo
comedy crossover there. Alright.

789
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,070
Nestle cunts. Nestle cuts.
That's right. Oh yeah,

790
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,980
they are the ones. They're the
ones causing all the wars. Hey,

791
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,330
they had Billy in the mirror.

792
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,070
A saw this article about Nestle that
I thought might ruffle your feathers.

793
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,140
Uh, the line, the byline
says it all. Okay. Uh,

794
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,240
this year, this year is
Halloween confectionary. Oh,

795
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,940
this is so great. I have people who,
what the f what is of confectionary?

796
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,860
It's a white,
it's a candy store.

797
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,130
What kind of an asshole
calls it a confectionary.

798
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,500
You know what's funny? I got this
acting gig right now by the way.

799
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,410
I've got to promote the movie.
You got to see it next.

800
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,010
Probably come out next year. It's
called front row. Front runner starts.

801
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:23,180
Hugh Jackman is Gary Hart. If you're
old enough, you remember Gary Hart?

802
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,270
Yeah, Gary Hart. We went a little
ric flair on the road, right?

803
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,090
He Bang some woman and then
all of a sudden he couldn't
be president anymore and

804
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:32,510
that's how,

805
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:36,790
that's how Bush got in because this
guy was a good looking guy and uh,

806
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,520
all the ladies liked him. And that's all
you need to do to win the presidency,

807
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:44,960
right? You play the saxophone, you
hit a jump shot, you know what I mean?

808
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,760
You do something like that and then
everybody fucking loves you anyways,

809
00:52:49,761 --> 00:52:51,770
that's coming out. By the
way, all you hear on a,

810
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:56,450
on a movie set is people going
copy that, copy that, copy that.

811
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,270
I need this, go over there,
copy that. And I get it.

812
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:02,310
When you say it into like a fucking,
uh, you know, you're on little,

813
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,900
your little CB radio copy that I get that,
you know what I mean?

814
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,710
But people say it to just other people.
Now just one person will be, hey,

815
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:13,540
can you move that over there? And
the guy go copy that. It's like,

816
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:17,720
why don't you just say, okay, it's a
lot quicker. Can you move that? Okay,

817
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,200
got it.
Copy that.

818
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,250
Those are the same kind
people that call a fucking

819
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,380
candy store. Confectionary. All right.

820
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,520
Yeah.

821
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,970
Hey, that's where you can, that's called
a callback. The guy just goes copy that.

822
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,700
He was waiting for the end
of the bit. See that? Now,

823
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:43,150
how does he know about callbacks?
How does he know?

824
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,230
Because Netflix has released
30,000 standup specials this year.

825
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:53,320
They're creating a comedy special
housing bubble over there.

826
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,083
Um,

827
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:01,610
come watch. The greatest open miker
is do an hour of their best material.

828
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,190
That's who they're down to at this point.

829
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,930
There's like everybody
has an hour special.

830
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:08,263
MMM.

831
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,500
I'm going to freeze myself after I die.
Don't they have that here?

832
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:17,670
The cryogenics right next
to the confectionary, right.
I'm going to freeze myself.

833
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,440
So then when they figured
out how to cure death,

834
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,780
they can unfreeze me
and I could do a bit of,

835
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:25,200
I can do an hour long one man show on
Netflix about what it's like to be in a 40

836
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:30,000
year coma. All right. Net,
uh, Nestle, everybody. Um,

837
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,290
by the way,F is for family.

838
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,600
Please watch that on Netflix
now that I've made fun of them.

839
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,190
[inaudible]

840
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:41,910
just scroll. If you can't find it,
just scroll left for like 20 minutes.

841
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:49,310
MMM.

842
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:49,701
Anyways,

843
00:54:49,701 --> 00:54:54,440
this year's Halloween confectionary
will contain palm oil grown on land that

844
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:59,000
should lawfully be habitat.
Be Habit. I can't read this.

845
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:00,440
H A. B. I t a t

846
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,370
lawfully be habitat to orangutans.

847
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:08,480
I was always a rang a tank
like the drink orangutans,

848
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,990
rhinos and clouded leopards.

849
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:15,910
I don't know how the fuck that is.
Uh,

850
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:19,760
despite commitment to
clean up supply chains,

851
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:25,310
this is on top of them.
Siphoning. Yeah, this is, this is,

852
00:55:25,311 --> 00:55:29,240
you know, a lot of times it's not me. This
is the sentence. This is on top of them.

853
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:32,480
Siphoning. I fucking screen just went
out. It's finally gonna make a point.

854
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,940
This is on top of them siphoning.

855
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:39,670
They do have water from national
parks that you've spoken about.

856
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:43,340
I guess they take water out of national
parks where they had agreements with

857
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:47,600
native American tribes
that have since expired a,

858
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:50,240
what's it going to take to
end Nestle's corruption?

859
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,790
Maybe you can take this up as your,

860
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,800
cause the way the first lady's doe,
um,

861
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,060
this is how you stop that. What'd
you'd have to do is have politicians,

862
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:06,350
politicians have to start earning fuck
you money rather than being grossly

863
00:56:06,351 --> 00:56:10,970
underpaid. The fact that, you know,
as a podcast or comedian and actor,

864
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,010
you can make almost as much,

865
00:56:13,011 --> 00:56:16,610
if not more money than the president of
the United States is fucking pathetic.

866
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,380
You know what I mean?
They should have,

867
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:23,290
fuck you money the second you become
present. Did she like, just be like, like,

868
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:23,591
you know,

869
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:26,870
like a pitching machine that's just throw
in one fucking heater over the place

870
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,230
should be a bag of money entire time.
You're there.

871
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,140
So then when these guys go, Hey, can
we siphon this fucking out of here?

872
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:37,740
You can be like, no, fuck
you. Well, if you doubt, uh,

873
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:42,090
we won't help you get reelected. I
don't give a fuck. I got fuck you money.

874
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,100
It probably wouldn't work. I don't
know. Sometimes I have good ideas.

875
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:49,910
Sometimes I don't. Um, so I guess, yeah,

876
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,760
don't buy any Nestle crunch bars
everybody and stay away from their bottled

877
00:56:53,761 --> 00:56:58,270
water and whatever else they
make. Do they make thongs? Um,

878
00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,893
all right.

879
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,320
Do you feel how the podcast
just immediately fucking
slowed down the second I

880
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:08,490
started reading out loud. It's fucking
unbelievable. Why do I do this?

881
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:12,030
Why do I do this to myself? What is the
shame is because I was raised Catholic.

882
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:16,510
All right. Accidentally made two
girls, my girlfriend. All right.

883
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,580
I like this guy already.
Hi William. The bald

884
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,840
big fan from Kenya. Oh, this is
a second language. All right.

885
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:30,660
Love the podcast.
And F is for family is amazing.

886
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:36,360
That's amazing that you can watch it
over there. Um, no, you should see,

887
00:57:36,361 --> 00:57:39,540
go on f, go on the Internet. You can
actually watch all these people. You know,

888
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:40,740
you know whatF is for family?

889
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:44,850
I feel like captures the frank character
that's loosely based on my dad.

890
00:57:44,851 --> 00:57:49,530
You know which one I think does
it the best is Mexico, you know,

891
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,740
cause they got a lot of fucking same
kind of people screaming and yelling,

892
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,220
temper. You know what I mean?
It just fucking works great. Um,

893
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:01,440
somehow that'll come off as racist, but
it was supposed to be a compliment. Um,

894
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,880
long story short,

895
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:07,970
I have had a crush on two ladies in
my college class for over four years.

896
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,290
Jesus Christ. This guy moves slow. Huh?

897
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,010
Now one of them is dying of ovarian
cancer and I feel like it's too late. Ah,

898
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:22,300
Jesus. Not that we care.
We Care in Phoenix,

899
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,773
Huh?

900
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:27,523
Yeah,

901
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,990
I bet you guys all
pictured a white vagina.

902
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,870
Yeah.

903
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:36,710
Fucking act like you guys care how you
try to bully me into your fucking phone.

904
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:37,763
He given a shit.

905
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,123
Yeah,

906
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,770
they probably showed that hurricane and
fucking Houston on comedy central out

907
00:58:45,771 --> 00:58:50,660
here. That's how little you people
care guys are all about yourselves.

908
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,953
Yeah.

909
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:01,230
All right. All I, all right. I
didn't know where I am and this,

910
00:59:01,231 --> 00:59:04,440
I don't know how you
follow a white vagina.

911
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:08,250
Next item up for bids,
a white vagina.

912
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:12,870
Mika did Mika auctions for serial killers.

913
00:59:12,871 --> 00:59:17,610
It would just be like women's
body parts. Ah, we're so offended.

914
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,910
Oh fuck. All of you. I'll
steer even harder into it. Um,

915
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,940
did you hear that? They're going to start
having Jeffrey Dahmer Day in Wisconsin.

916
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:31,340
It's true.

917
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:36,340
They have an all you can eat ms and
all you can eat mystery meat day in

918
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:37,844
Wisconsin.

919
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,050
They're trying to change the perception
that all they do is eat cheese up there.

920
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:47,620
See we done grown in because
I'll keep fucking going.

921
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:55,640
All right, so this guy's had a crush
on these ladies for four fucking years.

922
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,640
But since breaking up with my
previous girlfriend three years ago,

923
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:01,100
I decided to not get into
another relationship.

924
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,410
So the whole time you with
this girl for three years,

925
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:06,500
you had a crush on two other women
for four years. I love this guy.

926
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:09,410
He's a fucking mess.
Um,

927
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:12,800
all I did with these two girls was
light flirting from time to time.

928
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,270
What is light flirting in Kenya.

929
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:17,050
MMM Wow.

930
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:23,730
I was going to do some starving jokes.
Yeah.

931
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:28,120
You want a piece of bread just fucking
with you. Ah, you're going to have it. Um,

932
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:33,430
he's gonna write back next, next week.
Dear bill, we are not Somalia or Ethiopia.

933
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,050
We actually have food in Kenya.

934
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:36,980
Okay.

935
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,870
Running water and skyscrapers.

936
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,673
MMM.

937
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,420
Anyways, all I gave you all he did was
flirt with one. One of them is the fun,

938
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:51,620
friendly kind,
but she's kind of loose parentheses,

939
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:55,670
open relationship and sending nudes types.
All right, so that's the one you bang.

940
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:58,820
You fucking, you double rapid, right?

941
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,570
You double wrap it and
the other is conservative.

942
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,510
The other is conservative, introvert,
virgin. But I really enjoy her company.

943
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,930
All right. There's the one you have
kids with. This is an easy one. Well,

944
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:15,350
a few days ago it was my
birthday and I had both of them.

945
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,660
And you had both of them. He just going to
stop there. You Bank both of them? Well,

946
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:23,690
she's not a virgin anymore now is she?
I had oh it,

947
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:27,010
both of them and some few friends over.

948
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,540
This is his second language
and I can't read for a party.

949
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,180
I had a shit load of booze and was on,

950
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:37,210
I'm going to guess right now the one
that he thinks is loose held her alcohol

951
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,400
and the Virgin Blue.
Everyone at the party,

952
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,763
when I'm going with,

953
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:47,560
maybe I've been in Hollywood too long,
but this can't be linear.

954
01:01:47,561 --> 01:01:51,760
It has to make a left turn at some
point to spin us into the second act.

955
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:00,600
Okay, well, a few days ago it
was my birthday and I, okay,

956
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:03,510
and both over. I read, right, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. They came over.

957
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,870
I had a shitload of booze and
was on autopilot the whole time,

958
01:02:06,871 --> 01:02:11,490
but apparently I had the balls to ask
the two ladies to be my girlfriend. Oh,

959
01:02:11,491 --> 01:02:15,450
he was drunk.
I don't believe this is a true story.

960
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:18,510
Or did he watch some Kenyan
version of the Brady Bunch?

961
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,110
When Peter has two dates in one night,

962
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:27,480
a few days later I get a text from both
of them asking whether I was serious

963
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:28,590
about asking them out.

964
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:33,770
I'm now on a huge dilemma of choosing
between the two who I really like and the

965
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:37,830
fact that I haven't been in a relationship
in a while and basically forgot how

966
01:02:37,831 --> 01:02:40,740
to be in a relationship.
Oh, shut the fuck up.

967
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,990
You remember exactly how
to be in a relationship.

968
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:44,190
That's why you don't want to be in one.

969
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,930
Any advice would be appreciated and uh,

970
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,180
okay.
And uh,

971
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:59,550
[inaudible] Dean [inaudible] which
is Swahili for go fuck yourself.

972
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,333
MMM.

973
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:07,230
All right. Well I think, uh,

974
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:13,090
I think you got to go with the whore.
You know,

975
01:03:13,091 --> 01:03:17,530
if you don't want to be in a relationship,
but you did say girlfriend.

976
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:20,493
MMM.

977
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,450
I would just own up to it. Just be,
just be like, listen, I've been,

978
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,940
I was totally shit faced when I sent that,

979
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,950
but I have had a crush
on you for four years.

980
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:32,130
You always got to go with honesty
with women guys go into it. You know,

981
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,510
you always think you got to lie to him
and all of that shit. You gotta just,

982
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:39,150
you just fucking lay your cards on the
table. It's the best thing he could do.

983
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:42,420
She won't get mad. They might get a
little upset depending on what you say,

984
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,920
you know,
it depends on how graphic you get.

985
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,260
Where do you see this
going? I see you, uh,

986
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:56,760
laying off the edge of my bed on your
back with your head hanging off as I fuck

987
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:59,850
your mouth while watching sports center.

988
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:02,770
Okay.

989
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:05,900
That might be a little too honest.
You could just say, um, you know,

990
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,180
just looking to have a good time.

991
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:18,400
I would just go with the honesty.
I would tell both of them, dude,

992
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:20,530
you used the fact that you're
not in a relationship right now.

993
01:04:20,531 --> 01:04:23,140
You get to hit the reset button.
You just go total. Honestly,

994
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:25,330
I would tell them exactly
what the fuck happened to say.

995
01:04:25,331 --> 01:04:27,760
I had a crush on both
of you for fucking food.

996
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,170
I'm going to have talked
to both same time,

997
01:04:29,171 --> 01:04:33,760
but I would say I sent it to two
different people and that's what I did.

998
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,990
And then just wait to hear what they say.
That's it. And if they don't like it,

999
01:04:37,991 --> 01:04:41,920
who gives a fuck? Take you and
your honesty to the next situation,

1000
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:45,010
I'm telling you. All right, that's the
best way to handle the fucking thing.

1001
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,800
And then, uh, I don't know,
somehow you just tell them
what's going on out. Christ.

1002
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:51,190
I gotta tell the story.
Here's a story for you.

1003
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:53,080
One time when I learned about honesty,

1004
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,650
I was in my fucking early to mid
thirties and I was just sick.

1005
01:04:57,130 --> 01:05:00,700
Elian and I met this chick,
she was like 22 years old.

1006
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,880
So we get back to my apartment.
This lady's leaving right now.

1007
01:05:03,881 --> 01:05:05,080
She can't bear to listen to this,
right?

1008
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,173
No.

1009
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:10,210
So we get back to my apartment,

1010
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:14,440
we start making out and everything and
she goes, wait a minute. She goes like,

1011
01:05:14,441 --> 01:05:18,310
wait a second. She says, where's
this going? And I said, nowhere.

1012
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,470
What are you kidding me? I go, I'm
like 50 years old. And then you,

1013
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:27,550
by the time you're 30, I'm going
to be like 86 years old. All right,

1014
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,440
this is going to go nowhere.

1015
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,760
So whatever you want to do sexually,

1016
01:05:36,761 --> 01:05:40,000
but you don't want to do with
somebody that you like you do with me,

1017
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:42,243
right?

1018
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:47,090
And then you'll never have a midlife
crisis because you got it out of your

1019
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:51,680
system. And you know what she said?
She went all right. That was it.

1020
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,253
Yeah.

1021
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:58,440
They're not as prudish as you
think they are. Don't be afraid.

1022
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:02,430
That's the number one thing you gotta.
You gotta go with the fucking honesty.

1023
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:06,300
Do you like me?
No.

1024
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:09,583
Yeah.

1025
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:13,530
No. You don't have to be meat. You
don't have to be me. I like you,

1026
01:06:13,531 --> 01:06:17,160
but not like that.
All right.

1027
01:06:17,161 --> 01:06:21,840
Girlfriend loves my long hair.
I don't. Oh, go fuck yourself.

1028
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,500
Jesus Christ. What are you gonna do
next? Go Up to somebody with leukemia.

1029
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:31,740
My girlfriend loves my sick,
free body, but I don't,

1030
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:34,020
I just love how you guys
have this thing with disease.

1031
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:37,950
What is it with you guys and disease?
Why does it make you so sad?

1032
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:43,050
It's mother nature trying to help us.
They should close down all the pharmacies.

1033
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,770
Okay. And if you're lucky enough
to be disease free, you live.

1034
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,310
That's what we need to do.
Tough decisions have to be made.

1035
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,553
MMM.

1036
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,200
Okay. So I've been growing
my hair out for a while.

1037
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,373
MMM.

1038
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:06,660
Since I enrolled in college. Oh Dude.
That's the time to do it. Good for you.

1039
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:11,610
Grow your hair out.
Livia Steven Seagal years in your 20s.

1040
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:14,550
Get by a sword.
Sit there Indian style,

1041
01:07:14,551 --> 01:07:17,940
meditating out on the fucking
some sort of bluff over there.

1042
01:07:17,941 --> 01:07:20,550
I never went to college.
Really? I never lived there.

1043
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:25,200
What do they call it out on the compound?
The uh, the quad area, the grassy area.

1044
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,750
Just try to act interesting anyways
and I'm about to graduate this upcoming

1045
01:07:30,751 --> 01:07:31,500
spring.

1046
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,640
My girlfriend and a few friends convinced
me to grow my hair out since they are

1047
01:07:35,641 --> 01:07:39,150
all the hippie type. Ah,
that's not the cool long hair.

1048
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,480
Skype probably goes to
the University of Denver.

1049
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,500
I don't consider myself a hippy at all,

1050
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:50,340
but that is the crew I run with since
I have known most of them since back in

1051
01:07:50,341 --> 01:07:53,490
high school and they are
all close friends. A couple
of them have long hair too.

1052
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:57,060
I was open to the idea since I've had
short hair for most of my life before that

1053
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,640
the long hair turned out
looking pretty good too.

1054
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,970
My girlfriend though loves
the long hair on guys.

1055
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:07,170
A few days ago I told her passingly that
I've been thinking about cutting it and

1056
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:10,140
she immediately seems
really concerned saying,

1057
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:13,530
I just don't think it would look good and,

1058
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:19,280
but I really love how it is. And She
just dating you for your hair, sir.

1059
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,320
But that she's only ever dated
guys with longer hair. Dude,

1060
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:26,060
if you're looking to get
out of this relationship,

1061
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:30,680
one quick trip to the fucking barber,
this is the easiest breakup ever.

1062
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,370
And you got to go hardcore.
I get like a cop flat top

1063
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,203
haircut,

1064
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,820
detective mustache.
This is the easiest breakup ever.

1065
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:47,150
Her concern kind of annoys me as she was
saying that she would not be attracted

1066
01:08:47,311 --> 01:08:48,660
to me in general if I,

1067
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:53,160
if I cut it to me it seemed pretty shallow
considering we've been together for

1068
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:56,820
almost three years. Yeah, dude, she
doesn't love you. She doesn't love you.

1069
01:08:56,821 --> 01:08:59,340
Get your fucking haircut and get
out of there. That's what I do.

1070
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:02,190
I'm pretty fed up with my long hair
and everything that comes with it.

1071
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:06,640
Not Hair trying, you know, getting into
my eyes cause yeah, dude, you're, you're,

1072
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,650
you're, you learn something. You
know you did something for her,

1073
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,410
not for fucking you.
Right. You don't like it.

1074
01:09:13,411 --> 01:09:15,510
You're telling you you don't like it.
She says she's,

1075
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:19,860
she doesn't like the fact that you don't
like it. It's all there, sir. All right.

1076
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,100
This is what you do. You fucker. One more
time and then you go get your hair cut.

1077
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,120
MMM.

1078
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,780
I don't advise you doing that. That's
mean. I just, I just needed a laugh.

1079
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,293
MMM.

1080
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:33,520
Okay.
Here's the last one,

1081
01:09:33,521 --> 01:09:36,130
everybody and then we'll own it will
be almost at the end of the podcast.

1082
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,900
Hour and 10 minutes. Just like that
first ever live one. There you go.

1083
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,793
All right

1084
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,840
guys, lie on Tinder. Surprise.

1085
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:51,600
Okay.

1086
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,790
Hey.
Oh Bill.

1087
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:57,620
I'm a 29 year old single
lady living in Virginia. Uh,

1088
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:00,060
along with most other singles my age.

1089
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:04,020
It seems I've had to try out various
dating sites and apps over the years,

1090
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:08,550
but haven't had any success cultivating
anything more than a date here or there.

1091
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,400
I realized this alone. My
God, this is so fucking long.

1092
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:14,543
Ah,

1093
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,180
lady. Maybe if he got to the
point you'd get a second date.

1094
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:19,503
MMM.

1095
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,480
That was a cheap shot.
Admittedly, that was a cheap shot.

1096
01:10:23,481 --> 01:10:27,050
I got anxiety and how long this was in
rather than admitting to the fact that I

1097
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:29,930
don't like to read out loud.
I blamed her. I'm sorry,

1098
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:33,260
and I'm sorry for your horrible
social life. Let's continue.

1099
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,400
I realize a lot of this was likely
due to the fact that I've been pretty

1100
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:41,360
overweight my entire adult
life now. Now I'm sad. However,

1101
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:45,590
the last year and a half I've
managed to lose a 112 pounds.

1102
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:49,360
[inaudible]

1103
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,710
that's fucking awesome. It took me
a year and a half. Good for you.

1104
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:59,050
112 pounds and counting. She's not
done yet. She's like John Elway.

1105
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:00,820
She's getting the rings
at the end of her career

1106
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:03,653
and

1107
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:10,730
taken all that shit in the press. She's
finally living up to her expectations.

1108
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:15,731
I love it and counting and counting by
changing my diet and literally running my

1109
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:21,180
tits off on the elliptical
for an hour five times a week.

1110
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:24,510
That's fucking amazing. Good you.
Anyways, last week on Tinder,

1111
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:28,330
I matched with a very
cute 29 year old guy. Uh,

1112
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,030
he initiated the conversation.

1113
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:33,390
We had a great back and forth
comparing what podcasts we listen to.

1114
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:38,391
I found out he actually lives in Ohio and
was only traveling in my area for work

1115
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:41,370
for the next few days. All right.
That's a red flag. And he's on Tinder.

1116
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,920
He's looking to get his dick
sucked. All right. That's it.

1117
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,040
He doesn't want to know how many
brothers and sisters you have.

1118
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:51,180
And what's your hobby? Oh, do
you like to cook? Fantastic.

1119
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:56,310
Why don't you cook my balls in your mouth
as I stroke my Dick over here.

1120
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:02,700
Um, brutal honesty. Women
like honesty. Anyways,

1121
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:06,300
I know I should have called it quits then.

1122
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:10,770
But finding out someone that had that
can actually hold the conversation seems

1123
01:12:10,771 --> 01:12:15,120
to be a real rarity these days. He asked
me out to dinner, but because of my diet,

1124
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,640
I, uh, and wanting to be nice,

1125
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:22,050
I offered for him to come over
for a home cooked healthy meal,

1126
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:24,510
uh, when you didn't fill
them into the backstory.

1127
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,370
Now he thinks he thinks he's getting anal.

1128
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,600
This is how guys stink,
okay?

1129
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:34,590
If we want this whole me too thing to end,

1130
01:12:34,591 --> 01:12:37,980
guys have to be honest about
how they think. All right?

1131
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:42,810
He came over was just acute, was just
as cute and person as in his pictures.

1132
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,970
The great conversation kept flowing.

1133
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,730
I can't believe you just met somebody
on the Internet and invited them over to

1134
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:48,840
your fucking house.

1135
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,560
Please tell me you had a fucking
pistol taped to the inside of your leg.

1136
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:58,120
The great conversation kept
flowing in six hours later,

1137
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,210
we were making out.
We both had to be up early.

1138
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:08,211
The next day he left with plans to hang
out again the next day after work we did

1139
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:12,210
and ended up hooking up.
He left Virginia the next day,

1140
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,710
but we continued to message pretty
constantly over the next week with him

1141
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:20,730
initiating the conversation.
Most of the time, I swear to God,

1142
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:24,510
this three paragraphs left and I want to
apologize to each and every one of you.

1143
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:28,320
I want to have a benefit for all of
your ears having to listen to me.

1144
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:31,460
Have to fucking read this God damn long.

1145
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:35,700
Please call the number at the bottom of
the screen and a portion of the proceeds

1146
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:38,640
will go to everybody's
eardrums in this room.

1147
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:42,840
And also my dodge two
door hemi pickup truck

1148
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,640
for 40 grand. Um, anyways,

1149
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:52,140
all seem to be going pretty great except
the eight hour distance in between one

1150
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:54,000
another. Well, yeah. Okay

1151
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,430
guys never looked at a globe. Um, however

1152
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:06,660
you know what, there's an I in
Virginia. There's an I in Ohio.

1153
01:14:06,661 --> 01:14:08,190
They must be pretty close.

1154
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:14,120
Don't they alphabetize by a vowel
in the middle of them or something?

1155
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,900
I'm all seem to be going pretty good.
Okay.

1156
01:14:17,901 --> 01:14:20,960
Except for the aid blahblahblahblahblah
nothing really came. Okay. However,

1157
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:24,350
I just had a feeling something
wasn't quite right, so I googled him.

1158
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:28,850
I'm guarantee you he has a family.
Nothing really came up except his,

1159
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:31,790
I dunno what profile
than a few lines down.

1160
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:36,000
I see an old wedding gift
registry site with his name on,

1161
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:40,040
I called it,
I swear to God I didn't read this before.

1162
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,460
You think this sounds bad out loud.

1163
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:46,260
You should hear when I read quietly and
I just hear me stuttering in my brain,

1164
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:52,350
I searched all the girls' names on the
registry along with his last name on

1165
01:14:52,351 --> 01:14:57,351
Facebook and Bingo all over this girl's
profile or cute pictures of a sweet

1166
01:14:58,711 --> 01:15:02,430
couple. The other half of
which is the guy that was in,

1167
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,640
I was in bed with a week ago.
This son of a bitches married.

1168
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,910
What do I do here,
Bill?

1169
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,080
Do I call the guy out on his
shit and rip them a new one?

1170
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,130
Do I send his wife a message
and tell her what he's doing?

1171
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,890
He travels. All the women are gone.
Yes. So the guy that like, no, no,

1172
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,480
no. Move on. Move on.

1173
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:31,390
He travels the majority of the
time for work and I'm sure I'm not,

1174
01:15:31,391 --> 01:15:33,310
the first person has done this too.

1175
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:38,580
He already deleted his Tinder profile and
our text message have only been PG for

1176
01:15:39,941 --> 01:15:44,380
the most part, so I don't have any
concern, concrete proof to send her.

1177
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,890
I feel completely wretched.
Wretched.

1178
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:54,940
W. R. E. T. C. H. E. D. Wretched.
All right. I was right. Jesus Christ.

1179
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:03,160
Wretched. I thought this one you
like puking retching Hower right.

1180
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:04,540
Everybody's got a degree in the room.

1181
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:12,080
I feel completely wretched and terrible.
For the most part.

1182
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:15,530
I unknowingly played in this entire,

1183
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:18,530
I played into this entire
situation. No, you didn't.

1184
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,770
You didn't.
Unknowingly,

1185
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:25,220
if this is like one of the oldest
fucking stories on the Internet, also,

1186
01:16:25,221 --> 01:16:28,420
any dating advice for me moving
forward is also appreciate it.

1187
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:32,810
Thanks for the advice and congrats on
that. Beautiful baby girl. Yours. Oh,

1188
01:16:32,811 --> 01:16:36,200
thank you very much. All right. Yay.

1189
01:16:38,030 --> 01:16:42,650
Oh, Billy became a father.
All right. First of all,

1190
01:16:42,651 --> 01:16:43,700
I gotta be honest with you,

1191
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:48,230
you're kind of going Hillary Clinton on
this thing where you're not taking any

1192
01:16:48,231 --> 01:16:52,580
responsibility for this loss whatsoever.
You're blaming him,

1193
01:16:52,581 --> 01:16:56,000
you're calling him a piece of shit.
You're of the Electoral College,

1194
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:59,780
you're blaming the Sandinista rebels,
everything

1195
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:07,670
but you. Okay? You went on Tinder.
Tinder is a total hookup site.

1196
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:11,930
It's full of fucking
like, and then guess what?

1197
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:14,000
You met a fucking scumbag.
So

1198
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:19,520
what I would take out of that is to
not go on dating sites and I would try,

1199
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:22,850
I don't know, I would join like a
fucking sports league or some shit.

1200
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:27,020
Like go play some softball.
I would try to do some hobby thing.

1201
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:29,180
I know that sounds like an old guy thing,
but like,

1202
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,170
you know the fucking
Internet is the Internet now.

1203
01:17:33,171 --> 01:17:37,720
If you want to go blow up this guy's
life to make you feel better, I mean you,

1204
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:42,650
you can also do that. I mean,
I mean, I dunno what I do.

1205
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:46,950
I just, when I fuck up, I just
go, I fucked up and I just, I,

1206
01:17:46,951 --> 01:17:49,760
I walk away from it. I mean, if you
want to, if you want to do that,

1207
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:53,390
that's up to you. I don't
fucking know. I mean, who knows?

1208
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:57,650
Maybe maybe his wife isn't blowing them,
you know,

1209
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,630
let's try to blame as innocent wife now,

1210
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:02,993
you know,

1211
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:07,260
I just feel like in this
age of hyper feminism,

1212
01:18:07,261 --> 01:18:11,280
the way women always just stick up for
other women that guys need to start doing

1213
01:18:11,281 --> 01:18:16,280
this. So I have to stick up for this
complete piece of shit here. Um,

1214
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:22,870
maybe, uh, maybe, you know,

1215
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:28,240
maybe just the love's gone in the
relationship. They got the kids,

1216
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:32,350
he doesn't want to leave. He just wants
to know what it likes to have fun again.

1217
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:37,420
And you were fun and he fucking, you
know, it's kind of on you though,

1218
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:41,920
because the first night
when you just hung out,

1219
01:18:41,921 --> 01:18:44,740
all you gotta do is look at his wedding
ring. And if he's wearing a ring,

1220
01:18:44,741 --> 01:18:49,730
you'll see the indentation from it. I
mean, you got to go a little bump up,

1221
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:54,400
up, up, right, ma'am?

1222
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:56,110
I don't know why I'm blaming for you,
blaming you.

1223
01:18:56,111 --> 01:19:00,460
I have no excuse for this
fucking guy. Uh, I dunno.

1224
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:03,280
I mean,
what about George Clooney in that,

1225
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:07,060
that movie where he's flying around in
the planes and he showed up and that

1226
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:10,630
woman had a family, you
know, did he say anything?

1227
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,620
He didn't. What was it
called? Up in the air. Right.

1228
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,310
And he was banging that woman and then
he went to her house and he found out

1229
01:19:18,311 --> 01:19:22,120
that she was married and he was
like, oh fuck. He just walked away.

1230
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:28,300
That's what guys do. They,
we just, we just walk away.

1231
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:32,080
Women's start pulling hedges
out of the front yard.

1232
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:37,081
They started putting rabbits
in the fucking stupid shit.

1233
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:42,280
Like,
is that why we die sooner than they do?

1234
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,270
Cause we just hold that in our chest,

1235
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:47,110
the fucking pitch at a family and you
just carry that around for the rest of

1236
01:19:47,111 --> 01:19:49,990
your life.
Women get to get it out.

1237
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,553
Okay.

1238
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,590
Well here's the thing.
If he has kids and shit,

1239
01:19:55,591 --> 01:20:00,030
like maybe he's just going through a
fucking phase that he's working it out,

1240
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:05,310
you're going to blow up that family
and their dad's gonna leave. And just,

1241
01:20:05,311 --> 01:20:08,460
just so you know, there's going to be
two kids crying with this guy has kids.

1242
01:20:08,461 --> 01:20:09,294
Does he have kids?

1243
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:12,570
Yeah,

1244
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:14,760
I know personally I would just
take the loss and I would move on.

1245
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:19,110
I would just go like, listen, I, I checked
you out. I found out you're married,

1246
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:21,960
you fucking piece of shit. And, uh,

1247
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:26,910
because I'm a cool chick, I'm not going
to call you fucking wife. Go Fuck you.

1248
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:29,520
I mean, you could do that or
you could just be, oh, you
can just say, I don't know.

1249
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:31,260
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you.

1250
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:34,710
I can't throw another guy under the bus
like this. That's a, so what you would do,

1251
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,850
there you go. Someone in the
crowd. So that's what I would do.

1252
01:20:38,851 --> 01:20:41,070
Keep losing weight and move the fuck on.
Yeah.

1253
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:46,300
Would you have to, this is what you
have to do. Yeah. You know what?

1254
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:46,970
You got to look,

1255
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:49,620
look at that guy.
Like you got to look at that guy.

1256
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:54,360
Like when Columbus was sailing across
the ocean, he didn't see land first.

1257
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:58,470
He saw branches. So he knew that
something good was coming right.

1258
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,710
That he could exploit and cut their arms
off when they didn't give enough gold.

1259
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:06,660
Okay. Allegedly, oh,

1260
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:09,980
I go new evidence shows that he was this,
what was your find?

1261
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:15,960
And it's somebody's scrawling
into a fucking tree. Um, yeah,

1262
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:17,720
just look at this guy. Okay.
You're going to have to,

1263
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,450
you have to take some losses on
your way to a championship. Okay.

1264
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:24,060
You don't blow up the whole team
and burned down the fucking arena.

1265
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,350
That's what you want to do.

1266
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:27,893
Yeah.

1267
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:32,450
Just know this. Take it as a
compliment. You lost so much weight.

1268
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,270
You were worth risking a house for.

1269
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:44,100
I Dunno. I got nothing. All right.
You know what? That is the podcast.

1270
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:48,270
This is the first ever live podcast.
Thank you guys so much for coming out.

1271
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:53,070
I hope you had a good time. I hope
you enjoyed it. I hope it was fun.

1272
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:00,030
Go fuck yourselves and I'll
check in on. Yeah, on Thursday.

1273
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:01,890
Thank you.
Good night.
