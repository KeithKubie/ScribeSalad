00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.080
I'll ask this question several times in

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090
I'll ask this question several times in
 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.530
I'll ask this question several times in
the past but to no satisfactory answer I

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540
the past but to no satisfactory answer I
 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.270
the past but to no satisfactory answer I
hope this time it works imagine you have

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280
hope this time it works imagine you have
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.999
hope this time it works imagine you have
a train moving at 100 miles an hour you

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
a train moving at 100 miles an hour you
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.740
a train moving at 100 miles an hour you
have to train moving at hundred miles an

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750
have to train moving at hundred miles an
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.620
have to train moving at hundred miles an
hour and you have a fly within the train

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630
hour and you have a fly within the train
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.810
hour and you have a fly within the train
that moves it two miles an hour with

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
that moves it two miles an hour with
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.080
that moves it two miles an hour with
respect to the train now to another

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
respect to the train now to another
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.189
respect to the train now to another
outside observer the fly seems to be

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
outside observer the fly seems to be
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.659
outside observer the fly seems to be
moving at 102 miles an hour we know it's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
moving at 102 miles an hour we know it's
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.000
moving at 102 miles an hour we know it's
not possible is this just a paradox or

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010
not possible is this just a paradox or
 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.619
not possible is this just a paradox or
does this lead us to understand one of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
does this lead us to understand one of
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.869
does this lead us to understand one of
the loopholes a possible and possible

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879
the loopholes a possible and possible
 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.000
the loopholes a possible and possible
plausible loophole in relativity it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
plausible loophole in relativity it's
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.850
plausible loophole in relativity it's
it's just my attempt to question

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860
it's just my attempt to question
 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.950
it's just my attempt to question
relativity because any theory any

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
relativity because any theory any
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.299
relativity because any theory any
understanding is if no credibility if it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309
understanding is if no credibility if it
 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.290
understanding is if no credibility if it
cannot be questioned thank you
