00:00:00.398 --> 00:00:01.768
- [Instructor] So we have a system of two

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:02.939
linear equations here.

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.863
This first equation, X minus
four Y is equal to negative 18,

00:00:06.863 --> 00:00:09.544
and the second equation,
negative X plus three Y

00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:10.794
is equal to 11.

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:16.373
Now what we're gonna do
is find an X and Y pair

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:19.282
that satisfies both of these equations.

00:00:19.282 --> 00:00:22.514
That's what solving the
system actually means.

00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:24.267
As you might already have seen,

00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:25.881
there's a bunch of X and Y pairs

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:27.338
that satisfy this first equation.

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:28.529
In fact, if you were to graph them,

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.747
they would form a line,

00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:31.285
and there's a bunch of other X and Y pairs

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:32.639
that satisfy this other equation,

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:33.722
the second equation,

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:34.792
and if you were to graph them,

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:35.941
it would form a line.

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:38.513
And so if you find the X and
Y pair that satisfy both,

00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:40.967
that would be the
intersection of the lines,

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:42.458
so let's do that.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:43.645
So actually, I'm just gonna rewrite

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:45.160
the first equation over here,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.794
so I'm gonna write X minus four Y

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:49.794
is equal to negative 18.

00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:53.552
So, we've already seen in algebra

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.156
that as long as we do the same thing

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:56.840
to both sides of the equation,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.336
we can maintain our equality.

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:01.441
So what if we were to add,

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.885
and our goal here is to
eliminate one of the variables

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:06.331
so we have one equation with one unknown,

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.189
so what if we were to add

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.779
this negative X plus three Y
to the left hand side here?

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:14.029
So negative X plus three Y,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.147
well, that looks pretty good

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:19.485
because an X and a negative
X are going to cancel out,

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:20.963
and we are going to be left

00:01:20.963 --> 00:01:24.547
with negative four Y, plus three Y.

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:28.203
Well, that's just going to be negative Y.

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:30.136
So by adding the left hand side

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:32.059
of this bottom equation
to the left hand side

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.016
of the top equation,

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:34.967
we were able to cancel out the Xs.

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:36.706
We had X, and we had a negative X.

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:38.322
That was very nice for us.

00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:39.942
So what do we do on the right hand side?

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:41.263
We've already said that we have to add

00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:44.143
the same thing to both
sides of an equation.

00:01:44.143 --> 00:01:45.726
We might be tempted

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:49.727
to just say, well, if I
have to add the same thing

00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:50.560
to both sides,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.229
well, maybe I have to add a negative X

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.008
plus three Y to that side.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:57.496
But that's not going to help us much.

00:01:57.496 --> 00:02:00.247
We're gonna have negative
18 minus X plus three Y.

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:02.204
We would have introduced an X

00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:04.304
on the right hand side of the equation,

00:02:04.304 --> 00:02:05.337
but what if we could add something

00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:07.887
that's equivalent to
negative X plus three Y

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:11.724
that does not introduce the X variable?

00:02:11.724 --> 00:02:13.820
Well, we know that the number 11

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.704
is equivalent to negative X plus three Y.

00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:17.802
How do we know that?

00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:19.747
Well, that second equation tells us that.

00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:22.690
So once again, all I'm doing
is I'm adding the same thing

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.616
to both sides of that top equation.

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:28.547
On the left, I'm expressing
it as negative X plus three Y,

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:29.811
but the second equation tells us

00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:31.722
that negative X plus three Y

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:33.301
is going to be equal to 11.

00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:36.615
It's introducing that second constraint,

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:38.944
and so let's add 11 to
the right hand side,

00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:41.109
which is, once again, I
know I keep repeating it,

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.400
it's the same thing as
negative X plus three Y.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.143
So negative 18 plus 11

00:02:45.143 --> 00:02:47.099
is negative seven,

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.596
and since we added the
same thing to both sides,

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:51.738
the equality still holds,

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:55.633
and we get negative Y is
equal to negative seven,

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.023
or divide both sides by negative one

00:02:58.023 --> 00:03:01.043
or multiply both sides by negative one.

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:03.673
So multiply both sides by negative one.

00:03:03.673 --> 00:03:06.552
We get Y is equal to seven,

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.985
so we have the Y coordinate

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:12.818
of the X, Y pair that
satisfies both of these.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.695
Now how do we find the X?

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.075
Well, we can just substitute
this Y equals seven

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:19.782
to either one of these.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.017
When Y equals seven, we
should get the same X

00:03:22.017 --> 00:03:24.710
regardless of which equation we use.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.595
So let's use the top equation.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:30.086
So we know that X minus four times,

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:31.200
instead of writing Y,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.802
I'm gonna write four times seven

00:03:32.802 --> 00:03:34.434
'cause we're gonna figure out what is X

00:03:34.434 --> 00:03:35.972
when Y is seven?

00:03:35.972 --> 00:03:40.133
That is going to be equal to negative 18,

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:42.223
and so let's see, negative
four or four times seven.

00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:43.919
That is 28.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.677
So let's see, I could just solve for X.

00:03:45.677 --> 00:03:48.028
I could add 28 to both sides,

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:50.028
so add 28 to both sides.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:53.652
On the left hand side,

00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:55.968
negative 28, positive
28, those cancel out.

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:57.408
I'm just left with an X,

00:03:57.408 --> 00:03:58.490
and on the right hand side,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.157
I get negative 18 plus 28 is 10.

00:04:02.848 --> 00:04:03.681
So there you have it.

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:07.098
I have the X, Y pair that satisfies both.

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:09.152
X equals 10.

00:04:09.152 --> 00:04:10.220
Y equals seven.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.904
I could write it here.

00:04:11.904 --> 00:04:13.536
So I could write it as coordinates.

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:16.688
I could write it as 10 comma seven,

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:17.864
and notice, what I just did here,

00:04:17.864 --> 00:04:18.968
I encourage you.

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:20.885
Substitute Y equals seven here,

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.081
and you would also get X equals 10.

00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:26.812
Either way, you would
have come to X equals 10,

00:04:26.812 --> 00:04:30.029
and to visualize what is going on here,

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:31.584
let's visualize it really fast.

00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:33.913
Let me draw some coordinate axes.

00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:37.443
Whoops, I meant to draw a
straighter line than that.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.734
Alright, there you go,

00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:41.334
so let's say that is our Y axis,

00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:42.334
and that is,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.240
whoops, that is our X axis,

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:51.894
and then, let's see,

00:04:51.894 --> 00:04:56.061
the top equation is gonna
look something like this.

00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:00.759
It's gonna look something like this,

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.417
and then that bottom equation

00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:04.834
is gonna look something like,

00:05:07.597 --> 00:05:09.710
lemme draw a little bit nicer than that.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.960
It's going to look something like this,

00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:15.032
something like that.

00:05:15.032 --> 00:05:16.186
Lemme draw that bottom one here

00:05:16.186 --> 00:05:19.491
so you see the point of intersection,

00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:22.170
and so the point of
intersection right over here,

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.359
that is an X, Y pair that satisfies

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:26.022
both of these equations,

00:05:26.022 --> 00:05:27.682
and that we just saw,

00:05:27.682 --> 00:05:31.101
it happens when X is equal to 10,

00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:33.101
and Y is equal to seven.

00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:37.173
Once again, this white line,

00:05:37.173 --> 00:05:38.845
that's all the X and Y pairs

00:05:38.845 --> 00:05:40.755
that satisfy the top equation.

00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:43.013
This orange line, that's
all the X and Y pairs

00:05:43.013 --> 00:05:45.469
that satisfy the orange equation,

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:46.908
and where they intersect,

00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:48.435
that point is on both lines.

00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:50.896
It satisfies both equations,

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:52.493
and once again, take X equals 10,

00:05:52.493 --> 00:05:53.413
Y equals seven.

00:05:53.413 --> 00:05:55.185
Substitute it back into
either one of these,

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:57.852
and you will see that it holds.
