2
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.140
<v 1>abstractions took us far.</v>

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.790
They let us notice common features of objects throw away their differences and

4
00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:18.410
end up with a general concept. But now that you have that abstraction,

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.750
tell me what are you going to do with it?

6
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.310
Once you see common properties and abstract them,

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.450
you aren't limited to applying your abstraction to the original objects that

8
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:30.284
sparked it.

9
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.480
You can find those same properties in new objects and in new situations.

10
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.310
This lets you learn. It lets you gain knowledge.

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.640
We've used the abstract round to work out formulas that apply to every round

12
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:47.474
thing.

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.160
Let's say I tell you I have a new round thing in my backpack that you've never

14
00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:55.820
seen before in your life since you don't know what it is.

15
00:00:55.821 --> 00:01:00.500
How could you possibly be able to tell me anything about it? Well, my friend,

16
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.600
once you've mastered abstract thinking, you see right past the charade.

17
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.450
We can use the same kind of abstract thinking to pick up on patterns in

18
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:15.290
language. There's something else in my backpack you've never seen before.

19
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.830
It's a creature called a f,

20
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.490
but I bet you already know exactly what to say when you see three of them don't

21
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:25.100
you? When you do that,

22
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.640
you're drawing on a past pattern you've seen in English.

23
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.540
Abstracting that pattern and applying it to this new instance.

24
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.100
You've never had to say that you've seen three Schweppes before in your life,

25
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.900
but by taking a pattern from your source and applying it to a target,

26
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.730
the answer was obvious.

27
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.200
If you've taken your fair share of standardized tests,

28
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.840
you've come across comparisons like this.

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.710
These puzzles are called analogies. More specifically,

30
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:59.711
this is a proportional analogy and it tests how good we are at abstracting the

31
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:04.490
meaning of one pair of words and applying it to the second pair,

32
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.860
but analogies like this might have even more to teach us about language and

33
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:12.050
thought. Think about it.

34
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.450
Doesn't the Schwab Schwab's thing work a little like one of these analogies?

35
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.243
If so,

36
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.250
just how far can we take analogies in our quest to learn and think and create?

37
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.320
You'll see this pattern of recognizing a pattern,

38
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:31.360
abstracting the properties of that pattern,

39
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:36.070
and applying that obstruction to a new instance over and over again.

40
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.510
Ooh, we might even call this a pattern of analogies,

41
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.820
but how do we abstract that and analogize those abstractions?

42
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.120
Thanks for taking the time to learn with me.
