00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.960
What are kids these days smokin?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.620
Well it ain’t your momma’s weed.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.640
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.200
Not that I would know from experience, but
it there’s a rumor that weed strains these

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.770
days, are a little different from what your
parents might have smoked back in the day.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.840
And the blame is placed on THC.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.810
Tetrahydrocannabinol acts a lot like the cannabinoids
your body naturally produces.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.940
The cannabinoid receptors in your brain do
a lot of different things, they have a hand

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.500
in pain reduction, pleasure, memory, sensations,
and other stuff.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
But THC is also the thing that gives marijuana,
well... its high and euphoric feeling.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.440
Basically the more THC, the stronger the high.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.670
Potency has been monitored for about forty
years.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.290
But the rumor is lately that today’s pot
boasts more THC than in prior years.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.030
While some data might be skewed because of
out of date testing procedures or sample size

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.940
variations, there does seems to be a general
trend upward.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.820
As some pot users demand stronger, longer
highs, producers are happy to accommodate.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.809
One study presented at the 249th National
Meeting &amp; Exposition of the American Chemical

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.399
Society found that THC levels of 30% are pretty
common in parts of Colorado where marijuana

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.859
has been legal since 2012.

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:09.850
But like 30 years ago THC levels were usually
under 10% according to one of the authors

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.969
of the study.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.270
And some researchers, like Michael Kahn, the
president of Massachusetts Cannabis Research,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.139
think that "the mega-potent strains may soon
represent the norm”.

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:22.100
So, yeah pot is a little stronger today than
it was when your mom was a teen.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.429
While high THC might seem like a great idea
for those looking to get high, some strains

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.310
of pot are bred to be the opposite.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.009
Low THC but high in other compounds like Cannabidiol
(CBD), one of dozens of other active compounds

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.320
found in marijuana.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.359
Strains like this are newer and aren’t great
sellers, except in a few cases.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.149
Like one strain called Charlotte’s Web,
named after a little girl who uses its extract

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.349
to cure her seizures.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:47.119
Today, there’s a market developing for strains
low in THC but high in CBD, for medical purposes

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.659
for other diseases like schizophrenia and
alzheimer's.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.579
But THC has medicinal benefits too, like it’s
been shown to reduce tumor growth in patients.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.619
But it’s difficult to deal with its potential
healing properties while also dealing with

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.619
the high.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.380
So researchers are currently working on separating
the high inducing properties from the medicinal

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.380
benefits.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.020
In one study published in the journal PLOS
Biology, researchers found that the psychoactive

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.439
component of THC runs through different neural
pathways than its other components.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.959
THC works on a lot of different receptors,
like cannabinoid receptors and serotonin receptors.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.579
The researchers found that by removing one
of the serotonin receptors in mice, (5HT2AR),

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.090
they were able to reduce some of the negative
side effects of the compound like memory disfunction.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.379
But it didn’t change some of the good effects
like pain relief.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.860
While the researchers caution against people
self medicating, they hope that their research

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.950
might lead to synthetic weed.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.860
All of the medicine but none of the high.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.500
On the topic of controlled substances there’s
also been some research into the medical properties

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.500
of LSD.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.860
In case you missed it, here’s a video I
did.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.290
And we’ll put the link in the description
below, if you’re on moble.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.760
So what do you think of medical marijuana?
