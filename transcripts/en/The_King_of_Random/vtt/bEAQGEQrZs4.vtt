For this video, I’m going to show you how
to make homemade microwave popcorn from scratch,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.500
that’s delicious, healthy and ready to serve,
in a couple of minutes.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.020
Start with a handful of popcorn kernels, like
the kind you find at the grocery store. You’ll

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.160
also need salt, olive oil, and a little sugar,
if you like it like that. And it’s also

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.359
a good idea to set a brown paper lunch bag
on the counter, because we’re going to need

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.570
it in just a second. Now for this recipe you’ll
need 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels, 1/2 teaspoon

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.010
of salt, and 1 teaspoon of olive oil. You
could also add 1 tablespoon of sugar and turn

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.280
it into a sweet and savory kettle corn. Now
pour the teaspoon of oil over the popcorn

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.920
kernels and let it soak down for a couple
of seconds, then plop them all into the brown

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.890
paper bag. The salt and sugar go in next,
and you can just pour them straight in over

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.100
top, then fold the bag over two
times to give it a little crease and hold

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.600
it all inside. Now set the bag on a paper
towel in the microwave for about 2:30

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.140
That’s the perfect timing
in my microwave, but every system is a little

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.530
different, so play around to see what works
best for you. When the popping slows to around

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.649
2-3 seconds between pops, it’s done. So
let it cool for a bit, then give it a quick

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.250
shake upside down to make sure everything’s
evenly seasoned. Just like that, you’ve

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.420
got in instant batch of kettle corn ready
to serve. Not only is this a fun and easy

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.970
way to make popcorn, but it’s about as fresh
as it gets, and doesn’t have any harmful

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.560
chemicals to worry about either either. Well
now you know how to make a tasty batch of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.920
instant homemade kettle corn, or if you prefer
your popcorn salty, just leave out the sugar.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.659
That’s it for now. If you like this
