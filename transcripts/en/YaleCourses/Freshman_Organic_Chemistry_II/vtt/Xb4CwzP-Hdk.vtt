1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.010
Okay.
We're talking about acid derivatives,
uh,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.550
where we started last time talking about ACL insertions,

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:10.350
although I'm not sure I mentioned the term.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.300
And then about reactivity at the position adjacent to carbon eels,

5
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:20.280
Alpha reactivity and condensation reactions,
which are related to that,

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.210
which are chapters 18 and 19 in the Jones tax.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.680
So a cell insertion is to put an atom in the bond between the r and the carbonyl

8
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:36.840
group,
the ACL group.
So you just moved the,
our aside and put x in there.

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.570
Okay.
So x can be an oxygen,
uh,

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.140
the buyer villiger reaction of ketones.
It can be,

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.330
uh,
an Nh group.
So you can make an amine from a key tone.

12
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.570
It can be a ch two group,
so you from which,
uh,

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
inserted into the carboxylic acid.
So in the first case,

14
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:05.931
you get a ketone transformed to an Ester in the second case of ketone

15
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:11.520
transformed to a mid,
in the third case,
it's an acid,
goes to an acid,

16
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.670
but it's an asset that's longer by one carbon.

17
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.890
Can you think of any other ways of having an acid and making an acid that's

18
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.480
longer by one carbon?

19
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.970
It has to be sort of a roundabout way.

20
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.840
You could go from the acid to the alcohol,

21
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.073
<v 1>right</v>

22
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.840
<v 0>from the alcohol to the haylight.
Now you've got something you can make reactive.</v>

23
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.390
It's reactive in itself.
The Halo lied.

24
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.830
You could displace it with a carbon nucleophile that would add one carbon to the

25
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:48.580
chain.
So it could be CN,
right?

26
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.390
And then we know you can hydrolyze Sia and to make a carboxylic acid.

27
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.240
So that would be one one unit longer.

28
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.720
Or once you have the Alk Hill haylight you can make it into a grin are reagent

29
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:06.610
or an Kia lithium.
And they had CO2,
which is a carboxylic acid.
Again,
one way.

30
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:10.030
So there are many ways,
as we said last time to skin the cat.

31
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.770
But one way is this aren't I stared procedure,
which,
which gives good yields.

32
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.800
So we starting to talk about the buyer villiger a reaction last time.

33
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.050
And um,

34
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.760
I'm going to put it on the right some more on the board here with this.

35
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.030
<v 1>No,
it's this one.</v>

36
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.060
Okay.

37
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.340
<v 0>So as we said last time,
the buyer Villinger reaction hopes this is,
I thought I,</v>

38
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.663
<v 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.660
<v 0>it's supposed to turn that projector off.</v>

40
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.290
<v 1>MMM.</v>

41
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.180
<v 0>I think I'll just
turn it off</v>

42
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.850
and we'll use the side ones for the rest of the,

43
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.240
okay.
So the buyer Villinger reaction as we said,
starts with a key tone.

44
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.930
<v 0>And reacts with that.</v>

46
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.290
<v 0>Per Roxie acid.</v>

48
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.670
<v 0>Which is of course an acid.
It's got a PK,</v>

50
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.600
I think about seven or something like that.
So we can get the anti in here.

51
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.200
<v 0>Okay.
We could add the acid and make the,</v>

53
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.280
the analog of a Hemi Quito.

54
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.540
<v 1>But,
uh,
uh,
instead</v>

55
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.280
<v 0>we don't have a leaving group here that we can leave.</v>

56
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:35.110
It looks like the only leaving group is that,
but there's a fancy way to do it,

57
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.740
which is this can make these electrons of high energy so we can use those

58
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:41.710
electrons.

59
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.170
<v 0>To displace the leaving group.</v>

61
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.680
So now we have Si.

62
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.310
<v 1>Oh,
our prime.
Oh,</v>

63
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.960
are,
okay.

64
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.810
<v 0>So we've inserted that oxygen between the originally ACL carbon and the,</v>

65
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:05.660
our group.
So we have an Ester.

66
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.150
<v 0>Plus,
of course,
the carboxylic acid,
which was a good leaving group.</v>

68
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.010
Yeah.
And I ended the carboxylic acid.
Now,
uh,

69
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.290
I indicated here that we had different art groups or could have different r

70
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:26.640
groups are in our prime.

71
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.680
The question obviously arises of which one,
uh,

72
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.480
which one migrates which Esther do you get?
Uh,

73
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.170
now this has,
this is called migratory aptitude.

74
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.510
<v 0>And it comes in a reasonable order.
H</v>

76
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.820
tertiary,
radical secondary,

77
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.280
primary
and c h three.

78
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.340
But I didn't tell you whether this is increasing or decreasing in migratory

79
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.850
aptitude.
So what is the group that shifts?

80
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.580
Is that a cat ion or radical or an an eye on,

81
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.370
what am I showing my curve
when our moves over?

82
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.820
Does it move without electrons with one electron or with a pair of electrons

83
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.470
with a pair of electrons.
So it's r minus that moves.

84
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.610
Okay.
At least it's a height.
It's a myth.

85
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.550
I'd or an and shift.

86
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.880
When you say like the Meth,
I'd shift now.

87
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.790
So do you think methyl is the best or the worst?
That shifting say,

88
00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:15.570
compared with a tertiary,
which should be the best?

89
00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:19.470
Suppose that were a cad ion on that we're shifting,
which would be best?

90
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.880
<v 1>Well,
yeah.
What do you think?</v>

91
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.510
<v 0>Which is the best cat?
[inaudible] methyl.
A primary.
A secondary.
A tertiary.</v>

92
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

93
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.240
<v 0>Yeah,
tertiary.</v>

94
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.470
So if it's just the opposite with an ions,

95
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.370
right?
So if it's an an eye on the shifting,

96
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.410
then one would predict that methyl would be the thing that would be easiest to

97
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:49.630
shift and tertiary would be the hardest.

98
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.760
But in fact h is better than this and this is better.
Better,

99
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.780
better,
right?
So it's not the best.

100
00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:03.700
And I on that shifts,
it's the best cat die on the shifts.

101
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.820
Doesn't that seem curious?

102
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.420
But the reason is that it doesn't break completely away to become our minus,

103
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.990
right?
It's electrons

104
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.640
which have been boosted and energy by having this charge next door are being

105
00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:28.290
shared with sigma star here.

106
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.503
<v 1>Right.</v>

107
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.330
<v 0>So in fact,
those electrons have to be given to something else in order for the</v>

108
00:08:36.331 --> 00:08:37.920
rearrangement to take place.

109
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.610
If it were an alcaide shift in which they are pulled away to become an ion and

110
00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:48.480
then attacked sigma star,
then the best anti and would do it.

111
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.730
But that's not the way it goes.

112
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:55.731
It's exactly the opposite because it actually is giving up electrons in the

113
00:08:55.771 --> 00:09:00.150
process of shifting.
These electrons are being given the sigma star,

114
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.310
so it's the best cat on migrates fast,
fastest,

115
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.690
which seems sort of funny when you say that it's an alcaide shift.
Okay.

116
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:22.501
Uh,

117
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.501
one other feature is that if you have,

118
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.950
um,
if the group that's migrating

119
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.650
is Kyrell,

120
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.070
then since you're just moving these electrons over,

121
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.860
it's not any kind of backside attack.

122
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.630
So the are in the product.
We'll retain stereochemistry.

123
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.140
Okay.
This is the buyer villiger reaction.

124
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.710
So that inserts and oxygen.

125
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.310
Then we said that the Beckman Rearrangement,
uh,

126
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.770
notice that these are old.

127
00:10:32.771 --> 00:10:36.310
Remember the buyer villiger was done at the same time that Gomberg was there.

128
00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:40.690
Essentially 1900,
roughly.
The Beckman rearrangement is 1886.

129
00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:42.010
This was done by,
uh,

130
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.190
one of the few organic chemists who was also a physical chemist backed bond.

131
00:10:47.201 --> 00:10:52.150
He invented a very,
very sensitive thermometer as well and worked in the same,

132
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.810
uh,
uh,
department with Austin,
all whom we mentioned before.

133
00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.600
But the,
uh,
the back of Henri rearrangement puts a nitrogen in,

134
00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:03.700
so it starts with a key town

135
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.970
like cyclohexanone and inserts a nitrogen.

136
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.440
<v 0>And the bond between carbon and oxygen and the reagent that does it.</v>

138
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

139
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.740
<v 0>Is hydroxyl mean</v>

140
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.633
<v 1>okay.</v>

141
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.560
<v 0>And then treated with acid.</v>

142
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.700
So we already talked about what a means do with ketones.

143
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.750
They give him means and it's especially good to do.

144
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:37.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.380
<v 0>For a means you remember that have unshared pairs that are interacting</v>

146
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.620
unfavorably.

147
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.993
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.850
<v 0>So you'll lose water and generate what's called an</v>

149
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.823
<v 1>yeah.</v>

150
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.900
<v 0>Now the backbone rearrangement happens when this is treated with strong acid.</v>

151
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.370
You could imagine it protonated and the nitrogen,
it probably does that,

152
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.680
but one it does it,
it comes off again.

153
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.620
But it can protonate the oxygen as well.

154
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.423
<v 1>No.</v>

155
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.110
<v 0>And now we have the leaving group,</v>

156
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.950
but in plus doesn't look like us or such a very good cad ion.

157
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.340
So in fact,
what you use is the electrons here.

158
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.090
These electrons shift up.
So it's very much likely,
uh,

159
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.080
r minus R R plus if you wish shift in that case.

160
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.073
<v 1>Oops.
Sorry.</v>

161
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.580
<v 0>Some part of me that this is the C.
Alright.
It explicitly,</v>

162
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.610
and we have the on here.

163
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.660
<v 1>All right.
Uh,</v>

164
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.000
<v 0>double bond here.</v>

165
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:18.913
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.030
<v 0>And notice that since these electrons left this carbon,</v>

167
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.960
there should be a positive charge on this carbon in the formula.

168
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.443
<v 1>All right.</v>

169
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.383
Uh,

170
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.330
<v 0>so since this is done with water resin,
we can put water on there.</v>

171
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.260
Well,
actually,
let me draw a resonance structure of this first.
Uh,

172
00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.020
notice that,
uh,

173
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.860
it's hard to pull these electrons away to leave this,

174
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.890
what would appear to be a vinyl cad ion,
right?

175
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:11.110
But remember that the nitrogen has a pair of electrons in its Pi system.

176
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.350
Uh,
me just stuck on this.
I got that right.
Yeah.

177
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.180
It's got another pair of electrons.
These electrons are displacing this.

178
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.880
So they're coming again backside to that orbital.

179
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.000
But there's another pair of electrons on the nitrogen.

180
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.980
And at the same time that these electrons are leaving from this carbon,

181
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.100
these electrons can go toward that carbon.

182
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.200
And if that happens,
we got a resonance structure of this thing.

183
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

184
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.530
<v 0>Which has the positive charge.</v>

185
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.653
<v 1>Oh,</v>

186
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.760
<v 0>on the nitrogen.
Right.
So it's not unstable as you might've thought,</v>

187
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.410
but any rate when we add water,

188
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.993
<v 1>okay,</v>

189
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.670
<v 0>I lose a proton,
we can get this,</v>

190
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.160
which is of course related Al Lily,
Chloe.
If we just shift the Proton.

191
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.913
<v 1>Okay,</v>

192
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:20.710
<v 0>so this,
I'm good.</v>

193
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.240
So we've indeed inserted n h into the carbon eel to Alpha carbon bond.

194
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.710
Incidentally,
this particular bean,

195
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.610
this particular lactone a lactone

196
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.550
lactam.
Pardon me?

197
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.660
A lactone is a cyclical Esther.

198
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:55.150
I'll walk town is a sick lick Amin or a mid right.

199
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.720
And this particular one is called caprolactam.

200
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.573
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

201
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:07.550
<v 0>And it's of some commercial interest because if you hydrolyze it,</v>

202
00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.070
it becomes this amine.

203
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.690
<v 1>All
right.</v>

204
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.490
<v 0>Which of course can Sciflies the amine conform in the mid with the Coh,</v>

205
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:32.230
but it can also form polymers where the amine attacks the,

206
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.800
the a carboxylic acid of another molecule.

207
00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:39.550
So instead of a ring one can then get a chain and you can get a very,

208
00:16:39.551 --> 00:16:43.990
very long chain.
This is called nylon polymer.

209
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.000
All right?
If this way

210
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.840
it's called nylon six.

211
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.720
<v 0>So the six means that there are six carbons in the chain between the amid</v>

213
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:00.494
groups.

214
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

215
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.450
<v 0>Now again,
we could wonder in a,</v>

216
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.940
in a case where we have different ours here,

217
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.770
which are migrates,

218
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.860
that is which one gets next to the nitrogen.
Okay.

219
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:35.560
Now one might think that would be something like this up here where the best cat

220
00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:40.561
ion would move because it's electrons are being shared with the sigma star who's

221
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.300
that's allowing the water to leave.

222
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.670
But it's actually not that because you'll notice there are two different isomers

223
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.210
of oxy hymns.

224
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

225
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.500
<v 0>And if you're careful,
you can separate them.</v>

226
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.430
And it turns out that in this one are migrates,
but in this one,

227
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:06.900
our prime migrates,

228
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.040
which doesn't surprise you because it's a backside attack cause displacement of

229
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:15.414
the water.

230
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.710
So it inserts the nitrogen inserts in the anti bond.

231
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:22.614
The one that's,

232
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:26.843
<v 1>yeah,</v>

233
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.160
<v 0>the one that's away from the h?</v>

234
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:34.923
<v 1>Yes.</v>

235
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.290
<v 0>Okay.
So that's the backbone rearrangement.</v>

236
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.470
And then the art,
I stare a reaction,

237
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:04.350
which is up the whole model allegation,
the one that makes the,

238
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.550
I'm Allison one year longer.

239
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.153
<v 1>Okay,</v>

240
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.370
<v 0>so you have a carboxylic acid</v>

241
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.040
and insert c h two
in this bond.

242
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:36.170
And the way that one goes is first to react with soc all to what will that do to

243
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:43.230
the acid SOCL to remember that reagent switches,

244
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.380
the wage up for seal replaces all h with cl,

245
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:50.370
the same as it does in Roa h so we have an acid chloride.

246
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:54.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.360
<v 0>And now nuclear files can,
I can,
uh,</v>

248
00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.690
do association dissociation and displace the chloride.

249
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.540
And the particular nucleophile that's used in this case is called die a zone

250
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.383
methane.

251
00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.190
<v 0>It's a very poisonous and unstable compound.</v>

253
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.370
It's a good idea not to work with it.

254
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:28.480
It's one of these interesting molecules that you can't draw a Lewis structure

255
00:20:28.481 --> 00:20:29.980
without putting in charge in it,

256
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.980
which is sort of a tip that it might be reactive,

257
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.190
but you can draw not only that resonance structure,
but also this one.

258
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.040
<v 0>The nitrogen in the middle has to be</v>

260
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.873
<v 1>positive,</v>

261
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.440
but the negative charge can be written on either end of the molecule.

262
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.640
It's probably better to put it on nitrogen that to put it on carbon.

263
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.000
But the reactivity is of the carbon.

264
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.930
So this is that these are the electrons that come up and then,

265
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.423
okay,

266
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:17.090
<v 0>lost again.
So substitution at the ACL carbon as we've been speaking about.</v>

267
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.770
So now we have,
uh,

268
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.090
c h two n plus triple bond,

269
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.910
which loses a proton

270
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.020
<v 1>to give r</v>

271
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:45.640
o c h and to,

272
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.270
uh,
okay,
I'll draw it this way

273
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.230
if I had done it right.

274
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.180
Uh,

275
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.560
did I do it took those electrons in there?
Yep.
Okay,
good.

276
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.010
Uh,
yeah.
Plus minus.

277
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:18.460
Okay.

278
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.620
<v 0>Which is called a diease.
Oh,
ketone.</v>

279
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.680
No,
it doesn't surprise you that dies.
Oh,
ketones when heated

280
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.020
and it's often done in the presence of silver

281
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.420
<v 1>lose nitrogen.</v>

282
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.520
<v 0>Can you give an unusual compound?</v>

283
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

284
00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.710
<v 0>Because there's just a same,
just to bonds to that hydrogen to that carbon.</v>

285
00:23:00.711 --> 00:23:05.120
It's like a car being,
so it has a vacant orbital.

286
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.323
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.840
<v 0>And An unshared pair.</v>

288
00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:12.970
<v 1>All right.</v>

289
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.700
<v 0>And now you can see how we're set up for the rearrangement.</v>

290
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.540
These electrons can shift

291
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:27.260
just as they did in the Beckman rearrangement,
just as they did in the,

292
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.870
in the buyer villiger reaction.

293
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.580
<v 1>Right.
Which would,</v>

294
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.440
<v 0>but at the same time,
these electrons.</v>

295
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.270
<v 1>Okay.
Then come here
to make a double</v>

296
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.510
<v 0>bond.
So we have c double bond,
o</v>

297
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.310
double bond,
c,
h,
R.

298
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.200
Right.
And notice that this,

299
00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:03.443
<v 1>okay,</v>

300
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:08.630
<v 0>if we trace through this carbon here
became this carbon</v>

301
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.930
and this carbon
became a,
this carbon

302
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.680
and it's now this carbon.

303
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.473
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

304
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.350
<v 0>so we inserted that carbon between the carbonyl carbon and the r group.</v>

305
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

306
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.050
<v 0>Now we've seen this kind of compound before.
It's an acid derivative.</v>

307
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.430
It's a key team.

308
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

309
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.320
<v 0>So it can add water,
as we've discussed before,</v>

310
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.430
to give R,
c,
h,

311
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:56.160
c,
O,
o,
h,
which accomplishes what we wanted to do.

312
00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.613
<v 1>Wait</v>

313
00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.200
<v 0>c h two now because of the age from the water.</v>

314
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.840
Okay,
so that's the aren't I stared of procedure,

315
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:12.470
which LinkedIn's a carboxylic acid by one unit.

316
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:20.893
<v 1>Second,</v>

317
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.500
<v 0>I want to speak a little bit about the rest of the stuff we're going to talk</v>

318
00:25:34.571 --> 00:25:39.520
about with acid derivatives is reaction that the Alpha position that is making

319
00:25:39.521 --> 00:25:43.750
an an eye on at the Alpha position and using that.
So like an [inaudible].

320
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:49.030
But first we should look at the,
at the acidity of these compounds.

321
00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:53.560
Uh,
so I'll just use the slide to talk about that.
Okay,

322
00:25:53.561 --> 00:25:57.730
so the PKA of acid aldehyde is 17,
right?

323
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.230
A acetone,
we talked about this before,
is slightly more acidic.
That is the,

324
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.890
the anti,
any or part,
probably slightly less acidic,

325
00:26:05.891 --> 00:26:07.660
the anti and isn't quite as stable.

326
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:13.170
19 to two a or two orders of magnitude in the equilibrium constant.

327
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:14.710
Okay.

328
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.710
Now the Ester is another five orders of magnitude less acidic,

329
00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.590
right?
The equilibrium constant is 10 to the fifth smaller.

330
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.980
Why is it that the ester forms is less prone to form the anti and by losing that

331
00:26:31.511 --> 00:26:34.510
Red Proton than a ketone is,

332
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.223
<v 1>okay,</v>

333
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.490
<v 0>I could make the opposite argument.
I could say oxygen is electron withdrawing,</v>

334
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:43.980
which should make

335
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.600
<v 2>it easy to form an an eye on.</v>

336
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.430
So there must be something else that goes in the opposite direction that's even

337
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:52.380
more important.
What is it,

338
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.263
<v 1>Roy?</v>

339
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.570
<v 2>What allows you to form?
That's right.</v>

340
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.990
What allows you to form the anti and at this position is it's in these cases,

341
00:27:09.481 --> 00:27:13.350
it's that stabilization by mixing with the Lumo Pi Star.

342
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.000
But in this case,

343
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:20.060
the Luba was always already being used to stabilize the electrons of the oxygen.

344
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.180
In fact,
you could make the same argument here in terms of hyper conjugation,

345
00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:29.181
that the Pi Star here is being used to stabilize the electrons in a ch bond,

346
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.840
right?
So when those,
when that a vacant orbital,

347
00:27:33.841 --> 00:27:36.960
the Pi Star mixes with the occupied orbital,

348
00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:41.961
whether it's ch bond or even higher than the unshared pair of oxygen,

349
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.570
then they mix and the vacant orbital becomes higher and less able to stabilize

350
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:52.830
the Ani and on the carbon here.
Right?
So that,

351
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.910
that's a clear understood.
Now,

352
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.070
notice that a cyanide group,
as we've said before,
I so called night trial,

353
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.420
has much the same character as a carbon eel.
In fact,
this has the same,

354
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.110
uh,
this has the same acidity as the Esther does.

355
00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.700
Okay.
Now,
in an amid,

356
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:19.530
so this amid has a PK of 18.
Does that make sense to you?

357
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.030
<v 1>What would you have predicted?
Ayesha?</v>

358
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.470
Yes.

359
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.590
<v 2>If,
uh,
if the Aldehyde is here,
when you have a,</v>

360
00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:37.540
an unsure that when you have a bond next door,
you get a little bit of,
of,
uh,

361
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.530
raising the vacant orbital,
right?
So it's not so good.

362
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.750
Unshared pair on oxygen is even more important and makes it a lot of civic.

363
00:28:46.751 --> 00:28:50.380
What would you expect if I,
instead of oxygen here,
if I had nitrogen?

364
00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:51.940
How about it's unshared?
Pair?

365
00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

366
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.930
<v 2>Huh.
You got everything right except the periodic table,</v>

367
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.650
right?
Nitrogen comes before oxygen.

368
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.630
So nitrogen has less nuclear charge than oxygen.

369
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.410
So it's unshared is higher in energy.

370
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.420
So what would you expect would he makes even more with Pi Star?

371
00:29:24.421 --> 00:29:28.200
Pi Star would go up even more and it should be,
uh,

372
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.950
it should be less acidic.
It should be greater than 24.

373
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:37.110
And the reason is that that's not what ionizes what?

374
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:40.140
Ionizes is a hydrogen from the nitrogen.

375
00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.990
So it's like the amid is a little bit like a carboxylic acid,

376
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.320
so it's not comparable with these others actually.
Right.

377
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:51.510
But if you put to our groups on the nitrogen so it doesn't have a hydrogen,

378
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.630
it can lose then.
Indeed it's less acidic than the Ester,

379
00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:59.410
which is what you predicted once you get the periodic table.
Right.

380
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.410
Okay.
Now you can do even better if you have two carbon eels.

381
00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:09.580
So notice that all of these are weaker acids than water,

382
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.970
right?
So if you put them in with hydroxide,

383
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:17.860
the equilibrium will have the proton on them,
not on the water.

384
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:22.990
Right?
So if you can,
especially in the cases up here,

385
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.640
they're close enough to water,

386
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:29.641
water's about 1615 0.7 they're close enough that you get an that there is some

387
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:34.270
anti entity equilibrium,
a significant amount.
So you can do reactions with it.

388
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.860
Right?
But mostly it's not in that form.
Mostly it's in the protonated form.

389
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.510
But if you have two carbon eels,
then it becomes quite acidic.

390
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:47.410
And we spoke before when we were talking about the myths are Nobu reaction about

391
00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:50.660
active methylene compounds,
methylene group,

392
00:30:50.661 --> 00:30:55.661
ch two groups that are adjacent that are activated by two adjacent Pi Star or

393
00:30:56.321 --> 00:31:00.730
but also that then they become much more acidic.
This one has a pka of five.

394
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.570
Right?
And if we have two methyl groups,
it's like going from here to here.

395
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.720
The PK is nine.
In fact,
it looks,

396
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.810
it looks uncannily good for that because if you've got two orders of magnitude

397
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:17.740
by putting on one methyl group from h to methyl here,
when you put on too,

398
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:18.471
you get forward,

399
00:31:18.471 --> 00:31:23.470
there's a magnitude that's that's a spurious and how good at it,
uh,

400
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.140
how good the agreement is because you see,

401
00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:30.460
if you put Esther on instead of the methyl as we did here,
Esther,

402
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:34.930
instead of methyl,
the PKA goes up as it did here.
But here it went up.

403
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:39.770
Five orders of magnitude here,
the acidity,
one up,
only two orders of magnitude.

404
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.610
So they're really not additive the way we were talking about,

405
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:44.740
but it's in the right direction,
right?

406
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.750
If you have to Esther's then it's another two orders of magnitude,
right?

407
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:54.760
If you have nitrogen,
it goes up five orders of magnitude for the reason that we,

408
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.460
uh,
in fact,
uh,
compared to this one,

409
00:31:57.461 --> 00:32:02.461
it went up seven orders of magnitude over here compared to the Esther to

410
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:06.250
nitrogen.
It went up six orders of magnitude.
So that one,
it looks reasonable,

411
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.280
right?
And finally,
uh,
if you have two night trial groups,
you can get,
uh,

412
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.390
you,
it's still quite acidic.

413
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:17.200
And notice that all of these are stronger acids than water,

414
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.610
except the one here which was deactivated by the unshared.
Pair the nitrogen,

415
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.450
right?
So if you put these with base,
they'll be in the,

416
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:29.110
an ionic form with hydroxide or alk oxide.

417
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:35.230
Okay.
So you can get these,
these anti ions from the simple compounds,

418
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.530
a small amount of equilibrium and strong base.

419
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:43.220
And for the double doubly activated compounds and high concentration,

420
00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:46.040
if you put strong base in there,
in fact,

421
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:51.041
if you use an even stronger base like lithium die ice of propyl amid.

422
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:57.210
So amid remember as a confusing name because it means both the functional group,

423
00:32:57.211 --> 00:33:01.400
c Double Bond,
o n,
but it also means a nitrogen.
And I,
and,

424
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:05.680
and you just have to know from context what you're talking about.
Okay.
So anyhow,

425
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.530
this is a nitrogen and I,
and so it's a strong anti and it's the,

426
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:14.480
the PKA is 36.
Right?
So if you were to take this one,
that,

427
00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.950
that,
that you don't get,
uh,
uh,
uh,

428
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.130
very good formation of pulling off this hydrogen,

429
00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:26.030
the one that's much deactivated,
but you put it with this very strong base.

430
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:30.590
This one has a pka of 25,
but this one has a pka of 36.

431
00:33:30.591 --> 00:33:35.591
So you have an equilibrium constant of 10 to the 11th favoring formation of the

432
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:40.370
Anti.
And so you could make a hundred percent essentially or,
uh,

433
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.260
just one part in 10 to the 11th.
Not that way if you,
uh,

434
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.520
if you use this very strong base.
So sometimes even,
uh,

435
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:54.500
these alpha and ions that are difficult to make,
if you use a really strong base,

436
00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:58.190
you can get them all made.
Okay.
So,
so you can,

437
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.340
you have complete formation even of the amid insulate and not just a little bit

438
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:07.730
at equilibrium.
Okay.
And notice that it's a hindered base.

439
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:10.280
It's not die methyl or die.
Ethel,

440
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:14.930
it's die ice approachable and you want it to be hindered because otherwise this

441
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:17.030
h isn't so very easy to attack.

442
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.940
It would also be possible to attack the carbon yield group.

443
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:23.210
Pi Star had the nitrogen to this,
uh,

444
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.230
to this carbon and lose the other nitrogen.
You don't want that to happen.

445
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.950
So you use a hindered one that can only get at the hydrogen out there.

446
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:36.590
Okay?
Doesn't attack the insulate.
Okay?
Uh,

447
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:41.090
now when you make these things,
you have a nuclear fill lake,
Alpha carbon.

448
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:44.090
That's why you make them so you can use carbon.

449
00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:48.560
Remember in the ways we've talked about it mostly is an electrified while our

450
00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:51.110
halogen,
uh,
uh,

451
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.770
the Pi Star of CW Bondo are low lumos.

452
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.930
Here's a carbon that's a high homo,

453
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:59.870
the unshared pair here on that kind of that Alpha carbon.

454
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:04.760
So this allows you then to form carbon carbon bonds with the other kinds,

455
00:35:04.761 --> 00:35:06.860
the electrophilic carbons.

456
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.720
So by using that unshared pair to form a new bond.
Okay?

457
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:13.610
So let's look at some examples of that.

458
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.880
And it could be done either with acid or basic italicize via in the acid case

459
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:22.700
enal and in the base case in oh,
late an ion.

460
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.450
And you know how to do this,
I'm going to zip through it quickly.

461
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.680
So a proton comes in prototype.
In the acid catalyzed case,

462
00:35:30.681 --> 00:35:31.880
you get this cat ion,

463
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.740
which is very stabilized because of the unshared pair on oxygen next door,

464
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:42.330
okay?
But that can lose a proton degenerate.
Any anal.

465
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.490
Okay.
But now in the case of hydrogen deuterium exchange,

466
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.430
it's interesting because if d comes up,

467
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.830
we can reverse the state the reactions.

468
00:35:52.831 --> 00:35:55.290
We could have reversed it this way and put a proton on.

469
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.630
But if you have a Deuteron available,

470
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:02.810
then you can do it this way and go to there and now lose this a d plus.

471
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.920
And what we've done is exchange in the Alpha position,

472
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.820
hydrogen deuterium in place of hydrogen.
Okay?

473
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.720
So that's the acid catalyzed mechanism,
which doesn't surprise you.

474
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.630
You can also do it with basic analysis.

475
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.140
You can have bass come in and take the proton generating is an Ino late.

476
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.660
And I ion,
which of course has this resonance structure.

477
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.120
And now we have this as we had here,
a new,
uh,
uh,
nuclear fillic.

478
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:37.290
Yeah.
Nuclear affiliate carbon.
We also have a nuclear affiliate carbon here,

479
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.510
so we can in the Ino eight,

480
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.780
we could bring in a deuterated water and do it.

481
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:49.440
So you either acid or base allows you to exchange that,
uh,

482
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.500
those protons,
protons.
And if there's more than one proton,

483
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:56.280
you and that Alpha position,
you can exchange the others as well.

484
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:03.230
Now notice that you can also Ras Umyes in this way because if the other things

485
00:37:03.751 --> 00:37:06.960
attached to this carbon,
we're a and B,
right?

486
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.190
You can go through exactly the same scheme,
acid or base,

487
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.610
but there's no configuration here.
So if the AE is,

488
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.450
if the H is in front of the plane here,
in this case,

489
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.810
when the h h plus comes back on,

490
00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:25.770
it could come either from the front or from the back.
So,

491
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:30.390
so because this,
this thing is planar and this thing is plainer,

492
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.370
not chiral.
So,

493
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.960
so we've lost the memory of whether the thing was right or left handed so it

494
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:39.870
could come in from the back just as easily as from the front.

495
00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:42.000
And then we Rasamayi wise,
uh,

496
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:46.560
so either by deuterium exchange or by randomization,

497
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:50.580
you can measure the rate at which ina latest formed and destroyed.

498
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.070
Okay.

499
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:57.930
You can also do Alpha halogenation and it's exactly the same scheme.
Again,

500
00:37:57.931 --> 00:38:01.440
the only difference is once you get the anal or the analyte,

501
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.240
you react it with a halogen.

502
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:07.680
I've chosen to show IOD and here you can do it with chlorine or bromine as well.

503
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:12.430
So you can make an Alpha Halo Ketone,
right?

504
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.220
Nothing special here.

505
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:21.090
Now the product we made was an eye odo methyl ketone.
Right?

506
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.150
But we could also do the reaction with that.

507
00:38:24.151 --> 00:38:26.970
Pull out if there's another hydrogen here.
We could,
we could,
uh,

508
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:32.300
we could do the acid catalyzed or the base catalyzed and get a dye.

509
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:37.510
I odo compound or can we,
in fact,
in this case,

510
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:39.460
only one of the pathways works.

511
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:44.590
And the reason is that the eye than the halogen is electron withdrawing,

512
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.230
right?
So it's deep.
It's makes,

513
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:51.130
gives positive charge to that carbon partial positive charge.

514
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.230
That means that if you want to up here,

515
00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.920
you will be putting two positive charges next to one another.

516
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.180
Which isn't so great.

517
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:03.690
So in fact the acid catalyzed a pathway disappears after you've added the first.

518
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:09.040
And so you can put one in one I had in one chlorine,
one bromine,

519
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.630
but you can't put the second one in cause you can't with acid ketalysis get the

520
00:39:13.631 --> 00:39:16.480
anal.
But if you have a positive charge there,

521
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.730
that's all the better for for uh,

522
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:23.260
for losing the Proton and getting the analytes.
So this is even faster.

523
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:25.870
The second one.
And what do you think happens next?

524
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.470
If you'd have another hydrogen there.

525
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.010
<v 1>All right,</v>

526
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:35.360
<v 2>so there's the,
the base catalyzed of hearts,</v>

527
00:39:35.361 --> 00:39:39.350
but now you can do it with the dye iota methyl ketone and make a try.

528
00:39:39.351 --> 00:39:42.200
Iota Messel ketone.
Okay,
so that's great.

529
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:44.600
What happens next with base?

530
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.020
<v 1>Okay,</v>

531
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.680
<v 2>well there are no,
you can't have any more hydrogens on that one,
right?</v>

532
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.800
So if you brought in hydroxide,
at this stage

533
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.920
it would attack the carbon eel.
Right?

534
00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.460
But when it does that,
you could imagine the Eoh coming off again.

535
00:40:02.461 --> 00:40:05.970
Although it's not such a good leaving group,
there's a better leaving group.

536
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:07.590
What's the better leaving group?

537
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.430
See I three with three halogens on the carbon.

538
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:18.030
It's a sufficiently good an iron that it can leave.

539
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.280
So we can unzip and that direction.

540
00:40:20.281 --> 00:40:25.281
One of these association dissociation mechanisms and get that because the,

541
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.920
the PKA of,
of,
uh,
of,

542
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:33.950
and then of course you want to transfer the Proton,
uh,
the PKA of,
of the,

543
00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:38.250
uh,
Hci three is about 14,
so it's more acidic than water is.

544
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.020
Okay.
Now that's neat because that compound I odo form,

545
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:46.620
remember CHC all three as chloroform.
This is iota form,

546
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.350
but whereas chloroform is a colorless liquid,

547
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.760
I oto form is a yellow solid.
Right?

548
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.230
So this provided in the days before there was a Nmr,

549
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:03.510
like if you had a methyl ketone,
now you'd look for a methyl singlet,
right?
At a,

550
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.860
shifted down,
a shifted down field,
right?
At a certain position.

551
00:41:07.861 --> 00:41:12.450
We know from Nmr how you'd identified it in the,
in the,
uh,
Carbon Nmr,

552
00:41:12.451 --> 00:41:16.170
you'd look at a particular place,
right?
But in the days before,

553
00:41:16.171 --> 00:41:18.540
there was spectroscopy to identify these things.

554
00:41:18.541 --> 00:41:20.640
How would you know if you had a methyl ketone?

555
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:26.010
You reacted it in water with bass and I iodine and see whether you get a bright

556
00:41:26.011 --> 00:41:30.770
yellow solid.
So this is a picture,
uh,
uh,

557
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.610
what you want is,
it isn't a,

558
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.610
I can't remember what just went chair and you can see here at two test tubes.

559
00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:40.130
This one had a methyl ketone in it.
That one didn't.

560
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:45.200
This one has a yellow precipitate.
So that was a handy way of,
of uh,

561
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.010
of identifying methyl ketones in the days before spectroscopy.

562
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:51.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

563
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:55.960
<v 2>Now you can do it with,
you can do this Alpha halogenation with other,</v>

564
00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.550
uh,
carbon eel groups as well.
For example,
carboxylic acids.

565
00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.230
So we've seen before that you could make a,
an acid chloride in this way.

566
00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:07.000
And since I had it animated,

567
00:42:07.001 --> 00:42:10.030
I decided to put it here so you can review it if you want to.

568
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.130
Right?
And that's how you get the acid chloride.
Okay.
Um,

569
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.450
<v 1>yeah,</v>

570
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.310
<v 2>but the,
one of the most,
uh,</v>

571
00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:29.060
charmingly named reactions is the hell Volart Zelinski reaction sometimes called

572
00:42:29.641 --> 00:42:31.860
the HV z reaction.
But if you remember,

573
00:42:31.861 --> 00:42:36.360
Ha Hell Volart Zelinski that's another one you can impress your,
your,
uh,

574
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.960
roommates with.
So it was held,

575
00:42:38.961 --> 00:42:43.050
did it first and then volart and then Zelinski at about two year intervals,

576
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:48.120
a flanking 1885 so the hell ards Linsky,

577
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:52.980
I forget whether I've got this animated here,
are not involves PBR three

578
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:55.500
and bromine.

579
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:02.760
So the same way that SOCL to can,
can make an acid chloride from an acid.

580
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:07.710
So can PBR three in the,
so the HV z reaction,

581
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.110
a carboxylic acid

582
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:14.520
reacts with PBR three.

583
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:19.350
So you have the acid chloride or bromide.

584
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:22.620
<v 1>Right.</v>

585
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.950
<v 2>But the acid bromide is very good at forming an anal.</v>

586
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.550
And if you have bromine present,

587
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:42.790
<v 1>yeah,</v>

588
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.810
<v 2>bromine can attack the,</v>

589
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.480
a double bond because the cad ion will be stabilized with oxygen next door.

590
00:43:58.930 --> 00:43:59.763
<v 1>Oh.</v>

591
00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.260
<v 2>So then when you lose the Proton,</v>

592
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.290
<v 1>okay.</v>

593
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.800
<v 2>You have Alpha Broman nation,
Roman nation adjacent.</v>

594
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:11.910
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

595
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:13.110
<v 2>So the carbon nailed group.</v>

596
00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:19.010
So this was easy to do because the [inaudible] acid bromide is good at forming

597
00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:23.780
the,
uh,
anal.
But now it looks like you would need a store.

598
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.770
You need to keep making the acid bromide in order to,

599
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:32.610
to continue doing this reaction.
But in fact,
this could be catalytic.

600
00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:37.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

601
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.270
<v 0>Why couldn't it be catalytic?
Why do you need only a little bit?</v>

602
00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:44.530
You need a full mole of this of course,
because this can react with acid.

603
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.910
Uh,
uh,
I said,
yeah.

604
00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

605
00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:02.840
<v 0>So it displaces the bromide and we have br,</v>

606
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.540
so the brominated product,

607
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.900
but now in the form of an acid and hydride.

608
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:13.243
<v 1>Okay.</v>

609
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:17.200
<v 0>My different,
uh,
acid derivative.</v>

610
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.630
But we also have br minus

611
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.753
<v 1>yeah.</v>

612
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.700
<v 0>Which could attack here</v>

613
00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:33.110
<v 1>and
then,
uh,</v>

614
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.830
<v 0>yeah,
then this comes,
let's see.
Oh yeah.</v>

615
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:44.710
And uh,
what have I done wrong?
Oh,
I'm losing the,

616
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:49.040
yeah.
Uh,
right.
And then,
uh,
yeah,
back here,

617
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.920
because I didn't have the br,
I wasn't thinking,
right?

618
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:53.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

619
00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:01.690
<v 0>So now we have the acid plus the other product you can see is br.</v>

620
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.700
So we traded,
which one was acid bromide in which one was carboxylic acid.

621
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.520
Right.
So now that's,

622
00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:21.560
this can give this and this is that this is a cycle that goes around.

623
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:23.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

624
00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:27.680
<v 0>So you only need this to get that started to get the first bromide and the</v>

625
00:46:27.681 --> 00:46:29.540
subsequent bromides can come from that.

626
00:46:29.541 --> 00:46:34.541
And the actual product then ultimately is h plus came off here

627
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.250
of the ultimate product is the Alpha brominated acid.

628
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

629
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:54.330
<v 0>Uh,
I was hoping I'd get further than this.
I'm going to go,
well,</v>

630
00:46:54.331 --> 00:46:57.510
let's see.
Yeah,
I'll go,
uh,
just this slide.

631
00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.460
So Alpha alkylation

632
00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:08.160
we promised before that that the real advantage of having these,

633
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:09.803
uh,

634
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.770
carbon nuclear files is the possibility of putting an art group on there.

635
00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:21.640
So,
um,
so you do this with,
with,
uh,

636
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.090
uh,
I have here.

637
00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.110
So you use a base,
you get an analyte

638
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.460
<v 1>okay?</v>

639
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.670
<v 0>From your ketone Aldehyde.</v>

640
00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

641
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.910
<v 0>And now this,
you react with something like methyl iodide,</v>

642
00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.300
so,
and electrophilic carbon sigma star.

643
00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:02.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

644
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.060
<v 0>And you can make a new carbon carbon bond alpha.</v>

645
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:11.670
So the same way we could put roll mean an Alpha or hydrogen and Alpha,

646
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.420
uh,
we can put a methyl in Alpha,

647
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:17.893
right?

648
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:23.510
But there's a problem here because we also have the possibility that could react

649
00:48:23.611 --> 00:48:24.444
here.

650
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:36.680
So,
which nucleophile wins is the question.
Um,

651
00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.580
I think I probably should let you go now and Wella go onto the resolve the

652
00:48:45.141 --> 00:48:47.860
perils of Pauline and next time.
Okay.
