00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.480
GEORGIOS MOSCHIDIS: The subject that I'm in?
General relativity.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.920
I first met my adviser,
Mihalis, in Greece.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.400
And while I was an undergraduate student,
he came to give a talk at the University that

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.300
I was in.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.640
MIHALIS DAFERMOS: Several professors from
the National Technical University came up

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.980
to me and said, you know, there was a student
who was sitting in your talk.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.090
You should really take that student to Princeton.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.760
GEORGIOS MOSCHIDIS: It was the first talk
about mathematical general relativity that

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.860
I went to in my life.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.700
And I was really fascinated about the subject.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.820
MIHALIS DAFERMOS: It didn't take long for
me to be convinced that we should certainly

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.270
accept him at Princeton.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.829
And the difficulty would be competing for
him to come to Princeton.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.489
GEORGIOS MOSCHIDIS: Exactly, because I want
to do general relativity, Princeton was the

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.940
best place for this subject.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.829
These are called Einstein's equations.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.600
These are the equations that Einstein wrote
down, in 1915, in his paper about general

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
relativity.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.699
On the left hand side, these are terms which
somehow describe the geometry of space.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.250
These are terms which describe gravity, if
you want.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.960
And on the right hand side, you have terms
which come from the matter.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.950
This is the energy, in terms of
matter at a certain point.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.700
So this equation actually tells us how the
presence of matter, at some point in the universe,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.369
determines the gravity around this point.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.600
MIHALIS DAFERMOS: Mathematics is a very rigid
subject.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.170
You have to prove theorems.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.650
As much as you want to prove the theorem,
if the theorem doesn't want to be proved,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.070
you're not going to prove it.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.840
And some theorems are very, very difficult.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.450
Some problems are easy to state but they spent
hundreds of years, maybe more, in the category

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.450
of unsolved.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.390
Georgios solved that problem.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:01.960
He showed that a sort of arbitrarily small wiggle
in the dust is sufficient, eventually, to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.200
create a black hole.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.009
GEORGIOS MOSCHIDIS: Even the presence of moments
when you think you've solved something, but

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.009
then turns out that this was wrong, these,
psychologically, they are also important,

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.820
because they motivate you to dig deeper into
the problem.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.900
So, this is also counted as progress.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.940
