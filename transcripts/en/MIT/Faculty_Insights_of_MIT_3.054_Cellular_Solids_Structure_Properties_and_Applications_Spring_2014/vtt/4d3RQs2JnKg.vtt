00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.650
PROFESSOR: So
typically in the course

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.630
we start off talking
about the structure

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.360
of these cellular materials.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.500
We do some modeling of honeycomb
and foam type materials,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.460
and that takes not
quite half the term,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.270
but most of the first
part of the term anyway.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.850
And I give them
more problem sets

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.975
at the beginning of the
term, and they don't really

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:30.840
start on the projects
at the beginning.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.600
So I give them some background
information to get them going.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.010
And I assign the project at
the beginning of the course,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.550
and I think there's
three kind of deadlines.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.810
One is they have to
give me a proposal.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.292
I think that's typically
about a month into the course,

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:46.750
and that can be
fairly brief, but I

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.690
want to at least know
they've got a team.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.720
They've got an idea.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.470
They've got some idea
of how they're going

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.950
to carry out their project.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.720
Then in about another
month they have

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.465
to send me a sort of update on
the project, and by that point,

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:01.840
I would have expected them,
if they're doing a literature

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.792
review, to start
reading some papers

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:06.000
and be able to tell me
something about the background

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.849
to their project.

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:08.390
If they're doing
experiments, I would

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.910
have expected them to at
least gone into the lab

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.290
and maybe made some materials,
or bought some materials,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.880
and done some preliminary tests.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.360
And I give them
feedback at that point.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.130
And at the end of the term,
they hand in the final project.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.020
And I see them twice
a week in class,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.530
and I don't really have a formal
recitation, but what I do do

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.626
is every week that a problem
set is due I have office hours.

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:36.750
And in fact, I don't actually
have it in my office.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.560
I book a room, and we
do a little tutorial.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.650
So there's times
throughout the term

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.530
they can see me and come
and ask me questions

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.630
about the project as well.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.480
So the question is what kind of
feedback do I give the students

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.209
and how do they interact
with me on the projects,

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.750
and typically there's about 20
students that take the course.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.510
So if they do it in pairs,
there's roughly 10 projects.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.000
Some of the projects students
just do literature searches,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.049
and I don't really get
that involved with those.

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.090
They're perfectly capable
of going to the library

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.830
and doing a literature search.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.580
And some of the students
who are taking it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.560
are graduate students, and
they often do finite element

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.550
numerical calculations.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.180
And again, I give them some
advice about how to set it up,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.170
but often they have
experience doing this,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.150
and it's sort of applying
what they already

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.710
know to something new, but
they kind of know what to do.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.810
The way I get the most
involved is if students

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.740
do experimental projects.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.200
So for instance, in this
elephant skull project,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.200
I had this connection at the
Museum of Comparatives Zoology,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.665
and I took the student up there.

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:45.990
They had this idea
about 3D printing it,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.190
and we have a 3D printer
in the department.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.120
And one of the technical
staff, Mike Tarkanian,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.670
is very, very good
with the students

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.690
and very helpful in getting
them set up on the 3D printer,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.640
so he helps with that.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.369
And I give them sort
of general advice.

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:02.910
When they said now
we want to measure

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.910
some sort of
acoustical response,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.750
I suggested maybe
you could suspend it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.010
from a wire, or
thread, or something

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.880
and then put an accelerometer
and measure the vibrations.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.210
So I try to give them some
general advice like that,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.310
but they then carry the
experiment out themselves.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.450
They have to figure out how to
actually put it into practice

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.777
and how to do it.

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:23.610
And I think they get a
big kick out of that.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.990
MIT students enjoy that kind
of thing so that's kind of fun,

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.680
and obviously I was
very delighted too

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.090
with this elephant
skull project.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.700
So there's different
things I try

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.249
to help with-- mostly giving
general advice about how

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.915
they can do their
experimental projects.

00:03:42.994 --> 00:03:44.410
So what are some
of the challenges

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.974
that students encounter
in their projects.

00:03:46.974 --> 00:03:48.890
So I think one thing is
students sometimes are

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.500
little over ambitious in
what's possible to accomplish,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.000
because typically we have to
cover some material before they

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.390
can even start the project.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.360
So typically they
don't start the project

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.760
until a month or six
weeks into the term,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.980
and the term is only three
months long more or less.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.810
And so they really have a fairly
limited amount of time-- maybe

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.560
six weeks or eight
weeks, something

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.440
like that-- to actually
do the project.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.440
So if they want
to make materials,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.529
if they want to do some sort
of processing to make a foam,

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.839
for example, they don't
really have a lot of time,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.220
because often it takes
some trial and error

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.810
to be able to do that.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.900
So the projects have
to be fairly focused

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.130
so that they can actually get
something interesting out of it

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.996
in a fairly short
amount of time.

00:04:32.996 --> 00:04:34.370
And sometimes
students might want

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.390
to do something where they
would have to order materials,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.750
and it may take a few weeks
for the materials to come in.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.210
So again, I try
to discourage them

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.150
from doing projects where
there's going to be a long lead

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.100
time on getting some
critical thing that they

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.410
need for the project.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.502
So there are some limitations,
partly because of just the time

00:04:52.502 --> 00:04:53.960
we have for them
to actually do it.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.810
And they're not just
taking my course.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.476
They're taking other
courses, so there's

00:04:57.476 --> 00:05:00.570
sort of a limited amount of
time they can spend on it, too.
