11 years you know and I was into science

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299
11 years you know and I was into science
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.810
11 years you know and I was into science
and nature and I suppose I was a logical

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
and nature and I suppose I was a logical
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880
and nature and I suppose I was a logical
person and I thought yeah but I learned

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
person and I thought yeah but I learned
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.069
person and I thought yeah but I learned
it through body language I learned it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
it through body language I learned it
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.899
it through body language I learned it
through that human interplay between

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
through that human interplay between
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.840
through that human interplay between
these two people that one was worried

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
these two people that one was worried
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.980

about what the other one was going to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
about what the other one was going to
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.410
about what the other one was going to
tell me so I assumed that what my

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
tell me so I assumed that what my
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.200
tell me so I assumed that what my
brother had something big to tell me and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
brother had something big to tell me and
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.349
