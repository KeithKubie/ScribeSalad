00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
 . 

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.950
 I have sent an interesting question of algebra 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.760
 I think the question is not well formulated, or maybe it is 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.400
 Some information is missing 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.050
 But it is an interesting question though, so 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.340
 I think I will solve it. We can talk about why 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.150
 Which makes its wording unclassified 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.520
 If you give us a pairing (f (x 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.910
 It is considered to be the third-degree polynomial of the formula 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:28.020
 ax ^ 3 + bx ^ 2 + cx + d 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.280
 And give us a set of zeros for this polynomial 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.330
 And that we have zeros on point 1.0- and 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.150
 Point 2.0 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.360
 The intersection of y, y intersection 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.760
 Located on point 0, -2 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.320
 What is required of us is, what is the output of a + b + c + d? 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.330
 Suppose that if we can progress in this 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.830
 The first thing we can think about is, how 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.010
 It looks like a third-degree polynomial and what we mean 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.070
 When talking about zeros 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.430
 Let me draw a diagram 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.280
 I do not know exactly what form appears to be a third-degree polynomial 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.150
 It is still 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.840
 Let me paint the axis 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 Now the third-degree polynomial can contain three zeros 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.350
 Drainage is the points where 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.750
 Equals 0 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.730
 If we have 0 on point 1.0- 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.320
 This point is located here 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.640
 We have 0 on point 2.0 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.110
 1, 2, 0 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.530
 These are the saffron given to us 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.290
 I also give us that the intersection y falls on point 0, -2 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.720
 Intersect with y axis here 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.200
 But it can contain three zeros 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.270
 Now some of them can be compounded 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.750
 But the composite zeros come in pairs 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.980
 No married couple 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.710
 I do not want to go into details now 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.630
 If this must be zero real third, because if it is the third zero 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.060
 Composite, you will need to zero another composite, and 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.920
 You can not get a fourth zero in the third-degree polynomial 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.760
 Since its third root, it can be used somewhere 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.460
 Here, maybe here 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.910
 Or it can be bis for one of these two 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.850
 The two roots here 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.890
 But let's assume that we have a third root 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.260
 We do not know how it looks 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.610
 Let 's suppose it looks - suppose 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.410
 The third root is located somewhere here 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.550
 Then its representation is possible, and I can be completely wrong 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.750
 I suppose, but until we get the meaning 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.980
 For the form of a third - degree polynomial, how can we represent a graphic that intersects with 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.160
 X axis three times, the possible graphic representation will appear 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.880
 So 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.305
 Curves, infect another zero, afflicting y axis 

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:40.530
 Then come back 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.040
 Maybe he'll go that way, maybe he'll go the other way, so 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 Up then down 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.920
 Well, there are several ways you can paint something out 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.580
 Bend twice to intersect with these three points 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.870
 And y that cross also, but I will not order 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.720
 These are all now 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.190
 But let's see if we can find transactions here 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.590
 If the key point here is it 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.250
 There must be a third zero 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.600
 Let me name it with the third zero, and it is located on the point, located on 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.470
 The point - let's call it - r3,0 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.390
 Use r to denote roots 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.890
 The roots are x values ​​for the expanse 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.950
 If we say that f (-1) = 0, we will say that x 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.720
 = -1 is a root 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.360
 Similarly, we know that f (2) = 0 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.780
 Or we can say that x = 2 is a root, these are two roots 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.160
 When someone tells you about 0, it is also 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.360
 It tells you about the root, then we know it must be 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.300
 Third root on point x = r3 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.340
 If x = r3 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.980
 Now, if we have a third-degree polynomial where these three x values 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.570
 Make it 0, we can rewrite the third-degree polynomial 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.270
 So - we can rewrite it - I'll do it 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.820
 In a different color - f (x) = x + 1-- 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.300
 You'll see why you put x + 1 instead of x - 1 in 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:20.230
 Second - + 1 x x - 2 x x - r3 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.015
 We will put a abroad, and I will inform you 

00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:26.550
 Quickly because of my condition for a abroad 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.400
 Because if we want to multiply the words x only, when 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.370
 We distribute and multiply 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.260
 For these polynomials, you'll get x ^ 3, but we have 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.390
 ax ^ 3 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.360
 If we need it here for a constant until we turn it into a 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.100
 ax ^ 3 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.490
 Now, why did you write it this way? 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.520
 Well, if you put -1 here what will happen? 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.660
 This statement will become -1 + 1 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.850
 Which equals 0 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.210
 What will take care of this or what a 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.380
 Something will be 0 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.170
 If we put x = 2, this phrase 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.610
 Here will become 0 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.190
 Who will take care of the other phrase or to a 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.070
 (f) 2 will equal 0 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.360
 Similarly, when x = r3, this last statement is 0, from 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.170
 He will take care of anything here 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.550
 We know that this can be rewritten 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.520
 In this format 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.490
 If we can find r3 we can multiply this 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.370
 We try to make a matching pattern to find 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.760
 These transactions 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.100
 Now, the key to the other solution given to us is the intersection y 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.640
 That point, ie 0, -2 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.160
 Tell us that f (0) = -2 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.940
 Well, how much is equal to f (0? 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.730
 (f) 0 - I will write here - (f) 0 - if you put 0 here 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.420
 This statement will become 0, this statement will become 0, and that phrase will become 0 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.840
 And we have d 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.940
 If f (0) = d 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.760
 Or we can say that d should equal -2 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.530
 d = -2, so at least we found one 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.090
 Of effective communication 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.450
 The fixed term is d = -2 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.970
 Now, if d = -2, it means all these 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.740
 Fixed phrases, when you hit them with this 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.340
 The phrase, plus a, is because a measure 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.620
 Everything, it should equal -2 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.730
 Let me be clear here 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.910
 Let me rewrite this phrase 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.970
 That's worth it, I'll hit a this 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.740
 With the last phrase 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.400
 We can use any order we want, if this is equivalent to x 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:36.450
 + 1 x x - 2 x ax - r, please let me know 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.870
 Type 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.400
 This is equivalent to this thing at the top, will 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.860
 Type it using f (x), and this 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.460
 Equivalent to the above 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.560
 Now, in order to find R3, or try to find R3 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.540
 You should realize that when we multiply this 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.690
 The way to get a static statement here, or d 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.840
 Here, this will be a product 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.310
 For the fixed phrase in our phrases 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.920
 Because if any products are inserted by adding any of the x statements 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.870
 Here you will get one of these other phrases 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.300
 The phrase ax ^ 3 is generalized from that phrase, that phrase 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.320
 That phrase, mingled with each other 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.680
 Then the fixed phrase multiplied 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.790
 So that we can strike them together 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.080
 Then the 2 in the middle multiplied 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.260
 With different components of fixed phrases 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.460
 You'll see that if we want to 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.260
 We hit it 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:35.000
 But if you follow me in this way, that is, to strike this with this 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.340
 Actually let me write this way 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:43.820
 So, so that = d 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.550
 Then we can find a relationship between a and d 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.500
 Which equals -2 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:57.890
 So we can say that 1 × -2 × -3, these two 

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.050
 The two references are deleted 

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.170
 = Terms d 

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.110
 Which equals -2, so if we spread it 

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:14.720
 A little bit we'll get 2ar3 = -2, divide both ends 

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.755
 On 2a we get r3 = -1 / a 

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:21.320
 On 2a we get r3 = -1 / a 

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.010
 If we do not find the third root, we get it 

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.990
 In terms of coefficient a 

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:33.060
 But let's see if we can use it in a useful way 

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.710
 If r3 = -1 / a, how often does this phrase become? 

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.210
 Let me rewrite it 

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.260
 Let me rewrite it 

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.030
 Well, I'll write it in blue 

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:50.700
 f (x) = x + 1 x x - 2 x ax 

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.610
 - Now a × r3- 

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.250
 Let me write it here 

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.780
 a × r3 = -1 / a- 

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.340
 That negative signal × negative signal 

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.420
 It is a positive signal 

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.420
 The a 

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.210
 We get 1 

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.300
 If this is the case now, if we replace r3 with this 

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.140
 It becomes a, will become a + 1 

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.640
 a × -1 / a- = positive 1 

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.450
 Positive 1 

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.160
 We replaced it instead to get this 

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.790
 Now let's hit this 

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.120
 Let us carry out the forced beating 

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.130
 We see what we will get 

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.980
 I will strike these two words first 

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.580
 I will use a different color for that 

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.050
 Let me hit these two phrases here 

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:39.740
 This is equal to x ^ 2 + 1x 

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.400
 - 2x, this is an -x, is not it? 

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.235
 1 x x = x, -2 x x = x - 2x 

00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:53.110
 Ie -x, then -2, multiply 

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.940
 These two boundary variables 

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.000
 Then I would have to hit it with Ax + 1 

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.880
 I will write ax + 1 down here 

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.720
 So keep the space 

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.810
 ax + 1 

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.600
 Now I will do some forced beatings 

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.140
 1 x -2 = - I will do this purple - -2 

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.150
 1 x-x = x- 

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.690
 1 x x ^ 2 = x ^ 2 

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:26.820
 Now ax × -2 = -2ax 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.910
 2ax- 

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:37.680
 ax × -x = -ax ^ 2 

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.160
 ax ^ 2- then ax × x ^ 2 

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.020
 = ax ^ 3 

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.750
 ax ^ 3 

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.220
 Then we collect everything, and we get f (x) 

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.380
 = ax ^ 3 - Let me go to 

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.710
 Left slightly - ax ^ 3 

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.920
 x ^ 2 - ax ^ 2 

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:04.620
 This is equal to 1 - a, 1 - ax ^ 2 

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.360
 Then we have these two groups, so they become 

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:17.660
 -1 - 2a, or we can say = - -1 

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:25.890
 - 2a-- or we can say -1 + 2ax then 

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.090
 2, and this is logical because that is what d equals 

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.300
 That is d 

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.030
 That is the solution already 

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.410
 This is how the equation will be 

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.590
 The reason I said at the beginning of the matter is that 

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.270
 The equation or issue was not well defined is that 

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:48.430
 I can choose any real number for this equation 

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.280
 These conditions will be met by us 

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.270
 I suppose he did not give me all the restrictions 

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:54.940
 This issue 

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.930
 Perhaps there is a third restriction is a = 

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.990
 1, b = something else, or a + b 

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.860
 = Something else 

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.060
 But using these limitations, use these 

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.050
 Limitations, the formula will take this shape 

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.690
 If this is the case, of course this is a, and this is b 

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.800
 Which is 1 - a, that is b, and that is a, then 

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.540
 This is equal to c 

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.730
 You can choose, as you know, we can choose 

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.320
 One option is specific if we want to get an answer to the issue, but it is 

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.210
 Perhaps it will not be the expected answer to it 

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.670
 Maybe a different was chosen 

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.290
 But if you choose a simple value like a = 1, then 

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.690
 How much will b? 

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.750
 b will be 1 - a, equal to 0 

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.730
 Ie that b = 0, then that c = - in fact that c 

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.530
 That negative sign would include - c would be 1 + 2a 

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.470
 2a = 2, 1 + 2 = 3 

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.790
 We put a negative signal 

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.920
 If c is equal to -3 

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.280
 Of course it does not matter what to do, where d 

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.480
 Will equal -2 

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.230
 If we choose a = 1, the answer here to a question is a result of a 

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:07.970
 b + c + d +, will be + 1 -3 

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.410
 1 + -3 = -2 

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.530
 -2 - 2 = -4 

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.110
 That is another possibility, but we can easily 

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.310
 We choose it, you know that a can be something, it can be 

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.630
 Break, can be anything 

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.310
 Could be, you know a can be -1 

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.990
 A can be equal to -1, and if it is a = -1, then the b 

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.930
 = 2, hence b = 2, is not it? 

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.400
 1 

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.790
 Then that c = 1 - 2, ie -1, but 

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.400
 We have a negative signal abroad 

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.040
 Then that c = 1, then that d is always 

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.230
 Will equal -2 

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.930
 d = -2 

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:53.020
 Then we have a + b + c + d = 

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.350
 Well, these two are deleted, and they become 0 

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.110
 We do not know exactly what the answer is 

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.500
 The author of the matter is looking for it, but it is an interesting issue 

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.530
 As you know, out of curiosity - let us take this 

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.750
 The first example we took - as a = 1 

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.280
 Thus we can look at how root must be 

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.470
 If it is a = 1, therefore the third root is r3 

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.790
 For this case here - r3 

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.330
 It will equal 1/1 which equals 

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.410
 -1, which means that we will have a duplicate root 

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.940
 We will have a duplicate root here 

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.830
 We do not need a distinctive root here 

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.730
 If we are curious to see how it looks, let's 

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.130
 Look at the case where a = 1 

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.280
 In fact maybe we'll look at both 

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.710
 When a = 1, the equation is x ^ 3 

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:54.140
 - button x - x ^ 3, none 

00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:03.040
 The expression x ^ 2, - 3x - 3x, - 3x, - 2 

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.880
 Let's take them together 

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.160
 This is where we chose this option 

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.210
 For laboratories 

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.760
 Then let's deal with this option for transactions, if we have, if 

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:23.270
 We had x ^ 3-, right? a = -1 + 2x ^ 2 

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:31.350
 Then we have, + x - c = 1 - then + x - 2 

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.520
 So that's what we've discussed 

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.370
 Let's see how they look 

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.640
 Let us represent them graphically 

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.500
 If first, let's start, we've got that point 

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.500
 That is the double root 

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.200
 Note that both of these graphs are done 

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.480
 Restraints 

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.790
 Both have a root on -1 

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.310
 Both have a y-junction on y = -2 

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.780
 Both have a root on x = 

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.420
 Positive 2 

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.480
 Now the second, has a distinct and separate third root 

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.960
 While the first, here, possess a double root 

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.000
 Here 

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.230
 Anyway, I think the issue was 

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.850
 Some enjoyable thing was where we had to look 

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.240
 Different solutions 

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.030
 In fact, we have an infinite number of solutions 

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.180
 Its based on the value of a which we choose
