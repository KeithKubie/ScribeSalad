Check it out, kids. Here's the Concept Map for

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.810
Lesson 7. And notice that it makes connections to

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.630
all the other lessons in the course. Print it

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.510
out or keep it handy and see if you

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.610
can figure out what belongs in the blanks. At

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.130
the end of the lesson you can test how

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.260
well you're paying attention. As always, a complete version

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.200
of the map can be found at the very end.
