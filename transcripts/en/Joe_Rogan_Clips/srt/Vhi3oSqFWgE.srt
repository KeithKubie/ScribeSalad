1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,820
Here's an interesting idea.
Why do we die at all?

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,120
Why is natural selection never
given us an immortal species?

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,150
Have you ever thought about
that? Yeah. Yeah, I have.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,150
I have never reached a conclusion,
but I always figured you live long enough.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll, especially up until recent
history, only long enough to recognize it.

6
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,300
It was all crazy hustle.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,570
It's a more philosophical, I'm looking
for a scientific answer. Here's,

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,560
here's one answer for why we're not
immortal. So if you think about it,

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,400
why would natural selection not have
created a creature that lived forever,

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,320
right? That'd be why. Why should we die?
Yeah. Okay, so here's the one answers.

11
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,110
It's not knowing for sure if this is
the answer, but this is a good answer.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,530
Imagine there's the two different
kinds of things that can kill you.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,770
Intrinsic Causes,
an extrinsic causes,

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,790
so things inside your body that
result in you dying, defects,

15
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,750
diseases and so forth, or things
outside your body, like accidents,

16
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:01,230
lightening strikes, trees fall,
and you just die and so forth

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,290
because it's impossible to eliminate
all extrinsic causes because some people

18
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,210
are going to die from accidents.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,070
It would be inefficient from the point
of view of evolution to evolve to be

20
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:17,640
immortal. Because we would have
all this capacity to be immortal.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,070
We would have these body's
capable of immortality,

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,320
which let's say would be
evolutionarily demanding,

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,180
like to evolve anything like
an I or a brain or strong,
any, any quality, lactase,

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,370
right? We, like we talked
about earlier, you,

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,480
you don't have lactase persistence
into adulthood because it's not needed.

26
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:36,060
So evolution doesn't waste anything.
There'd be no reason for that.

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,280
So there'd be no that there would,
uh, there, there would be no reason.

28
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:46,281
The argument goes to evolve in mortality
because inevitably some people would be

29
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,520
killed eventually by accidents anyway.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
So unless you can create a world
in which there are no accidents,

31
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,130
there are no extrinsic causes of death,

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,720
it would be inefficient from an
evolutionary point of view to evolve in

33
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,780
mortality. So death, the
reason we die naturally,

34
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,980
some people think is that the reason
we die naturally is that there are

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,460
unnatural causes of death in the world,
like accidents.

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,340
If we could eliminate the unnatural
causes so that nowhere, no,

37
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,380
no time ever where we ever killed by
trees falling or lightening strikes or

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,740
things like that.

39
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,170
Then actually over time we would
evolve to live indefinitely.

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,940
This is the theory.
It's crazy idea is fascinating,

41
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:38,550
but do you think that nature had
that sort of sort of foresight?

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,040
He was not a foresight,
but that's how natural selection works.

43
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,120
Think about like if I have suddenly
magically transformed your body at great

44
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:49,560
expense to make you capable of immortality
and then two days from now you're hit

45
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:54,360
by a bus. I've wasted all that effort.
But if you only done to one person,

46
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,610
you wasted that effort.
If you did it to other people,

47
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:00,880
you have the potential to
create an incredibly wise
person with a thousand years

48
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,940
of life and experience and
education and learning die.

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,900
He also had guy so everyone eventually
would die for in these extrinsic causes.

50
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:11,380
So perhaps lot, well, no, that's, that's,
that's the assumption in the model.

51
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,640
If it's not,
perhaps if in fact there are no extrinsic,

52
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,350
if in fact there is a world in which
you're never struck by lightning,

53
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,290
never hit by a bus, never a
tree branch. Right. Then, uh,

54
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,830
then the theory is that we would
have evolved to be a mortal.

55
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:26,470
So that's almost like the,
the life that you live,

56
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:29,740
you're inevitably going to get
killed by extrinsic causes. Yes.

57
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,570
If you extend that life
to a thousand years,

58
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,690
then it's absolutely going to
happen. Yes. Therefore, why bother?

59
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,300
That's just living in a bubble.

60
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:41,320
Just terrified of the world falling
rocks language in the entry. Yeah.

61
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,350
But you can't transport,

62
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,790
you can't take this theory and this
model and apply it to an individual in an

63
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,130
individual life.
It's about our species evolved.

64
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:51,010
It's not about how you should live
your life. I mean, it's also true.

65
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:54,310
I don't think you should
live your life afraid.
