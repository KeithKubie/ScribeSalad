00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.035
Are you guys ready to get kicked

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.036
in the emotions?

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.471
Well, tomorrow is the 77th

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.039
birthday of possibly the best

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:07.107
known Christian Republican

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.041
martial arts-turned Internet

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.076
meme, Charles Norris.

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:10.077
&gt;&gt; Ooh.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:11.111
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Uh, sometimes know

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:12.112
as Chuck.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:15.215
(applause and cheering)

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.283
There he is.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.317
These days, Chuck-- seen here

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.418
deciding which audience member

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.188
to punch through the screen--

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.189
spends his days relaxing on his

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.524
Lone Wolf Ranch and selling his

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.125
new brand of bottled water--

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.126
CFORCE.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.662
(laughter)

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:29.763
That's a real thing.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.164
Chuck makes his own water by

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.266
punching clouds and making

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.267
nature cry.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:34.268
(laughter)

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.269
(applause and cheering)

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.571
And...

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.240
CFORCE!

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.441
I got to believe "CFORCE" was

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.776
also his Wu-Tang name.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:43.844
Right? That feels like that's

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.179
probably a thing.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:46.346
(laughter)

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.347
Let's see.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.815
Which one is he?

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:49.816
Oh, there he is.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.151
&gt;&gt; He's in the middle.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.152
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Now to us, Chuck

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.153
will always be the Internet's

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:54.488
ultimate badass, with Chuck

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:55.856
Norris facts detailing how Chuck

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.691
Norris once beat a wall at

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:59.426
tennis, and "Chuck Norris can

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.460
strangle you with a cordless

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.461
phone."

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.630
But at 77, Chuck is well into

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.365
Old Man Logan territory.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:06.366
So, comedians, I would like you

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.367
to give me an Old Man Chuck

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.368
Norris fact.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.369
Anyone can buzz in.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.404
Matt Braunger.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:11.405
&gt;&gt; Chuck Norris lowers his

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.240
cholesterol... to the ground by

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.141
punching it in the face!

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.142
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yeah. Very good.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:16.143
Points.

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:17.377
(applause and cheering)

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.412
Nick Simmons.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:19.513
&gt;&gt; When he pees, it burns...

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:20.581
through the center of the earth.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.582
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yes, points.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.583
(applause and cheering)

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.684
Very good.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:24.685
Colton.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.153
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Chuck Norris's balls

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:27.154
don't get lower as he ages.

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.155
They get higher.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.156
They're currently under his

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.157
chin.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:31.158
(laughter)

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:32.159
(applause and cheering)

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.794
He can tea-bag himself.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:34.228
(laughter)
