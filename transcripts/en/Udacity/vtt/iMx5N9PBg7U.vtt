00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, what happens if there is more than two charges--for instance three.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
How do we use this equation to find the potential energy of this system.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We have three charges all separated by 1 m and this one is +2, this one -3, and this one is +4c.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
One thing not to be confused by is the fact that even though this is q1 and q2

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that is not saying that this formula exclusively applies to q1 here and q2 there.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I just happen to label this charge q1 and this charge q2.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I could have labeled this one q7 and this one q? and this one q smiley face, but I didn't.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This equation just means that for any pair of charges, there's potential energy stored

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and this one and two just referred to the two charges in that pair.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If we want to calculate the potential energy of this system, we have to calculate the energy associated

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
with this pair of charges, this pair, and that pair.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We'll have to make three calculations.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Could you tell me what is the potential energy stored in this system of three charges,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and you can enter your answer here and I've already included the

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
