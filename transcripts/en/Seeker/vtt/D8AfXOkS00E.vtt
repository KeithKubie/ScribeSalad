00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.529
Ancient Egyptians believed the burial tomb
should contain everything needed for the afterlife,

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.610
so Kings were buried with gold, food, beer,
weapons, even pets!

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.639
But what about Ladies of the Court?

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.180
Where they at, tho?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:24.320
One of the most famous Pharaohs of Egypt was
(and is) King Tut. But Tutankhamun's mother,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.679
Nefertiti is a far more intriguing political
and cultural figure to Egyptologists. She

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:35.000
is legendary for her beauty, but also because
she, and her husband Akhenaten, turned Egypt

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.410
toward the cult of Aten the Sun God and away
from polytheism.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.210
Nefertiti died before Tut, and no one knew
where she was buried (though they've been

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.200
looking for decades) and technology may have
finally revealed Nefertiti was hiding in plain

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200
sight this whole time!

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.910
In a paper titled "The Burial of Nefertiti?"

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.210
Lead researcher Nicholas Reeves writes that
he believes Nefertiti is buried IN TUT'S TOMB.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.670
Or more accurately, Tut was buried in Nefertiti's.
He believes there is a secret chamber behind

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.040
an elaborately painted wall in Tut's burial
chamber which houses the legendary Queen.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.509
Tut's tomb is highly trafficked by tourists,
so to protect the original from human destruction,

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.740
a Spanish company took high-resolution photos
of the hieroglyphs and paintings and created

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.670
a reconstruction. Looking at those photos,
Reeves discovered fissures in the wall which

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.340
might hide secret doors. Obviously, they couldn't
go in and break down the walls, so instead,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.560
the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities scanned
the room with infrared thermography. Essentially,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.729
scientists and engineers measured the surface
temperatures of the walls with infrared cameras;

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.380
two sections of the walls were cooler, meaning
there is space behind them!

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.640
Reeves believes one is a storeroom, and the
other -- NEFERTITI'S LOST BURIAL CHAMBER.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.270
More research is needed before they can determine
if Nefertiti's Tomb is back there, or if they'll

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.080
cut into the wall to find her, but wow. This
could be huge. I love the idea that technology

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.849
is making archaeologists drool. In a "Scan
Pyramids" joint effort by Cairo University,

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.890
the University of Laval in Quebec and Nagoya
University in Japan, researchers pointed these

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.099
infrared thermography scanners at the Great
Pyramid at Giza; and after only two weeks

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.980
may have found ANOTHER undiscovered tomb!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.629
While normally, variation in external stone
temperatures are only about point-1 to point-5

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.430
degrees, in one area the stones were SIX degrees
different. The researchers think they can

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.680
use lasers, drones and infrared scanners to
get a picture of the internal structure of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.040
the pyramid without drilling and destroying
part of the historical building.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.980
Advances in technology help archaeologists
gather information about ancient and fragile

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.590
artifacts without destructively manipulating
them by cutting them open or moving ancient

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.650
bones. The lasers they mention are probably
LIDAR -- or Light Detection and Ranging tech.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.860
Using laserlight, archaeologists can get super-accurate
measurements of historical sites, which let

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.930
them create 3-D models. These computer models
can reveal details about construction, building

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.840
techniques, especially sensitive bits, or
areas for further exploration.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.830
Drones and robots can also help get scans
or images from hard-to-reach places; back

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.830
in the 90s, a tiny crawling robot was sent
into a tiny, undisturbed burial chamber in

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.830
the Great Pyramid.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.440
Even satellites are put to work in the hunt
for our history. 400 miles (644km) above the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.489
Nile's shores, infrared satellite pictures
revealed 17 buried pyramids, 3,000 settlements,

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.980
and 1,000 tombs across Egypt. This took many
hundreds of hours of trial and error, but

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.349
newer techniques are looking at AI systems
to find these settlements…

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:53.159
Though there's no substitute for getting in
there with a brush, magnifying glass and phalanges;

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.599
archaeologists are finding technology to be
a powerful ally. I love this stuff.
