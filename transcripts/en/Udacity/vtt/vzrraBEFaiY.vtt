So files are objects that we can write into and read from. Before we can read or

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.750
write into a file we need to open it, and we can do that using the built in open

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.090
operation, which takes a file name and a mode and it returns an instance of a

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.892
file. File is a built-in type. The file name and mode are strings. The file name

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:24.231
identifies the file. So for example we could do open Passing in gim.py gimpy as

00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:30.709
the name of the file and as the mode we could pass in R for reading. As another

00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:37.924
example we can use a full path name so we could use users/dave/ log.out to write

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:43.090
to the file log.out. There are different modes that we can use for example if

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.500
this is really a log What might make more sense is instead of using just the w,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.980
which would replace what's there if you use w plus, it will append to what's in

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.953
the current logged it out file.
