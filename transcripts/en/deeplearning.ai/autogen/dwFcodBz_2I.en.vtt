00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 align:start position:0%

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 align:start position:0%
a black to like early 2000 I think not
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
a black to like early 2000 I think not
new<00:01:15.079><c> technology</c><00:01:15.259><c> was</c><00:01:15.740><c> really</c><00:01:16.130><c> really</c><00:01:16.280><c> hot</c>

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 align:start position:0%
yeah and but I was thinking probably I
 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and but I was thinking probably I
should<00:01:20.619><c> look</c><00:01:21.619><c> at</c><00:01:21.799><c> something</c><00:01:22.189><c> like</c><00:01:22.219><c> a</c><00:01:22.399><c> even</c>

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 align:start position:0%
should look at something like a even
 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.849 align:start position:0%
should look at something like a even
more<00:01:22.969><c> exciting</c><00:01:23.630><c> and</c><00:01:23.810><c> the</c><00:01:24.380><c> leaves</c><00:01:24.560><c> a</c><00:01:24.680><c> good</c>

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 align:start position:0%
more exciting and the leaves a good
 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.459 align:start position:0%
more exciting and the leaves a good
chance<00:01:25.070><c> that</c><00:01:25.219><c> I</c><00:01:25.430><c> I</c><00:01:25.609><c> was</c><00:01:26.149><c> taking</c><00:01:27.140><c> some</c><00:01:27.320><c> classes</c>

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 align:start position:0%
chance that I I was taking some classes
 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.730 align:start position:0%
chance that I I was taking some classes
that<00:01:27.799><c> you</c><00:01:28.070><c> pay</c><00:01:28.280><c> and</c><00:01:28.670><c> I</c><00:01:29.390><c> got</c><00:01:29.600><c> to</c><00:01:29.719><c> know</c><00:01:29.930><c> Tenley</c>

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 align:start position:0%
that you pay and I got to know Tenley
 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.029 align:start position:0%

so<00:01:31.070><c> later</c><00:01:31.340><c> he</c><00:01:31.579><c> became</c><00:01:31.969><c> my</c><00:01:32.149><c> PhD</c><00:01:32.659><c> advisor</c><00:01:32.990><c> so</c><00:01:33.740><c> and</c>

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
so later he became my PhD advisor so and

so later he became my PhD advisor so and
I<00:01:34.189><c> was</c><00:01:34.460><c> thinking</c><00:01:34.759><c> like</c><00:01:34.880><c> machine</c><00:01:35.270><c> learning</c><00:01:35.299><c> was</c>

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 align:start position:0%

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 align:start position:0%
insulate and improved yeah so so we
 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.110 align:start position:0%
