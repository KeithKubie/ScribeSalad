Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and I'm back!

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.740
Over the next ten weeks we're going to read a bunch of books together. I got some of them right here.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.720
We're going to read Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston, Lord of the Flies by William Golding (my least favourite book)

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.900
also Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison and a bunch of books that aren't currently on my bookshelf, including The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.040
and we're gonna round out our reading list this year with One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.200
some Shakespeare sonnets, and a personal favorite of mine, Sula by Toni Morrison.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.840
So I've talked a little bit in the past about how and why we read,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.140
but as we go into this course I'd ask you to consider one big question:

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.120
What in the heck do you mean when you talk about yourself?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.240
Like you -- and this is not a compliment exactly, just an observation -- are fiendishly complex.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.380
I mean, to borrow a phrase from Walt Whitman, you contain multitudes, right?

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.920
And a lot of the adjectives that other
people apply to you,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.380
like, for instance, maybe they say that you're smart or that you're stupid, are insufficient.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.760
Because you know that you are both smart AND stupid.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.240
There are some facets of the universe that you understand clearly and with depth and others that baffle you.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.900
so you aren't a collection of adjectives, at least not entirely.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.440
You also aren't a body.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.860
I mean, you have a body and if you didn't have it, you would cease to be you, but you aren't your body.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.800
Like, for one thing, there are pieces of you outside of your body.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.840
You affect your friends and your family.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.080
You also make things that live outside of you, from poetry to artwork to initials carved into trees.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.220
And, not to sound too much like my brother over at Crash Course Philosophy,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.680
but the more we think about this question of what constitutes you, the more vexing it becomes.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.920
There are of course many joys to reading literature, but chief among them to me is that literature is a way of exploring and explaining the self,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.300
of understanding how we come to identify
ourselves and other people as human.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.560
For lack of a better term, how are you going to make yourself up?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.940
And how are you going to understand the even more complicated worlds of other people?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.880
And what are you going to do if the world refuses to acknowledge your personhood?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.760
Those are some of the questions at the heart of the books that we're going to read,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.040
along with questions like, should you shoot your husband if he has rabies?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.080
Oh, love, you are so complicated and beautiful and deadly.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.240
Speaking of which, our first book will be Their Eyes Were Watching God.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.980
It's a great one, so get to reading it, and I'll see you next week!

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.440
