00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:08.856
&gt;&gt;Derek: The high school was
underperforming according

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:10.616
to the State's measures.

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.656
We were the fifth lowest performing
high school in New Hampshire.

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:17.186
&gt;&gt;Student: A con is some
students will not be happy

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:19.066
that their freedom will be taken away.

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:21.666
&gt;&gt;Derek: We wanted our
students to take more ownership

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.966
for the operation of the school.

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:25.416
&gt;&gt;Student: A pro would
be that the grades

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:27.636
that they're expecting is reasonable.

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:30.636
&gt;&gt;Derek: And so we began to
develop plans for a Site Council

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:32.566
to increase student engagement.

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:34.726
&gt;&gt;Tucker: Anybody got
anything else they want to add,

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:35.976
pro, con?

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:41.886
&gt;&gt;Tucker: At this time,
I can entertain a motion.

00:00:42.446 --> 00:00:43.016
All in favor.

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:46.866
&gt;&gt;Derek: Student voice was a key part

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:50.416
of rethinking what equity
among our students looked like.

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.506
And how they may have control.

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:57.226
We bring together this group of
key stakeholders to be a part

00:00:57.226 --> 00:00:58.706
in that decision-making process.

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.826
&gt;&gt;Teacher: There's going
to be a limit on the amount

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.006
of credits that could be earned.

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:03.566
&gt;&gt;Derek: Including the
overall course grade.

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.476
&gt;&gt;Derek: Surveys have
been sent out via email.

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:07.956
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I don't really
care about that part as much.

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:09.786
&gt;&gt;Tucker: Site Council is the
governing body of the school.

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:14.736
We're responsible for making any
changes to do with student procedures,

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:18.596
policies that aren't governed
by State or Schoolboard law.

00:01:19.226 --> 00:01:23.956
&gt;&gt;Derek: Site Council's made decisions
regarding the dress code, open campus,

00:01:24.386 --> 00:01:26.916
grades and grading policy,
the class schedule.

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:29.286
&gt;&gt;Derek: You know, with somebody,
I'll do the pros list if one

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:32.556
of the students wants to do
the cons, I'm happy to help.

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:35.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If you don't have
a passing grade in the class,

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:38.606
should you be allowed open campus,
was the question we were-- ?

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:42.976
&gt;&gt;Colby: We went over the current policy
using feedback that we came up with.

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:46.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We put out
a form for some data.

00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:50.946
&gt;&gt;Colby: In such a small environment
like this, actually having a voice,

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:53.756
and getting opinions from
everyone in the school,

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.686
it's pretty cool to be a part of that.

00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:58.656
&gt;&gt;Derek: What was the student consensus?

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:01.196
&gt;&gt;Colby: The students that
I talked to would agree

00:02:01.196 --> 00:02:06.256
that course grading would be-- should
be-- and hopefully will be a factor.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.716
&gt;&gt;Savannah: Most students in the
class, they have very loud opinions,

00:02:09.716 --> 00:02:12.236
but they won't tend to share
it with the rest of the school.

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:15.146
&gt;&gt;Savannah: Students have to be passing
their classes with a 2.5 or higher.

00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:16.676
I think that could be
factored in as well.

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:18.276
&gt;&gt;Tucker: I think that's a great idea.

00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:20.576
&gt;&gt;Savannah: So I figured that
the students could come to me,

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:21.756
so I can get their opinion.

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:23.746
And when I vote it's
not just my opinion.

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:25.576
It's my entire class'.

00:02:25.576 --> 00:02:26.906
&gt;&gt;Colby: Especially when
they start taking--

00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:29.936
&gt;&gt;Student: All of your
overall classes of the 2.5.

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:32.646
&gt;&gt;Derek: Through the discussions
that we're able to have here,

00:02:33.096 --> 00:02:35.956
we not only identified that
there needed to be a change,

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:38.876
but the Council really was the
voice for making that change.

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:43.056
&gt;&gt;Colby: At Site Council, me and
Miss Massey brought up a Proposal--

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:45.266
&gt;&gt;Tucker: After we make the
decision with the Council,

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:47.366
we go back to class meetings.

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:50.016
Definitely seems to work and
get information out pretty well.

00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:53.286
&gt;&gt;Student: Will this go into effect
next year, or is it happening this year?

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:57.106
&gt;&gt;Tucker: I like being able to work
with teachers, work with peers.

00:02:57.256 --> 00:02:58.006
&gt;&gt;Colby: Any other questions?

00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:03.286
&gt;&gt;Tucker: It's just easy to voice
input and have somebody listen.

00:03:03.656 --> 00:03:06.696
&gt;&gt;Student: Kind of rewards
the people who really did

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:07.366
that extra mile to try hard.

00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:07.966
&gt;&gt;Tucker: Yep.
