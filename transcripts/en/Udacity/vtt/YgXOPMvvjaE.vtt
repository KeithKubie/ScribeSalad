00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For our last shock absorber-related problem, we're going to be talking about damping,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So far when we've been talking about simple harmonic motion,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we've been assuming that the motion just continues forever in this nice sinusoidal pattern.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In real life, however, we have to deal with things like friction and losses to heat

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
when the springs move up and down.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In real life oscillations often look a lot more like this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
where they start out with a large amplitude just like before but the longer they continue to oscillate,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the smaller their amplitude become as they lose energy and this phenomenon is called damping.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, there are actually several different types of damping,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but for our problem, let's only consider this type of damping which we call under damping,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where the amplitude decays in this kind of exponential pattern.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
All right, now we're ready to move on to the problem.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Supposed the car here is damped, such that it loses 20.6% of its energy per cycle.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That means that after a car hit, say a bump, it will oscillate with some initial energy

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but after each cycle, a cycle being one pattern like this, it will lose 20.6% of its energy.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Looking at this situation a bit more mathematically,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we get this equation that the energy of the oscillator after (n) cycles,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is equal to 0.94 which is 1 minus 20.6% to the (ⁿ) times the initial energy E₀.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What this equation is saying is that after three cycles, for example,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the amount of energy left in the oscillator will be equal to 0.794³ times E₀.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
My question for you is, how many cycles does it take with this value n,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in order for the amplitude to decay to one half of its original value?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If for example, you said the answer was 4, that would mean that after complete oscillations,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
after four cycles, the amplitude of this oscillation would be reduced to one half its original value.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Put your answer here and round your answer to the nearest whole cycle.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Don't say 3.5, say 4 for example. So as a hint when you're solving this problem,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
you should keep in mind that the energy of the oscillator is

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
directly proportional to the amplitude squared, not just the amplitude.

00:02:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Keep that in mind when you're using this equation here. Good luck.
