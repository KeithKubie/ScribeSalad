00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.590
So, we made a few videos about relativity, and we've talked about how

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.819
distances change in relativity, we've talked about how time changes in relativity.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.680
So I thought I'd talk about something, which combines those two things together, which is how speed,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.440
which is distance divided by time, changes in relativity.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.300
In the previous videos, we made what we called a Gamma Trilogy because they all have this gamma factor in it.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Actually one of the interesting things, about the way speed transforms

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.200
is that the gammas all disappear, they all cancel out so there is no gamma in this gamma video.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.900
So, we need to think about how you made your speed, of course it's distance divided by time,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.980
but particularly how it changes depending on what reference frame you're in.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.580
So we need to think about how different people measure speed in different reference frames.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.360
And some of the classic kind of thought experiment you might do is you've got somebody on a train

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.200
I'll call this reference frame S'. and they're gonna roll a bowling ball, along the train

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.540
at some speed or other,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.500
and the train itself is moving so this whole reference frame is moving in this direction at some other speed v.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.220
The way you're on the train you'd measure the speed is that you'd see how far the bowling ball had gone in your reference frame,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.200
What should we call this?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.060
Δx: how far it's gone, Δx' because it's in your reference frame.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.000
and at what time you've measured that at, some time Δt' after you'd let go of the ball,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.740
and then you could actually measure the speed in your reference frame of that bowling ball is just how

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.760
far it's gone divided by the time it took to get there.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.780
That's the definition of speed, it's how far something's gone divided by the amount of time it took to get there.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.740
So that's in one reference frame, so then the question is what does the person in this reference frame, the other reference frame see?

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.740
And let's deal with the non-relativistic case first:

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.980
What are they gonna measure?

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.280
The distance that they'll measure that the ball has gone is going to be how far the bowling ball has rolled away from you plus how far you've moved down the line.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.860
That extra distance, how far the train has moved, depends on and is basically how fast the train was going.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.860
You're sort of adding it all on top of each other?

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.860
Yeah, exactly! That's all you're doing.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.900
So, that distance is vΔt.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.500
If the train is going at some speed v, and it has traveled for some time Δt, then the distance it has covered is just the speed times the time it has taken to do it.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.020
So, now we can put all this stuff together . . .

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:27.460
That says that Δx is equal to (how far you see the ball as having moved is) how far the train has moved, plus how far the ball has moved relative to the train.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.480
Just the sum of the two.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.080
And we can rearrange this in the non-relativistic case

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.460
to say that

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:42.300
Let's just divide through: Δx divided by Δt is equal to v plus Δx' divided by Δt.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.280
And in this non-relativistic case we don't have to worry about different people seeing different times . . .

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.060
So, it doesn't matter whether it's Δt or Δt', we can call it the same thing. It's all the same thing.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.540
Or, we can rewrite this again: it just says that

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.980
the speed you see the balls moving is equal to v.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.980
So that's Δx divided by Δt.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.280
Plus the speed that the person on the train sees the ball moving.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.920
And that, as you just said, is you basically just add the speed. The speed at which the bowling ball is moving is

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.820
the speed that the bowling ball is moving relative to the train plus the speed that the train is moving relative to you.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.040
That's the simple Galilean transformation, no relativity. Everything works in the way that we're used to it working.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.100
One of the things that get's people interested in relativity is that people say, you can't ever travel faster than light.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.440
So one obvious question you could ask is: why can't I just travel faster than light by just doing these kinds of additions?

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.800
Supposing the person on the train, instead of rolling a bowling ball, was actually shining a torch along the train

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.740
Then the torch beam would be traveling at the speed of light relative to them and then if you ask how fast the torch beam was travelling relative to you

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.600
Well, it would be the speed of light, plus the speed that the train is moving away from you, and that's faster than the speed of light.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.940
Unfortunately, relativity takes care of that, and it's not really the way that things work.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.760
So, we need to start again, but we need to do the problem properly with relativity.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.540
Unfortunately, my drawing is not quite up to the job, I suspect.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.820
And then we've got the other chaps in here.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.820
Moving along at some speed v.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.620
Previously the formula we had said that the distance that the bowling ball is down the line

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.380
is equal to the distance relative to the train plus

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.560
how far the train has moved.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.520
Now, the extra factor that we haven't put in yet is special relativity.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.380
And, what we saw before was that what special relativity does is enter these factors of γ (gamma).

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.980
And so this Galilean transformation that we had before is a little bit modified by an extra factor of γ.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.600
γ is 1 over the square root of 1 minus v squared over c squared.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:59.800
One of the things we know about relativity is that not only does the distance depend on the reference frame you're in, but actually the time depends on which reference frame you're in.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.380
And so we need the equivalent transformation for that.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.480
So, there are these things called Lorentz transformations . . .

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.840
That's the first of them

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.480
and this is the other transformation that we need.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.720
Turns out, these are the two Lorentz transformations that you need.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:20.220
Now we can say, what's the speed as measured from the person who is beside the track watching the train go by.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.940
And we just do the same thing that we did before.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.340
And the speed is just the distance divided by the time.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.020
So, we can just divide them with Δx divided by Δt.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.760
is equal to . . . now the γs (gammas) are going to cancel

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.220
because if we divide that by the other we end up with a γ on the top and a γ on the bottom.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.940
So, we can just cancel them out.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.380
I'll do a little bit of tidying up:

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.540
I'll divide top and bottom through by Δt'

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.660
So, I can just write this as,  Δx' over  Δt'.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:56.240
This is kinda the answer we wanted because  Δx over  Δt is the speed of the bowling ball or whatever it is being thrown along the train

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.560
As seen from the perspective of the person standing beside the train track.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.940
And  Δx' over  Δt' is the speed as seen from a person standing on the train.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.220
So, I can write that in terms of the "u"s and "u'"s we have before

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:18.480
This just says that u is equal to u' plus v divided by 1 plus, u'v divided by c squared.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.860
Which is the final answer in the non-relativistic limit.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.880
So, what we were looking at before, the Galilean transformation, both u' and v are small compared to the speed of light.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.240
That means this term is small. That's just 1 basically. . .

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.340
And that just says that the speed you see is just the sum of the ball relative to the train and the train relative to you.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.740
Which is the answer we had before. So, things all kind of come out right if things are going faster than the speed of light.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.800
Now let's do the more interesting case of where the relativity actually matters.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.620
And in particular let's go to the really extreme case of instead of rolling a bowling ball along the train, let's shine a light beam along the train.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.400
So, in that case, u', the speed of whatever it is is equal to the speed of light.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.020
And let's see what happens when we put that in there.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.380
So, in that case we end up with, if u' is equal to the speed of light . . .

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.640
Then u is equal to c (the speed of light) plus v . . .

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:21.840
divided by 1 plus (u' is the speed of light)  cv over c squared.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.100
Now, let me know just do a little playing around with this.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.240
So, I will rewrite the top here as . . .

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.080
c into 1 (so, I will pull that factor out) plus v over c.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.560
Because if I multiply this out, I just end up with c plus cv over c which is just v

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.600
so, c plus v.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.920
divided by

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:49.300
And then all I'm going to do is cancel the c over c squared so I end up with 1 plus v over c.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.460
Which you know is just the same as the term there.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.240
So this is the same as that which just basically means that this whole thing is equal to the speed of light still.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.580
So, there's the bizarre thing:

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.100
That we've taken

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.040
Remember, what we've done here is we've said, okay

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.780
So, there's a light beam that's moving relative to the train at the speed of light

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.780
Now, if you're watching from beside the train, what speed do you see that light beam going at?

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.780
The answer is still the speed of light.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.260
You haven't actually added to its speed at all.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:23.980
And I guess the physics behind it is that you have to worry about both space and time being changed by what reference frame you're in.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.120
Which means that not surprisingly,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.820
the speed that comes out is going to be change in a slightly strange way as well.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.520
And it turns out that relativity takes care of this invariance in the speed of light.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:40.380
That no matter what reference frame you're watching the light beam travel from, you'll always see it travel at the speed of light.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:46.220
Is the universe wanting to keep things at the speed of light and everything changes to cater for that?

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.880
Or, does everything change all the time and the speed of light just falls out of that?

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.240
Is it chicken or egg?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.760
It's a very good question.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.920
And I actually really like your first explanation that

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.460
the universe arranges in things in such a way that

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.600
the speed of light always comes out as the speed of light.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.680
and no matter how much you try to mess around with things by trying to run away from the light beam or run towards it . . .

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.560
When you come to measure it's speed, you'll always find that it's speed comes out at the speed of light.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.380
and everything else kind of adjusts

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.300
the distances and the times adjust in just such a way

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.940
so that when you come to combine those distances and times to measure a speed of a light beam, it will always come out the speed of light.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160
Is there something that

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.920
is important about the speed of light being constant and unchanging?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.020
So, what motivated Einstein to come up with all this in the first place is . . .

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:40.100
he had this idea that the laws of physics should the same no matter what reference frame you're in.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:47.680
So that is you're in sealed box, there should be no experiment you can do that will tell you if that sealed box is moving at a constant speed or is stationary.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.620
And in fact, in his view of things, it is a kind of meaningless question.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.520
And what he also knew is that the speed of light comes out from the laws of electromagnetism.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.300
And so

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.820
then the question is, in what reference frame do those laws of physics work

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.500
And his argument is that those laws of physics should work in whatever reference frame you're in.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.160
which means that the speed of light has to be invariant

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.900
if you believe the laws of physics are the same in all the different reference frames.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.900
What if it hadn't been that way?

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.660
What if the universe said, "nah, I can be different for different reference frames"?

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.860
Like, would you and I be ripped to pieces in some cosmic rip?

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.700
Or, would the universe just be a bit different and quirky?

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.180
Like, does the universe benefit from the fact that this is what happens?

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:39.100
It's very hard to construct a universe in which this wasn't true.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.880
(In retrospect it's hard to construct a universe in which this isn't true.)

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.880
Bear in mind that for example, you know,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.500
all the other things that come from relativity flow from that.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.800
So, think that famous things like E=mc squared all flow from the invariance of the speed of light.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.800
And that means that

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.500
the equivalence of mass to energy is a natural consequence of relativity

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.580
and so, for example, what powers the sun (fusion),

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.640
converting mass into energy

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.640
wouldn't work.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.020
And if we weren't living in a relativistic universe

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:13.580
Now, you could imagine that the laws of physics in such a universe would come up with a way of generating energy from fusion.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.400
But, the picture we currently have of it really would be completely different.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.940
And the quantity of the speed of light (the speed that it actually is)

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.200
Does that matter?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.520
Would the universe be the same if the speed of light had been, like halved?

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.040
Or it was quite, you know, if it was something close to the speed we walk at?

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.420
Does it need to be as fast as it is to our human brains?

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.080
So, it comes out of the laws of electromagnetism

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.420
it's to do with how strong magnetic fields are, how strong electric fields are.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.860
which are really just arbitrary constants of nature as far as we know.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:55.960
which means that the speed of light, which is some combination of these things, is just an arbitrary law of nature.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.440
The universe would be a very strange place if the speed of light were very much slower.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.480
Because of course all of these relativistic effects

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.000
that lead to all the weird things that come out of relativity

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.260
we don't have to worry about them in every day life.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.280
But, if it turned out the speed of light was walking pace

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:18.180
then all sorts of strange relativistic effects would happen every time you walked to the post box.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.060
You'd have to worry about all the relativistic time dilation and length contraction effects

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.660
So, it would be like, if I go to post this letter, am I going to die before I get there?

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.560
Or, will we all have relatives that have died of old age before you get home again.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.280
So, yes indeed, it would be a very very strange universe.
