Welcome to Google, everybody.

MARVIN CHOW: Are you excited?

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.120
MALE SPEAKER 1: Very, excited.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.225
Very, very excited.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:09.054
MARVIN CHOW: It's Like every
other company you've been to?

00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:09.990
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.550
It's quite very different.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.020
It's a lot of passion here.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.370
We can feel that.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.340
MARVIN CHOW: That is us, we
are all about the passion.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.350
Why don't we start, tell us--

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.360
I think you have the
concert tonight.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.630
You've been on the road
for ten days.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.890
How is it going?

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.950
What are you thinking about
the concert tonight?

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.200
What are your expectations?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:49.420
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.140
TRANSLATOR: We have great

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.120
expectations for today's concert.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.450
This is the first of its kind,
that we are holding.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.290
And then we are hoping to
interact with our fans across

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.670
the world tonight
over YouTube.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.510
MARVIN CHOW: Any surprises
tonight?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.380
MALE SPEAKER 2: Surprise?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.476
Maybe some one will be naked.

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:09.952
MARVIN CHOW: Oooh.

00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:12.332
Which one?

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:12.808
MALE SPEAKER 2: You.

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:15.220
The one spoken, you.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.840
Just kidding.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.130
MARVIN CHOW: It's officially
on YouTube.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.620
So it's going to be true, so.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.470
But speaking of YouTube, you
know, you are the most viewed,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.780
most followed, most searched for
Chinese band in the world.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.800
And as you guys have been around
for a long time, what

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.950
do you think the future of kind
of C-pop is in America?

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.400
And then around the world.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:04:23.910
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.470
TRANSLATOR: So in the past,
you may think that you can

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.610
find some impersonal and
unemotional information on,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.270
via Google search engine.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.610
But today we want to show you
that not only you can find

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.030
information via Google search
engine, but also emotional

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.140
music contents that we
brought to the world.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.630
MARVIN CHOW: And that goes, so
I think, you know, in today's

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.250
world social media
is very big.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.150
You're big on Google+, I'm
sure, in other platforms.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.350
How is your role on these
different social media

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.210
platforms helping your career,
your music, and your fan base?

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:32.220
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.180
TRANSLATOR: Something that very
excites us is we'll be

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.520
able to use a platform like
Google+ to directly interact

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.780
with our fan base.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.980
Not through other medias
or channels.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.410
And that's something that we
think, it's very necessary in

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.200
today's world.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.960
MARVIN CHOW: I don't know if
you know this, but when we

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.110
look at the data, your band is
probably one of the top ten

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.260
bands in the world-- entities
in the world--

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.980
in terms of engagement
with fans.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.440
So commenting, liking, +1, and
so I think your fan base is

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.390
clearly very interested in
everything you have to say.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.460
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.448
MARVIN CHOW: Keep going.

00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:14.653
TRANSLATOR: Are we really
the top ten?

00:06:14.653 --> 00:06:22.318
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:06:22.318 --> 00:06:23.420
TRANSLATOR: We are surprised.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.780
Is it really so?

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.580
MARVIN CHOW: Look
at everybody.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.830
Your love is huge.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.480
MALE SPEAKER 1: Actually, we
didn't know we had lots of

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.710
fans in US right now.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.260
I think so.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.470
MARVIN CHOW: You're about to
have many more after tonight.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.680
MALE SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.950
Please cheer for us, yes.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.780
MARVIN CHOW: So,
I mean, talking

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.250
about being in America.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.560
We are talking backstage that
you were in Atlantic City last

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.130
night, or before, and one
of you lost $100,000.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.390
And, naw, I'm just kidding.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.940
I'm totally kidding.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.420
You know, but tell us what it's
like, being In Atlantic

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.460
City and obviously traveling
around America.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.880
What's been surprising?

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.070
What's been interesting?

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:45.820
MALE SPEAKER 4:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.810
TRANSLATOR: There's always
a nice surprise for us

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.610
everywhere we go in the world.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.450
And one of the most interesting
thing for us is,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.680
we cannot imagine before we came
over here what our fans

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.550
look like in such a far
place in the world.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:07.450
And once we meet them, and see
them swaying, and singing to

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.560
our music, we just feel that
it's such a powerful

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.750
experience for all of us.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.760
MARVIN CHOW: So then besides
New Jersey, where is your

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.560
favorite place in the world that
you guys have traveled

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.860
and performed to?

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.910
MALE SPEAKER 1: I think it's
definitely one place, but it

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.790
hasn't happened.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.270
It's just tonight.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.520
In Google headquarters.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:41.860
I think it's not only singing at
Google because it's singing

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.750
to lots, lots--

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.520
it's millions of people.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.070
And it's part of the future.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.650
It's internet and you
can connect with

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.530
people without seeing.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.560
Just listen.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.400
And didn't have to touch.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.310
And its information
transmission.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.850
I think it's very exciting
for tonight.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.750
MARVIN CHOW: So if you weren't
a world famous music band, do

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.670
you think you'd be working
at Google?

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.180
MALE SPEAKER 2: Sure
we want to.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.090
But it's not about if
we want or not,

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.020
it's about your ability.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.700
So I heard that it's
hard to work here.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.920
So maybe all the guys work here
wearing a black t-shirt.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.250
Maybe you're one of the
most intelligent

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.600
people in the world.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.450
Maybe.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.730
But we are not so intelligent.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.420
MARVIN CHOW: You're doing OK.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.930
MALE SPEAKER 3: Really?

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.180
MARVIN CHOW: But if you weren't
singing, because

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.200
obviously it's a very
hard profession.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.860
Have you guys thought about
what would you be doing?

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.820
What are the other passions that
you would be pursuing?

00:09:48.820 --> 00:10:13.210
MALE SPEAKER 5:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.680
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:35.570
MALE SPEAKER 5:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.250
TRANSLATOR: First choice.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.240
Is definitely being
a Google engineer.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.620
They saw a lot of bicycles
parked downstairs.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.090
And he's thinking that this must
be a great, fun, and easy

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.770
place to work at.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.730
MARVIN CHOW: So easy.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.030
We, in the middle of the
day we just break

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.560
to hang with Mayday.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.010
Maybe if you talk to the Google
Taiwan team they can

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.510
get you some bicycles
back home.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.530
We'll work on that for you.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.620
On the music, a little bit, I
think a lot of people have

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.710
talked about the Beatles
compared to you.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.210
And I understand that
they're are a major

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.700
influence on your music.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.110
Can you talk about kind of the
influences on your music and

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.690
the relationship with
the Beatles?

00:11:13.690 --> 00:12:02.010
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.190
TRANSLATOR: So back when they
were young, they've had

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.250
challenging times.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.570
And it was the Beatles music
that helped them through the

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.880
difficult times.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.320
But back in those days, it was
a little difficult to find

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.370
Beatles music.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.630
But now we are so fortunate to
have a platform like YouTube,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.290
where you can just search
any music that you

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.840
want to listen to.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.670
MARVIN CHOW: So was there
a Beatles song that

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.470
really was your song?

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.710
MALE SPEAKER 4:

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:39.470
"Let It Be."

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.940
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:51.440
MALE SPEAKER 3: I think
mine is "In My Life."

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.470
MALE SPEAKER 5: What
about "Yesterday?"

00:12:53.470 --> 00:13:01.520
MALE SPEAKER 4:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.110

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.460
[SINGING]

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.830
It's long and winding road.

00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:16.010
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.680
MALE SPEAKER 3: Yes.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.330
Yes sir.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.730
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.526
"Gangnam Style" [MANDARIN].

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.920
TRANSLATOR: They want a live
performance of "Gangnam

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.580
Style."

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.710
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.950
TRANSLATOR: Save it
till tonight.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.300
MARVIN CHOW: It must be
interesting, I mean, you guys

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.650
have been singing for
over 20 years.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.300
What do you think of "Gangnam
Style", and PSY, what's

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.700
happening in the world?

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.300
MALE SPEAKER 1: I think it's
the power of the music.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.510
And power of the internet.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:01.140
You don't have to know
something like--

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.500
you don't have to really
understand the language.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:10.610
So there is no limit, no
boundary, and no, no gaps

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.310
between what we are speaking.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.030
and what we are, the words.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.450
It's all about music.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.450
The passion and the heart.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.750
So just feel the heart, then
you can feel the music.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.950
MARVIN CHOW: It's
very powerful.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.340
So one of the things that is
kind of a Google tradition,

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.780
with regular meetings or when
world famous bands come, is we

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.300
ask the employees questions.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.480
And they get to vote and ask
questions of the guests.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.120
And so we have a couple
questions from the fans.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.840
So the first question is from
Ming, is Ming here?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.820
Or is a Ming here?

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.940
The question is my band is going
on debut next February.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.030
But we haven't had a name yet.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.030
Can you please give us a name?

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.970
Is that person here?

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.460
Your band?

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.290
Come here.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.220
I think maybe if he sings a
little bit for you, you can

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.852
help him name the band.

00:15:10.852 --> 00:15:11.794
MING: I'm not a vocalist.

00:15:11.794 --> 00:15:14.440
Actually I play the drums.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.060
MARVIN CHOW: So if you look at
him, what do you think we

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.000
should name his band?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.960
MALE SPEAKER 3: June.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.210
MARVIN CHOW: June.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.720
MALE SPEAKER 3: It's like,
you know, June day.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.250
Girl's name.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:32.960
MARVIN CHOW: OK.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.310
You are now June.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.350
Congratulations.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.110
MING: Oh, really?

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.670
MARVIN CHOW: Thank
you very much.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.510
MING: Thank you.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.850
MARVIN CHOW: The second question
is from Mayday fan in

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.160
Mountain View.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.860
How frequently do
you use Google+?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.430
What kinds of opportunities do
you think social networking

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.850
products can bring to
the music industry?

00:15:48.850 --> 00:16:23.000
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.210
TRANSLATOR: So the last time
I use Google+ was about 30

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.070
minutes ago.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.200
And actually recently I've
found a lot of music

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.680
professionals to collaborate
with among my fan page.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.040
And all of you know, once you
become famous artist, it's

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.640
hard to make friends
outside the world.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.030
And then Google+ is a platform
where I can do so

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.230
and meet new people.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.650
MARVIN CHOW: The next question
is what's your favorite song?

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.760
Non-Beatles song.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.720
I'm guessing Mayday
song, maybe?

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.480
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.770
TRANSLATOR: Hard to answer
this question.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.930
MALE SPEAKER 3: Yeah, it's
a big, big question.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.750
MALE SPEAKER 4:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:55.470
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.960
TRANSLATOR: So actually the
last song I heard was last

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.710
night on YouTube.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.640
And it's a song passed over
from my friend in

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.990
my Google+ fan page.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.850
And I thought that this is a
great platform for us to

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.560
discover not only music and
songs from unknown artists, as

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.860
well as well known artists.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.450
MARVIN CHOW: Do we have
a live question?

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.450
Anyone here?

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.960
First I would like to say happy
birthday to Monster.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.760
It's your birthday today.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.010
Yeah, happy birthday.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.830
And I'm going to ask a really
common, but everyone want to

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.360
know the answer.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.760
That is, do you have any plan to
have an outdoor, open, huge

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.890
concert in the Bay Area?

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.550
MALE SPEAKER 1: Outdoor,
maybe.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.870
Bay Area?

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.130
Not far from here.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:49.550
We are, we are going to
play Sports Arena in

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.730
LA on February 2.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.820
And it's full concert.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.070
We will ship our equipment
from Asia to here.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.150
So it's full, full
Mayday concert.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.960
So please welcome.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:10.140
Everybody in the US and in the
San Francisco, hope all of you

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.450
can be there.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.100
See you.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.150
MARVIN CHOW: We're getting
ready to wrap it up.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.500
Is there anything you
would like to share

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.940
with the fans at Google?

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.360
Anything upcoming or any words
that you would like to share

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.270
with the group here?

00:19:23.270 --> 00:20:02.120
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.210
TRANSLATOR: Everyone please
remember to tune in at 7:00 PM

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.430
sharp to the YouTube
live streaming of

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.140
their concert tonight.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.320
And also remember to interact
and post your lives and

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.750
thoughts, on Google+ frequently
because that's

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.860
where Mayday is searching
for their next

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.390
collaborative partner.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.870
MARVIN CHOW: Question
from the audience?

00:20:24.870 --> 00:21:01.000
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.800
MALE SPEAKER 4:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.244
MALE SPEAKER 5:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:21:10.244 --> 00:21:22.400
MALE SPEAKER 1:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.350
TRANSLATOR: This question is
about their Taiwanese?

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.790
How good their Taiwanese is.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:30.090
And I think it's obvious that
Ming doesn't speak Taiwanese.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:30.294
MARVIN CHOW: Shh.

00:21:30.294 --> 00:21:32.950
We won't tell anyone.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:43.940
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.300
MARVIN CHOW: We have
another question.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.920
AUDIENCE: I was always curious
to find out if there was the

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.940
meaning behind the
French bread.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.890
Like the [MANDARIN], what
was the story behind it?

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.000
MALE SPEAKER 3: Oh you
mean the French bread

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.865
in the music video?

00:21:55.865 --> 00:21:58.410
AUDIENCE: The videos, yeah.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.290
Because we always, every time
we went KTV we would just

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.380
like, love that song.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.370
And be dancing everywhere.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.760
And like, we even one
time had a party and

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.810
brought French bread.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.290
And we're hitting each
other with it.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.630
MALE SPEAKER 3: Actually
we have the same

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:11.880
questions with you.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.350
You know, we are not a director
of the music video.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:22.200
But that's the idea of the
music video director.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.590
So every time I saw the music
video, I have the same

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.550
question with you.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.046
What happened with
the French bread?

00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:33.410
MALE SPEAKER 4:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.980
MALE SPEAKER 3: Yeah, maybe
you can Google it.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.510
Many forums, many people
discuss about that.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:45.040
But I'm not a director.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.160
AUDIENCE: I went
to UC Berkeley.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.870
And like a lot of-- in TSA
we always had parties.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.530
And the French bread with
like a really big thing.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.680
Everybody had like
the [MANDARIN].

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.220
Every time we had a party, or
KTV contest the [MANDARIN].

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:06.150
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.010
TRANSLATOR: There's nothing to
like about us, besides the

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.200
French bread?

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.010
MARVIN CHOW: You guys should
get a bread sponsorship.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.340
All right, one more question.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.570
I think there was
one, this young

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:16.990
gentleman here, very eager.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:30.200
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.970
TRANSLATOR: In terms of writing
music, when you run

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.520
into difference in opinions,
how do you settle that?

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:57.760
MALE SPEAKER 2:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.800
TRANSLATOR: But we're
a democratic group.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.480
So we voice our opinions
and then we vote.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:07.040
But lately, we let the richest
guy among us, to decide.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.360
MARVIN CHOW: It's just
like at Google.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.970
MALE SPEAKER 3:
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.480
MARVIN CHOW: Everybody,
thank you very much.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.970
Please give it up for Mayday.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.870
Thank you very much.
