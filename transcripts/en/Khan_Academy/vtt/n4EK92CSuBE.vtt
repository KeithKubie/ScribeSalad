00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.120
Let's

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.600
say I have the indefinite
integral 1 over the square

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.840
root of 3 minus 2x squared.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.730
Of course I have a dx there.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.600
So right when I look at
that, there's no obvious

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.240
traditional method of
taking this antiderivative.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.510
I don't have the derivative of
this sitting someplace else in

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.830
the integral, so I can't do
traditional u-substitution.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.560
But what I can do is I could
say, well, this almost looks

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680
like some trig identities that
I'm familiar with, so maybe I

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.610
can substitute with
trig functions.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.740
So let's see if I can find
a trig identity that

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.280
looks similar to this.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.830
Well, our most basic
trigonometric identity-- this

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.100
comes from the unit circle
definition-- is that the sine

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.080
squared of theta plus
the cosine squared of

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.040
theta is equal to 1.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.380
And then if we subtract cosine
squared of theta from both

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.510
sides, we get-- or if we
subtract sine squared of theta

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.220
from both sides, we could do
either-- we could get cosine

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.310
squared of theta is equal to 1
minus sine squared of theta.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.460
We could do either way.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.790
But this, all of a sudden, this
thing right here, starts to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.230
look a little bit like this.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.790
Maybe I can do a little bit of
algebraic manipulation to make

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.580
this look a lot like that.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.540
So the first thing, I would
like to have a 1 here-- at

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.090
least, that's how my brain
works-- so let's factor out a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.420
3 out of this denominator.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.630
So this is the same thing as
the integral of 1 over the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.920
square root of-- let me factor
out a 3 out of this expression.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.690
3 times 1 minus 2/3x squared.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.900
I did nothing fancy here.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.890
I just factored the 3
out of this expression,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.250
that's all I did.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.130
But the neat thing now is,
this expression looks a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.650
lot like that expression.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.310
In fact, if I substitute, if I
say that this thing right here,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.490
this 2/3x squared, if I set it
equal to sine squared theta, I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.250
will be able to use
this identity.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.450
So let's do that.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.130
Let's set 2/3x squared, let's
set that equal to sine

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.590
squared of theta.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.210
So if we take the square root
of both sides of this equation,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.730
I get the square root of 2 over
the square root of 3 times x is

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.910
equal to the sine of theta.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.600
If I want to solve for
x, what do I get?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.870
And, well, we're going to
have to solve for both

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.600
x and for theta, so
let's do it both ways.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.390
First, let's solve for theta.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.430
If we solve for theta, you get
that theta is equal to the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.500
arcsine, or the inverse sine,
of square root of 2 over

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.820
square root of 3x.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.300
That's if you solve for theta.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.380
Now, if you solve for x, you
just multiply both sides of

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.940
this equation times the inverse
of this and you get x is equal

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.650
to-- divide both sides of the
equation by this or multiply it

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.180
by the inverse-- is equal to
the square root of 3 over the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.230
square root of 2 times
the sine of theta.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.060
And we were going to substitute
this with sine squared of

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.410
theta, but we can't leave
this dx out there.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.000
We have to take the integral
with respect to d theta.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.530
So what's dx with
respect to d theta?

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.560
So the derivative of x with
respect to theta is equal to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.690
square root of 3 over
square root of 2.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.170
Derivative of this with respect
to theta is just cosine of

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.340
theta, and if we want to write
this in terms of dx, we could

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.490
just write that dx is equal to
square root of 3 over the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.370
square root of 2 cosine
of theta d theta.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.870
Now we're ready to substitute.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.660
So we can rewrite this
expression up here-- I'll do it

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.360
in this reddish color-- I was
using that, let me do

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.770
it in the blue color.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.650
We can rewrite this
expression up here now.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.610
It's an indefinite integral
of-- dx is on the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.600
numerator, right?

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.330
Instead of writing this 1
times dx, I could have

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.050
just written a dx up here.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.750
That could be a dx
just like that.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.800
You're just multiplying
it times dx.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.990
So what's dx?

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.880
dx is this business.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.070
I'll do it in yellow.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.950
dx is this right here.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.560
So it's the square root of
3 over the square root of

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.250
2 cosine theta d theta.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.160
That's what dx was.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.250
Now, the denominator in my
equation, I have the square

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.580
root of 3 times--
now it's 1 minus.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.053
Now I said 2/3x squared is
equal to sine squared of theta.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.750
Now how can I simplify this?

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.960
Well, what's 1 minus
sine squared of theta?

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.480
That's cosine squared of theta.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.670
So this thing right here is
cosine squared of theta.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.010
So my indefinite integral
becomes the square root of 3

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.030
over the square root of 2
cosine theta d theta, all of

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:18.340
that over the square root of
3 times the cosine

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.570
squared of theta.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.900
That just became cosine
squared of theta.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.890
So let's just take the square
root of this bottom part.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.380
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll do an arbitrary

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.670
change of colors-- square root
of 3 over the square root of 2

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.890
cosine of theta d theta, all of
that over-- what's the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:38.420
square root of this?

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.230
It's equal to the square root
of 3 times the square root

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.730
of cosine squared, so
times cosine of theta.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.200
Now, this simplifies
things a good bit.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.110
I have a cosine of theta
divided by a cosine of theta,

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.150
those cancel out, so we'll just
get 1, and then I have a square

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.150
root of 3 up here divided by a
square root of 3, so those two

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.860
guys are going to cancel out,
so my integral simplifies

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.730
nicely to 1 over square
root of 2 d theta.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.530
Or even better, I could write
this-- this is just a constant

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.460
term, I could take it out of my
integral-- it equals 1 over the

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.140
square root of 2 times my
integral of just d theta.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.800
And this is super easy.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.570
This is equal to 1 over
the square root of 2

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.590
times theta plus c.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.900
Plus some constant.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.760
I mean, you could say that the
integral of this is theta plus

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.830
c and then you'd multiply the
constant times this, but it's

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.950
still going to be some
arbitrary constant.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.320
I think you know how to take
the antiderivative of this.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.630
But are we done?

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.210
Well, no.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.420
We want to know our indefinite
integral in terms of x.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.280
So now we have to
reverse substitute.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.960
So what is theta?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.900
We figured that out here. theta
is equal to arcsine the square

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.810
root of 2 over the
square root of 3x.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.840
So our original indefinite
integral, which was all of this

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.180
silliness up here, now that I
reverse substitute for theta or

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.140
put x back in there, it's 1
over the square root

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.890
of 2 times theta.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:12.980
theta is just this, is just
arcsine of square root of 2

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.530
over square root of 3 x, and
then I have this constant

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.600
out here, plus c.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:26.230
So this right here is
the antiderivative of

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.800
1 over the square root
of 3 minus 2x squared.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.840
So hopefully you
found that helpful.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.690
I'm going to do a couple of
more videos where we go through

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.350
a bunch of these examples,
just so that you get

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.220
familiar with them.
