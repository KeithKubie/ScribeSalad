we're going to be focusing on building a

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589
we're going to be focusing on building a
 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.080
we're going to be focusing on building a
set piece now I've never built anything

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090
set piece now I've never built anything
 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.180
set piece now I've never built anything
on awesome build this large before and

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
on awesome build this large before and
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.220
on awesome build this large before and
I'm pretty excited about it it's going

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
I'm pretty excited about it it's going
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.720

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.310
to be pretty cool I think you guys are
going to enjoy it but it's going to be a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
going to enjoy it but it's going to be a
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.140
going to enjoy it but it's going to be a
lot of stuff so I'm going to be probably

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
lot of stuff so I'm going to be probably
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.910
lot of stuff so I'm going to be probably
breaking it up into two episodes so

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920
breaking it up into two episodes so
 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.010
breaking it up into two episodes so
today we're going to focus on building

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
today we're going to focus on building
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.679
today we're going to focus on building
the structure and then next week we'll

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
the structure and then next week we'll
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.170
the structure and then next week we'll
focus more on dressing it up and this

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
focus more on dressing it up and this
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089
focus more on dressing it up and this
particular set piece is going to be a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
particular set piece is going to be a
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.669
particular set piece is going to be a
sci-fi corridor you want to make a short

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
sci-fi corridor you want to make a short
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860
sci-fi corridor you want to make a short
film or feature film or whatever you

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
film or feature film or whatever you
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930
film or feature film or whatever you
just want to make a cool prop you want

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
just want to make a cool prop you want
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.450
just want to make a cool prop you want
to do like an alien's themed haunted

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
to do like an alien's themed haunted
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.889
to do like an alien's themed haunted
house or something like that this might

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
house or something like that this might
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.450
house or something like that this might
be kind of cool but it's going to be

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
be kind of cool but it's going to be
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.830
be kind of cool but it's going to be
kind of like your basic octagonal space

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
kind of like your basic octagonal space
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.860
kind of like your basic octagonal space
corridor it's gonna be pretty generic

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870
corridor it's gonna be pretty generic
 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.270
corridor it's gonna be pretty generic
but I'm going to show you how to make it

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
but I'm going to show you how to make it
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010
but I'm going to show you how to make it
so that it's customizable so that you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
so that it's customizable so that you
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.400
so that it's customizable so that you
can reuse it for different purposes and

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410
can reuse it for different purposes and
 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.080
can reuse it for different purposes and
different projects or even the same

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
different projects or even the same
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910
different projects or even the same
project but when you dress it up it'll

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
project but when you dress it up it'll
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.470
project but when you dress it up it'll
look like different corridors so you can

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
look like different corridors so you can
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779
look like different corridors so you can
just build the structure once and then

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
just build the structure once and then
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119
just build the structure once and then
keep dressing the inside over and over

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
keep dressing the inside over and over
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.410
keep dressing the inside over and over
to make it look like different things

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
to make it look like different things
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750
to make it look like different things
let's go to the drawing board let's map

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
let's go to the drawing board let's map
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030
let's go to the drawing board let's map
out kind of how I've got it in my head

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
out kind of how I've got it in my head
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830
out kind of how I've got it in my head
while I would think I can build it get

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
while I would think I can build it get
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.350
while I would think I can build it get
our basic measurements and start cutting

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
our basic measurements and start cutting
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.450
our basic measurements and start cutting
our lumber and building okay so I want

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
our lumber and building okay so I want
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670
our lumber and building okay so I want
to have your kind of basic octagonal

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
to have your kind of basic octagonal
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.330
to have your kind of basic octagonal
design for this corridor so in order to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
design for this corridor so in order to
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069
design for this corridor so in order to
do so I'm going to build the framework

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
do so I'm going to build the framework
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410
do so I'm going to build the framework
and basically the bones of the skeleton

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
and basically the bones of the skeleton
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.980
and basically the bones of the skeleton
of it and then we can fill in the inside

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
of it and then we can fill in the inside
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.390
of it and then we can fill in the inside
with whatever we want it's going to be

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
with whatever we want it's going to be
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.950
with whatever we want it's going to be
cheap objects that we can find around

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960
cheap objects that we can find around
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.210
cheap objects that we can find around
the house so that we can get really

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
the house so that we can get really
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710
the house so that we can get really
cheap at the dollar store the hardware

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
cheap at the dollar store the hardware
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.160
cheap at the dollar store the hardware
store and most of us can be comprised of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
store and most of us can be comprised of
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.219
store and most of us can be comprised of
junk on the inside but the bones of it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
junk on the inside but the bones of it
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.810
junk on the inside but the bones of it
are going to be constructed out of wood

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
are going to be constructed out of wood
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.999
are going to be constructed out of wood
so that it is it's somewhat sturdy but

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
so that it is it's somewhat sturdy but
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590
so that it is it's somewhat sturdy but
still lightweight easy to move around

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
still lightweight easy to move around
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.770
still lightweight easy to move around
easy to break down and easy to transport

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
easy to break down and easy to transport
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.469
easy to break down and easy to transport
so basically what I want to do is create

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
so basically what I want to do is create
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.209
so basically what I want to do is create
a structure that is going to be able to

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
a structure that is going to be able to
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.819
a structure that is going to be able to
hold up the walls but it doesn't have to

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
hold up the walls but it doesn't have to
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.690
hold up the walls but it doesn't have to
sport a ton of weight

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.570
I think a good height is going to be

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
I think a good height is going to be
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.309
I think a good height is going to be
about six and a half feet so I'm going

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
about six and a half feet so I'm going
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.229
about six and a half feet so I'm going
to use two by threes and I'm going to

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239
to use two by threes and I'm going to
 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.630
to use two by threes and I'm going to
take the two by threes and I'm going to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
take the two by threes and I'm going to
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.390
take the two by threes and I'm going to
cut them to a six and a half foot

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400
cut them to a six and a half foot
 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.070
cut them to a six and a half foot
lengths then I'll take a two by three

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080
lengths then I'll take a two by three
 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.479
lengths then I'll take a two by three
and I'm going to cut it into two foot

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489
and I'm going to cut it into two foot
 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.729
and I'm going to cut it into two foot
pieces one down here and one up here now

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739
pieces one down here and one up here now
 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.009
pieces one down here and one up here now
I'm going to have a four foot by eight

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019
I'm going to have a four foot by eight
 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.289
I'm going to have a four foot by eight
foot sheet of plywood that's based going

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299
foot sheet of plywood that's based going
 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.199
foot sheet of plywood that's based going
to be the walls of the structure so I

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209
to be the walls of the structure so I
 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.839
to be the walls of the structure so I
want to have enough room on my six foot

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849
want to have enough room on my six foot
 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.930
want to have enough room on my six foot
piece that I have enough my four foot in

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940
piece that I have enough my four foot in
 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.309
piece that I have enough my four foot in
the middle that's going to be like the

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319
the middle that's going to be like the
 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.350
the middle that's going to be like the
center piece so then I need to cut a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
center piece so then I need to cut a
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.729
center piece so then I need to cut a
couple more pieces as my support

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739
couple more pieces as my support
 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.830
couple more pieces as my support
structure okay so these support

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840
structure okay so these support
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.170
structure okay so these support
structures are going to be 21 inches

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
structures are going to be 21 inches
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.350
structures are going to be 21 inches
from the farthest end of the farthest

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360
from the farthest end of the farthest
 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.360
from the farthest end of the farthest
end so 21 inches and then from the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
end so 21 inches and then from the
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.280
end so 21 inches and then from the
inside will be 16 from ended and what

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
inside will be 16 from ended and what
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.729
inside will be 16 from ended and what
that means is when I'm I tore it it's

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
that means is when I'm I tore it it's
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.890
that means is when I'm I tore it it's
going to look like this basically I'm

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900
going to look like this basically I'm
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.550
going to look like this basically I'm
going to cut 45s on either side and so

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560
going to cut 45s on either side and so
 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.710
going to cut 45s on either side and so
from this length this length will be 21

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720
from this length this length will be 21
 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.479
from this length this length will be 21
inches from this length of this length

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489
inches from this length of this length
 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.360
inches from this length of this length
will be 16 I feel like this is a good

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370
will be 16 I feel like this is a good
 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.300
will be 16 I feel like this is a good
framework for a free-standing wall

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310
framework for a free-standing wall
 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.530
framework for a free-standing wall
that's why I'm going with the 2 foot and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
that's why I'm going with the 2 foot and
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.970
that's why I'm going with the 2 foot and
the 21 by the 16 yeah and the 21 overall

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980
the 21 by the 16 yeah and the 21 overall
 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.640
the 21 by the 16 yeah and the 21 overall
length or my mitered edges I want it to

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650
length or my mitered edges I want it to
 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.110
length or my mitered edges I want it to
be almost like a rib cage we're going to

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
be almost like a rib cage we're going to
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.819
be almost like a rib cage we're going to
build six of these we'll have three on

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829
build six of these we'll have three on
 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.559
build six of these we'll have three on
either side to help give it enough

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569
either side to help give it enough
 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.360
either side to help give it enough
support where I can have one on either

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370
support where I can have one on either
 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.520
support where I can have one on either
side and one in the middle so we'll have

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
side and one in the middle so we'll have
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.039
side and one in the middle so we'll have
our fourth by eight foot sheet of

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049
our fourth by eight foot sheet of
 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.390
our fourth by eight foot sheet of
plywood and then we'll have support

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400
plywood and then we'll have support
 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.180
plywood and then we'll have support
piece here on the center and one on the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190
piece here on the center and one on the
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.229
piece here on the center and one on the
end all right then we're going to tie it

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239
end all right then we're going to tie it
 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.050
end all right then we're going to tie it
the top and the bottom together with one

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060
the top and the bottom together with one
 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.860
the top and the bottom together with one
by two 8 foot length and when we get to

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870
by two 8 foot length and when we get to
 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.690
by two 8 foot length and when we get to
it I'll show you what I mean by that all

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700
it I'll show you what I mean by that all
 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.979
it I'll show you what I mean by that all
right well our measurements are pretty

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989
right well our measurements are pretty
 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.240
right well our measurements are pretty
simple I'm just going to start making my

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
simple I'm just going to start making my
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.250
simple I'm just going to start making my
cuts and start assembling all right so

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260
cuts and start assembling all right so
 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.180
cuts and start assembling all right so
once I cut my six six

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190
once I cut my six six
 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.880
once I cut my six six
foot pieces out of the two by threes I

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890
foot pieces out of the two by threes I
 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.820
foot pieces out of the two by threes I
cut 12 two foot lengths and 12 of my

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830
cut 12 two foot lengths and 12 of my
 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:45.070
cut 12 two foot lengths and 12 of my
mitered that was 21 overall

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080
 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.480
now to put the pieces together

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490
now to put the pieces together
 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.520
now to put the pieces together
originally I was going to use some of

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530
originally I was going to use some of
 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.710
originally I was going to use some of
these metal brackets but they're kind of

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720
these metal brackets but they're kind of
 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.350
these metal brackets but they're kind of
expensive and for the first few I kind

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360
expensive and for the first few I kind
 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.879
expensive and for the first few I kind
of realized I didn't need to use them so

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889
of realized I didn't need to use them so
 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.820
of realized I didn't need to use them so
I just pulled out some metal strap cuz

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830
I just pulled out some metal strap cuz
 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.719
I just pulled out some metal strap cuz
it's much cheaper

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729
it's much cheaper
 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.930
it's much cheaper
I have rolls of it so I just kind of cut

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940
I have rolls of it so I just kind of cut
 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.610
I have rolls of it so I just kind of cut
pieces of that off and use that to tie

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620
pieces of that off and use that to tie
 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:22.330
pieces of that off and use that to tie
it together basically once you screw in

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340
it together basically once you screw in
 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.149
it together basically once you screw in
one side in order to get it nice and

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159
one side in order to get it nice and
 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.309
one side in order to get it nice and
snug I shoot the other one in a bit of

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319
snug I shoot the other one in a bit of
 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.610
snug I shoot the other one in a bit of
an angle so it kind of pulls that bottom

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620
an angle so it kind of pulls that bottom
 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.619
an angle so it kind of pulls that bottom
piece in nice and tight I flip it over

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629
piece in nice and tight I flip it over
 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:48.520
piece in nice and tight I flip it over
the same thing the other side

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530
 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.050
and now I'm ready to put in my mitered

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060
and now I'm ready to put in my mitered
 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:59.410
and now I'm ready to put in my mitered
piece basically my support strut

00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.420
 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.210
pre-drill some holes so I didn't split

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220
pre-drill some holes so I didn't split
 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:10.450
pre-drill some holes so I didn't split
my wood

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460
 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.650
and it shuts miss cruising to that nice

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660
and it shuts miss cruising to that nice
 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.840
and it shuts miss cruising to that nice
and snug all right there's one as I said

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850
and snug all right there's one as I said
 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:26.940
and snug all right there's one as I said
I just have to make six just like that

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950
 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.220
once I have all six of them I propped

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230
once I have all six of them I propped
 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.840
once I have all six of them I propped
them up like that and this is where I'm

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850
them up like that and this is where I'm
 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.690
them up like that and this is where I'm
going to use that 8 foot 1 by 3 I was

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700
going to use that 8 foot 1 by 3 I was
 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.580
going to use that 8 foot 1 by 3 I was
talking about

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590
talking about
 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.830
talking about
so I'm use two of those one at the top

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840
so I'm use two of those one at the top
 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.590
so I'm use two of those one at the top
one at the bottom to hold it all

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600
one at the bottom to hold it all
 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:07:02.390
one at the bottom to hold it all
together

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400
 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.040
let's make sure they're evenly spaced

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050
let's make sure they're evenly spaced
 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.680
let's make sure they're evenly spaced
give one on either end and then one of

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690
give one on either end and then one of
 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.030
give one on either end and then one of
the four-foot mark right in the center

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040
the four-foot mark right in the center
 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:22.519
the four-foot mark right in the center
so

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:22.529
 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:25.009
you can see it's freestanding so then I

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:25.019
you can see it's freestanding so then I
 

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:27.589
you can see it's freestanding so then I
flipped it over got my four by eight

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599
flipped it over got my four by eight
 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:32.329
flipped it over got my four by eight
sheet of plywood drop that on there and

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:32.339
sheet of plywood drop that on there and
 

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:34.519
sheet of plywood drop that on there and
you can use whatever thickness you want

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529
you can use whatever thickness you want
 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.219
you can use whatever thickness you want
this is an eighth inch sheet it's very

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:37.229
this is an eighth inch sheet it's very
 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:40.879
this is an eighth inch sheet it's very
thin very lightweight and I just screw

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:40.889
thin very lightweight and I just screw
 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:08:25.320
thin very lightweight and I just screw
it right to my two buckles

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:25.330
 

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.909
all right now I took another 4x8 sheet

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919
all right now I took another 4x8 sheet
 

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:36.690
all right now I took another 4x8 sheet
and I measured out 21 inches

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:36.700
 

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.029
cut them down and your four out of a

cut them down and your four out of a
 

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.730
cut them down and your four out of a
sheet those are basically to serve as

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:42.740
sheet those are basically to serve as
 

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.230
sheet those are basically to serve as
the top and bottom of our four to a wall

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240
the top and bottom of our four to a wall
 

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.070
