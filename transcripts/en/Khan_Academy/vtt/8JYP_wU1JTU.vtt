00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:03.569
As we begin our journey into the world of economics,

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.902
I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all time,

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:11.514
the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith.

00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:15.035
And he really is kind of the first real economist

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.037
in the way that we view it now.

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:19.309
And this is from his The Wealth of Nations,

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:24.369
published in 1776, coincidentally, the same year as

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.594
the American Declaration of Independence, and it's one of his most-famous excerpts.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:34.104
He generally indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest,

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:36.263
nor knows how much he is promoting it.

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:39.769
By directing that industry, so that the industry in control of that individual actor

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.042
in such a manner, as its produce may be of the greatest value,

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:46.260
he intends only his own gain.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.102
'He intends only his own gain'.

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:53.770
And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.770
to promote an end which was no part of his intention.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.435
And this term "the invisible hand" is famous.

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:04.932
Led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:08.180
He is saying, look, when individual actors just act in their own self-interest,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.300
that often in aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actors did not intend.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.641
Then he says: nor is it always the worst for society

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.175
that it was no part of it.

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:18.929
So, it was not necessarily a bad thing.

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.436
By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:28.702
that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.

00:01:28.702 --> 00:01:30.590
So, this is really a pretty strong statement.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.597
It's really at the core of capitalism.

00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:35.179
And that's why I point out that it was published

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.970
in the same year as the American Declaration of Independence,

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.905
because obviously America, the Founding Fathers,

00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:42.182
they wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution,

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:45.176
that really talks about what it means to be a democratic country,

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:46.775
what are the rights of its citizens.

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:52.041
But the United States, with its overall experience of an American,

00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:54.967
is at least as influenced by the work of Adam Smith,

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:58.569
by this kind of foundational ideas of capitalism.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.265
And they just both happened to happen around the same time.

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:08.102
But this idea is not always that intuitive. Individual actors, by essentially pursuing

00:02:08.102 --> 00:02:12.836
their own self-interested ends might be doing more for society than

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:18.104
than if any of them actually tried to promote the overall well-being of society.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:22.907
And I don't think that Adam Smith would say that it's always good

00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:24.843
for someone to act self-interested, or that it's never good for people to actually

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:29.900
think about the implications of what they are doing in an aggregate sense,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.514
but he is saying that frequently .. frequently, this self-interested action

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:38.436
*could* lead to the greater good. Could lead to more innovation.

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:44.309
Could lead to better investment. Could lead to more productivity. Could lead to more wealth,

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.438
more, a larger pie for everyone.

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:53.435
And now Economics is frequently .. and when he makes a statement, he is actually making

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:56.101
a mix of micro-economic and macro-economic statements.

00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:00.102
Micro is that people, individual actors are acting out of their own self-interest.

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:04.262
And the macro is that it might be good for the economy, or the nation as a whole.

00:03:04.262 --> 00:03:08.767
And so, now, modern economists tend to divide themselves into these two schools,

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:16.233
or into these two subjects: microeconomics, which is the study of individual actors.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:21.565
Microeconomics .. and those actors could be firms, could be people, it could be households.

00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:25.840
And you have macro-economics, which is the study of the economy in aggregate.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.107
Macro-economics. And you get it from the words.

00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:34.929
Micro -- the prefix refers to very small things. Macro refers to the larger,

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:36.347
to the bigger picture.

00:03:36.347 --> 00:03:42.588
And so, micro-economics is essentially how actors .. actors make decisions

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:49.310
or, you could actually say 'allocations', allocations .. decisions or allocations.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.102
Allocation ..

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:55.636
of scarce resources. And you hear the words scarce resources a lot

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:57.969
when people talk about economics.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:01.304
And a scarce resource is one you don't have an infinite amount of.

00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:06.377
For example, love might not be a scarce resource. You might have an infinite amount of love.

00:04:06.377 --> 00:04:13.925
But a resource that would be scarce is something like food, or water, or money, or time, or labor.

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:19.682
These are all scarce resources. And so microeconomics is how do people decide

00:04:19.682 --> 00:04:23.703
where to put those scarce resource, how do they decide where to deploy them.

00:04:23.703 --> 00:04:27.775
And how does that .. does that affect prices and markets, and whatever else.

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:32.708
Macro-economics is the study of what happens at the aggregate to an economy.

00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:38.601
So, 'aggregate', what happens in aggregate to an economy, from the millions of individual actors.

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:45.770
Aggregate economy. We now have millions of actors.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.900
And often focuses on policy-related questions.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.701
SO, do you raise or lower taxes. Or, what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes.

00:04:54.701 --> 00:05:00.036
Do you regulate or de-regulate? How does that affect the overall productivity

00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:06.926
when you do this. So, it's policy, top-down .. 'top-down' questions.

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:12.434
And in both macro- and micro-economics, there is especially in the modern sense of it,

00:05:12.434 --> 00:05:16.236
there is an attempt to make them rigorous, to make them mathematical.

00:05:16.236 --> 00:05:20.845
So, in either case you could start with some of the ideas, some of the philosophical ideas,

00:05:20.845 --> 00:05:24.569
so of the logical ideas, to say someone like Adam Smith might have.

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:31.596
So, you have these basic ideas about how people think, how people make decisions.

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:38.102
So, philosophy, 'philosophy' of people, of decision-making,

00:05:38.102 --> 00:05:42.569
in the case of micro-economics -- 'decision-making'

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.634
And then you make some assumptions about it.

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:49.593
Or you simplify it .. let me write this .. you simplify it.

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:53.846
And you really are simplifying. You say "oh, all people are rational",

00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:57.570
"all people are gonna act in their own self-interest, or all people are going to maximize their gain",

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.601
which isn't true -- human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things.

00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:06.272
We simplify things, so we can start to deal with it kind of a mathematical way.

00:06:06.272 --> 00:06:11.368
SO you simplify it, so you can start dealing with it in a mathematical sense.

00:06:11.368 --> 00:06:14.930
So, this is valuable to clarify your thinking.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.513
It can allow you to prove things based on your assumptions.

00:06:17.513 --> 00:06:21.522
And so, you can start to visualize things mathematically, with charts and graphs

00:06:21.522 --> 00:06:23.841
and think about what would actually happen with markets.

00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:27.436
So it's very valuable to have this mathematical, rigorous, thinking.

00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:32.677
But at the same time, it could be a little bit dangerous, because you are making

00:06:32.677 --> 00:06:37.702
these huge simplifications, and sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions.

00:06:37.702 --> 00:06:43.341
Conclusions, which you might feel very strongly about, because it looks like you've proven them

00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:46.977
in the same way that you might prove relativity, but they were based

00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:50.430
on some assumptions that either might be wrong, or might be over-simplifications,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.511
or might not be relevant to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about.

00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:59.036
So it's very very very important to take it all with a grain of salt,

00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:02.369
to remember that it's all based on some simplifying assumption.

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:05.675
And macro-economics is probably more guilty of it.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:09.367
In micro-economics you are taking these deeply complicated things that are

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:11.926
the human brain, how people act and respond to each other, and then

00:07:11.926 --> 00:07:17.511
you are aggregating it over millions of people, so it's ultra-complicated.

00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:21.509
You've millions of these infinitely complicated people, all interacting with each other.

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:25.512
SO, it's very complicated. Many millions of interactions, and

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:31.186
fundamentally unpredictable interactions, and then trying to make assumptions on those,

00:07:31.186 --> 00:07:37.369
trying to make assumptions and then doing math with that --

00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:41.570
that could lead you to some conclusions or might be leading you to some predictions.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:47.702
And, once again, this is very important. This is valuable, it is valuable to make these mathematical models,

00:07:47.702 --> 00:07:50.969
with these mathematical assumptions for these mathematical conclusions,

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:53.260
but it always need to be taken with a grain of salt.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.256
So, then you have a proper grain of salt, so that you are always focused on the true intuition.

00:07:58.256 --> 00:08:02.641
And that's really the most important thing to get from a course on economics.

00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:05.338
So you can truly reason through what's likely to happen,

00:08:05.338 --> 00:08:06.969
maybe even without the mathematics.

00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:11.103
I'll leave you with two quotes. And thse quotes are a little bit .. a little bit funny,

00:08:11.103 --> 00:08:15.268
but they're really I think helpful things to keep in mind,

00:08:15.268 --> 00:08:17.842
especially when you go deep into the mathematical side of economics.

00:08:17.842 --> 00:08:24.680
So, this right over here is a quote by Aflred Knopf, who was publisher in the 1900s.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.847
"An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible."

00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:34.238
And I'm assuming what he is talking about as the incomprehensible, he is referring to some of the 'mathy' stuff

00:08:34.238 --> 00:08:37.767
that you see in economics, and hopefully we're going to make this

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.507
as comprehensible as possible.

00:08:39.507 --> 00:08:41.172
You'll see there is value in this.

00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:43.256
But it's a very important statement he is making.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.436
Oftentimes, it's taking a common-sense thing.

00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:49.103
It's taking something that's obvious .. that's obvious.

00:08:49.103 --> 00:08:53.181
And it's very important to always keep that in mind, to always make sure that

00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:56.301
you have the intuition for what's happening in the math,

00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:59.176
or to know when the math is going into a direction that might be strange

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:02.370
based on over-simplifications or wrong assumptions.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.644
And then you have this quote here by Lawrence J. Peter,

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:08.569
most famous for Peter's Principals, a professor at USC.

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:12.436
"An economist is an expert know will know tomorrow why the things

00:09:12.436 --> 00:09:14.597
he predicted yesterday didn't happen today."

00:09:14.597 --> 00:09:17.436
And once again -- important to keep in the back of one's mind,

00:09:17.436 --> 00:09:21.436
because especially relevant to macro-economics, because in macro-economics

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:26.108
there is always all sorts of prediction about the state of the economy:

00:09:26.108 --> 00:09:30.847
about what need to be done, about how long the recession will last, what will be the economic growth next year,

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:34.264
what will inflation do ... and they often prove to be wrong.

00:09:34.264 --> 00:09:38.036
In fact, few economists even tend to agree on many of these things.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:42.037
And it's very important to realize that, because oftentimes when you are deep

00:09:42.037 --> 00:09:46.436
in the mathematics, economics might *seem* to be a science, like physics,

00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:50.768
but it's not a science like physics. It is open .. it is open to subjectivity,

00:09:50.768 --> 00:09:54.768
and a lot of that subjectivity is all around the assumptions that you choose to make.
