00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
So, you can see the general pattern here, and what you can see is that

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.600
the number of times that lines 3 to 5 are executed grows very rapidly.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.040
So, for 5 communication centers it's just 32; for 20, it's already a million.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.780
Now, Alice's telecommunications company, of course, has lots more

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.080
communication centers than that.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.770
So, let's assume they have about 500 communication centers.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.950
So, for 500 communication centers--if Alice runs her algorithm--

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.140
how often are the lines 3 to 5 executed in that case?

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.330
More than a trillion times?

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.970
More than a trillion trillion times?

00:00:36.970 --> 99:59:59.000
Or way more than that?
