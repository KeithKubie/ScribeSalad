Skylar Tibbits:<i> We focus on
designing physical components</i>

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:04.003
<i>that can build themselves.</i>

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:05.571
So, this project proposes that

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.507
you can have self-assembly
at very large scales

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.110 line:0%
This is interesting for
construction scenarios

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.613 line:0%
where it's hard to get to,
it's dangerous

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:14.814
<i>there is extreme environments</i>

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.582
<i> it's hard to get
 people or machines</i>

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.484
<i> or where it's difficult
 to build things</i>

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.653
<i>in space, under water, etc...</i>

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.421
<i>that we could potentially
 deposit materials</i>

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.658
<i>and they could come together to
build highly functional things.</i>

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.727
<i> In this case it's a
ten-by-ten-by-ten space frame.</i>

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:32.298
<i>When the helium dies you're left
with a large rigid structure.</i>

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:34.868
<i> The other category of
 research we look at is</i>

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.503
<i> How to program
 physical materials</i>

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.539
<i> to change shape and
 property on demand.</i>

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.075 line:0%
<i> On the top left is our
 materials and geometry.</i>

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.277 line:0%
<i>That's the obvious stuff.</i>

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:45.945 line:0%
<i> Everything we know in
 the physical world</i>

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.013 line:0%
<i> is made out of materials
 and geometry.</i>

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:49.782
Each one of those though
responds to

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.350
different types of energy.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.020
If you have moisture, you
might want to use wood.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.657
If you have metal, you might
want to use heat to activate it.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:59.158
And the way that we
design the geometry

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.226
and how those materials
come together

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.663
creates mechanical
transformation and

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.767
allows us to control how it
folds, curls, bends or twists.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.169
<i> And we've released three
 materials so far.</i>

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.372
<i> The first one is
programmable carbon fiber</i>

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.374
<i> textiles, and wood.</i>

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.277
<i> With wood there's a long
 history of using wood</i>

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:20.146
<i>as an active building material.</i>

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:22.782
<i> From Japanese joinery
 that would use moisture</i>

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:26.118
<i>to make more precise tight
joints to contemporary examples.</i>

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.486
<i>But there's two main problems.</i>

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.622
<i>One of the problems is that
 there's a lot of energy</i>

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.759
that goes into forcing plywood
to form into arbitrary shapes.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.395
You have to force it and
steam it and have molds.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:37.997
The other is that
you are constrained by

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.599
the grain direction
that you can find in the forest.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.736
<i> So, we print wood,
 we actually deposit wood</i>

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:49.075
<i>we chop it up into a pulp with
sawdust and adhesive or plastics</i>

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.644
<i> we're able to print
different grain directions.</i>

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.280
<i>Two-dimensional patterns,
three-dimensional patterns</i>

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:57.182 line:0%
<i> that allow it to
 fold, curl, twist and</i>

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.220 line:0%
<i>go from any one arbitrary shape
into any other arbitrary shape.</i>

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:04.724
So, we believe that today we
program computers and machines

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.259
and tomorrow we'll
program matter itself.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:08.161
Thank you.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.996
