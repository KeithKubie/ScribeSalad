00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.340
There have been two central traditions in European gardening.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.440
Each one associated with a great European nation.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.620
The first originated in 17th century France,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.680
and became known as the "Jardin à la française" or "formal French garden".

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.340
The most sublime example of this school of gardening is to be found in the chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.800
which is about 50 kilometers southeast of Paris.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.700
It was laid out in the late 1650s by André le Nôtre

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.440
the most important figure in the history of the French Garden.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.620
And the son of the gardener of Louis XIII.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.510
The idea was to arrange everything
around symmetry, flattening the existing

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.490
natural landscape so as to create
perfect arrangements of borders, flower beds

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.980
and reflecting pools.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.360
A grand perspective, a thousand five hundred meters long extended from the foot of the chateau to the end point:

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.160
a statue of Hercules.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.960
The alleyways were decorated at
regular intervals by statues, basins

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.430
fountains and carefully sculpted
topiaries.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.970
It was in an extremely logical precise
unyielding way perfect .

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.240
Another masterpiece of French
gardening was then constructed at Versailles also by André Le Nôtreto.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.700
Here to there was
astonishing symmetry and a will to bend the unruliness of nature to the designs
of man.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.900
The French gardening tradition achieved
enormous popularity and was widely

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.869
copied in far more modest homes across
Europe for a century at least.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.360
But the dominance eventually gave way to a new theory of gardening that developed in England in the 18th century.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.400
And was known as the "Jardin à l'anglaise" or "English Garden".

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.300
The central figure in
this tradition was Capability Brown,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.700
a gardener of genius responsible for a
170 gardens up and down the United Kingdom,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.280
including Petworth in West Sussex, Chatsworth and Darbyshire

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.860
Bowood in Wilshire and Blenheim Palace  in Oxfordshire.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.080
The Jardin à l'anglaise couldn't have been more different from the Jardin à la française.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.080
In the English tradition everything was about working with rather
than flattening natural features .

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.210
Wildness of nature wasn't the enemy.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.790
It was the starting point which the
skilled English gardener would enhance and work with.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.360
A good English garden
relish the raw impulses of nature

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.900
it was about accommodating and
delighting in nature

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.340
even though this was nature that was
tampered with in order to get it to look just that bit more natural.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.280
The English garden usually included a
lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns and groves of trees.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.460
The English tradition reign supreme for
a century at least.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.240
These are two historical traditions of gardening but
they are also along the way two modes of being.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.960
The French style is about a
confident rationalism and willpower.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.100
This is how we might feel when we want
to change the world through thought and planning.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.580
The English tradition is about
accommodating ourselves to what already exists,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.100
bending with what is there, trying to
make the most out of what we've been given

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.280
and to see its beauty and its charm.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.160
It looks like a battle but ideally we
need the two attitudes, the French and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.680
the English in our lives in order to
call upon them in diverse situations.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.100
Each of us is probably a bit biased
towards one or the other and could

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.540
benefit from seeking out the distinctive
wisdom of either the French or the English style.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.580
The opposition of the to
gardening styles is stark

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.930
but in truth we need integration, the Jardin à la française and the Jardin à l'anglaise,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.920
rational willpower and acceptance of
nature.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.850
There are in fact a few places that do
show the two integrated like

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.450
Sissinghurst Garden in Kent which
borrows from both traditions.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.459
This shows us the model of how an ideal
individual might be, someone with a

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.499
French and an English garden sight to
their nature.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.900
Ready to call upon either faculty depending on the occasion.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.320
That would be interesting gardening and
wise psychology.
