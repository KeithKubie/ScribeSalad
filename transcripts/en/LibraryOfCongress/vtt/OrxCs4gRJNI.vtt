00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:22.350
[silence]

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.660
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Good morning,
and all of the shushing,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.030
and this is so wonderful.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.330
I'm Carla Hayden and
I am very fortunate

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.870
because I am the rather
new Librarian of Congress.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.170
And so, we're so ...

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.990
yes ... I know, I know.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.390
And just think about what I get
to do as Librarian of Congress.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.740 position:56%
I get to be here with special people

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.590
and to help you think
about special books.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.280
So, we're so glad you're
here and also,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.280
I want to give a special thank you
to the people who are making sure

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.490
that we all get these books,
and that's "Everybody Reads."

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.190
Could you just stand
up for a minute?

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.570
Thank you for helping
to make this possible.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.530
Now, I've got a quiz question.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:30.260
This is a special month; do
you know what month this is?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.090
Women's Rights, Women's History ...

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.430
and we just celebrated
Women's Rights.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.730
That's right.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.030
And guess what?

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.460
The reason why we were all going
like this is because we have one

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.330
of the most important
and influential women

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.520
in the United States, even
the world, right here today.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.230
[applause]

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.780
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Now, I'm
sure you know what she does.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.230
She sits on the highest
court in the United States.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.230
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: It is
the Supreme Court.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.030
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: It's the
Supreme Court and it's right

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.440
across the street; right
across from the Library.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:24.570
And do you know what
they're called, the judges?

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.960
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Justices.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.280
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Justices ...

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.290 position:56%
great. Have you all been practicing?

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.590
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Noooo ....

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.870
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Okay, because
the name of the book is "Dissent,"

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.530
so we have 'yes' and
'no' and all that.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.060
We have a great author
here today as well,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.240
and she just wrote a wonderful
picture book called, "I Dissent."

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.540
And you just heard ...

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.070
do you know what dissent means?

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.760
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.410
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Or not.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.240
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I admire?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.030
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: You could
agree but you don't agree.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.340
It means that some people
agree and some people don't.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.590
And Justice, if I get this
wrong, please correct me.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.670
But we are delighted that Ms.
Levy is here who wrote the book,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.800
and she's going to interview
the lady that we're going

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.430
to give a big hand
to, Chief Justice ...

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.050
oops. Sorry.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.640
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.600
[applause]

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.900
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Thank
you, Dr. Hayden,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.530
for that lovely introduction.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.830 position:56%
I'm so happy to be here for
several reasons: to share this space

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.150
with someone who, to
me, is a true hero.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.990
To also be here and spend
some time with you students

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.370
in the Young Readers Center, and to
be here at the Library of Congress,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.550
largest library in the
world - did you know that?

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.450
- where I did research for
this book, "I Dissent,"

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.570
and I've done research for
other books that I've written.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.470
And I'm still doing research for my
book that's going to come out ...

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.590 position:56%
let's see, you all are in 3rd grade?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.970
... that will come out
when you are in 5th grade.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.260
That's how long sometimes it
takes to get a book published.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.570 position:56%
As you know, I wrote this book about
this very accomplished person next

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.380
to me, who holds one of the
highest offices in our land.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.490
And I focused the book on
how she has been disagreeing

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.880
with things ever since
she was a little girl.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.970
Now, there's no disrespect in
this focus because, as you'll see,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.020
Justice Ginsburg's example shows

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.440
that disagreeing doesn't
make you disagreeable.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.810 position:56%
And in fact, that we can make change

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.030
in the world one disagreement
at a time.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.250
So, I'm going to read
some pages from my book

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.480
so you can see how Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg started

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.840
out as little Ruth Bader.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.210
Then, I'll ask Justice
Ginsburg some questions

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.790
that I think you'll want
to hear the answers to.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.420
And then you'll have the chance
to ask some questions of your own.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.990
So, I'm going to start
with, "I Dissent."

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.100
"I Dissent" the book is called,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.490
"Ruth Bader Ginsburg
Makes Her Mark."

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.610
You could say that Ruth Bader
Ginsburg's life has been one

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.390
disagreement after another;
disagreement with creaky old ideas,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.120
with unfairness, with inequality.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.420
Ruth has disagreed,
disapproved, and differed ...

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.760
she has objected, she has
resisted, she has dissented.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.450
Disagreeable?

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.540
No. Determined?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.850
Yes. This is how Ruth Bader
Ginsburg changed her life and ours.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:13.580
In 1940, little Ruth's neighborhood
was vibrant with immigrants ...

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.430 position:56%
people from Italy, Ireland, England,
Poland, Germany, Jews from Russia

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.260
like Ruth's father, Nathan Bader.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.070
People from different cultures

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.200
with different holidays,
foods, and traditions.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.500
But in all these families
in Brooklyn, New York

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.700
and in families everywhere, one
thing was pretty much the same.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.900 position:56%
Boys were expected to grow up, go
out in the world, and do big things.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.520
Girls? Girls were expected
to find husbands.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.910
Ruth's mother disagreed.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.510
Celia Amster Bader thought
girls should have the chance

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.700
to make their mark on the world,
so she took Ruth to the library.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.950
On the shelves were stories of
girls and women doing big things.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.440
Ruth read about Nancy
Drew, girl detective.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.420
She discovered Amelia
Earhart, daring aviator.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.690
She learned of Athena,
goddess of Greek myths.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.630
Here were independent girls
and women taking charge.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.720
Ruth read her way into this world.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.440
Around her, the sweet smell of
books blended with savory aromas

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.610
from the Chinese restaurant
that was downstairs.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.070
Delicious!

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.070
A girl could be anything.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:43.600
Sometimes Ruth and her parents took
car trips out of the crowded city.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.570
As they drove past a hotel in
Pennsylvania, Ruth saw a sign ...

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.880
"No dogs or Jews allowed."

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.570
This is how it was in those days.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.730
Hotels, restaurants, even
entire neighborhoods announcing,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.400
"No Jews, no colored, no Mexican.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.880
Whites only."

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.830
Ruth and her family were Jewish;
this was prejudice pure and simple.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.640
Now it was Ruth's turn to disagree.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.900
She disagreed by never forgetting
how it felt to read such words.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.800
She never forgot the
sting of prejudice.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.740
In elementary school, Ruth
was excellent in some classes,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.000
and less excellent in others.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.320 position:56%
Her favorites were English, history,
and gym; in those she did well.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.280
But then, there was handwriting.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.150
Back then, teachers told
left-handers they should try

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.500
to write with their right hand.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.550
Ruth's left-handed penmanship
was so bad she earned a

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.250
"D" on the penmanship test.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.510
She cried.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.850
Then she objected.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.320
Then she protested.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.200
(Pardon me; I want to get in
every single one of those words.)

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.640
She protested by writing with her
left hand from that day forward,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:15.590
and it turned out she had
quite nice handwriting.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:21.010
That's what I'm going to read,
and from there, Ruth, excuse me,

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.330
Justice Ginsburg, went on to
disagree, resist, persist,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.410
not concur, and dissent
- which means disagree -

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.880 position:56%
and dissent her way into big things.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.100 position:56%
Also to agree, support, lift up,
and defend the idea she believed in.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.780
She went to college.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.490
She became a lawyer, a
professor of law, a judge,

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.250
and a Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.770
the highest court in our nation.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.540
Justice Ginsburg, I
know you didn't sail

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.920
through all these accomplishments
without challenges,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.310
so I do want to talk to
you about your school days

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.920
and some of those challenges.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.710
But first, let's make sure
everyone understands the job

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.530
that you do today.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.940
So, will you tell these
students something about the role

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.230
of the Supreme Court, how it works?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.070
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: What
does the Supreme Court do?

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.440
The Supreme Court is the
highest court in the land

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.210
to decide questions
involving federal laws.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:30.620
That means laws passed by
Congress, or the Constitution

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.460
of the United States,
which is our highest law.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:42.300 position:56%
And if any law passed by Congress is
in conflict with the Constitution,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.700
the Constitution prevails.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:52.000
So, our job is to say
what the national law is.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.970
Sometimes, Congress writes
statutes that are very dense,

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:02.350
not easy to understand, and people
disagree about what they mean.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:07.430
So we interpret statutes,
laws passed by Congress,

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:14.150
and our highest law,
the U.S. Constitution.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.460
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: And there
are nine Justices normally,

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.120
and there is a Chief Justice,
currently Chief Justice Roberts.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.160
So, does the Chief Justice
decide what the decision will be

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.190
and the rest of you
just go along with him?

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.980
[laughter]

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.810
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
The way it works is this.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:39.560
We spend lots and lots
of time, hours and hours,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:46.030
reading about the cases that are
then argued before the Court.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.330
We start sitting ...

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.190
this Monday coming up,
we'll sit for two weeks.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.210
And on Wednesday, we'll all meet
together to talk about cases

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.510
that were argued on Monday.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.890
And then we meet on Friday to talk

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.760
about the Tuesday and
Wednesday cases.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.580
We go around the table; the
Chief Justice speaks first,

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.570
but he has only one vote
as the rest of us do.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:18.320
We go around in seniority
order, and when each one

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.020
of us has said how we think
the case should come out,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.180
sometimes we talk across the table.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.240
When all of us have
given our opinion

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.850
on how the case should come
out, if the Chief Justice is

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.910
in the majority, he will
say who writes the opinion.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:47.870 position:56%
And if he's not in the majority,
then the most senior Justice who is,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:53.820
nowadays that's often Justice
Kennedy, will assign the opinion.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.480
And then we write opinions.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.870
That's the biggest difference, I
think, between the way courts work

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.690
and the way the legislature,
Congress, works.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.270
If you're a member of Congress, you
can just vote "yea" or "nay," yes

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.650
or no, but we can't do just that.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:18.530
We have to write our reasons
for every decision we reach.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:23.370
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: And that is why
we end up with volumes and volumes

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.460
of written opinions
from the Supreme Court,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.820
and that creates part of our law.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.950
Now, let's go from the Court
back to your school days.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.950 position:56%
We just heard that your neighborhood
in Brooklyn was full of immigrants

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.590
and children of immigrants.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.350
Your father was an
immigrant from Russia.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.910
What type of work did
your parents do?

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
My mother was a bookkeeper

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.640
in the New York garment district,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.730
and my father was a
manufacturer of fur coats.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.030
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Of fur coats.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.590
And as parents, would
you say they were strict?

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.670
Just wondering.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.950
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
My mother was very strict.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.350
My father spoiled me.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.450
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: And what did
you like to do as a girl hanging

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.550
out with other kids
in your neighborhood?

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.570
What types of games and did
you ever get into mischief?

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.740
Were you a good, good girl?

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.820
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Games first ...

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.120
jump rope, stoop ball.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.630
Mischief? Climbing garage roofs.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.790
The way the neighborhood was,

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.050
you could go from one
garage to the other.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:43.870
I don't think that my parents were
very happy about my doing that.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:50.250
And then later, there was
skating and bicycle riding.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.850
And when the weather was
warm, going to the beach

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.620
in a place called Coney
Island in Brooklyn.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.400
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: How
would you get there?

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.800
How'd you get to Coney Island?

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.450
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Sometimes
by bicycle, sometimes by bus.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.640
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: In my reading, I
mentioned some classes at school

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.080
that you were good in and some
that you were less good in.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.220
I didn't get to talk about Home Ec,
that is, sewing and cooking class.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.200
You were required to take sewing

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.800
and cooking class as
a girl, weren't you?

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.590
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
All the girls were, yes.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.210
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Did the boys
take sewing and cooking?

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.510
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Oh, no, no.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.810
The boys took shop.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:40.100
The boys worked with saws and
they made things out of wood,

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.370
and the girls made
chocolate pudding.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.900
[laughter] Which, one
time, instead of reaching

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.580
for the sugar, I reached
for the salt.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.890
And we had to eat ...

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.680
at the end of the class we
had to eat whatever we made.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.410
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Well, I was going
to ask how did that go for you,

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:05.140
but I think you just told
us how that went for you.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.970
Also, I know that you enjoy,

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.450
and enjoyed when you were
a girl as well, music.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:17.980
I know that you very much enjoy
opera today, and I also understand

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.310
that you were introduced
to opera at a young age,

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:22.950 position:56%
about the age that you children are.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.150
But in school, there was no
opera class, so will you tell us

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.170
about your chorus class and
your participation there?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:37.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes, in that
class, all the children were divided

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.930
into two groups, and one
group was called the Robins,

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.440
and the Robins could sing.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.660
And the other group was
called the Sparrows,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:55.100
and Sparrows were told never to
sing out, only to mouth the words.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.270
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Did
you follow that rule?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.030
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
In the chorus class?

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.620
I had no choice but to do it.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.980
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Did you ever sing
just for pleasure, for yourself,

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.180
after you were told you
were just a sparrow?

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.480
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Oh, yeah.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.050
In the shower and in my dreams.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:25.390
But I should say that
I did play the piano,

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:31.220
and then I also played the cello,
which is a very nice instrument,

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.960
so I could be in the
school orchestra.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.080
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: And when you were a
little older, maybe in junior high

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.110
or high school, what other
activities did you participate in?

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.170
So, you were in the
school orchestra;

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.900
did you have any after
school activities?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.520
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes, I
was what we called "a twirler."

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.900
Do you know what a baton is?

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.860
Have you seen them
at sporting events?

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.910
So, I went to every football game,

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.990
and at halftime we
twirled the batons.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.290
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: You twirled.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.640
Were you good at it?

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.940
Were you a good twirler?

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.240
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yeah.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.540
I was pretty good at it.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.190
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Justice Ginsburg,
when you went on to college

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.860
in the 1950s, many people assumed

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.520
that girls were there
only to find husbands.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.210
What was that like knowing that
that's what a lot of people

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.270
around you thought when
they saw you in college?

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.570
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I went
to a school in New York state.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:39.540
It was called Cornell
University, and in that school,

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.400
there were four boys to every girl.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.520
So yes, that was a school where
parents would send their girls

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.130
because if you couldn't find
a husband at Cornell, then,

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:56.500
four-to-one, you were hopeless.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:05.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: You did meet a young
man there named Marty Ginsburg.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:11.130
Did he also think you were
in college to find a husband?

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:19.250
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Maybe he
was in college to find a wife.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.420
Anyway, one of the
reasons I loved him

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.880
so much is he cared
that I had a brain.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.610
And so we were very good friends.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.570
We talked about everything.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:39.460
He would ask me what
classes I was taking

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:46.670
and then he would sign
up for the same classes.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.500
Something I didn't know then
but I soon found out ...

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:56.590
I already told you that
cooking was not my strong point,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.540
but my husband was a great chef.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.040
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: So, who did
the cooking in your family?

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: So it
started out, I was the everyday cook

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.870
and my husband was the
weekend and "company" cook.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:14.490
I was never allowed
to cook for guests.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:19.790
I had one cookbook, it was
called "60 Minute Chef,"

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.930
and that meant nothing
took longer than one hour

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.150
from the time you got home 'til
the dinner was on the table.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.180
I had seven things that I made,
and when I got up to number seven,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.860
we went back to number one.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.550
So my daughter, when she
was about high school age,

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.310
noticed an enormous difference
between her daddy's cooking

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.640
and her mommy's cooking,

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.730
and she decided daddy should
be the cook every day,

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.360
not just on weekends.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.120
And so it has been now for ...

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.570
well, he died in 2010.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.210
But my daughter, because she was
responsible for my husband taking

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:07.430
over the kitchen, now comes
once a month to cook for me.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.390 position:56%
And she fills the freezer with food,

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.380
and then when the supply
is finished,

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.520
she comes back and cooks some more.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.800
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: That's a very
nice thing for a daughter to do.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.100
Is she a good cook, too?

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.050
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yeah,
she learned from the master.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.470
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: I'll add that
Justice Ginsburg's daughter,

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.120
Jane Ginsburg, is also a
professor at Columbia Law School.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.380
So she cooks, teaches law,
and does a few other things.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.590
Today, things have changed from
when you were in college more

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.240
and in high school and younger.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.270 position:56%
More people understand that girls
and boys both go to school to learn,

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.530
to be able to grow up
to do interesting work,

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.120
and to take control of
their own lives as adults

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.210
because they have an education.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.390
But, Justice Ginsburg, what would
you like the students to learn

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:05.680
or to understand from your
own less-than-equal experience

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.300
as a girl and young woman?

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.510
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I
would like the students to know

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.520
that they can be free
to be you and me.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:21.270
That is, free to do whatever you
have the talent and are willing

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:27.400
to work hard enough to do;
that there are no closed doors.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.370
So, it used to be ...

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.450
you heard Debbie tell
you that there was a time

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:37.780
when women were not allowed
to be pilots in planes.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.320
Men were not allowed to be nurses.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:48.640
Now, there are no such restrictions
anymore, so a girl can grow

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:54.360 position:56%
up thinking, "Whatever I like to do,
if I'm willing to work for it enough

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.790
to achieve the learning that
I need to do it, I could do it

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:07.450
and nobody will say - as they often
said to me - 'We really don't want

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:12.230
to have any lady lawyers
in this place'."

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:17.410
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Well, you became
a lady lawyer and you specialized

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:24.830
in cases where you were fighting
against unequal treatment of men

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.810
and women, girls and boys.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.340
And in the cases you
brought, you argued to Judges

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.030 position:56%
that a person's choices shouldn't
be limited just because she happened

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.500
to be born a girl,
happened to be born a boy.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.930
Can you tell us why you felt,

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.810
and still feel I assume,
so strongly about this?

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.110
Tell us why ...

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.070
And also, if I can make
a two-fer question here,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.450
tell us why you thought society had

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.930
such rules limiting
what girls could do.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.310
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I
thought it was a tremendous waste

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.440
of people's talents.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:09.660
Boys and girls have
a range of talents,

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.460
and to say that boys can only do
this and girls can only do that,

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.510
was just wasting the
talent of a lot of girls

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.090
who could do what boys were doing,

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:22.240
and boys who could do
what girls were doing.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.740
So I thought everybody
would be better off

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:32.740
if people could do whatever it is
that they have the talent to do,

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:38.990
and it shouldn't matter
whether they're a boy or a girl.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.610
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Why do you think
those rules, those limitations,

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.850
were put on girls, for example?

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:51.000
Why did society say, "No, young
Ruth, you shouldn't be a lawyer."

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.450
Or to somebody else, "You
shouldn't be an airline pilot

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.550
because you're a woman."

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.250
Why do you think?

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:03.190
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Well, some
people said all those "no's" were

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.910
to protect women, so
they couldn't be pilots

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.180
because that was a
dangerous occupation.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.720
The important thing to understand,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.830
it turned out women were
not really protected.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:27.090
Instead, as one Supreme Court
Justice said, they were in a cage

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:34.960
and couldn't get out to
do what they wanted to do

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:41.070
and were ready, willing,
and able to do.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.890
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: I started out
talking about you as someone

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.670
who has disagreed with
unfairness and with discrimination,

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.260
and with inequality since you
were a girl, so I would say

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.360
that you are an awesome arguer.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.670 position:56%
I think you're a champion disagreer,

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.910
so now I'd like to get
back to that in this way.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.670 position:56%
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.150
and you disagreed very
frequently on legal matters.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:10.560
And students, I want to make sure
you understand that Justice Scalia,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.580 position:56%
who was one of the other Justices
on the Court, sadly, died last year.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.460
But when he was alive,
the two of them ...

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.760
oh my goodness.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.930
They disagreed strongly
on legal matters.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:27.660
Will you tell students, first,
about the back and forth that went

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.790
on between you and Justice Scalia?

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.210
That is, did you listen
to each other?

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.940
Did you just show each other the
hand and say 'don't talk to me?'

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.670
How was that?

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: When Justice
Scalia and I disagreed, and I wrote,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.040 position:56%
say, the opinion of the Court and he
dissented, or he wrote the opinion

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.160
of the Court and I dissented, my
opinion was always much better

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.090
in the end because he pointed
out all the weak spots,

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:03.480
and then I was able to fix them
and make the opinion stronger.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.180
Justice Scalia was
very good at grammar.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.690
His mother was a grade
school grammar teacher

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.440
and his father taught Latin.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.240
So if I made mistakes in grammar,
he would call me on the telephone;

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.720
wouldn't tell the rest of my
colleagues, and he's say, "Ruth,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:30.920
you know, you really should use
plural here instead of singular."

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:37.500
And I would sometimes tell him,
"Your dissent is so overheated,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.240
you're going to lose people that
you might otherwise persuade

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.220
if you moderated the tone."

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:51.230
He didn't always listen
when I said that.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.200 position:56%
But I loved him and I've missed him.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.990 position:56%
One reason is, he had a wonderful
sense of humor and he made me laugh.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.290
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: So the two

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.040
of you disagreed strenuously,
but were great friends.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.340
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:13.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Since we're here in
a great library, and I know that you

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.200
as a girl went to the library
in Brooklyn with your mother,

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.380
I want to ask why was reading
important to you as a child,

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.710
and why do you think it's important
for our students here, reading?

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.950
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Because it opened vistas to me

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:34.990
about far away places and
people who were different.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.630
My mother would leave me
at the library and I'd pick

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.370
out five books to take home.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.630
And we'd check them out and
bring them back the next week,

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.930
and find more books.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:53.250
Something that I loved that
was not real, Greek mythology.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.260
You mentioned Athena,
the goddess of wisdom.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.310 position:56%
I love to read about the Greek gods.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: I wonder, what is it

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.700
about the Greek gods
and mythology ...

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.480
Percy Jackson, you all; right?

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.160
Weren't we talking
about that before?

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.140
What is it about that
that attracted you so?

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.580
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Well, for one thing,

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.440
there was more equality
among the Greek gods

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.660
with Athena the goddess of wisdom.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:25.370
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: There was equality
among the gods and goddesses.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.670
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.970
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: And
I know that you have

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.280
to read a great many
legal papers for work,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.390
but do you find time
to read for pleasure?

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.680
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes,
I wish I could do a lot more

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:43.050 position:56%
but I always take home a lot of work

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.820
from the Court; a lot
of reading to do.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.200
But the last thing I do
before I fall asleep,

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.290
if I've done a good job, I did all
my homework, and I get into bed

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.340
with a good book and
read a few pages,

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.970
usually fall asleep before ...

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:04.180
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: I think
that's a good habit.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:10.700
Much as we love to read, a
person cannot read all the time.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.230
Sometimes, one has to
get up and move around.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.670
And you, Justice Ginsburg,
are known to spend some time

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.430
at the gym in the Supreme Court.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.440 position:56%
You're an exercise buff, and I think
the students would be interested

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.990
in your exercise routine.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:31.070
Can you talk to them about it?

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:33.020
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Tonight, I will meet my ...

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.110
we call him "personal trainer,"

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:41.500
and we will spend an hour together
doing all kinds of things ...

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:53.490 position:56%
lifting weights, doing pushups,
planks, using the elliptical glider.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.660
I started working with a
personal trainer in 1999,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.790
long before you were born.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.870
And you know, the reason I started
was because I had been very sick.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:16.060
I had a disease called
cancer, and when I was finally

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.770
through all the treatments,
I was not in very good shape.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.840
I was very weak.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.220
So my husband said, "You'd better
get yourself a personal trainer."

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.520
Which I did.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.210
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: And you've
been exercising seriously ever

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.510
since then.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.810
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Yes.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.110
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: That's a long time.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.410
Now, I think I have time

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:39.610
for a couple more questions
before opening it up to you.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:45.810
I have two final ones, and that
is, what is the best advice

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:51.950
that you can give us on how
to react when someone argues

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.020
with you by saying mean things?

00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:02.330
That is, attacks you rather than
engaging or going after your ideas?

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:08.750
What about when it gets personal
as arguments sometimes do?

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.910
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: My
best advice is to tune out.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.080
Don't try to argue back.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.090
Don't try to be mean in return.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:24.680
That's not going to
get you anyplace.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.950 position:56%
Try to use the good reasons you have
to persuade people, and for people

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:34.560
who don't want to listen,
just tune them out.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.170
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: And another
question about advice,

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:45.380
what is the best advice that you
can give us for changing things

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.710
in the world as you have changed
things in the world as a lawyer

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.240
and as a Supreme Court Justice?

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.080
We're not all going to be lawyers
and Supreme Court Justices,

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.250
but what's your best advice
for how we can change things

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:03.210
in our own communities when
we think that they are wrong?

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.150
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Join
together with other people who feel

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.580
like you because there's
strength in numbers.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.650
If you just try to do
things all by yourself,

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.590
you're not going to get very far.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:24.830 position:56%
You need a team to work with you to
achieve what you think is important.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.130
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Thank you.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:30.360
Now, I could go on and on and on,
but I don't want to tread on time

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.180
that we've got for
student questions.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:37.410
So, may I open it up for
student questions and then ...

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:48.430
if you don't have any, I'll
just keep asking my questions.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.040
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Looks like we have one.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.690
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Were you involved
in the Women's Rights March?

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.330
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Were you involved

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.520
in the Women's Rights
March, the one in January?

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.300
That's your question?

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.220
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I
wasn't in the March itself,

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:11.520
but I met with people who were
in the March, and I had dinner

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.960
with them the night before.

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:19.860
But many people I know ...

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.980
my granddaughter was in the March.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:30.890
People who work for the government
tend not to be in marches,

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:38.100
but I thought it was a wonderful
thing because it was so peaceful.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:45.380
It wasn't at all rowdy; there
were no episodes of violence.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:51.870
There were just people, as I said
before, who were on the same team,

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:57.170
standing up and saying women have a
lot to contribute to this country,

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.300
and don't shove them aside.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:07.380
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: How
about right behind you?

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:12.290
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: What year did you
start at the Judicial Branch?

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.420
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: What year did
you start in the Judicial Branch?

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.220
So, when did you first
become a judge?

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.780
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I
first became a judge in 1980.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:26.730
I was not on the Supreme Court, but
I was on the U.S. Court of Appeals

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.350 position:56%
for the District of Columbia circuit

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:34.370
at the U.S. courthouse
on Constitution Avenue.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:39.160
I was there for 13 years, and
I was appointed to that Court

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.430
by President Jimmy Carter.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.830
And then I was appointed
to the Supreme Court

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:48.300
by President Bill Clinton.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:36:00.680
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Was it your dream to
become a Supreme Court Justice?

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.290
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Did I
dream to become a Supreme ...

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.590
?

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:04.890
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: That's the
question, was it your dream

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.190
to become a Supreme Court Justice?

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:14.250
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: People of
my advanced age, women who went

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:18.460
to law school when I did,
dreamed of getting a job

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.340
in the law, any job in the law.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:27.540 position:56%
There were no women judges so it
would have been an impossible dream.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.780
In fact, the first woman appointed

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:38.420
to a federal trial bench was
appointed by Truman in 1948,

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:45.630
and there had only been one
woman on a U.S. Court of Appeals;

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:51.320
she was appointed by Franklin
Delano Roosevelt in 1934.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:57.500
And when she retired,
there were none again.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.040
So it would have been ...

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:06.140
it could be something that was
beyond the realm of possibility.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.660
In fact, I didn't dream
about becoming a judge

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.320 position:56%
until Jimmy Carter became President.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.730
And the reason I started then
is, he looked around at people

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:22.080
who were judges in the United
States and he said, "You know,

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.290
they all look like me, and
that's not how the great United

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.620
States looks."

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.300
When he said "they
all look like me,"

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.010
he meant they were white
and they were male.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:39.170 position:56%
So he was determined to appoint
members of minority groups and women

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:42.200
in numbers to the federal bench.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:48.190
So he appointed about 25 women
to the federal trial Court,

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:52.780
and 11 to Courts of Appeals,
and I was one of the lucky 11.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.300
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Why did you want to
become a Supreme Court Justice?

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.720
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Why did you want
to become a Supreme Court Justice?

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.060
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Because I think it's the best

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:10.300
and the hardest job a
law-trained person can have.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:15.450
We have no cases that are
easy because most of the cases

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.170
that we hear are cases
where other courts ...

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.730
I'd better get myself
another Constitution;

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.130
this one's falling apart ...

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:34.970
So, my job is to do
a lot of reading,

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:39.280 position:56%
a lot of thinking, a lot of writing.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.310
It's hard, but it's very
satisfying when I finish an opinion

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.790
and I can say, "Yes, that's good.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:55.100
I hope it will persuade
the people who read it."

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:01.520
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Did you actually
write the little girl [inaudible]?

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Can you repeat that?

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.450
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Did you actually
write the little girl who dressed

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:11.370
like you a special message?

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:16.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Oh, did you actually
write the little girl who dressed

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.500
like you a special message?

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.660
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Yes, I certainly did.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.090
Her name is Michelle.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Michelle, for those
of you who are unfamiliar with this,

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.630
dressed up for her school's "Dress

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:40.170
Like a Superhero" Day
as Justice Ginsburg.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:49.940
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Did you always fight
for civil rights of your ...

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:54.200
did you ever fight for
civil rights to be a woman

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.850
to be in the Supreme Court?

00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:01.290
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Did you
ever fight for civil rights?

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.530
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Yes, I certainly did,

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:09.780
and I thought it was
great that I was ...

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:15.130
people were able to come
to the courts and say,

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:25.190
what is happening is wrong and it
doesn't fit with our Constitution.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:30.530
One of my favorite things
in the Constitution is

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:36.590
in the 14th amendment,
and it's known as the

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.950
"Equal Protection Clause."

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:43.140
So, let me read to
you just as it is.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:46.170
It says, "Nor shall any state deny

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:55.790
to any person equal
protection of the laws."

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.400
And let me ask you
a question in turn.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:12.390
The word "equal" becomes part of
the Constitution in the year 1868.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:18.210
The main part of the
Constitution was written in 1787.

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:24.850
Now, why do you suppose the word
"equal" doesn't appear until 1868?

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.850
What's the answer?

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:33.130
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: I think that
it only appeared in 1868

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:34.930
because people wasn't
allowed to be like ...

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:38.620
couldn't go to school with
white people or nothing,

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.750
but they couldn't learn with ...

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.630
they didn't have a lot
of books or nothing

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:47.600
like the white people did,
and they wasn't equal.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.930
They couldn't go to school
with them or nothing.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.620
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Do you have
another answer to that?

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:02.880
Or you have a question?

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.180
We'll take another, sure.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.280
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: When did she become
a lawyer, and how old was she

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.110
when she became a lawyer?

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:14.690
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: How old
were you, Justice Ginsburg,

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.990
when you became a lawyer?

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:19.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
When I became a lawyer ...

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.750
let's see.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.360
I was 26.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:34.740
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Who
hasn't asked a question?

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.620
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Why did you want
to stand up for equal rights?

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Because I
thought everybody should have a fair

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:53.670 position:56%
chance to do what they can do best,
and I also thought about how I would

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.370
like the world to be for
my children; I have one boy

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:00.820
and one girl, and now
my grandchildren;

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:06.270
I have four grandchildren
and two step-grandchildren.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:12.520
Some of them are boys, some
are girls, and I want the world

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:18.350
to give them a fair chance to
do whatever they want to do

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:22.620
if they're willing to do
the hard work that it takes.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.810
And nobody should be able to
say, "No, you can't do this"

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.360
because you're a boy or
because you're a girl.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:38.940
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Would
you want your children

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.480
to be a Supreme Court Justice?

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.390
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Would
you want your children

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.410
to be a Supreme Court Justice?

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:52.460
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Well, the chances for anyone

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.450
to be a Supreme Court
Justice are not large.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:01.710
There are only nine of us,
and there are thousands

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.390
and thousands of lawyers.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:09.620
I want my children to do
things that they can do well

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.950
and that gives them satisfaction.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:26.300 position:56%
My daughter is a law teacher, and my
son makes exquisite compact discs.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.880
He loves music, and so
that's what he does.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.150
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Do you still
work at the Supreme Court?

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:40.870
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: As soon as
I leave you, I'm going to go right

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:44.800
to my desk at the Supreme Court.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.180
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: It's
right across the street.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.070
It's right next door.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:50.880
Who hasn't asked a question?

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.180
I'll let you choose.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.980
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Is it
hard for you to get

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.930 position:56%
through all the cases that you have?

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.670
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Is it
hard for you to get

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.920 position:56%
through all the cases that you have?

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.600
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Yes, it is, it is.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.440
It takes a lot of staying
power, a lot of stamina,

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.560
because sometimes I'm reading
things to prepare for the cases

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.050
that will be argued
and I fall asleep.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.950
And then ...

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.600
somebody taught me a trick.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.570
Hold a pencil, and when it drops,

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:37.620
then you know you're falling
asleep and you should wake up.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:46.780
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Do you have a
place where you like to work,

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:51.900
prepare to work, when
you're doing your job?

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.180
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Do you have a
place that you prefer to work

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.480
when you're doing your job?

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.760
And I imagine we mean at the
Court or maybe not at the Court.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.060
Where do you like to work?

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:06.430
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: At the
Court I have a very nice office.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:10.110
At home, I work in the
bedroom and I've always done

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.550
that from the time we
had a small apartment ...

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:17.320
there's the bed, and
there's a writing table,

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:24.910
and there's bookshelves, and
that's my favorite place to work.

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.280
My husband used to work
on the dining room table

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.520
and I worked in the bedroom.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.230
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Anybody else?

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:37.840
I don't want to ignore
the people behind you.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:47.700
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: On your cases did
none of the Justices supported you,

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:54.650
did you have to agree
on the case, or no?

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.240
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Do I have to agree?

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:04.000
Five people have to agree in
order for the case to be decided.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.530
So, if five people can agree, then
the Court will make a decision.

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:13.340 position:56%
But the four people who don't agree
can write the reasons why they don't

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:20.950
agree, and that's what's
called "a dissenting opinion."

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.500
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Anybody
on this side?

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.540
We can stick with ...

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.250
yes?

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.600
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Did you
break any world records?

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:41.410
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Did you
break any world records?

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.710
Hmm.

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.010
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
I can say, one.

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:49.050
I am the longest sitting
Jewish Justice.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:54.830
There have been in history
eight Jewish Justices,

00:47:54.830 --> 00:48:00.470
and just this month I
am at the Court longer

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.410
than Justice Frankfurter.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.180
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: Mazel tov.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.480
[applause]

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:20.050
&gt;&gt; Who has not had a question?

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:21.870
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Did you ever ...

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:28.580
were you in the Supreme
Court when the Lovings was

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:33.390
in the Supreme Court
trying to get their rights?

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.030
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: When who
was in the Supreme Court?

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:36.330
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: The Lovings.

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:39.530
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: The Lovings,
as in Loving against Virginia.

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:43.030
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I was
a lawyer at the time of Loving

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:51.830
against Virginia, and I knew one of
the lawyers that represented them

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:55.770
because the American Civil
Liberties Union took their case

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:57.070
to the Supreme Court.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:07.540
There's a wonderful movie
called "Loving" about them.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:12.110
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: How long was you
working at the Supreme Court?

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.860
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: How long have you
been working at the Supreme Court?

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:27.970
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG:
Almost 24 years.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:29.270
[laughter]

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:32.730
Longer than any other
job I've ever held.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:38.030 position:56%
I was a law teacher for 17 years,
Court of Appeals judge for 13 years,

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:45.610
Supreme Court Justice
for almost 24 years.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.950
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: What was
your first case based on?

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:53.340
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: What was
your first case based on?

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.410
Maybe the first ...

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:58.310
well, either a first Supreme
Court case or some other case

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:01.270 position:56%
that didn't go to the Supreme Court.

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:09.040
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: The first
case that went to the Supreme Court

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:14.600
where I wrote the brief,
it was kind of a sad case.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:25.930
It was a couple who had a
young son, and then the mother

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:30.450
and father didn't get on
because they got divorced.

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:35.580
And the mother took care of the
child when he was very young,

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:40.360 position:56%
but when the boy was a teenager, his
father said, "Family Court judge,

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.180
give the boy to me because
he has to be prepared

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.250
to live in a man's world."

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:49.090
His mother did not want the
father to have the child,

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:52.180
but the judge ruled in
favor of the father.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:59.810 position:56%
The mother, sadly, was right because
the boy became very sad, depressed.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:01.120
And one day, he took out one

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.690
of his father's many guns
and he killed himself.

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.540
So his mother wanted to
take care of anything

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.690
that he left behind;
it wasn't much ...

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:14.710
a guitar, some clothes, recordings.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:20.530
And the father applied, too,
to be the one to take care

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:24.330
of whatever the boy had left.

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:29.690
And there was a law in the
state, the state was Idaho.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:34.450
The law read, "As between
two persons equally entitled

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:41.820 position:56%
to administer a decedent's estate,
males must be preferred to females."

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.330
And Sally Reed said, "That's wrong.

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:49.730
Why must males be preferred
to females?

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:52.360
I can do the job of attending

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.930
to my dead son's belongings
at least as well."

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:01.890
So, that was the first
case that I briefed,

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:08.070
and the Supreme Court decided that
unanimously in the mother's favor.

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:11.780
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE LEVY: I believe we
have run out of time I'm afraid,

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.940
and I just want to say, other
than thank you to all of you

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.980
for your excellent attention
and your good questions.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.040
And of course, thank
you to Justice Ginsburg,

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.970
thank you to the Young
Readers Center.

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:27.190 position:56%
Did you all know that it was Justice
Ginsburg's birthday yesterday?

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:28.670
Happy birthday.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:29.970
&gt;&gt; RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Thank you.

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:31.270
[applause]

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:34.250
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
