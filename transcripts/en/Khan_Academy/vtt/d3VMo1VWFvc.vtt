00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:01.919
- [Voiceover] "Which of
the ordered pairs is a

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.544
"solution of the following equation?"

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:09.544
4x minus one is equal to 3y plus five.

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.730
Now, when we look at an
ordered pair we wanna

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.563
figure out whether it's a
solution, we just have to

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:15.781
remind ourselves that
in these ordered pairs

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.289
the convention, the standard,
is is that the first

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.980
coordinate is the x coordinate,
and the second coordinate

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.745
is the y coordinate.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.682
So they're gonna, if this is
a solution, if this ordered

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:30.107
pair is a solution, that means
that if x is equal to three

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:32.928
and y is equal to two,
that that would satisfy

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:34.077
this equation up here.

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:35.540
So let's try that out.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.105
So, we have four times x.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.764
Well we're saying x needs
to be equal to three,

00:00:40.764 --> 00:00:44.258
minus one, is going to be
equal to three times y.

00:00:44.258 --> 00:00:47.357
Well, if this ordered
pair is a solution then

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:50.503
y is going to be equal
to two, so three times y,

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:52.756
y is two, plus five.

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:54.579
Notice all I did is wherever I saw the x,

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.505
I substituted it with three,

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.559
wherever I saw the y, I
substituted it with two.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.416
Now let's see if this is true.

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:04.237
Four times three is twelve, minus one.

00:01:04.237 --> 00:01:06.903
Is this really the same
thing as three times two

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:09.132
which is six, plus five?

00:01:09.132 --> 00:01:11.094
See, 12 minus one is 11,

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:13.253
six plus five is also 11.

00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:16.202
This is true, 11 equals 11.

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:21.159
This pair three, two does
satisfy this equation.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.911
Now let's see whether
this one does, two, three.

00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:25.977
So this is saying when x is equal to two,

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:29.378
y would be equal to
three for this equation.

00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:30.516
Let's see if that's true.

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:33.952
So four times x, we're
now gonna see if when

00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:35.914
x is two, y can be three.

00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:38.259
So four times x,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.977
four times two,

00:01:39.977 --> 00:01:43.370
minus one is equal to three times y,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.837
now y we're testing to
see if it can be three.

00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:48.028
Three times three plus five,

00:01:48.028 --> 00:01:49.386
let's see if this is true.

00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:51.637
Four times two is eight, minus one,

00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:56.637
is this equal to three times three?

00:01:57.992 --> 00:02:00.620
So that's nine plus five.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.697
So is seven equal to 14?

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:06.903
No, clearly seven is not equal to 14.

00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:11.546
So these things are not
equal to each other.

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:15.366
So this is not a solution,
when x equals two

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:19.718
y cannot be to three and
satisfy this equation.

00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:24.368
So only three, two is a solution.
