I think in five years or so VR is going

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
I think in five years or so VR is going
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.669
I think in five years or so VR is going
to be a really prominent platform for

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679
to be a really prominent platform for
 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.150
to be a really prominent platform for
experiences for business for commerce

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160
experiences for business for commerce
 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.750

entertainment social let me tell you why
so I've been trying a lot of the VR gear

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
so I've been trying a lot of the VR gear
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.060
so I've been trying a lot of the VR gear
and the thing about VR is and the other

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
and the thing about VR is and the other
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250
and the thing about VR is and the other
version of it called mr mixed reality

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260
version of it called mr mixed reality
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.910
version of it called mr mixed reality
which is where you see virtual objects

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
which is where you see virtual objects
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.139
which is where you see virtual objects
in the real world and VR where you see

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
in the real world and VR where you see
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.090
in the real world and VR where you see
only the virtual world

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
only the virtual world
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.720
only the virtual world
both of those operate on a different

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
both of those operate on a different
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.729
both of those operate on a different
part of your brain then when you're

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
part of your brain then when you're
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.439
part of your brain then when you're
watching on a screen so a very common

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449
watching on a screen so a very common
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.130
watching on a screen so a very common
demonstration in VR is to put on a pair

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
demonstration in VR is to put on a pair
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689
demonstration in VR is to put on a pair
of goggles while you're in a room and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
of goggles while you're in a room and
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.830
of goggles while you're in a room and
then to drop the virtual floor inside

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
then to drop the virtual floor inside
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689
then to drop the virtual floor inside
away so you're suddenly standing on a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
away so you're suddenly standing on a
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.020
away so you're suddenly standing on a
cliff and ask you to walk out on a plank

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
cliff and ask you to walk out on a plank
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.830
cliff and ask you to walk out on a plank
that's over nothing maybe it's

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840
that's over nothing maybe it's
 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.420
that's over nothing maybe it's
kilometers deep and for most people you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
kilometers deep and for most people you
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.120
kilometers deep and for most people you
can't it's almost impossible do your

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
can't it's almost impossible do your
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.200
can't it's almost impossible do your
knees start shaking you're nauseous even

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
knees start shaking you're nauseous even
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.929
knees start shaking you're nauseous even
while your brain is telling you hey

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
while your brain is telling you hey
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.640
while your brain is telling you hey
you're doing the same room I was in a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
you're doing the same room I was in a
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.249
you're doing the same room I was in a
few moments ago the VR is working on a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
few moments ago the VR is working on a
 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.980
few moments ago the VR is working on a
lower different part of your brain stem

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
lower different part of your brain stem
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780
lower different part of your brain stem
so much more primeval

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
so much more primeval
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.350
so much more primeval
as part of it that experiences things

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
as part of it that experiences things
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.850
as part of it that experiences things
and when you take your VR goggle off you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
and when you take your VR goggle off you
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.249
and when you take your VR goggle off you
remember not having seen something but

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259
remember not having seen something but
 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039
remember not having seen something but
having experienced it and that ability

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
having experienced it and that ability
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.810
having experienced it and that ability
to get to where we feel things get to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
to get to where we feel things get to
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.260
to get to where we feel things get to
where we experience things is very very

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
where we experience things is very very
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.010
where we experience things is very very
powerful and in trying many many of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
powerful and in trying many many of
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.740
powerful and in trying many many of
these worlds for almost two decades or

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
these worlds for almost two decades or
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.530
these worlds for almost two decades or
more one of the things that's most

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
more one of the things that's most
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.940
more one of the things that's most
surprising to me is that the most

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
surprising to me is that the most
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.880
surprising to me is that the most
intriguing things in these worlds are

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
intriguing things in these worlds are
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.969
intriguing things in these worlds are
not incredible objects or not amazing

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
not incredible objects or not amazing
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.770
not incredible objects or not amazing
world there are actually other people

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
world there are actually other people
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.330
world there are actually other people
so when you have a world with other

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
so when you have a world with other
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.420
so when you have a world with other
people in it that's really what's the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430
people in it that's really what's the
 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.430
people in it that's really what's the
most powerful thing and we now have the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440
most powerful thing and we now have the
 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.470
most powerful thing and we now have the
ability to add a couple things to make

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
ability to add a couple things to make
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.180
ability to add a couple things to make
those people seeing real one of them is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190
those people seeing real one of them is
 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.120
those people seeing real one of them is
eye contact

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
eye contact
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.320
eye contact
the other one is ability to have

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330
the other one is ability to have
 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.390
the other one is ability to have
real-time capture of their movements so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
real-time capture of their movements so
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.360
real-time capture of their movements so
you can see and see the body language

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
you can see and see the body language
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.130
you can see and see the body language
and you can detect it back actually this

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
and you can detect it back actually this
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.740
and you can detect it back actually this
other person and the experience is a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750
other person and the experience is a
 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.790
other person and the experience is a
real experience and that experience of

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800
real experience and that experience of
 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.490
real experience and that experience of
other people I think is going to make VR

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500
other people I think is going to make VR
 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.920
other people I think is going to make VR
the most social of all the social media

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930
the most social of all the social media
 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.199
the most social of all the social media
and actually been trying a couple of

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209
and actually been trying a couple of
 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.160
and actually been trying a couple of
these VR games where you have to do

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
these VR games where you have to do
 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.710
these VR games where you have to do
stuff physically and even the idea that

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720
stuff physically and even the idea that
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.180
stuff physically and even the idea that
this is sort of you're going to become a

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190
this is sort of you're going to become a
 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.030
this is sort of you're going to become a
big slug in the closet is isolated is

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
big slug in the closet is isolated is
 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.640
big slug in the closet is isolated is
totally wrong this is going to be some

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650
totally wrong this is going to be some
 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.550
totally wrong this is going to be some

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
of the most calisthenic kinetic activity
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.420
of the most calisthenic kinetic activity
that we're going to undergo VR is likely

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430
that we're going to undergo VR is likely
 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.850
that we're going to undergo VR is likely
to become the social platform within

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860
to become the social platform within
 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.370
to become the social platform within
five years and it's the place we're

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380
five years and it's the place we're
 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.340
five years and it's the place we're
going to download exchange buy purchase

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350
going to download exchange buy purchase
 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.390
going to download exchange buy purchase
experiences which are going to be some

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400
experiences which are going to be some
 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.770
experiences which are going to be some
of the most valuable things that we can

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780
of the most valuable things that we can
 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.340
of the most valuable things that we can
create and there'll be a whole economy

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350
create and there'll be a whole economy
 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.680
create and there'll be a whole economy
based around this and then the amount of

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690
based around this and then the amount of
 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.060
based around this and then the amount of
data that is necessary to make this work

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070
data that is necessary to make this work
 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.520
data that is necessary to make this work
is huge there's going to be no VR

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530
is huge there's going to be no VR
 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.470
is huge there's going to be no VR
without AI and the VR companies who make

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480
without AI and the VR companies who make
 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.380
without AI and the VR companies who make
this are going to become the largest

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390
this are going to become the largest
 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.229
this are going to become the largest
data companies in the world because in

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239
data companies in the world because in
 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.160

order to have your avatar in the VR in
 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.650
order to have your avatar in the VR in
real time you have to capture so much of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660
real time you have to capture so much of
 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.750
real time you have to capture so much of
our behavior that we're going to be

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760
our behavior that we're going to be
 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.520
our behavior that we're going to be
capturing behavior that's expensive to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530
capturing behavior that's expensive to
 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.530
capturing behavior that's expensive to
capture outside in the real world that's

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540
capture outside in the real world that's
 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.740
capture outside in the real world that's
going to be very cheap to capture in VR

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750
going to be very cheap to capture in VR
 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.860
going to be very cheap to capture in VR
and the companies that are running these

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870
and the companies that are running these
 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.840
and the companies that are running these
they're not making the money selling

they're not making the money selling
goggles they're going to be collecting

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160
goggles they're going to be collecting
 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.360
goggles they're going to be collecting
our lives data and that's going to be

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370
our lives data and that's going to be
 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.870
our lives data and that's going to be
there well part of the attraction for

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880
there well part of the attraction for
 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.300
there well part of the attraction for
business in VR is going to be the fact

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310
business in VR is going to be the fact
 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.030
business in VR is going to be the fact
that everything is quantified that

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040
that everything is quantified that
 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.120
that everything is quantified that
everything is digitized and our digital

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130
everything is digitized and our digital
 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.920
everything is digitized and our digital
lives are going to become

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930
lives are going to become
 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.600
lives are going to become
paramount there and so the issues about

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610
paramount there and so the issues about
 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.490
paramount there and so the issues about
who owns that data the issues of who

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500
