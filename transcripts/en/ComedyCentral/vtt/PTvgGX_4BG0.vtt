00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:04.113
- I realize why Americans
don't travel abroad.

00:00:04.113 --> 00:00:06.346
I realize why they don't
live in other countries.

00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:08.429
Because it fucking sucks.

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:11.288
(audience laughing)

00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:14.205
(heavy bass music)

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:29.357
- Welcome to This is
Not Happening presents:

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:30.856
World of Blunder.

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:32.006
If you've never been to the show before,

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:33.756
this is a bunch of comics
telling fun stories

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:35.402
about real shit that happened.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.830
Give it up for Miss
Fortune Feimster everybody.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.830
(audience cheering)

00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:53.907
It's like I'm home.

00:00:53.907 --> 00:00:56.907
(audience laughing)

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:01.324
Oh God, I always, it
does feel like I'm home

00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:03.533
because I've always felt like I'm like

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.460
a Tuesday night stripper.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.359
(audience laughing)

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.225
You guys, well by now
you've heard my accent

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:13.071
and you know I'm not very sophisticated

00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:15.204
so there's that.

00:01:15.204 --> 00:01:17.499
I'm from North Carolina and you know,

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:20.176
I grew up, you know, I was, I guess,

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:22.011
what you would call like a redneck.

00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:22.849
I was a redneck.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.921
I wasn't one of those people that walked

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.400
into a gas station barefoot
like Britney Spears.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.526
That's just gross.

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:29.745
I had class.

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:32.745
(audience laughing)

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:36.125
I was one of those people that drank

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.704
out of a mason jar, you know?

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:40.377
And that was before it was cool.

00:01:40.377 --> 00:01:42.746
Like now it's cool to drink
out of a mason jar, you know?

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:44.723
People do it because it's vintage.

00:01:44.723 --> 00:01:47.178
They want to feel like they're
in a Mumford and Sons video.

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:50.178
(audience laughing)

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:55.193
They're like I want to
drink out of a mason jar.

00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:56.026
It's cool.

00:01:57.122 --> 00:01:58.242
I was like I drank out of a mason jar

00:01:58.242 --> 00:01:59.583
because I was a redneck.

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:02.642
I had green beans in a mason
jar like two days before,

00:02:02.642 --> 00:02:04.348
now I'm drinking out of it, you know?

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:05.907
(audience laughing)

00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:07.971
I was like I wanna drink
out of my mason jar.

00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:09.691
I want my mason jar.

00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:12.604
That's what's happening now
and just telling you guys.

00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:16.437
I drank out of a mason
jar before it was cool.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.096
So one thing my family didn't do.

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:20.118
We didn't travel.

00:02:20.118 --> 00:02:21.746
Like, that was not our thing, you know?

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:23.357
Our idea of branching out was going to

00:02:23.357 --> 00:02:26.240
the Hometown Buffet across town.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.440
That was dangerous.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.759
And if we wanted culture, I
went to a Chinese restaurant

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.795
and ordered lo-mein like
that was culture to me

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.676
or I would put Hollandaise
sauce on my steak

00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:39.587
instead of A1 sauce, which is delicious.

00:02:39.587 --> 00:02:43.372
(audience laughing)

00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:44.717
That just makes me really hungry.

00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.960
(audience laughing)

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.292
I love A1 sauce.

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:50.908
(audience laughing)

00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:53.189
So, you know, we definitely
didn't leave the country.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.556
That was crazy.

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:55.837
You know, once when I was young,

00:02:55.837 --> 00:02:58.515
I asked my dad what abroad meant

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:01.817
and he looked at me like
I was stupid, like duh.

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:03.290
It's a hot chick, and I was like.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.989
(audience laughing)

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:06.822
Yes.

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:10.504
That sounds exactly right.

00:03:10.504 --> 00:03:12.040
So by the time I graduated college,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.509
yes, that did happen.

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.784
(audience laughing)

00:03:14.784 --> 00:03:16.757
I was like, you know, I
need to broaden my horizons.

00:03:16.757 --> 00:03:18.580
I need to go see the world

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.383
and Mexico doesn't count, you know?

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:23.830
Because it's right next door
and it's not sophisticated.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.320
You could get a six pack of beer

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.775
and a hooker and a box of chicklets

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.210
for like three dollars

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.152
and you can use a Groupon on top of that.

00:03:32.152 --> 00:03:35.008
(audience laughing)

00:03:35.008 --> 00:03:36.559
So I was like I need to see the world

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:39.301
so I decided I was going to move to Spain,

00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:41.655
which was not a great idea.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.754
And not only was I going to travel there,

00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:44.925
I was like I'm going to live there

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:46.575
for an entire year.

00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:49.083
I'm going to pick a place
where they don't speak English.

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:50.249
That's fun.

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:51.181
No, it's not.

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:53.280
(audience laughing)

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.555
So when I arrived in Spain,

00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:58.433
I realized why Americans
don't travel abroad.

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:00.731
I realized why they don't
live in other countries.

00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.316
Because it fucking sucks.

00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:05.775
(audience laughing)

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:07.800
I'm like why am I an asshole because

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.623
I want more ice in my drink, you know?

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:11.748
(audience laughing)

00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:13.852
Why do I have to pay 75 cents

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:17.596
to use your shitty ass public restroom?

00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:18.904
I mean, I was glad that their gypsies

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:20.645
and vagrants didn't murder you

00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:23.198
like the ones do in America.

00:04:23.198 --> 00:04:25.288
They'll just fucking kill you.

00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:26.742
These guys will just steal your purse

00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:29.276
when you go to the
bathroom and, by the way,

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:31.876
I used to carry a purse all the time

00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:33.533
before I went to Spain.

00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:34.919
I was just walking down the street,

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.232
me and my purse.

00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:39.232
(audience laughing)

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.366
Just me and my purse, going to Starbucks,

00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:46.073
drinking out of a mason jar.

00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:48.507
(audience laughing)

00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:50.044
Now, I don't carry a purse.

00:04:50.044 --> 00:04:52.095
Thanks a lot Spain.

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:55.695
(audience laughing)

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.227
So I arrived at Spain and the thing

00:04:57.227 --> 00:05:00.449
about living in Spain is you
want to blend in, you know?

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.678
And I stuck out like a sore thumb

00:05:02.678 --> 00:05:05.080
and by sore thumb, I mean a fat,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.694
curly haired, tall American who

00:05:07.694 --> 00:05:11.295
everybody stared at everywhere I went.

00:05:11.295 --> 00:05:13.615
And it didn't help that we
had gone to war that year

00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:17.176
with Iraq so everyone hated America.

00:05:17.176 --> 00:05:18.291
It was awesome.

00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:19.344
(audience laughing)

00:05:19.344 --> 00:05:21.796
So everywhere I went, people
didn't even wave at me.

00:05:21.796 --> 00:05:23.585
They just were like this immediately.

00:05:23.585 --> 00:05:25.062
(audience laughing)

00:05:25.062 --> 00:05:25.962
I was like cool.

00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:28.165
I'm pretty sure that's
not how you say hola.

00:05:28.165 --> 00:05:31.165
(audience laughing)

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.559
So to make this travel
experience even greater,

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:37.509
I was like, you know what?

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.015
I want the full experience.

00:05:39.015 --> 00:05:41.609
I'm going to live with a native Spaniard.

00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:43.534
This sounds awesome.

00:05:43.534 --> 00:05:46.181
We can like habla espanol, totos los dias.

00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:49.181
(audience laughing)

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:53.556
That's every day in Spanish ma'am.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:54.772
Thank you.

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:55.712
(audience laughing)

00:05:55.712 --> 00:05:57.770
God, some people have no culture.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.504
(audience laughing)

00:06:01.504 --> 00:06:03.629
So I was like I'm going to
live with a native Spaniard

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.469
so I get to her apartmento,
that's apartment.

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.463
(audience laughing)

00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:10.187
And she wasn't there so I had to

00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:12.190
end up waiting outside
her door for an hour

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.897
with like three huge
suitcases and my purse.

00:06:14.897 --> 00:06:16.455
(audience laughing)

00:06:16.455 --> 00:06:18.448
Finally, the lady comes home.

00:06:18.448 --> 00:06:20.296
She's like 80 years old.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:21.965
She's cute, she's adorable.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.064
She's like this spanish Betty White.

00:06:24.064 --> 00:06:25.616
I'm like oh my God, this
is going to be amazing.

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:28.949
I'm living with the spanish Betty White.

00:06:29.804 --> 00:06:31.682
She really took to me too.

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:33.930
She had took to me too soon.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.664
Within three hours of being there,

00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:39.279
I walk into the den and
she's sitting on the couch

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.892
and she is there, but her
hair is no longer with her.

00:06:42.892 --> 00:06:44.885
(audience laughing)

00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:46.539
I'm like, she had hair when I showed up.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.727
I know she had hair when I showed up.

00:06:48.727 --> 00:06:50.778
These are the kind of
things you don't forget.

00:06:50.778 --> 00:06:52.611
She did not have hair.

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:56.578
So I'm scanning the room
and all of a sudden,

00:06:56.578 --> 00:06:58.975
I see a wig just hanging on the lampshade.

00:06:58.975 --> 00:07:00.759
I'm like oh my God, that's her hair.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.592
Holy shit.

00:07:02.737 --> 00:07:03.817
Oh my God.

00:07:03.817 --> 00:07:05.245
And she's sitting there on the couch

00:07:05.245 --> 00:07:07.934
and she just has two sprigs of curly hair.

00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:10.121
Just two sprigs just
hanging out like that.

00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:12.304
Like that ma'am, just like ugh.

00:07:12.304 --> 00:07:14.056
I'm like oh my God.

00:07:14.056 --> 00:07:15.267
She showed me to my room.

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:17.122
I was like okay, I can handle this.

00:07:17.122 --> 00:07:18.942
Whatever, I can get past this.

00:07:18.942 --> 00:07:20.169
She showed me to my room.

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:21.641
It's the size of a closet

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.172
and at this point, I didn't
know I was a lesbian yet.

00:07:24.172 --> 00:07:25.005
What, you're a lesbian?

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:26.081
That's crazy, you're so feminine.

00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:29.081
(audience laughing)

00:07:30.834 --> 00:07:33.046
I know, I know, thank you.

00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:35.268
So at this point, I am living in a closet

00:07:35.268 --> 00:07:37.619
both literally and figuratively.

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:40.797
(audience laughing)

00:07:40.797 --> 00:07:42.818
It's not great.

00:07:42.818 --> 00:07:44.150
So the thing about this lady is

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.619
that she wanted to turn
me into a senorita.

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:49.347
She wanted me to be the
best future housewife

00:07:49.347 --> 00:07:50.514
to a man ever.

00:07:51.488 --> 00:07:52.864
She's like I've got to prepare you

00:07:52.864 --> 00:07:54.256
for your future husband.

00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:55.339
I'm like hmm.

00:07:56.645 --> 00:07:58.002
I think it's going to take a lot more

00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:00.318
than cooking and cleaning, but cool.

00:08:00.318 --> 00:08:02.165
Like, whatever, we'll try this and so

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:04.020
she would hand me a broom and

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.892
I would pretend to be allergic to it.

00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:07.309
I was like oh no.

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:11.465
(audience laughing)

00:08:11.465 --> 00:08:13.048
And I even tried to get my own hair cut.

00:08:13.048 --> 00:08:13.997
I tried to get a haircut.

00:08:13.997 --> 00:08:15.328
I go to the beauty parlor.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.896
That's what we call them in
the south, beauty parlors.

00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:20.765
And I go there and I tell
the guy I want a trim.

00:08:20.765 --> 00:08:22.619
You know, I want a trim.

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:26.198
In America, a trim is like
mm, mm, mm, that much, okay?

00:08:26.198 --> 00:08:30.653
In Spain, you end up
looking like Miley Cyrus

00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:32.589
and not in the good way.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:35.594
At the end of this haircut, I'm like this.

00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:36.560
I have no hair.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.698
I look like Katie Lang.

00:08:37.698 --> 00:08:38.531
That's a lesbian.

00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:39.390
She's not great.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.140
(audience laughing)

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.973
So I'm freaking out.

00:08:42.973 --> 00:08:44.292
I'm like oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:48.028
I don't know what to
do and I need a friend.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.995
I need a Betty White.

00:08:49.995 --> 00:08:52.528
I need to eat cheesecake with somebody.

00:08:52.528 --> 00:08:54.583
So I'm like I know what I'm going to do.

00:08:54.583 --> 00:08:56.899
I'm going to go home and I'm going

00:08:56.899 --> 00:08:58.860
to find the one person who understands

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.527
what it's like not to have hair.

00:09:03.065 --> 00:09:05.713
She will understand my plight.

00:09:05.713 --> 00:09:08.713
So I get home and I walk in the door

00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:12.641
and I'm ready to be like
hey, we're in this together.

00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:14.933
We both don't have hair now.

00:09:14.933 --> 00:09:19.008
We're BFF forever and she
sees me walking in the door

00:09:19.008 --> 00:09:21.124
and she looks at me like this.

00:09:21.124 --> 00:09:23.580
(audience laughing)

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.163
I'm like excuse me?

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:30.004
And the she says que falla,

00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:31.722
which I don't know if
you know what this means.

00:09:31.722 --> 00:09:33.805
Que falla means how ugly.

00:09:35.153 --> 00:09:36.572
She said how ugly.

00:09:36.572 --> 00:09:38.575
I'm like you have two sprigs of hair.

00:09:38.575 --> 00:09:42.171
You have two fucking sprigs of hair.

00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:44.200
I will fucking shank you.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.123
I will kill you.

00:09:45.123 --> 00:09:49.123
I will shank you you
fucking two sprigs of hair.

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:53.173
(audience laughing)

00:09:57.147 --> 00:09:58.271
So I was like I'm done.

00:09:58.271 --> 00:09:59.634
I said I'm done with you.

00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:01.224
I am done with Spain.

00:10:01.224 --> 00:10:04.276
I will never live abroad again.

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:06.497
I was like I'm going to fucking Mexico

00:10:06.497 --> 00:10:10.662
because I love hookers
and I have a Groupon

00:10:10.662 --> 00:10:13.662
(audience cheering)

00:10:16.827 --> 00:10:18.438
- Fortune Feimester everybody.

00:10:18.438 --> 00:10:19.618
Fortune Feimster.

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:21.398
Last week, in honor of Trevor Moore,

00:10:21.398 --> 00:10:24.315
I asked you to tell me
stories of road rage

00:10:24.315 --> 00:10:25.820
and there were some great ones.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.337
Apparently, you guys are very, very angry

00:10:27.337 --> 00:10:28.469
when you get behind the wheel.

00:10:28.469 --> 00:10:30.122
So here is one of the
best ones that we saw.

00:10:30.122 --> 00:10:32.545
This week for our comment section contest,

00:10:32.545 --> 00:10:35.879
I guess we'll call it,
where would you move

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:36.712
if you had to move somewhere?

00:10:36.712 --> 00:10:37.803
If you started getting sick of America

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.518
and you had to go somewhere
else in the world,

00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:40.589
where would it be?

00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:41.422
That's it everybody.

00:10:41.422 --> 00:10:42.697
