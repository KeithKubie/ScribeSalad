(pulsing music)

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.349
- Since 2012, we have
been based in Savute.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.085 line:0%
I just want to walk you through

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:22.254 line:0%
the reason why we ended up there

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.657 line:0%
and how that kind of led into

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.862
the making of Savage Kingdom.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.433
Botswana is a land locked county

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.603
right in the heart
of Southern Africa.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.675
Chobe National Park is in
the northeastern corner

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:46.746
and it's a particularly dry
and fairly arid environment.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.648
It's almost semi-desert

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.450 align:start size:84% position:16%
and what that
really means is that

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.989
water is always at a premium
especially in the dry season.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.893 align:start size:97% position:3%
But Savute was a particularly
interesting place

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:05.097
in that the river that
flowed into that area

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:06.366
is an ephemeral river

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:10.370
and it only flows for 20
years in every hundred.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:16.109
Its name translates as
unpredictable because,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.812
and it's apt because
nobody really knows

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:23.650
when it will arrive or when
it will disappear again.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.820
Now that unpredictability is
due to a number of events.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.823
The catchment area
where the rain falls

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:32.725
that flows down into that area

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.461
is about a thousand
kilometers away.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:37.663 align:start size:84% position:16%
And on its long
journey getting there

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.631 align:start size:88% position:13%
it has to break through
several fault lines

00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.602 align:start size:88% position:13%
and these fault lines
sometimes block the flow

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.438
and sometimes release it.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.674 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then Savute
being so dry and arid

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.243
it relies quite heavily in also

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:53.179
the micro climates
around the area.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.947 align:start size:84% position:16%
If there's good
rainfall around Savute

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:57.416
and in the dry riverbed
leading up to Savute,

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.385 align:start size:84% position:16%
all of those factors
come together

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:03.556
and only then does the river
actually flow into this area.

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:09.929
When it does reach Savute and
when it flows into that area

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start size:94% position:6%
it empties out into the
bed of an old ancient lake

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.337 align:start size:84% position:16%
and really just brings
that back to life.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.774
It forms this incredible oasis
in the middle of the desert.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.943
And when it's at its full,

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:28.347
Savute is probably one
of the most incredible

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:31.016 align:start size:94% position:6%
wildlife habitats,
habitat that would rival,

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:33.720
any of the wildlife habitat,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.024 align:start size:88% position:13%
great wildlife habitats
we have in Africa.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:42.662 align:start size:97% position:3%
When I was a child I saw the
drying up of the channel,

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:45.131
it disappeared completely

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:47.300
and that was 35 years ago.

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.704
But it did return and in 2008,

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:56.842
the river flowed
back into Savute.

00:02:56.842 --> 00:03:00.679
In 2012, once the area
had responded somewhat,

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:03.182
we decided to move our
entire filming operation

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.818
into Savute for obvious reasons.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.421 align:start size:84% position:16%
After several years
of being there

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:12.192
we did two films on lions,
a film on a leopard family.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:16.195
In 2014, we started to see that

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.963 align:start size:84% position:16%
the area was
starting to dry out.

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start size:84% position:16%
All those factors that
enabled it to flow

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.503
slowly sort of went out of sync

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:28.007 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a big drying up
process was beginning.

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.210 align:start size:88% position:13%
We started noticing
that a lot of the herds,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.446
the big herds that
are gathered there

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:36.549 align:start size:94% position:6%
just started to naturally
move off literally

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.117
to greener pastures

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:42.888 align:start size:94% position:6%
and that presented a
problem for the predators.

00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:47.026
Now, the predators were
stuck in that habitat.

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:50.630
They were bound by their
territorial boundaries,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.831
they couldn't leave.

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:55.268 align:start size:88% position:13%
They were sort of thrust
into the situation.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.705 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I very soon started
to recognize that

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.408 align:start size:81% position:19%
this incredible
storm was brewing.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:05.744
We had a number of
predator families

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:09.849 align:start size:97% position:3%
that were being forced into
an untenable situation.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.987 align:start size:97% position:3%
They were being pushed and
forced in on top of each other

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:17.756
and that really was the
premise and the seed

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:21.761
that pushed forward
the whole concept for

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.930
the Savage Kingdom itself.

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.004
What was going to happen
when Africa's top predators

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:34.674
were thrust into a confined area

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:40.280
and most of their resources
were gonna be taken away?

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.182
Let's have a peek.

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.817
(thunder rumbles)

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:47.987 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Narrator] One
kingdom, five heroes.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.826
Each with a unique power.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:04:59.866
Fighting,

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.369
not just to survive.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:08.174
(growling)

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:11.944 align:start size:88% position:13%
But to reign supreme
over the savage kingdom.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.848
(dramatic music)

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.866
- Tonight I'm gonna walk you
through sort of round one,

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:38.037
the first season of Savute's
own real life Game of Thrones.

00:05:40.872 --> 00:05:42.942
A season of diminishing habitat

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:46.712 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a number of
predator families that

00:05:46.712 --> 00:05:48.514 align:start size:84% position:16%
were literally
fighting to survive

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.351
and exist in that
particular area.

00:05:52.818 --> 00:05:55.154
From the onset, we knew that

00:05:56.555 --> 00:06:00.126
this was not gonna
be an easy ride.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.195
These groups of predators

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.865
were being forced into this
really untenable situation

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:10.002 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't going to be a
story about Bambis and rainbows.

00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:14.807
Knowing the circumstance

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:18.544
and wanting to be true
to that whole dynamic,

00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:22.581 align:start size:94% position:6%
we were really determined
to capture life

00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.282
as it unfolded in front of us

00:06:24.282 --> 00:06:26.752
no matter how harsh and brutal

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:28.755
and difficult it became.

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:35.227 align:start size:94% position:6%
I have a bugbear about
natural history films that

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:38.231
sanitize predators
and what they do.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:44.337 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think that people
overlook they are predators

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:47.372
and they're doing
what is so natural.

00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:50.676
It's not for us to
pull away from it

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.211
and I think that the
more that you pull away

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.912
from the reality
of what they do,

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:55.213
the less you care for them,

00:06:55.213 --> 00:06:56.948
the less you bind to their lives

00:06:56.948 --> 00:06:59.151
and emotionally invest in them.

00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:04.123
We were determined to show
a sort of honest account

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.125 align:start size:84% position:16%
of the way these
predators really live

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.527
unaffected by people.

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.429
No human pressure was involved.

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:14.099 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just a purely natural
circumstance that
was playing out

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.602
and how hard each one
of these predators

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.772 align:start size:84% position:16%
had to fight just
in order to survive.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.309
Before we go into more about

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:25.578 align:start position:0%
the Savage Kingdom and 
the dynamic,

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:30.549 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'd like to introduce the
team that helped me film this.

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:34.153
Obviously we had several
family groups to follow.

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:37.323 align:start size:84% position:16%
We had two prides
of lion, a wild dog,

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:42.828 align:start size:84% position:16%
a leopard mother and
a clan of hyenas.

00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:45.130
And so, we needed multiple
crews if we were going to

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.969
embed in the area and have
a crew per animal family.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.771
This is Rich, he is
my right hand man

00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:55.674
who Geoff was talking about.

00:07:55.674 --> 00:07:58.110
He's a childhood friend

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.279
and he's our longest
serving cameraman.

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:04.350
And then there's a crazy kid,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.419
crazy American kid.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.819
He's from LA.

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:09.421
He gave up his life in the city

00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:11.890
and decided to move out
into the wild with us.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.093
Very passionate, very driven

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:16.195
and a lovely, lovely guy.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.667
Then there's Lawrence, he's
my cousin, that's not me.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:26.538
He is a Botswana bred bush
wreck kind of like I am.

00:08:26.538 --> 00:08:29.775
And the adjusting,
for him adjusting

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:32.010
to living out in the
wild and the bush skill

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.646
is quite, came very easy to him.

00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:36.549
He's a great asset to the team.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.918
And then there was
long, tall, thin Cam

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:42.021
who is a bit of a
wary Australian guy

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.656 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I knew him
for about 20 years

00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:46.659
and I knew at home in Oz

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.562 align:start size:84% position:16%
he didn't really
bath everyday anyway.

00:08:50.562 --> 00:08:53.732
So, him joining us, you know,

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:56.669
would have been such an
easy transition for him.

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:58.837
(audience laughing)

00:08:58.837 --> 00:09:00.072
I wanna start by saying that

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:03.742
being a cameraman
for the NHFU for us

00:09:03.742 --> 00:09:06.445
is very much modeled
on what I learned to do

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.380
and how I grew up.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.083
And it's quite a difficult job.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.118
If it is always your
life it comes naturally

00:09:13.118 --> 00:09:15.454
but for guys who
are not used to it

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.956
it's quite a task.

00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:20.459
You have to be bushman, tracker,

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:24.630
you have to be cook, you have
to be pretty much everything.

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:26.699
And then you've got,

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start size:84% position:16%
on top of that
you've got to spend

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:30.569 align:start size:84% position:16%
month on end living
out in the wild

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:33.205 align:start size:94% position:6%
just following, endlessly
following animals.

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.941
Month on just keep going.

00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:40.612
And it takes a very specific
type of character to do that.

00:09:40.612 --> 00:09:44.784 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I think fundamentally, you
have to be an animal lover.

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:48.020
If your enthusiasm
is about animals

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.322 align:start size:94% position:6%
and following your story and
loving their behavior,

00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:53.092
the camera work kind
of comes secondary.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.360
As long as you can do that

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.562
you can spend the amount
of time that you need to

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.331
to get what you want.

00:10:01.499 --> 00:10:04.937
It wasn't all just lying around.

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:08.007
You know, it was long hours.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:12.177
Lions used to, they sleep
for most of their lives.

00:10:12.177 --> 00:10:13.812
80% of their time
they're asleep.

00:10:13.812 --> 00:10:16.749
You will spend days
watching them sleep

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:20.152 align:start size:97% position:3%
just to capture a 15-minute
piece of interaction

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.687
on the fourth day,

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:23.389
and it's quite exhausting.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:27.025
And you have to be fairly
comfortable in your life

00:10:27.025 --> 00:10:30.630
and clearly Cam because
he wasn't showering.

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:33.865
Anyway, but there's
a point in which

00:10:33.865 --> 00:10:36.768
everybody starts to
go a little bit crazy

00:10:36.768 --> 00:10:41.473
and you start having your own
little docudrama in the car.

00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:43.976
You sort of fight wars and
you do all sorts of things

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:46.612
and everybody at some point
just gets a little bit manic

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:48.080
and a little bit crazy.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.917 align:start size:97% position:3%
And start doing some
particularly stupid things,

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.352
particularly Cam.

00:10:56.054 --> 00:10:59.892
Everybody seems to lose
the plot at some point

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:02.628
but very quickly
we regain it and

00:11:03.728 --> 00:11:05.297
you know, kick them in the line

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:08.968 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they start focusing
on the job again.

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:11.169 align:start size:84% position:16%
One of the things
that is so important

00:11:11.169 --> 00:11:15.341
to getting a behavior and
working with these animals

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.844
is you've got to get these
animals to really trust you.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.213 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now we had been
there for three years

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:22.748
before the Savage
Kingdom started

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:25.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a lot of these
animals really started

00:11:25.784 --> 00:11:28.621
to become acclimated to us.

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:33.793
And as you can see they would
use our car as shade so often.

00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:37.730 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's how comfortable
they became with us

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.633 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it's important
thing to do with animals

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:43.602 align:start size:84% position:16%
that they can play
out their normal lives

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:46.906
without you feeling like
you're influencing them.

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:49.608 align:start position:0%
Only then can we really immerse
ourselves into their lives

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:53.412 align:start size:88% position:13%
and let them just get
on with it unencumbered.

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:59.284 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now, some of you would
have noticed that our cars

00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:02.087
we paint with zebra stripes.

00:12:02.087 --> 00:12:05.056 align:start size:88% position:13%
I know it's the
Botswana national animal

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:06.925
but we really do that because

00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:08.960
it's cool, we're
young, we're hip.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.063
(audience laughing)
We wanna be different

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:13.899 align:start size:81% position:19%
and we wanna be
noticed, you know?

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.369
Most of that's not true.

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:18.703
The only thing that
is true about that

00:12:18.703 --> 00:12:22.041
is that we do wanna be noticed.

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:26.979
Most animals and predators
only see in black and white

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:29.715
and there are a lot
of other vehicles

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:30.982 align:start size:81% position:19%
that would come
through that area,

00:12:30.982 --> 00:12:32.384
tourists would be
traveling through

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:34.986
and what we wanted to
do is make ourselves

00:12:34.986 --> 00:12:36.721
instantaneously recognizable

00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:39.224 align:start size:84% position:16%
to the characters that
we're working with.

00:12:39.224 --> 00:12:41.894
That they could at a glance know

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:45.130
that we were there
and they trusted us

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they were completely
comfortable with
us having around,

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:49.701
and they knew that we weren't
going to impede on their lives

00:12:49.701 --> 00:12:52.404
while they hunted
and what they did.

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:55.908 align:start size:88% position:13%
And it so often happened
where we would be

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.444
working with a leopard,

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.978 align:start size:94% position:6%
she would go and she would
lie down in the tree.

00:12:59.978 --> 00:13:02.447
It's getting a bit hot, she'd
given up hunting for the day

00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:04.783
and she would get up and we'd be

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.218
80, 90 meters away from her.

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:09.354 align:start position:0%
She'd get up and she'd literally
walk straight to the car,

00:13:09.354 --> 00:13:10.789
crawl underneath our
car and go to sleep

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.991
or lie right next to us.

00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:15.026
They would choose to come to us.

00:13:15.026 --> 00:13:16.895
They sort of trusted us enough

00:13:16.895 --> 00:13:18.430
and it was just an indication

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.266
of how well that plan worked

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:24.436
and how accustomed they were
to us and us being around.

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:29.975 align:start size:94% position:6%
From a childhood
fascination with predators

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:33.145 align:start size:84% position:16%
to a adult familiarity
with predators.

00:13:34.245 --> 00:13:35.447
Andy and I were talking recently

00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:38.149
and in the past 20 years or so,

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:40.185 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've spent more
time with predators

00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:42.855
than I have with people.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:46.224 align:start size:97% position:3%
I am fascinated about their
level of intelligence.

00:13:46.224 --> 00:13:49.361
I am completely passionate about

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.397 align:start size:81% position:19%
spending time with
these animals.

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:53.732
Each one of them develop,

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:56.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
each species develops
a unique skillset

00:13:56.835 --> 00:14:00.272 align:start size:97% position:3%
that they use in very
different ways to each other.

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:02.041
And even beyond that,

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:08.313
specific individuals will
actually develop a skillset

00:14:08.313 --> 00:14:11.917 align:start size:88% position:13%
that is specific to
that particular animal.

00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:15.954
That is just an indication of

00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:18.289
the level of intelligence
that these animals have

00:14:18.289 --> 00:14:20.792
and it's what really drives me.

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:24.095
The fact that I can be with
predators out in the field,

00:14:24.095 --> 00:14:26.431 align:start size:88% position:13%
they adapt, they
change, they anticipate

00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:31.236 align:start size:88% position:13%
and there's nothing more
exciting than knowing

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.074
that at any point in
the day, at any time,

00:14:36.007 --> 00:14:37.409
that animal may do something

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:38.944 align:start size:84% position:16%
that nobody has ever
witnessed before,

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:40.945 size:88% position:44%
nobody's ever seen before.

00:14:40.945 --> 00:14:43.448
And that's really what drives me

00:14:43.448 --> 00:14:44.816
and what keeps me out there

00:14:44.816 --> 00:14:48.654
and keeps me wanting to
be with these animals.

00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:53.525 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now for some slightly
more serious side
to this whole thing.

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:57.696
The one thing that all these
predators have in common is

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:02.500
they have to kill
in order to live.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.003
It's exhilarating,

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:08.373
it's exciting,

00:15:08.373 --> 00:15:11.075
it's a very primal,
almost gladiatorial

00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:13.645
kind of instinct that they have.

00:15:13.645 --> 00:15:15.914
And I really, I'll
go back to this point

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:17.850
that I really feel that

00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:22.120
people are very quick to judge

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.859
and I don't shy away from it.

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think that we have
to get accustomed

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.764
to the reality of their
lives and embrace it,

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:34.900
and know that it's
completely natural.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.568
It's not gratuitous.

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:41.039 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's not for any other reason
than just pure survival

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:42.540
and it's very natural,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.078
and I think we should become
more and more accepting to it.

00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:53.652
I don't think that, I
mean hyenas as you know

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:56.288
have got a really bad rap.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.523
And they're sometime
referred to as evil

00:15:58.523 --> 00:16:01.793 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they're sometime referred
to as horrible or bad

00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:06.064 align:start size:94% position:6%
but you know, it's not for
us to lay that on them.

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:07.565
That's a human construct.

00:16:07.565 --> 00:16:09.534
They're just doing what they
are naturally designed to do,

00:16:09.534 --> 00:16:12.538
what they are born
to do to survive.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:18.076
Game of Thrones,
Geoff eluded to it

00:16:18.076 --> 00:16:21.946 align:start size:88% position:13%
and what the comparison
with that was.

00:16:21.946 --> 00:16:24.883
We were in a finite environment.

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.419 align:start size:81% position:19%
We had a series
of different clans

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:30.121
that were fighting it
out to take ownership

00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:33.024
or just to exist or to
own that piece of land.

00:16:33.024 --> 00:16:38.263 align:start size:97% position:3%
And when we are trying to
explain this concept to people

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:42.167 align:start size:88% position:13%
the minute we reference
Game of Thrones

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:43.334
it became a shorthand.

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:45.704 align:start size:88% position:13%
They understood exactly
what it is about

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it became a shorthand
for us to try and

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.507
explain the whole concept

00:16:49.507 --> 00:16:52.977
and how we wanted to
treat this project.

00:16:52.977 --> 00:16:55.547
We were after predator conflict

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:58.716 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that is
certainly what we got

00:16:58.716 --> 00:17:00.552 align:start size:84% position:16%
during our time
with Savage Kingdom.

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:02.787
In 15 months of filming,

00:17:02.787 --> 00:17:07.392
we saw 28 different war scenes

00:17:07.592 --> 00:17:11.597 align:start size:88% position:13%
where one clan
conflicted with another.

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.098 align:start size:88% position:13%
One or other
combination of predators

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:16.401 align:start size:94% position:6%
actually came together and
literally fought it out

00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:19.271
for ownership or for a kill

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:22.207
or for possession of
a particular area.

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.643
And the parallels between

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:26.678 align:start size:88% position:13%
what is happening there
and Game of Thrones

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:29.281 align:start size:88% position:13%
you can obviously
start to see that link.

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:32.284 align:start size:97% position:3%
We thought it was a
particular stroke of genius

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:34.286
to ask Charles Dance to.

00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:38.924
He was one of the leaders

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:40.458
of one of the clans
in Game of Thrones

00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:42.961
and we thought that bringing
him in to narrate it for us

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:47.332 align:start size:97% position:3%
would really help that
concept and help that project.

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:48.767
Charles was very

00:17:51.269 --> 00:17:53.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
intrigued by the way
that we want to treat it.

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:59.144 align:start size:97% position:3%
He really supported it and
was very interested in the way

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:03.248
and what we were trying to
achieve with this project.

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:08.687 align:start size:97% position:3%
And during the narrating
part of it when in the studio

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:10.822 align:start size:84% position:16%
he also seemed to have
quite a lot of fun

00:18:10.822 --> 00:18:12.658
and let's take a look.

00:18:17.195 --> 00:18:18.197
- I am life.

00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:24.303
(thunder rumbles)

00:18:25.503 --> 00:18:26.438
I am death.

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:31.510
I give everything.

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:38.550
But I take all.

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:42.321
(dramatic music)

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:50.929
I am the Savage Kingdom.

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:53.699
(dramatic music)

00:18:56.334 --> 00:18:58.170
The old queen is dead.

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:03.809 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now the greatest hunter
takes the throne.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.451 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
She leads the most
brutal army in the realm.

00:19:15.086 --> 00:19:15.921
Matsumi.

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:23.095
How was that?

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.867
Well, I'm not doing it again.

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:31.603
(dramatic music)

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.446 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Charles was
great to work with.

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:47.585
We felt that his voice
had a lot of gravitas

00:19:47.585 --> 00:19:49.087
and had a lot of gravitas to it,

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:52.357 align:start size:97% position:3%
and with his skill he was able
to add a lot of nuance into

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:56.395
the way that we wanted
to portray this film.

00:19:56.395 --> 00:20:00.731
And also give it very much
a sort of feature feel to it

00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:02.700
in the very much scripted drama

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.704
type of delivery
that we were after.

00:20:07.238 --> 00:20:11.142
Savage Kingdom really became
a perspective piece for us.

00:20:11.142 --> 00:20:14.045
We are following five
different family groups

00:20:14.045 --> 00:20:16.848 align:start size:88% position:13%
and each of the
episodes we try to tell

00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:19.985
from that particular
family's point of view.

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:22.721
We buy into, we wanted
the audience to associate

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:25.824
with a heroine, with a
character and a family

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:26.891
and go on their journey.

00:20:26.891 --> 00:20:29.060
Know what they wanted to do,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.261
what their ambition was,

00:20:30.261 --> 00:20:32.497 align:start size:84% position:16%
their path, their
life, their struggle.

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:36.234
And at some point they
were gonna cross with

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:38.770
these other predators.

00:20:39.337 --> 00:20:43.141 align:start size:84% position:16%
And inadvertently
they became the enemy

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:45.377 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then that all gets
turned on its head

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:47.645
when you now watch an
episode that was from

00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:50.181 align:start size:84% position:16%
the so-called
enemy's perspective

00:20:50.181 --> 00:20:52.517
and the whole dynamic shift.

00:20:53.918 --> 00:20:55.754
We are not comfortable

00:20:57.221 --> 00:21:00.325 align:start size:84% position:16%
with the whole
anthropomorphism idea

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:04.496 align:start position:0%
and we try to deliberately
avoid it in a lot of our films.

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:06.632
We feel that...

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:13.671 align:start size:97% position:3%
Well, the problem is is that
we still wanted people to

00:21:13.671 --> 00:21:15.440
emotionally invest
in your characters

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.175
and invest in those people.

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:20.645
Invest in those characters
and invest in their story.

00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:22.346
What we did is we introduced a

00:21:22.346 --> 00:21:25.283
second person voice
or a proxy voice

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start size:84% position:16%
that we used as a
sort of emotional step

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:30.522 align:start size:84% position:16%
just to kind of
navigate you through

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:33.357 align:start size:81% position:19%
the sort of, what
those animals wanted,

00:21:33.357 --> 00:21:36.561 align:start size:84% position:16%
their intent, their
instincts, their drive

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:39.865 align:start size:84% position:16%
without actually
being anthropomorphic.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:42.166 align:start size:84% position:16%
And we think it
really, really worked

00:21:42.166 --> 00:21:45.437 align:start size:97% position:3%
and Charles bought into that
idea really, really well

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:47.105
and he executed it
incredibly well.

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:51.276
We couldn't have asked for
a better delivery from him.

00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:55.580
An example of that is Saba

00:21:56.781 --> 00:21:59.450 align:start size:81% position:19%
who I'll introduce
you to shortly,

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:00.819
one of our main characters.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.220
She had a set of cubs

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.055 align:start position:0%
and she used to leave them 
on leopard rock.

00:22:04.055 --> 00:22:06.925 align:start size:84% position:16%
And it acted as a
nursery for her cubs

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:09.294
while she was out hunting.

00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:10.594
And just that drive with her

00:22:10.594 --> 00:22:13.365
wanting to return to her cubs,

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:15.600
that second person
voice just gave you

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.269
that anxiety and that drive

00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:20.371
and it just helped
you contextualize

00:22:20.371 --> 00:22:22.607
their lives in human terms.

00:22:24.308 --> 00:22:27.912 align:start size:97% position:3%
Names, a lot of the names that
we have adopted in the film

00:22:27.912 --> 00:22:29.414
were names that already existed

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:31.149 align:start size:84% position:16%
for a lot of the
characters out there.

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:33.285
They are names that
guides in the area

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:35.620
and people had given them

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.955
and most of the time
they were functional,

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:38.823
they earned their names.

00:22:38.823 --> 00:22:41.058
They were descriptive
of their character

00:22:41.058 --> 00:22:43.394
or of an area that they lived in

00:22:43.394 --> 00:22:45.564
or some behavior trait,

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:48.734 align:start size:84% position:16%
behavioral trait
that they used to do.

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.703
It definitely wasn't

00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:56.307
an idea to make them
into little people

00:22:56.307 --> 00:22:58.143
but it gave us the shorthand

00:22:58.143 --> 00:23:00.311 align:start size:84% position:16%
to be able to identify
with individuals

00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:02.581
within this greater battle.
