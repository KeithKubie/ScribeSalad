00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This question tests how well you understand the Diffie-Hellman key-agreement protocol.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first two statements are the security of the scheme depends on it being difficult to solve

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a^x = b mod n for a given b, n and x.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The security of the scheme depends on it being different to solve

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a^x = b mod n for x given a, b, and n.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The last two statements are if the value used for g in the Diffie-Hellman scheme

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is not a generator or a primitive root, the participants might not agree on the same key.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The last statement--if the modulus n is not prime, the Diffie-Hellman scheme

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
would still be correct, meaning two participants produce the same key,

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but it might not be secure. Check all that apply.
