TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.674
coming to you once again from
the YouTube Space in Tokyo.

00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:06.840
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.136
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:11.430
We're rolling out
Developer Preview 3

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.460
with the final Android O APIs,
the latest system images,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.290
and an update to
Android Studio to help

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.424
you get ready for the consumer
release later in the summer.

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:21.840
If you've already enrolled
your device in the Android Beta

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.310
program, you'll
receive an update

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.520
to Developer Preview 3 shortly.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.270
To make your app
compatible with Android O

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.850
and enhance it with Android
O features and APIs,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.440
check out the post.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.660
Developer Preview 1 of
the Play Billing Library

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.040
is now available.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.407
This library aims to simplify
the development process

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:39.240
when you want to make
money through your app

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.823
without having to deal with all
the different types of payment

00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:42.480
methods.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.790
For the intro video and
a link to the CodeLab,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.710
head on over to the post.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.410
reCAPTCHA is now available
as an Android API

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.450
as part of Google Play services.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.570
It uses our newest invisible
reCAPTCHA technology,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.180
which runs risk analysis
behind the scenes

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.920
and has enabled
millions of human users

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.157
to pass through with
zero click every day.

00:01:02.157 --> 00:01:03.990
Head on over to the
post to learn more about

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.380
how to integrate the
reCAPTCHA Android API.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.480
Blockly is our
open source library

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.090
for creating the block-based
coding experiences,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.030
and we're now finalizing
the 1.0 release of Blockly

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.890
on Android and iOS.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.200
These versions have everything
you need to use Blockly

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.150
natively in your mobile app.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.390
To get started, a video and
all the links are on the post.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.080
The latest set of improvements
to the Firebase Dynamic Links

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.160
are now available in our
iOS and Android SDKs.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.830
They enable you to create
user-to-user sharing campaigns

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.720
programmatically
from within your app,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.850
and a rebuilt Android
API makes it easier

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.010
to handle incoming
dynamic links.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.530
Example code is on the post.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.600
You can now manage both
your custom domains

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.300
and SSL certificates using
the new beta features

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.780
of the Admin API and G
Cloud command line tool.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.370
These new beta features
provide improved management,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.090
including the ability to
automate mapping domains

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.700
and uploading SSL certificates.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.180
Example commands
are on the post.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.450
Spinnaker 1.0 is now available.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.600
It's an open source,
multi-Cloud, continuous

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.719
delivery platform
used in production

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:12.570
at companies like Netflix,
Waze, Target, and Cloudera.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.160
There's also a new
open source command

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.260
line interface
tool called Halyard

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.864
that makes it easy to
deploy Spinnaker itself.

00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:21.030
To learn what Spinnaker can
do for your own software

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.750
