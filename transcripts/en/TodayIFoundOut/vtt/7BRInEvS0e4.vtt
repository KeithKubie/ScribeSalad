00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.140
A Man Once Tried to Raise His Son as a Native
Speaker in Klingon

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.120
The man is computational linguist Dr. d’Armond
Speers.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.309
Speers is actually not a huge Start Trek fan
himself.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.659
Indeed many Klingon language enthusiasts aren’t,
contrary to popular belief.

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.130
They tend to be language lovers fascinated
by constructed languages, of which Klingon

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.539
is a relatively thriving one, hence why they
gravitate towards it.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.369
Speers became fascinated with the Klingon
language after reading a flyer on a bulletin

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.859
board at Georgetown where Speers was studying
linguistics.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:39.059
The flyer was advertising the Klingon Language
Institute (KLI), founded by Dr. Larence M.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.059
Schoen.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.579
“I thought to myself, ‘A new language.’

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.920
The fact that it was a constructed language
really appealed to me.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.020
It sounded like fun,” said Speers.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.039
He soon became one of the more famous members
of KLI when he decided to experiment with

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.480
trying to teach a child to be a native speaker
of Klingon, his own son, Alec.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.250
Specifically, he stated, “I was interested
in the question of whether my son, going through

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.780
his first language acquisition process, would
acquire it like any human language.”

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.340
So as not to cause his Alec to have potential
learning disabilities and to make sure his

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.300
son could fully integrate into society without
language problems, Speers’ wife, who was

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.030
fully behind Speers’ experiment, always
spoke English to the child.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.420
(The reason for concern was that lack of an
adequate language for your brain to use before

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.310
the age of around 5 can severely stunt a person’s
mental capacity and causes extremely detrimental

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.820
learning disabilities in later life, which
through history is largely why deaf people

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.780
were once considered mentally handicapped,
even though with an adequate language taught

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.909
to them at an early age, like a sign language,
they are just as smart as anyone else.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.940

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.039
In any event, unlike his wife, Speers almost
exclusively spoke to Alec in Klingon.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.119
He even would sing the Klingon Imperial Anthem,
May the Empire Endure, as a bedtime lullaby

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.800
to Alec, which his son soon picked up and
would also sing.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.860
This experiment went on for about three years,
during which time, as you might imagine, Speers

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.750
was given a lot of funny looks in public as
he’d converse with Alec in Klingon.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.640
At first when people would ask what language
he was speaking, Speers would respond, “speaking

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.010
Klingon”, but after getting a lot of dirty
looks and comments for this, he switched to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.240
just saying, “speaking a constructed language”,
which generally would forestall potential

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.990
negative comments.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.690
Despite certain people being aghast that a
father would do this, thinking it perhaps

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.440
detrimental to a child, Speers, being a language
expert had a different view on it.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.590
“My feeling is that it’s good for people
in general to know more than one language.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.770
You get different viewpoints and perspectives
on things, and there is evidence to suggest

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.940
that kids who are bilingual do better academically,
whether their second language is a constructed

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.210
language or not.”

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.350
Despite the limitation of the language, Speers
claimed, “I’ve been able to say almost

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.880
everything I’ve needed to say to Alec in
Klingon…

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.510
One of the reasons I find the Klingon language
so interesting is that because the vocabulary

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.140
and grammar is so limited, you really have
to think to figure out how you’re going

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.570
to say something.”

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.510
For instance, “When I ask him to turn out
the lights, I say the Klingon for ‘make

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.510
it dark’.”

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.660
This joy found in the difficulty in saying
things in Klingon over English didn’t rub

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.540
off on his son, and Alec more and more resisted
speaking in Klingon, as Speers anticipated

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.540
in the beginning.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.050
“There’s going to come a time when he’s
going to stop making the effort to speak Klingon

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.720
because it’ll be easier for him to speak
English.”

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.970
Further, Speers was the only person who would
speak this language to Alec and the boy never

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.200
saw Star Trek during this experiment, so didn’t
ever see anyone but his father speaking it.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.600
As everyone else spoke English, Alec gradually
stopped responding to his father if he spoke

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.270
Klingon and, around three years old, Speers
states, “He stopped listening to me when

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.270
I spoke in Klingon.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.530
It was clear that he didn’t enjoy it, and
I didn’t want to make it into a problem,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.400
so I switched to English…”

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.600
Today the teenage Alec no longer is fluent
in Klingon and reportedly can’t even pick

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.530
out the meaning of individual words of the
language, which probably is a fact that helps

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.830
him out with the ladies in High School.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.330
Bonus Facts:
• The Klingon language continues to grow,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.490
despite the lack of new Star Trek shows or
movies featuring it, with new words added

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.880
each year, generally thought up by Marc Okrand,
the person who often mistakenly is said to

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.389
have first created the Klingon Language (in
fact, the actor who played “Scotty”, James

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.599
Doohan, did that at a very rudimentary level,
coming up with the style and the first few

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.599
words.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.979
Okrand took James Doohan’s work and made
it into a full language, which is why he’s

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.319
generally given the credit for first coming
up with it, doing the vast majority of the

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.300
work to make it into a real language.)

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.610
• It is estimated that approximately 20-30
people in the world, including Speers, are

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.060
fluent speakers of Klingon, with another few
thousand that are familiar enough that they

00:04:47.060 --> 00:05:02.330
can pick out words when they hear 
it spoken.
