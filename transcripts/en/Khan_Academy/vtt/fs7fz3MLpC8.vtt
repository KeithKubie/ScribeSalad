00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.860
Determine whether the
statement is always,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.390
sometimes, or never true,
and explain why.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.730
The statement here is b squared
plus b minus 2, all of

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.460
that over b plus 2 is equal
to b minus 1 for all

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.160
real numbers b.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.440
Well one thing that just jumps
out at you before you even try

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.440
to manipulate this algebraically
is that I can

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.730
think of a b value where this
left expression won't be equal

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.780
to b minus 1.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.680
A b value that will make this
left expression undefined.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.410
And it becomes undefined if this
denominator becomes 0.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.230
And the way the denominator is
going to become 0 is if b is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.800
negative 2.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.140
So let's write that down.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:45.400
If b is equal to negative 2,
then b squared plus b minus 2

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.920
over b plus 2, what
does that become?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.220
It equals-- b squared would be 4
minus 2 minus 2, which would

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.380
be 0/0, which is undefined.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.290
It's not equal to-- let me
write this this way.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:22.440
It's not equal to b minus 1,
which is-- negative 2 minus 1,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.260
negative 3.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.740
When you put negative 2 in here,
on the left-hand side,

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.060
it doesn't evaluate
to negative 3.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.520
It evaluates to 0/0,
which is undefined.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.630
So we already found an example
of a b where this is not true.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.570
So it's definitely not always
going to be true.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.600
We found a case.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.860
Now, let's algebraically
manipulate this and see if

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.330
it's true for pretty much
any other number.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.490
So let's see if we can maybe
factor the numerator up there.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.250
So b squared plus b minus 2.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.070
If you think about it, two
numbers when you take their

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.770
product is negative 2, and when
you add them you get 1.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.380
Well, that's going to be
positive 2 and negative 1.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.560
So the numerator we can
rewrite as b plus 2

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.970
times b minus 1.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.100
And then the denominator
is b plus 2.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.540
Well we can just leave
it like that.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.410
Let's just work on the
left-hand side.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.660
Now, if we assume that b is not
equal to negative 2, then

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.020
b plus 2 divided by b plus
2 is well defined.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.710
It is 1.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.020
As long as it's not
0/0 it will be 1.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.940
And so this expression is the
same thing as b minus 1 if we

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.810
assume that b is not equal
to negative 2.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.920
So if you assume that b is not
equal to negative 2, this

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.310
thing over here does indeed
equal b minus 1.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.810
So it is true for all of the
other real numbers except for

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.070
negative 2.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.110
So this is sometimes true.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.145
It's true every time except for
the case where b is equal

00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:51.647
to negative 2.

00:02:51.647 --> 00:02:53.340
And you can even try it
with some number here.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.590
Try it with 0.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.860
If I were to do 0 squared plus 0
minus 2, you get negative 2.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.980
Over 0 plus 2 is 2.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.510
And then that does indeed
equal negative 1.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.700
So it works with 0,
it works with 1.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.420
It'll work with any number
other than b is equal to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.220
negative 2.
