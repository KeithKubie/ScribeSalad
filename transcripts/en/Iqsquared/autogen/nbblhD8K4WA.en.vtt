teams and rich teams and I had this poor

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620
teams and rich teams and I had this poor
 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.920
teams and rich teams and I had this poor
team in my backyard that was at 1/5 the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930
team in my backyard that was at 1/5 the
 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.930

circles around all these rich teams and
 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.150
circles around all these rich teams and
it made no sense to me

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160
it made no sense to me
 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.589
it made no sense to me
because I thought if the market for the

players and the poor teams wouldn't
 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.430
players and the poor teams wouldn't
stand a chance so this story that

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440
stand a chance so this story that
 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.839
stand a chance so this story that
emerges it turns out the market for

terms of losses one of the insights of
behavioral economics is that you think

00:25:34.639 --> 00:25:34.649
behavioral economics is that you think

when in fact if you go back over the
 

01:02:05.279 --> 01:02:07.130
when in fact if you go back over the
game there's quite likely something to

01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:07.140
game there's quite likely something to
 

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.420
game there's quite likely something to
have in the beginning of game that no

so they didn't think economists were

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:00.530
so they didn't think economists were

lots of collaborations which last a very
 

01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:39.900
lots of collaborations which last a very
long time and kind of ran their natural
