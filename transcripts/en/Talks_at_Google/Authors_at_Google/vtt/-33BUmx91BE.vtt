MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, and welcome

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.940
to Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.250
Today, it's my great pleasure
to introduce a representative

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.310
from the collective
known as Frank Schaeffer.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.030
I say collective because
it seems unlikely

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.510
that one person could
have amassed a CV that

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.270
includes all of the following.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.330
Born into a family of
prominent evangelicals,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.310
and helping them found the
religious right in the United

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.830
States.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.540
Rejecting that
political point of view,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.420
and becoming a vocal
enemy of the Tea Party,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.100
directing slasher movies,
becoming a "New York Times"

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.070
best-selling author of both
fiction and nonfiction,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.050
becoming a visual
artist whose work

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.510
has been shown and
collected around the world,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.310
a frequent guest on "The Rachel
Maddow Show," with appearances

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.330
on "Oprah," the "Today" show,
"Fresh Air," and "BBC News."

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.590
An in-demand
lecturer who's spoken

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.270
at Princeton, The Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.560
A no longer terrible father, and
a pretty darn good grandfather.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.230
But most of all, a thoughtful,
reflective observer

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.920
of the human condition
in our relation

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.500
to spirituality, religion,
art, and the universe.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.490
I left of surviving
polio and becoming

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.320
a member of a Greek Orthodox
Church, and many other things.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.030
There just isn't time.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.470
Please join me in
welcoming Frank Schaeffer.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.428
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.340
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Hi, thanks
for coming out today.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.180
I just live up the road here
in Salisbury, Massachusetts,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.680
so it was a short drive
down, and a pleasure

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.350
to be here with you.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.442
I'm going to read a
little bit from this book,

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:08.150
"Why I'm an Atheist
Who Believes in God."

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.919
The first thing I'll
do is just mention

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.550
the subtitle is "How to Give
Love, Create Beauty, and Find

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.520
Peace."

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.330
So let me tell you a
little bit about why

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.430
I wrote this book as
opposed to some other book,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.120
or another novel, or
whatever it might be.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.610
I wrote a memoir seven
or eight years ago

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.680
called "Crazy for
God" that's tracked

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.500
my journey that was
referred to a little bit

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.396
in the introduction.

00:02:33.396 --> 00:02:35.020
I'd written a number
of novels, and I'd

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.280
been in Hollywood, where
I'd made four feature films

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.470
after I left the
evangelical world.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.770
And I had done everything except
address my personal journey

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.480
away from the religious right,
why I left that environment.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.145
I'd been my dad's sidekick
for a while, flown around

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:51.700
in Jerry Falwell's jet
when the moral majority was

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.360
getting going.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.510
We had been frequenters
of the White House

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.110
when Reagan was there, and
Ford, Bush one, and so forth.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.840
So we had been, as a family,
very much invested in that.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.700
And kind of like Hollywood,
the evangelical world

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.360
has a lot of nepotism in it.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.980
And so it seemed
natural at the time--

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.770
although now looking back it
seems very curious to me--

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.950
that I was groomed to be
my father's successor.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.100
I mean, how does that work?

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.120
Only the British royal family
and the mob works that way.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.960
But evangelicalism
also has that.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.480
Where the God business
becomes a family business.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.120
And so when I was
17, 18 years old,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.630
I began working with
my dad on producing

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.650
a couple of documentary
films, which then went out

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.062
into the evangelical world.

00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:39.770
One was called "How
Should We Then Live?"

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.000
And another, "Whatever Happened
to the Human Race?" that we

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.430
made with Doctor C. Everett
Koop, who then became Ronald

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.170
Reagan's Surgeon General.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.480
And by the time those film
series had been presented

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.410
in nationwide seminar
tours, playing auditoriums

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.960
like the Grand Ole Opry
or Madison Square Garden,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.420
and large venues like this
where we were packing 10, 12, 15

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.420
thousand people
in a night, my dad

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.000
became a household name
not in the larger world,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.090
but in the evangelical ghetto.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.960
And I, as his young
sidekick-- and this

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.870
is a long time ago in the
late '70s and early '80s--

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.550
became this kind of
a person who is going

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.970
to, put in the
evangelical terms,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.920
receive the mantle of his
anointed prophetic ministry,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.210
or however they
would have put it.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.219
One day in the mid 1980s,
after he died in 1984,

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:30.760
through a series of things that
I write about in this memoir,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.400
"Crazy for God," I
came to the conclusion

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.210
that I had really taken a
very drastically wrong step

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.950
with my life.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.690
For one thing, I was turning
into a complete asshole

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.530
at home.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.130
I was hating every
moment on the road.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.430
I had two little young
children at the time,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.930
and realized that I'd been
away six months of the year,

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.780
doing God's work.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.280
Talking all over the place.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.380
And also had a real series
of spiritual crisises

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.210
where I just simply
did not believe

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.010
what we were saying anymore.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.870
And so I really faced a
dilemma, because I didn't have

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.160
any other way to earn a living.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.989
I had run away from a
British private school,

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:12.280
where I was in boarding school.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.000
I'd gone home and become
part of my dad's ministry.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.050
I painted, and I was
showing some paintings,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.210
and pretty precocious
in that field.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.220
But nevertheless,
this is what I did.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.740
And the money was good.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.590
There is a lot of money
in the God business,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.030
in case you're
not aware of that.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.400
And so I didn't know
what would happen here.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.800
But in this personal crisis
that I write about in "Crazy

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.230
for God," I came
to the conclusion

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.090
that it was really this way,
the path out, or sanity.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.350
I couldn't do both things.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.810
And I couldn't do a
marriage and fatherhood,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.540
and live a life of complete
hypocrisy of gradually drifting

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.620
away from the core beliefs we
were selling both politically,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.280
and also religiously.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.670
And so I got out as far as you
can get away from the enclave

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.860
that I was part of.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.360
This nepotistic inheritance of
the Schaeffer little empire,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.220
which it was at that time.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.940
And all the access
to power that we had.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.090
Dad and mom staying
in the White House

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.340
frequently, mother going
as Betty Ford's guest

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.290
to swim in the White
House pool any time

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.810
she was in Washington,
yada, yada, yada.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.250
And so I went to Hollywood, and
we were living in Massachusetts

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.310
already at that time.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.640
And I rented a little
studio apartment,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.080
and used the footage
that I had cut out

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.230
of these religious documentaries
I'd made to make a show reel.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.780
And went off and
got myself an agent,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.080
and wound up directing
four low budget Hollywood

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.450
movies that if you
stay up very late

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.600
and go to shitty cable
stations, you'll see.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.570
They're not very good.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.800
But it was work, and it
got me over the hump.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.700
And then I happened to write
a novel called "Portofino,"

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.979
which, very fortunately for me,
got some really great reviews.

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.520
And got published
all over the world,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.760
and gave me permission to
continue to be a writer.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.420
And I'd finally found something
that I was actually quite good

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.400
at, as opposed to these second
rate movies I was making.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.250
As opposed to this weird
world I had just walked away

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.350
from in terms of the
evangelical ministry.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.570
And 15 books later or
so, I'm still writing.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.120
And after this memoir came
out, which I got around

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.980
to writing when I
was in my mid 50s,

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.160
not having wanted to
address the issue of why

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.640
I left the evangelical world
and my family's history before.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.630
Because there are a lot of
people who revere the Schaeffer

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.240
name out there in kind of a
guru presence kind of way.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.310
I don't mean my Schaeffer
name, but my father's.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.240
And I hadn't wanted
to just put up

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.950
with the bullshit that would
be coming over the transom,

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.250
especially in the post internet
age of email and messaging

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.480
and all the rest of it.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.439
And so I kind of, OK,
I'll write another novel,

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:53.480
and I'll write on this
subject, and that subject.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.230
And when my son went
into the Marine Corps

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.220
and fought in
Afghanistan, I wrote

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.030
a book called "Keeping Faith,
A Father-Son Story About Love

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.520
in the United States
Marine Corps."

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.819
I had never served,
it wasn't political.

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:06.110
And that got me on "Oprah,"
and it became a bestseller,

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.340
and so forth and so on.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.180
But I kept pushing
back this question,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.800
even though I got a lot of
email from people saying,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.750
when are you going
to tell your story?

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.620
What I did tell it, the book
came out and did quite well.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.000
Terry Gross did an hour
program on Fresh Air

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.062
on it, and so forth, and so on.

00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:25.520
But one of the
things that happens,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.490
I struck up an
email correspondence

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.414
with Christopher Hitchens,
who was a leading new atheist

00:08:30.414 --> 00:08:31.830
author, you may
have heard of him,

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.840
along with Dawkins and
others who write these very

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.409
anti-religious books.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.460
And Christopher
Hitchens liked the book,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.026
and he started writing to me
while he was reading it saying,

00:08:41.026 --> 00:08:42.400
you're good writer,
and so forth.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.720
And it was very nice,
because I respected him

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.330
and his writing and debating
skills, and so forth.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.020
But when he got to
the end of the book,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.060
he actually called me one time.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.290
And he said, you know,
I'm really disappointed.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.120
Because you left the
evangelical world,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.660
and as I was
reading this book, I

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.110
thought you were going
to come over to our side.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.890
He saw things very much
in black and white terms.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.700
And instead, I get there,
and you end the book,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.490
and you're indecisive, and
it sounds as if you're still

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.870
a spiritual person.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.450
Why didn't you leave all
this nonsense behind?

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.080
Why do you still
have this interest

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.057
in spirituality, albeit not
of the evangelical variety?

00:09:22.057 --> 00:09:24.390
Interestingly enough, I was
getting quite a bit of email

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.330
from evangelicals who
didn't like the book,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.060
and I was getting
quite a bit of email

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.740
from people who were following
Chris Hitchens, although I

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.320
was talking to him
himself in this case.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.250
And what I noticed
was on the subject

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.659
lines in the first
lines of these emails--

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:41.200
aside from the ones
that just told me

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.420
what I could go do with
myself, but I'm talking

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.990
about the ones I read on pass
the expletives-- if you changed

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.770
a word or two, they
were the same email.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.380
They were from people
who were, in my mind,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.200
increasingly as I
tried to identify what

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.630
the hell's going on here, what I
came to call certainty addicts.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.470
They want everything
nailed down.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.910
And I was starting
to think about what

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.890
became the subject of
"Why I'm an Atheist Who

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:06.710
Believes in God."

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.089
Which was that as I'm
getting older, anyway,

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:10.630
and have raised
three grown children,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.770
and have five
grandchildren, three of whom

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.300
live across the street from me
up in Salisbury Massachusetts

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:22.340
that I do daycare every day for
as a stay at home grandfather.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.880
The more I have lived
and experienced things,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.330
the more I've understood
that paradox is essentially

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.770
the fulcrum upon which all
human life and experience turns.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.170
If you don't embrace paradox,
you are royally fucked,

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:35.690
basically.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.460
Because everything is going
to slam you in the face,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.640
taking away whatever that last
certainty was that you had,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.110
until you suddenly
discover that you're not

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.500
so sure about what you
thought you were sure about.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.060
And having been on
a bit of a journey

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.860
spiritually, and professionally,
and emotionally-- not

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.130
to mention fatherhood,
when I got Genie pregnant

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:59.096
when we were 17 and 18,
and then had these kids,

00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:01.470
so that my oldest granddaughter
is the age of my friends'

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.830
children who waited longer,
and so forth and so on.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.480
But all this experience
added up to what

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.220
I write about in this book.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.560
So I want to share
a little bit of it,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.110
just some passages
not chosen randomly,

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.902
but kind of build a
picture of what's here.

00:11:15.902 --> 00:11:17.818
And I'll just start with
one at the beginning,

00:11:17.818 --> 00:11:19.760
though the book has more
stories in it than it

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.340
does this nonfiction narrative.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.980
But let me just
sum up a little bit

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.690
of what I was just saying
as I write it in the book.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.490
And this is in a
way my answer to

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.030
both my fundamentalist
friends on the right

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.820
in the evangelical world, and
my fundamentalist friends--

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.640
and I don't mean that
facetiously, people

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.100
who are my friends on
the left, and the Chris

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.165
Hitchens of this world,
though sadly, he's gone.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.730
And I guess you could call
this book and extended answer

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.780
to many, many emails.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.810
My kaleidoscopic
beliefs are fickle,

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.110
and motivated by desire,
wishful thinking,

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.380
and wanting to fit with
my family and community

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.380
and make my marriage work.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.390
My dogmatic
declarations of faith

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.250
once provided statuss-- ego
stroking power over others,

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.050
and a much better
income than I've ever

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.730
earned since fleeing
the evangelical machine.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.460
Certainty made things
simple, gave me an answer

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.230
to every question,
and paid the bills.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.190
With the acceptance
of paradox came

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.810
a new and blessed
uncertainty that

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.960
begin to heal the mental
illness called certainty.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.400
The kind of certainty
they told me

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.300
that my job was to
be head of a home,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.440
and to order around
my wife and children

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.460
because the Bible says so.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.490
Embracing paradox
helped me discover

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.050
that religion is a neurological
disorder for which faith

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.220
is the only cure.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.370
These days, I hold to ideas
about God simultaneously.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.760
He, she, or it exists, and
he, she, or it doesn't exist.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.610
I don't seesaw between these
opposites, I embrace them.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.550
I don't view this
embrace as requiring

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.805
a choice between mere
emotion and fact,

00:12:56.805 --> 00:12:59.980
or between evolutionary
biology and spirituality.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.110
Reality can't be
so neatly parsed.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.310
Neuroscientists who analyze
our chemistry-based brains

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.840
still fall in love.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.850
Preachers claiming
a literal view

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.980
of the Bible and
so-called young earth

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.000
still use petroleum
products only found

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.510
because geologists operate
on the premise of the earth

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.960
is 4.54 billion years old.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.060
I don't view my
embrace of opposites

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.020
as a kind of
agnosticism, I view it

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.290
is the way things actually are.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.530
An agnostic neither believe,
nor disbelieves in God.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.740
I'm not that person.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.390
I believe and don't
believe at the same time.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.840
So that sets up something here.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.390
Now I want to go to a little
passage which really tells

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.110
the same story of
growth and uncertainty,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.030
but in a different context.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.750
In a sense of growing away from
the certainties about career

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.600
path, and the picture I had
of what success is all about,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.490
and how I would more
measure that today.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.390
Picking up Lucy and Jack from
kindergarten and preschool--

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.470
Lucy's now seven
and Jack is five,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.610
but this was written when they
were a little younger-- has

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.060
evolved into a happy ritual.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.450
I prepare snacks for them
to eat on the way home.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.490
Usually sliced apples or
cheese and crackers for Jack,

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.160
and a banana or black olives
and sliced tomatoes for Lucy.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.610
The 20 minute drive home
often includes a stop

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.790
to watch the 109 New [INAUDIBLE]
to Boston train hurdle

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.550
under the bridge on Route 1A.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.290
Jack loves trains.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.290
When we wave, the driver sounds
his bell and blows his horn,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.240
and Jack shouts, hi, Joe.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.250
He knows the driver's name
from his many visits with Genie

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.090
to the New [INAUDIBLE]
Station to watch the trains.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.460
One day, just after
returning from preschool,

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.920
the grandchildren were
in the kitchen painting

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.970
on butcher paper when a friend
phoned, I'll call him Sam.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.390
Sam is a successful movie
producer in Hollywood

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.070
whom I worked with when I was
directing movies in the 1980s.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.740
Although I quit the movie
business in the early 1990s

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.330
after I wrote "Portofino"
and it was published,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.690
thus offering me a passport to
a little artistic satisfaction

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.190
and vindication, Sam and
I are still close friends.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.470
We bickered over our
philosophical differences

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.440
and exchanged insults for years.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.390
Sam asked me what I was doing.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.950
I'd just picked
up the grandkids.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.590
I said without
thinking, I added,

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.250
I love hanging out with
the other young mothers

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.800
at preschool.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.590
Sam paused as he
processed my words.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.397
The other young mothers?

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:31.230
He said and laughed.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.910
The other young mothers?

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.290
I laughed too, though my
remark made sense to me.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.380
When I pick up Jack and
Lucy, I'm one of the few men,

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.620
and the only grandfather
at the preschool.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.920
Because Lucy's kindergarten
ends half an hour

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.750
after Jack's
preschool, Jack and I

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.600
have time to play
in the hall, or

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.250
outside in the schoolyard
while moms and a few dads

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.750
come and go.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.480
At first, the mothers
couldn't figure me out.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.280
Why was this old
guy hanging around?

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.610
Why was he unshaved
with unkempt hair,

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.710
and torn jeans, and paint
all over his clothes?

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.920
Should someone call the police?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.790
After seeing me every day
for a year, the moms knew me.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.830
Some know that I'm a
writer and an artist,

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.930
so the paint spattered
look is accepted.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.550
One mom checked me out
online, and discovered

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.040
I'd been interviewed by
Oprah and Terry Gross

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.860
on NPR's "Fresh Air."

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.790
Even a minor celebrity is
accorded some eccentric artist

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.290
slack, at least in the
arts-friendly Boston area.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.300
I could show up in my
bathrobe and slippers,

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.260
and no one would mind.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.680
I'm just one of the gang,
albeit somewhat of a character.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.110
The mothers and I
discuss one child's cold,

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.300
and how fast the rest of
us are likely to catch it.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.940
We commiserate about the
latest pinkeye blight.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.570
We talk about one child
who wakes up in the night,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.010
and celebrate the quantum
leap another little girl

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.350
made with her drawing
skills after discovering

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.070
chalk pastels.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.780
We note who is pregnant with
her second or third child,

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.330
and share strategies for helping
a little boy who was scared

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.360
of pooping because
he's sure something

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.120
is down there in the toilet.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.000
We congratulate one mom
for finally getting a job

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.690
with health care
insurance benefits,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.710
and commiserate with another
about the challenging child

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.550
care schedule of a night nurse.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.839
Some of the mothers are
stay at home parents,

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.680
while others hurry away
from the office at lunchtime

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.530
to meet their child, deliver
her to the babysitter,

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.079
and race back to work.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.030
Some have told me about problems
with teenage step children,

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.520
previous marriages,
divorces, and their struggles

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.180
to fit into New England
after moving from friendlier

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.990
parts of the country.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.390
Some moms arrive in old cars,
while others drive new SUVs.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.600
No matter what we drive
or earn, or if we're

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.800
married, black, brown, white,
single, gay, heterosexual

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.180
or divorced, when we
get down on our knees

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.220
at eye level with our babies
as they run into our arms,

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.610
we understand each
other perfectly.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.700
The child we're meeting
touches the core of our being.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.440
Every mom delights in the
pint-sized human shouting,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.256
hi, mommy.

00:17:55.256 --> 00:18:00.360
The shouted greeting that
makes my heart skip is hi, Ba.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.770
I'm called Ba.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.840
Our shared experience
of vulnerability

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.980
erases the age and
gender differences

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.220
between the young
mothers and me.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.730
We share a fearful solidarity,
call it the flip side of love.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.470
If anything awful were happened
to the child clambering

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:22.140
into our arms, the universe
as we know it would end.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.320
And so, with a passage
like that, what I try to do

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.990
is something that
I see too little

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.800
of in a lot of writing about
philosophy and religion, which

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.090
all is part of the
certainty addiction.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.630
it does not embrace the paradox.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.580
And that is, it puts it in these
didactic intellectual terms

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.530
that is not where anybody lives.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.280
And what we all care about is
our version of Lucy and Jack,

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.250
whether we're married or
single, gay, straight,

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.960
whatever it may be.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.440
We have in our lives a
completely different dynamic

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.300
than the official belief system
that we say we subscribe to.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.320
And it has to do with
the people we love,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.172
and what we actually care
about, and what makes us tick.

00:18:56.172 --> 00:18:57.880
And so what I've tried
to do in this book

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.730
is be as honest as
I can about that,

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:05.360
and not keep trying to act as
if I have some omniscient view

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.280
to share with people that
will lead them to my truth

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.060
as if somehow that's
an exclusive truth.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.940
And to get away from
that, I do two things.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.790
I write in this way as a
novelist, as a storyteller,

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.710
but I also then come
back and describe

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.190
what I believe or don't
believe the way the earlier

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:28.370
passage landed that I
read at the beginning.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.610
So I want to conclude just
by going to something here

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.580
at the back of the
book when I talk

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.037
about the publication
of this book.

00:19:38.037 --> 00:19:39.870
Which, by the way, is
one of the first books

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.799
that I actually at
first self published,

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:44.340
and then it was picked up by a
small publisher, which I think

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.250
is the edition you've got here.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.820
But in the beginning,
I did this because it

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:53.160
was a book that didn't fit in
with the new atheist movement,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.220
or the religion movement,
which I think I talked

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.560
about in this passage here.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.190
Spirituality is
overtaking commerce,

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.430
while commerce looks
more and more like art.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.370
The kind of art the Medici
or Irving Penn Homer or Miles

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.580
Davis would have understood.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.450
In which artists and observer
comprehend one another,

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.590
even respect each other,
and speak a common language.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.110
More young people, and
a few old ones like me,

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.280
binge-stream
made-for-TV programs

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.470
like Netflix's
traditionally crafted,

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.390
Shakespearean-inspired
"House of Cards"

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.690
or the brilliant Australian
show, one of my favorites,

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.950
"Rake," than will visit
Tate Modern or the Whitney

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.020
in a year.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.640
Maybe the future
no longer belongs

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.730
to the anti-meaning ideologues.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.210
Shakespeare is produced
tens of thousands of times

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.250
more than the absurdist plays.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.680
Miles Davis lasted,
John Cage didn't.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.910
Duchamp's original
urinal got lost,

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.570
and had to be replaced by one
crafted by a ceramic artist.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.420
The museum wanted to
keep their investment

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.360
in a piece of art that was
meant to mock the art market.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.010
The found object became
the made investment.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.310
Damien Hirst's reputation is
rotting, along with his sharks.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.680
Daniel Dennett has a following,
but even his followers behave

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.240
as if their lives have a
deeper meaning than plant

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.400
life, no matter what he
says to the countrary.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.590
And modern delivery systems
are bypassing the critics

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.560
and gatekeepers.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.440
Who needs another rotting shark
in a tank of formaldehyde,

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.630
or a hank of cloth hung
from the Whitney ceiling

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.450
as a statement of
something or other,

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.040
when you come watch "QI," the
wonderful British comedy quiz

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.360
show, on YouTube, for free?

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.670
It's hosted by Stephen
Fry, a greatly talent

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.510
a defender of good
writing and music.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.990
Who would have guessed his
musical hero is Wagner?

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.360
A new generation is
embracing human connection

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.310
rather than debunking it.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.420
The liberating results are real.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.340
The geeks, bless
them, are killing off

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.020
the jaded, cold
hearted gatekeepers.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.110
When I was a young
artist in the 1970s,

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:57.670
I had to travel to gallery
after gallery with slides

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.620
in sweaty hand and beg for
a meeting with the owner

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.500
if I wanted to sell a painting.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.760
If the owner loved my
work, I'd be invited back

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.400
a year or two
later, and he or she

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.810
would put a few
paintings in a show.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.580
I wandered off into the movie
business and quit painting.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:18.770
When I resumed painting in
2006, I worked for eight years

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.100
until I liked my work
enough to show it.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.340
I started a website in 2014,
and now sell art directly

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.420
to collectors.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.620
There are no
gatekeepers in sight.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.610
It's just me directly in touch
with people who like my work.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:32.920
The same goes for my writing.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.510
I self-published this book.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.110
Given the bestselling status
of some of my previous books,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.800
several of my former
publishers and

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.190
several religious
publishers were

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.030
interested in publishing it.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.350
However, they wanted
me to craft this book

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.490
to fit their
marketing strategies.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.890
Does it go on the new atheist,
or the religion shelf?

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.830
They asked.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.620
Can you rewrite it to fit
one market or the other

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.350
so we can sell it?

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.070
My answer was no.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.360
Yet you are reading
the book I wrote.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.620
I don't view you as
a market segment.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.790
I view you as my partner,
an individual reader,

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:08.570
a friend as complex and maybe
even as conflicted as I am.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.060
Why should either
of us fit anywhere?

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.330
My liberators in
Silicon Valley have

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.770
freed me to write
for you directly,

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:21.390
and to say what I want to say
to anyone I want to say it to.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.810
The internet and its
innovators are doing more

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:28.760
to facilitate the reemergence
of content-laden, craft-rich,

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.830
hands-on art,
individuality, and perhaps

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:36.400
even spirituality, than all
the galleries, agents, critics,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.680
churches, and
publishers combined.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.540
So I'll end my reading
there, and you've

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.890
heard a little bit of my talk.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.919
And I'd like to do
a Q&amp;A, because I

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:49.710
find it's much more
interesting to find out

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.850
what you're interested in
than just rant on up here

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.890
about what I do.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.579
So if you have questions, by
the way, I can repeat them.

00:23:56.579 --> 00:23:58.620
So if you don't feel like
staggering up to a mic,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.286
just shout them out,
and they don't have

00:24:00.286 --> 00:24:01.730
to be about anything I said.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.606
They can be about
writing, or what

00:24:03.606 --> 00:24:05.480
it was like making crappy
movies in Hollywood

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.360
in the '80s, or anything
else you want to talk about.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.010
But if you have a
question, please let me

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.290
know and I'll try to answer it.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:14.800
AUDIENCE: Hi

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.805
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Hi.

00:24:15.805 --> 00:24:16.680
AUDIENCE: Great talk.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:16.980
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Thank you.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.540
What's your name?

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.470
AUDIENCE: My name is Jordan.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.170
FRANK SCHAEFFER:
Nice to meet you.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.840
Thanks for coming today.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.430
AUDIENCE: How do you
write your books?

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.121
FRANK SCHAEFFER:
How in what sense?

00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:28.120
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
process that you follow?

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.245
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Yes, I do.

00:24:29.245 --> 00:24:33.100
Actually, I'm disciplined not
by choice, but just by insomnia.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.560
So I've done on a weird
schedule that has nothing

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.770
to do with our time zone.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.280
I wake up at about 3
o'clock in the morning.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.560
I find that if I write from
about 3:00 until 7:00 or 8:00,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.120
it's my best work.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.210
Mainly because I know I won't
be disturbed, as in nothing else

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:51.790
is happening.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.320
So other than a couple fishing
boats that I see go by at 4:00

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.092
in the morning, or
5:00 in the morning,

00:24:58.092 --> 00:25:00.550
just psychologically knowing
the phone isn't going to ring,

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.810
or can't ring, or won't, or
that if I've turned it off,

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.930
I'm not missing a call from
something I want to do,

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.721
because no one else is
up, is very helpful.

00:25:06.721 --> 00:25:11.260
So I write early, I write
every day, seven days a week.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.060
I'm superstitious,
I don't miss a day.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.620
I wrote this morning.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.590
I was up at 3:00,
and then my son

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.000
came up and helped me install a
new window that's been leaking,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.842
and we finally got that put in.

00:25:21.842 --> 00:25:24.050
I've been working on this
building project for a week

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.400
or so now, and then I came
down here to give the talk.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.149
But the writing had to happen.

00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:29.940
Even though I'm saying
this makes no sense,

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.440
it's going to make
a crazy long day,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.344
I couldn't sleep if I wanted to,
because I'm on that clock now.

00:25:34.344 --> 00:25:35.260
So that's how I do it.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.630
It's just chunk, chunk, chunk.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.530
Some days, it's shit,
some days it works.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.680
But I got to get
something down, otherwise

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.717
it's like the day didn't happen.

00:25:42.717 --> 00:25:44.050
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a follow-up?

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:44.880
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Sure, yeah.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.421
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:45.421 --> 00:25:48.460
You mentioned that it seemed
like what you've found

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.870
is that when you're reading
pieces that people write,

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.310
sometimes they take this
approach where they're not

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.540
writing about themselves,
they're writing about,

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.310
and this is what God
is in my viewpoint,

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.750
and they don't really relate
it through their experiences.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.920
How do you make yourself
part of the story?

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.150
How do you make it personal,
or is that just how you write?

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.480
FRANK SCHAEFFER: No, I don't
look to make it personal,

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.920
it's just the way I write.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.340
So really, I only write
two kinds of books.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.292
I write fiction, and
the fiction is usually

00:26:16.292 --> 00:26:18.000
based on something
that's happened to me.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.300
So it's thinly veiled.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.800
Like I had one sister who didn't
speak to me for five years,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.220
because she was saying
they'll think it's us.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.160
And then but it's
different, and I said,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.000
well, it's different
because it's a novel.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.810
And she's saying, yeah,
but they'll still be like,

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.310
they'll think it's
us, and so forth.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.010
So that's the quandary
of all writers.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:36.030
But I happen to process
my life into my writing

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.720
pretty directly,
even in the fiction.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.200
I have a novel out
called "And God

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.829
Said Billy, about
a guy who comes out

00:26:41.829 --> 00:26:43.120
of a fundamentalist background.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.536
He's trying to make crappy
movies, he goes to South Africa

00:26:45.536 --> 00:26:46.460
where I was.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.740
He happens to make a movie
in Namibia, which I did.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.172
So there's a lot of cheating,
because I'm using my stuff.

00:26:52.172 --> 00:26:54.630
But on the other hand, I think
even science fiction writers

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.930
do.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.270
Say they're writing
a relationship,

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.770
they still have
wives, and husbands,

00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.510
and girlfriends, and
lovers, and they're

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.012
putting it all in there.

00:27:01.012 --> 00:27:03.220
So if you know a writer,
you're going to see yourself

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.120
in his or her book.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.900
You probably don't
want to tell them much.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.340
But when it comes
to my nonfiction,

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.650
I just find that I have
limited myself to try--

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:18.130
and I know this
sounds pretentious,

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.140
but I actually try to be honest.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.760
And so if I don't
know, I say it.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.970
I don't footnote the
nonfiction unless it's just

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.120
a historical reference
or something in something

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.220
like my memoirs so
people can follow up.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.650
And basically, If I'm
going to write about it,

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.540
I try to actually have
it a conversation,

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.762
and not be protective in that.

00:27:37.762 --> 00:27:39.220
So there's a certain
vulnerability,

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.620
and I think that actually
communicates with people.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.140
Because if you're writing about
things from a point of view

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.120
of, like, here it is,
and I've made up my mind,

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.494
there's nothing
much left to say.

00:27:47.494 --> 00:27:50.690
So I picture my reading
answering me somehow

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.020
and having a talk with me.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.950
And I'm writing to
someone who I hope

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.410
when they read my
work understands

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.610
they have a right to argue.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.194
And I hope they do.

00:28:01.194 --> 00:28:02.610
I don't know if
that answers that.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.873
Yeah?

00:28:03.873 --> 00:28:05.140
AUDIENCE: Speaking of arguing.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.700
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Yes, go ahead.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.360
Just don't throw anything.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.660
AUDIENCE: So it seems to
me like saying I accept

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.550
paradox is a bit of a cop out.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.430
In the sense that
you can understand

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:25.120
there are cases where there
are apparent paradoxes, where

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.710
things look to be in conflict.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.050
But if you look sideways,
you look at it the right way,

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.440
they're actually
not in conflict.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.000
And you can resolve
paradoxes that way.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.380
But to not actually
try to resolve it,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.260
and just to say
these x and not x

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.140
seem to be both-- I just
am comfortable with them

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.590
both true at the same time.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.804
I would almost feel
better about saying,

00:28:46.804 --> 00:28:48.220
well, I'm not
comfortable with it,

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.011
but I don't know the
answer yet, as opposed

00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:54.690
to just saying the answer
is that they're both true.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.020
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Well,
that might be a better way

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:57.640
to put it.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.620
I think if you read the book,
maybe I explain myself better

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.390
in the text.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.210
You would find that
what I'm trying to say,

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.090
really, is-- I guess
the way to put this,

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.930
and I don't want
be a downer here,

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.570
but it's to
acknowledge mortality,

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:10.790
and the shortness of
time we have to make up

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.100
our mind about anything.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.900
And so for instance,
just take the fact

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.500
that I got Genie pregnant
when we're 17 and 18.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.960
Now we've been
together 45 years,

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.730
we have these kids
we're caring for.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.800
And I love her, and
we have great times,

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.970
and all the rest of it.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.530
I have no clue who those
people were back then.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.160
So it wasn't a question of
good decisions, or planning.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.800
It was just, when I said
I'll pull out, I lied.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.510
And we got pregnant in an age
when, when you got pregnant,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:36.177
you got married.

00:29:36.177 --> 00:29:37.926
Especially if you're
an evangelical thing.

00:29:37.926 --> 00:29:39.750
I mean, it was the
worst possible scenario.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.710
So now you ask me, OK,
you've been married 45 years,

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:44.340
you must know something
about marriage.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.210
No, I don't.

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:51.066
Anymore than I know about
how to define the word love.

00:29:51.066 --> 00:29:52.440
If you ask me what
love means, it

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.420
means that I bring Genie
a cup of coffee in bed

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.160
once in a while.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.980
It means some days
that I hate her

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.230
less than I would otherwise when
we've had another huge fight.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:06.450
And so one of us slams
out, tires squeal,

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.310
and somebody comes back,
and you hate each other.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.810
And love that day,
passionate in love for years,

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.230
means we hate each
other a little less.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.730
That's it.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.289
So when I'm saying
about embracing paradox,

00:30:19.289 --> 00:30:21.330
I think really-- and you
make a good point-- what

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.100
I'm trying to say
is, the limitation

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.580
of our words to
describe actual meaning

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:32.520
is so vast that to say
with certainty things that

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.200
exclude other people when
it comes to religion,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.730
and philosophy, and belief,
and so forth, and so on--

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.100
it's not that there's no truth.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.850
I'm not talking about being
relativist in that sense--

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.140
but I'm saying that our
descriptions are very limited.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.870
So I'll just give you one
other example of what I mean.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.870
You know there's this
debate about whether Pluto

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.500
is a planet, or
whatever else it is.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.020
But of course, Pluto doesn't
know it's being renamed.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.920
So I think our human hubris
of thinking that because we've

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.990
named something, we own it.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.460
Mathematicians work
in precise numbers.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.830
But without mathematicians,
there would be no numbers.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.180
They don't exist independently
of our description.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.930
So really I just approach
truth the way a writer does.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.810
And that is, I look
at it as a story.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:19.730
All I have is my story,
I don't have truth.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.779
And there's a lot of
ways to tell my story.

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.570
And I'm not going to
bash you over the head

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.110
and say I've nailed it.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.950
So that's a circuitous way to
say, I hear what you're saying,

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.514
and I agree when it comes
to the logic of something.

00:31:31.514 --> 00:31:33.430
But in terms of where
we human beings actually

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.300
exist when it comes to
saying what love is,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.360
or who God is or isn't,
and all the rest of it,

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.050
we are feeling our way
along on a journey,

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.185
and we're not going to
get to the destination.

00:31:43.185 --> 00:31:45.310
And I think that's the
difference between embracing

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.250
paradox and still enjoying the
beauty and the intrinsic worth

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.320
and the glory of life
experience of, say,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.836
in a child, or a lover, or
sex, or whatever it may be.

00:31:54.836 --> 00:31:56.460
That's where we
actually do our living.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.140
So I'm just trying to
say, OK, pay no attention

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.570
to the man behind the curtain.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.180
I've lived my life
amongst wizards.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.860
Political wizards,
religious wizards,

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.420
and others who had their
systems and their truths.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.260
All the ones I got to know
personally, me included,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.830
turned out to have feet of clay.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.250
And their descriptions
we're limited by the fact

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.490
that words are simply metaphor.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.675
That ideas about truth
change, ideas about beauty

00:32:19.675 --> 00:32:20.710
and aesthetics change.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:21.560
That's all I'm trying to say.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:23.110
FRANK SCHAEFFER:
Yeah, you're welcome.

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:24.680
Thanks for a good question.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.180
Yeah?

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.096
AUDIENCE: So I think
Jonathan said that you're

00:32:27.096 --> 00:32:28.120
a Greek Orthodox now?

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.440
FRANK SCHAEFFER: I go to
a Greek Orthodox church.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.940
In fact, I can read you a little
something when we finish up

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.310
here about that experience.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.977
AUDIENCE: So I just
want to, you know,

00:32:35.977 --> 00:32:37.560
why you go to a Greek
Orthodox church?

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.100
What'd you get from it,
what does it do for you?

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.740
FRANK SCHAEFFER:
Well, you know, I'm

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.340
going to have to
get personal again.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.250
Because the thing
is, for me, someone

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.870
who would expect a
theological answer,

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.400
I could have done
that 40 years ago

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.650
when I thought in those terms.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.690
Today, I'll tell you the truth.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.750
I was raised by a mother
who took me to church.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.060
So I feel comfortable going
to some sort of community

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.330
based on religion.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.400
That doesn't sound like a very
good philosophical answer.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.860
But on the other
hand, and I'm not

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.870
saying this to you personally,
but I could put it this way.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.280
Hey, mom raised me that way.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.802
You got a problem with that?

00:33:09.802 --> 00:33:11.760
Do you have a better
reason for doing anything?

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.720
It's like falling in love.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.600
Why did I meet Genie?

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.270
Because I went downstairs
for dinner one night,

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.800
and she came to
this crazy community

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.960
my parents were running
called L'Abri Fellowship,

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.880
and she was a stunning hippie
princess from San Francisco.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.660
She hadn't listened
to "Abbey Road,"

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.330
and I had it in
my basement room.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.790
And we went down there,
and 45 years later, she's

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.580
still wondering what happened.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.860
So that's how.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.470
So I go to the Greek
Orthodox church

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.540
because I feel comfortable in a
religious setting of some-- OK.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.850
Aesthetically, I love the
liturgy for the same reason

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.940
I like Shakespeare and
unfooled-around-with

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.010
productions.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.284
So I don't want long sermons,
and people telling me

00:33:44.284 --> 00:33:44.950
what they think.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.450
I like that half
of it's in Greek,

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.030
and I don't understand it.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.800
That fits with my idea about
not understanding anything.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.180
And I happen to also
love, in the context

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.570
of my grandchildren, being
able to go to a place

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:58.070
where little old ladies swoop
them up, where they're growing

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.310
up in a community where
people know and love them,

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.380
tracking with them.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.250
Because there's not enough
of that in anybody's life.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.560
We live in these
compartments where

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.018
you're in school when you're
a kid, or you're a young adult

00:34:07.018 --> 00:34:10.460
and you're doing your
career, or whatever it is.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.560
I love it when one of
Lucy's dearest friends

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.909
is literally an
88-year-old lady who

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:20.290
lets her help decorate the
front of the church with her.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.520
That's priceless.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.860
And so partly community.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.560
And then you come to
the mystical desire

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.699
to touch something
bigger than ourselves.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.219
And that hasn't
gone away with me.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.030
So I'm still on a search
for what that might be.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.679
And I find the
solitude and the beauty

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.190
of the liturgical worship
service, which is anything

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.840
but original, but very ancient.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.830
A fourth century liturgy of St.
John Chrysostom, originally.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.239
For me personally,
with my taste that

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:50.190
has nothing to do with what
I'm telling anybody else do,

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:55.040
I find a quiet, contemplative
space within that structure.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.970
It's all personal, it's
nothing to do with telling

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.684
anybody else what to do.

00:34:59.684 --> 00:35:01.100
AUDIENCE: I guess
just to comment,

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.880
it seems to me like the
crucial thing is not

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.770
that you go to a
Greek Orthodox church,

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:07.710
but that you belong
to the community.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.660
FRANK SCHAEFFER: I do.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.610
And how else am I going to know
when [INAUDIBLE] isn't feeling

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.960
well, and how else will she
know that I just smashed

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.050
my finger with a hammer?

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:18.342
Get a close up of it right here.

00:35:18.342 --> 00:35:20.550
And that it's growing back
again, in all seriousness.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.542
And one of my best
friends in that church

00:35:22.542 --> 00:35:24.500
is a night nurse that
I'd never meet otherwise,

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.756
because she never makes any day
things because she's sleeping.

00:35:27.756 --> 00:35:29.130
But we would do
dishes every year

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.480
together at the food festival.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.730
And we've become best friends.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.180
Kathy and I are bosom buddies,
because we're sitting there

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.720
with greasy water
up to our elbows,

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.560
cleaning up after our
major fund-raising event.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.940
That's church.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.290
And you could name
it something else,

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.810
and it's totally available
to you if you're an atheist.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.650
It's not a religious thing.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.880
But I'm still
interested in religion.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.970
I still find meaning in
prayers, and rituals.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.570
And that is me.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.660
But it's not a system
of certain beliefs,

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.966
it is a system of
the way of being.

00:36:01.966 --> 00:36:03.590
Just like being a
father or grandfather

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.230
isn't about a theory
of fatherhood,

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.820
it's about, hey, when
you look at your child,

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.850
what do you see
written in their face?

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.100
Fear, or love?

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.690
That's the test, that's
the mirror, not the theory.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.415
Yep?

00:36:15.415 --> 00:36:18.040
AUDIENCE: So as you were saying,
you can certainly go to church

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.300
without believing in God.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.380
Those can be related, but
they don't have to be.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.501
But you were saying
you both believe in God

00:36:24.501 --> 00:36:26.250
and don't believe in
God at the same time.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.020
So aside from just saying I
believe or I don't believe,

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.570
how does that
affect what you do?

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.195
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Well, I'll tell
you exactly how it affects it.

00:36:33.195 --> 00:36:35.970
It affects it in that
I will, in my brain,

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.301
whatever this amalgam of
brain chemistry and neurons

00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:41.800
and everything else is here--
we don't even know what it is,

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.640
at least I don't-- when it comes
trying to give philosophical

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.630
answers that are certain,
I leave myself a way out.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.040
Like the gentleman
quite truthfully said,

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.870
my idea's kind of a cop out.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:54.876
It's a cop out.

00:36:54.876 --> 00:36:57.000
It's a way not to deal with
what I can't deal with.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.390
I'm ducking the issue.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.590
But in my daily life, when
I get up in the morning,

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.350
the staircase down
from my attic bedroom,

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.058
I make my sign of the
cross, because I've

00:37:05.058 --> 00:37:08.120
been in the Orthodox Church 30
years now, it feels natural.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.820
And I pray for my
family on the way down.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.180
I say, Lord, I
offer you this day.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.160
It's a ritual.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.010
And I say, Genie, Jessica,
Francise and John, Amanda, Ben,

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.552
Donnie, the Lucy,
Jack, Nora and Becky.

00:37:21.552 --> 00:37:23.426
And that's my family,
and my daughter in law,

00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:24.320
and all the rest.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.110
I have remembered them in the
context of a holy sacred thing.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.010
Now, whether that
answers any big question

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:35.430
about what's actually out there
is a whole different matter.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.550
So it's the same thing when
I see an ambulance go by.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.770
I make my sign of the cross.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.650
I don't do it because I think
some miraculous healing will

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.240
occur.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.950
It's because, God damn it,
a little human empathy never

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:47.680
killed anybody.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.460
And it's my way of
expressing that.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.320
It's in a religious context.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.860
I hope there's
something out there.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.740
I would like there to be.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.490
I would like there to be a
witness to all the things we

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:00.210
go through.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.510
And that is something
I still work through,

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.935
and I'm working on a new
book about creativity and art

00:38:04.935 --> 00:38:08.220
in children which really draws
on that spiritual reference

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.740
point so many
artists have found.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.590
But it's not trying to convince
anybody to believe anything.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.226
I'm saying, look,
I'm an atheist who

00:38:14.226 --> 00:38:15.975
believes in God in the
sense of describing

00:38:15.975 --> 00:38:18.786
two halves of the same person.

00:38:18.786 --> 00:38:20.660
And one of the reasons
I wrote this title was

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.160
to provoke a discussion
amongst certainty addicts who

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.400
say, yeah, but I'm sure
Jesus saved me from my sins

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.320
on one hand, or
on the other hand,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.130
I'm sure there is no God because
I read Chris Hitchens' latest

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.080
book, or Dawkins,
or here's the latest

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.980
research on brain chemistry.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.300
And I'm saying to myself, wow.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.430
At what point in human
history could you

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:46.050
go back and draw a line under
some cosmological statement,

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.400
and say, OK, that's
it, they nailed it?

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.500
If we could do
that, we would not

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.930
continue to not only
advance and evolve,

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:58.820
but it's a hubristic
misunderstanding of where we

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.760
are on the evolutionary chain.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.610
And where we are on
the evolutionary chain,

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:05.193
I mean-- it's funny to be saying
this in the middle of Google,

00:39:05.193 --> 00:39:08.560
that has such a sophisticated
footprint worldwide in terms

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.890
of not only technology,
but so many good things.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.990
The truth of the matter is
we're semi-evolved primates.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.720
And we are an eye
blink if you look

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.960
at the history of evolution.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.670
I mean, 10 seconds
ago, we were all

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.900
in the slime as
single-celled creatures.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.380
We're not at the
position where we

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.300
can stand up and start
making generalized statements

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.210
about anything.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:28.640
We can simply get
on with the day,

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.730
and try to treat people in a
way we'd want to be treated.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.990
If we could manage to do
that, we would already

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.680
be doing something.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.270
So all I'm saying is, hey,
let's have a little humility

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.930
and step back.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.960
And that is not borne of some
great philosophical insight,

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.060
it's just realizing what an
asshole I was as a young father

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.660
compared to being a fairly
decent grandfather who actually

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.080
is almost ready
for fatherhood now.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.410
I'm just about ready
to have my first child.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.370
And that's because
my grandchildren

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:56.520
have finished a
process of learning

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.170
that no book, no belief, no
religion, no making the cross,

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.844
no nothing could
have supplemented.

00:40:03.844 --> 00:40:04.760
That's all I'm saying.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.260
I'm just saying it's
a learning curve.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.760
AUDIENCE: So earlier
you were trying

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.090
to make a contrast between
I'm not an agnostic,

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.530
I'm an atheist who
believes in God.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.180
But I mean, everything you
just said, to me, sounds,

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.290
to me, like what an
agnostic would say.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:21.340
Saying, crossing yourself
certainly couldn't hurt,

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.830
and that all these, wouldn't
it be great for there to-- it

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.654
sounds, I'm having a
hard time seeing the--

00:40:26.654 --> 00:40:28.320
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Let
me put it this way.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.320
I won't go too much
further with this,

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.280
because I can't do better
than what I said in the book.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.810
Which is stated
better, because you

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.976
have time to think about it.

00:40:35.976 --> 00:40:37.310
I'm just off the cuff here.

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:40.320
But I live in a
world of agnosticism,

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.270
but I behave like a believer.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.700
That's the best I could put it.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.360
I try to follow Jesus in terms
of treating people the way

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.250
I want to be treated.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.380
It's why I don't slap
my grandchildren,

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.060
whether I lose patience or not.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.749
It's a philosophy of
life that says, look,

00:40:57.749 --> 00:40:59.040
you've got to choose some path.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.450
This is the path I choose.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.120
But it has nothing
to do with saying,

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.960
oh, here's the
theological implication,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.010
and I'm sure this is true
because so forth and so on.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.590
And so it's just admitting that
our beliefs and how we live

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:11.490
are separate things.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.035
But the most important thing
is who we are, not what we say.

00:41:14.035 --> 00:41:15.410
That's what I'm
trying to get to.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.550
AUDIENCE: OK, thank
you very much.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.180
FRANK SCHAEFFER:
You're very welcome.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.760
Thank you for your question.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.677
Yeah?

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.760
AUDIENCE: I just want to
know, do you see yourself

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:27.300
as trying to convince people
of your more moderate view,

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.377
or is it a total, do what
you want, hands off--

00:41:30.377 --> 00:41:32.210
FRANK SCHAEFFER: No, I
am trying to convince

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.501
people of a more moderate view.

00:41:33.501 --> 00:41:35.930
Because I think we
live in a world today--

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:39.480
and this doesn't take much
thinking about-- we're

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.030
involved in a medieval holy
war with ISIS and the Taliban,

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.230
and these other people.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.000
We had a President in
George W. Bush who basically

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.970
ran this country into
the ground on the basis

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:52.490
of evangelical certainty
about invading people

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.290
because they hit us first.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:57.050
We've got a history of
involvement globally, which

00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:00.200
is going to really keep
hurting us for centuries.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.060
We live in a polarized world in
which smartass new atheists are

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.340
answered by greedy and
hypocritical believers

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.970
on the other hand, as if
it's a war between nations

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.983
rather than saying in humility,
none of us know anything.

00:42:13.983 --> 00:42:18.410
And again, to get very personal,
my interests, my bet in this,

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.190
my dog in this fight,
is not my point of view,

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.760
it's my grandchildren.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.470
I don't want Lucy and
Jack to be given a series

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.285
of false, stupid alternatives.

00:42:27.285 --> 00:42:28.910
I would like them to
grow up in a world

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:32.620
where there's more
people who basically look

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.030
at the process of being a human
being from a point of view

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:39.400
of not just some humility, but
also compassion and empathy.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.150
And I think art
contributes to that.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.560
Religion can, and often doesn't.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.250
Philosophy can,
and often doesn't.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.422
Education can, usually
doesn't these days.

00:42:47.422 --> 00:42:49.130
Because it's all about
teach to the test,

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.460
instead of teach to the soul.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.480
So the humanities
go out the window.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.480
And I don't say this just
because I'm at Google.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.510
Remember, I wrote
this book before I

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.760
got invited to speak here.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.639
I didn't just put
this page in for you.

00:43:02.639 --> 00:43:04.680
But I do believe that
actually one of the hopeful

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.860
things in breaking that barrier
down is what Google does.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.610
Not only do I use Google
day and night as a writer,

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.300
and a resource for
everything-- it's

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.520
the only decent spell-check
system in the world,

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.050
by the way.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.750
And I say that as a dyslexic.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:22.590
My Word spell-check
never finds anything,

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.990
let alone anything else.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:25.430
But you go to
Google, if you even

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.170
have a vague idea
of what it might

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.090
be like, you will get there.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.350
So it works.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:32.530
Well, this actually
changes everything

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:35.560
when it comes from the point
of view of a combative approach

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.830
to everything.

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:40.130
How can you have certainty
when all knowledge becomes

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:41.480
at your fingertips?

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.455
You simply have to
have the humility

00:43:43.455 --> 00:43:46.400
to look into what you're
doing and realize, no matter

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.230
what I spend my
whole life studying,

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.592
I will only scratch
the tip of the iceberg.

00:43:50.592 --> 00:43:52.175
So yeah, there was
the Harvard Library

00:43:52.175 --> 00:43:54.719
and places you could go and
get a visual idea of everything

00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:55.510
that was out there.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.170
But now, someone like
me who's not a scholar

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.690
can type in something like the
word Saint John Chrysostom,

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:04.090
and now I could just spend
the rest of my life on that.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.650
That's a very
humbling experience,

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:07.280
and it should
teach us something.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.340
So I'm hoping that my book is a
little tiny drop in the ocean,

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.530
that "Why I'm an Atheist
Who Believes in God"

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:18.640
is just simply a statement
that says, listen,

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.740
I haven't learned much.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.739
I've learned to be a bit
of a kinder grandfather

00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:23.740
than I was a father.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.240
Maybe a bit of a better writer.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.996
But let's all step back
from this war of religion

00:44:27.996 --> 00:44:30.120
we're involved with, whether
from the new atheist's

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.610
side, or the Christian
side, of the Jewish side,

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.260
or the Taliban,
or whoever it is.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.260
Do we really want to
go down this path?

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.890
And so to me, I do want to
convince people of that.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.200
I have an agenda.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.930
But it isn't an
in-or-out agenda.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.340
It's an agenda that says,
let's all step back a minute

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.685
and take some of the foolish
aggression out of this.

00:44:51.685 --> 00:44:53.279
AUDIENCE: How do you do that?

00:44:53.279 --> 00:44:55.070
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Well,
it's very difficult.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.930
People ask me about
my blogging, which

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:59.760
I compare to cage fighting
compared to actual writing.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.860
And say, why are you
sometimes so strong in that

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.010
when you're preaching
this other viewpoint?

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:11.194
But I think we talk it, and
above all, we say it to people,

00:45:11.194 --> 00:45:12.860
as we are right here
in this discussion.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.280
But then, the most
important thing of all

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.360
is how we actually
relate with people.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.030
Do we really put climbing
ahead in our career ahead

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:21.099
of human relationships?

00:45:21.099 --> 00:45:22.890
Do we really think the
most important thing

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:24.260
to do is earn money?

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:29.125
Do we really want to always try
to dominate the situation we're

00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:32.010
in, and succeed in the terms
that corporate America has

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:32.890
lined up for us?

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:35.780
Or do we want to succeed
first as a human being?

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.840
And that's really a
series of small choices.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.930
It's not like a big one-time,
born-again experience.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:43.510
It's the little choices of
where we spend our time,

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:46.550
and who we spend it with.

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:49.162
And family, and
relationships between people,

00:45:49.162 --> 00:45:50.120
and all the rest of it.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.950
So I don't think there's
one big fix to this.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.380
I think it's a series of
small choices and priorities

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.463
in our lives, and that
changes the way we actually

00:45:57.463 --> 00:46:00.300
relate to other human beings.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.579
Yes?

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:02.620
AUDIENCE: Hey, I'm Chris.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.050
Nice to meet you.

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.490
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Hi, Chris.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.570
Thank you for coming today.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.990
AUDIENCE: I want to say first,
I appreciate your admitting so

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.781
openly that you weren't
good at fatherhood.

00:46:08.781 --> 00:46:12.680
Because I'm now a father of two
little kids, and I suck at it.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.780
And I was going to
say, hearing what you

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.030
said made me feel less shitty.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.020
It doesn't, actually,
that's not honest.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.610
It does at least making not
feel both shitty and alone,

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.720
so I appreciate that.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.680
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Good.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.180
Thank you.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.700
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
ask you, having formerly

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.840
been an atheist, now
being a church goer,

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.780
I find it interesting
you've had a lot

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:38.800
of up close view of church
behavior that was not hopeful.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.390
It was not positive.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.990
And now, you have spent
a while in a church

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.680
where you are clearly
getting positive value,

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.905
or no one's holding
a gun to your head

00:46:48.905 --> 00:46:51.140
and making you go to the
Greek Orthodox church-- I

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.200
guess it's good there.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.800
Beyond the point I
heard loud and clear

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.220
from you of avoiding
total certainty,

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.280
and the aggressive
asshole behavior that

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.680
proceeds from that, do you
have any other suggestions

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.110
about how to avoid doing
church badly for those who

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.550
are interested in doing church?

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.930
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Well, yeah, in
the sense that you first of all

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:13.610
have to, I think, be honest with
ourselves of why we're going.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:16.590
If we're expecting a magic pill
that will solve everything,

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.300
it will always be disappointing.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.760
If we expect perfection,
not just in churches,

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.450
but in any relationships
with other human beings.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:25.030
In a church context,
pretty soon it

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:28.640
boils down to a congregation
of one, and that's me, or you.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.900
Because no one else
is good enough.

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.720
And if you know
yourself, you don't

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.990
want to be stuck in
any denomination where

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.680
you're the pastor, bishop,
and confessor, and all

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.670
the rest of it.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:40.390
So I think part of
it is always being

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.220
willing to settle
not just in church

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.967
but in any human community
for something workable

00:47:45.967 --> 00:47:47.800
where you can have a
meaningful relationship

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.049
with other human beings-- I
keep coming back to this--

00:47:50.049 --> 00:47:52.490
and not look for the kind of
magic bullet teaching pill.

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:55.510
Actually, I have a
little bit in the book,

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:59.390
and I promise everybody this
is not a planted question.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.200
But I'll just read
one little section,

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.450
because as we're getting
pretty down in the time here,

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:04.366
we have a few minutes.

00:48:04.366 --> 00:48:07.840
But this is an actual
answer to your question.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.490
In the movie "The Big
Lebowski," The Dude Lebowski,

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.880
a single unemployed
slacker living in Venice,

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.660
California is mistaken
for a millionaire

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.779
who is also named Lebowski.

00:48:16.779 --> 00:48:18.320
Thugs break into
The Dude's apartment

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.840
and try to coerce
him into paying

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.220
a debt he knows nothing about.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.780
When he refuses, they
pee on his carpet.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.410
Later, while considering
the immorality

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.380
of the self-defined
nihilists who

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.590
desecrated The Dude's
carpet, his friend Walter

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:32.760
says, "Nihilists?

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:38.090
Fuck me, I mean,
say what you want

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:39.860
about the tenets of
national socialism,

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.490
Dude, at least it's an ethos."

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.120
Unlike the nihilist
carpet wreckers,

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.120
Walter, played by John
Goodman, and The Dude,

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.550
played by Jeff Bridges,
do have an ethos.

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.740
They embrace this
code by bowling.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.820
To them, bowling is church.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.597
Their means of
establishing relationships

00:48:54.597 --> 00:48:56.180
with people who share
their commitment

00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:00.660
to a liturgical tradition in a
way that caters to their lives.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.780
And their church isn't perfect,
either, but they still go.

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.740
Even though it also includes
jerks like Jesus Quintana,

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.300
played by Don Turturro.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.115
Turturro's hilarious Jesus
is a pain in the ass.

00:49:13.115 --> 00:49:16.640
Notwithstanding, Walter and The
Dude still go bowling with him.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.530
They don't see themselves as too
good for whoever else shows up

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:20.780
to participate.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.050
The Dude is into
liturgical tradition.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.510
He practices his
rituals religiously.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.010
Which include smoking
marijuana in the bath,

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.070
drinking White Russians,
bowling, and remaining

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:31.240
faithful to his friends.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.510
The Dude abides, because
he's true to his rights,

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:35.950
and thus to himself.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.740
The Dude does not worry
about his motivations,

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.550
let alone his inner
sincerity, or the perfection

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:43.180
of his bowling church.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.070
The Dude is not trying to
change his liturgical rights

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:48.280
to make them hipper,
progressive, or modern.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.340
The Dude isn't a bowler
because he believes in bowling,

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.840
but because he bowls.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.860
And that's how I see the
doing of community and faith.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.610
So yeah, there's a line.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.390
The Greek Orthodox
church is no picnic.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.740
I mean, there's
politics everywhere.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.160
Some priest you love, other
people want to kick him out.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.070
On and on it goes,
this is a human deal.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:11.070
But that said, I like the
continuity of a liturgy

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.070
that I subscribe to
and am familiar with,

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:15.530
because I don't want
new all the time.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.660
I want to go back
to familiar things.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.264
So it's like the
same reason you don't

00:50:19.264 --> 00:50:21.680
want to go to a home you grew
up in and find they razed it

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.339
and put a parking lot there.

00:50:23.339 --> 00:50:25.880
It wasn't the greatest place on
Earth, but it was your house,

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.590
and you knew it.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.910
So similarly, I like tradition.

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:32.360
So I would just say everybody
has their limit of what

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.340
they can take.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.610
But unless that
limit is reached,

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:38.430
the continuity of
friendships, the continuity

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:42.550
of liturgical service, the
continuity of styles that you

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:44.890
are used to is worth
a lot in a world

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:46.430
where so much else is changing.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:48.200
And it isn't just
church, it's art.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.450
One of my definitions
of great art

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.640
is that you want to revisit it.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.800
So if you love a piece
of work, one of the signs

00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.200
that it is a great
piece of work,

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.450
at least as it relates to
you, is you want to go back.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:04.610
If you're just wowed by
something, the latest CGI

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:08.110
thing on IMAX, and it's
huge and it's loud,

00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:10.240
but you never actually want
to revisit that moment,

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.905
that says something to you.

00:51:11.905 --> 00:51:14.447
It wasn't part of
that inner fabric

00:51:14.447 --> 00:51:15.530
that really matters to us.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:19.110
So those quiet things that
we like to revisit and really

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.490
contemplate and enjoy, and
be part of, and community,

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.300
and people, to me,
that's worth putting up

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.990
with a lot of failure
that doesn't measure up

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:30.070
to the perfection, as
long as that steady stream

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:31.610
of experience feeds us.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.467
So that's the best I can do.

00:51:33.467 --> 00:51:34.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.010
FRANK SCHAEFFER: You're welcome.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:35.680
Yes?

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.381
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:36.880
Patrick.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.370
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Hi, Patrick.

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.740
AUDIENCE: The way you
described your daily habits,

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.720
it would be really
easy for the religious

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.010
to claim you as
their own and say,

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:49.070
he is a believer who has
doubts, like so many of us have.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:51.820
What's the flip side of
that, where the atheist can

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.820
claim you, and say, yeah, he
still has these tendencies

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:56.737
to fall back on faith?

00:51:56.737 --> 00:51:58.694
FRANK SCHAEFFER: Well,
I'll mention two things.

00:51:58.694 --> 00:52:01.637
One that's not in your question,
but just to put it in context.

00:52:01.637 --> 00:52:03.220
As someone who goes
around the country

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.410
talking about gay
rights, and accepting

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.590
gay marriage, and
transgender rights,

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:10.950
and appears on "Rachel
Maddow" deconstructing

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.160
the religious right again,
and again, and again,

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.490
the kind of Ghostbusters
thing-- who do you call?

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:18.990
Somebody just said
something stupid,

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:20.860
so we'll get Frank Schaeffer
to tell us just how dumb.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.890
So I have a thing in
the book that says,

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:24.760
and I'm coming back
to your question.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.885
I get a call from something
like "The Maddow Show,"

00:52:26.885 --> 00:52:28.910
and it's like, they just
said this dumb thing.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.280
And my dialogue when I get
on there is, Rachel says,

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.450
they just said
this stupid thing.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:33.880
And then I say, well,
how stupid was it?

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.050
And she says, very stupid.

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:36.950
And then she says,
how dangerous is it?

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:39.610
And I say, very dangerous,
and that's my next two minute

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:40.570
commentary.

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:42.740
So I'm not a friend.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.820
In the eyes of religious
people, I'm part of that enemy.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.110
When it comes to my
own personal beliefs,

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:53.300
I think that on a much
more serious level,

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:57.140
I'm someone who not only
relates to atheists,

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:01.070
but spends a lot of my
time way past doubt,

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:03.490
and simply being
honest about admitting

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.890
that these rituals
fundamentally are not

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:09.380
grounded in anything that would
relate to the word "true."

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.740
So for me, the truth,
say, of the Bible,

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.990
is that things that
never happened still

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.490
can have a nugget
of truth in them,

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:19.180
because it's a reflection of
the collective human experience.

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:22.590
And in the times when I have
more perception of the divine,

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:25.260
I hope that's
somehow been guided.

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:28.320
But most of the time, I wouldn't
break it down in percentages,

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.280
I simply don't
believe a word of it.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.700
And that's an honest statement.

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:36.740
I don't think it happened.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:40.530
And I don't think there's
any way to make it so.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:43.090
So when it comes to
an argument, a lot

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:45.030
of my beef with the
new atheist movement

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:48.300
is style, and hubris,
and arrogance,

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.240
and putting down
long traditions that

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.280
have tremendous value
for many reasons.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.470
And not all new
atheists do that.

00:53:54.470 --> 00:54:00.280
But when it fundamentally comes
to the point, when I lie down

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.820
and die, what do I
think will happen?

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.860
Usually, I'm pretty cold
hearted to myself about it,

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.930
and say, guess what?

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:11.010
The lights will just go out.

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.860
Other times, I
don't believe that.

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:14.780
But at the times
when I do feel that,

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:18.820
it's way past peripheral
doubt to a system

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:22.202
that I think is otherwise
OK, except for my doubts.

00:54:22.202 --> 00:54:23.660
And then the last
step I would just

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.390
say is if you are going to have
a faith informed by anything

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.340
but that kind of doubt,
then it certainly

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.070
doesn't qualify it as a faith.

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:34.510
It qualifies as an addiction
to some sort of certainty,

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:39.090
because faith implies unbelief.

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:40.970
And I leave you
with that thought.

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:42.090
So I think we're done.

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:42.599
Thank you.

00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:43.140
Thanks a lot.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.260
Sorry I didn't get
to your question.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.080
Thanks a lot.
