00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.230
&gt;&gt; Margaret Sullivan: Good
afternoon, I'm Margaret Sullivan.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.370
I'm the media columnist
for The Washington Post.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.820
The Post is a charter
sponsor of the Library

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.200
of Congress National Book Festival.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.880
We want to thank the sponsors,
in particular David Rubenstein.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.770
You can support the festival with
a donation, there's information

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.850
in your program and
you're urged to do so.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.860
Another piece of information is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.590
that this presentation will have
a question and answer period.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.810
There are microphones at
the end of these aisles

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.490
and you're urged to take part.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.430
And there is a book signing at 5
o'clock, I think it's at 5 o'clock.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.790
There's a book signing,
I think it's at 5.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.720
Peter Cozzens recently retired
as a Foreign Service Officer

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.500
at the State Department
after 30 years.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.040 position:56%
While at State he wrote 17 books on
the Civil War and the American West.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.150
His new book is "The Earth
is Weeping: The Epic Story

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.290
of the Indian Wars for
the American West".

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.140
A starred review from Booklist
called the book 'A magnificent

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
single-volume account of
the post-Civil War conflicts

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.520
that shaped our history and
the mythology of the frontier'.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.630
Cozzens' books have all
been selections of the Book

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.440
of the Month Club, the History Book
Club or the Military Book Club.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.510
I introduce to you Peter Cozzens.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.890
[ Applause ]

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.570
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Thank you
so much for all coming out

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.880
and as you all know as I do the
green is like the head [laughter].

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.270
You know I was watching the other
night some pundits on a network

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.610
that shall remain nameless, pundits
who shall also remain nameless,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.300
discussing the president's
decision to add more troops

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.700
to our conflict in Afghanistan.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.010
And they were speaking of it as of
course already the longest conflict

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.000
in American history and that's
not quite, not quite true.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.100
Actually, the longest conflict

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.810
in our nation's history
involving the United Stated Army,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.470
were the Indian Wars.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:40.420
They lasted 101 years, beginning
in 1790 and running through 1891.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.070
Now, before I get into my talk I
thought I should orient us briefly

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.240
on the period of the Indian
wars that I'll be discussing

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.870
and which my book covers.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.250 position:56%
My book is devoted to the 25 years
of struggle following the Civil War,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.430
the climatic Indian Wars
of the American West

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.790
that really shaped the modern West.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.370
And the conflicts in my
book cover the area ranging

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.920
from the Missouri River
all the way West to Canada,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.650
from the Canadian border
and the Pacific Northwest

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.070
down into Northern Mexico.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.780
That is essentially the area
that is covered in the book.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.410
Now of all this, you know we're
in a book festival today I'd

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.760
like to begin my remarks
with a scene from the movies.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.070
Does anyone recognize
this movie scene offhand?

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.570
Okay, by the applause
I gather you do.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.310
This of course is Dustin Hoffman

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.900
as a very befuddled army scout
watching George Armstrong Custer

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.600
preening himself before the
Battle of the Little Bighorn.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.180
I guess he wanted to look
good before he was killed.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.410
This scene from "Little Big Man"
came to have an allegorical meaning

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.610 position:56%
to me as I was researching the book.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.570
Custer, Dustin Hoffman actually I
kind of came to feel somewhat akin

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.280 position:56%
to him as I delved into the subject.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.570
And Custer for me came to personify
the mythos of the Indian Wars,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.600
the many myths that
surround the Indian Wars.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.720
Now, to some degree of course
myth always distorts history

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.120
but I believe that the Indian Wars

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.910
of the American West are uniquely
susceptible to this phenomenon.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.470
Much of both popular
and academic history,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.650
film and fiction has depicted the
period as an absolute struggle

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.630
between good and evil, reversing
the roles of heroes and villains

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.950
as necessary to accommodate a
changing national conscience.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.770
Now in the first 80 years following
the tragedy at Wounded Knee in 1891

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.640
which ended the Indian Wars,
the nation had a tendency

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.210
to lionize the Indian
fighting army and to vilify

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.100
or to trivialize the Indians
who resisted "civilization".

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:30.140
In 1970 the story reversed
itself and the pendulum swung

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.060
in the opposite direction,
to the opposite extreme.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.130
Americans were developing an acute
sense of the countless wrongs

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.750
that had been done to
the American Indian.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.210
Dee Brown's elegantly written and
passionately wrought "Bury My Heart

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.740
at Wounded Knee" and
later that same year,

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.590
the film "Little Big
Man" shaped a new saga

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.090
that articulated the
nation's feelings of guilt.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.900
In the public mind the
government and the army became seen

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.450
as wilful exterminators of the
native peoples of the West.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:18.640
In "The Earth is Weeping" I have
tried to bring historical balance

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.810
to the story of the Indian Wars.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.140
The first step to presenting
a balanced history is,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.420
I believe is, to strip
away the myths.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.430
There are too many myths for
us to discuss them all today,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.920
what I'd like to do then, is I hope
wet your appetite for the book,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.100
by addressing what I consider to
be the three most egregious myths

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.470
and most commonly-held myths
surrounding the Indian Wars.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.460
And here they are, the
first one, myth one,

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.360
that the regular army was
hell-bent on killing Indians.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.750
Myth two, that government Indian
policy was exterminationist

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.010
and three, that the Indians
united to resist the Whites,

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.860
to resist white encroachment
on their lands.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.260
So, let's begin with the fallacy,
what I argue is a fallacy,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.040
that the regular army was
eager to kill Indians.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.790
Does anyone recognize
this jaunty fellow?

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.810
This is George Crook and he was one

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.940
of the premier Indian
fighting generals in the West.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.270
He doesn't look like
much of a general,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.270
he never wore a uniform out West.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.320
He usually dressed in a pith
helmet and civilian clothes

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.670
and rode a mule, and was
less military-looking

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.740
than the common soldiers.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.030
But he was without a
doubt one of the two

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.460
or three finest generals
fighting the West.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.890
And during the height of
the Indian Wars, a reporter,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.990
a newspaper reporter asked
him how he liked his job.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.910
And Crook replied, not much.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:11.450
He said it was a hard thing to be
forced to do battle with Indians

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.020
who more often than
not were in the right.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.760
As Crook continued, he said I do
not wonder and you will not either

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.930
that when Indians see their
wives and children starving

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.710
and their last source of
supplies cut off, they go to war.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.530
And then we are sent
out there to kill them.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.000
It is an outrage.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.900
All tribes tell the same story.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.590
They are surrounded on all sides.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.060
The game is destroyed
or driven away.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.970
They are left to starve and there
remains but one thing for them

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.800
to do, to fight while they can.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.730
Our treatment of the
Indian is an outrage.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:04.730 position:56%
Now, that a general would offer such
a candid and forceful public defence

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:10.930
of the Indians may strike some of
you, as it did me, as implausible

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.210
because it contradicts
an enduring myth,

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.010
that the regular army was the
implacable foe of the Indian,

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.260
and they wanted to go
out and kill Indians.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.640
And Crook was far from being
the only high-ranking officer

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.440
to protest the injustices
that were done to the Indians.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.850
John Pope, who was then the
commander of the huge Department

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.210
of the Missouri, which encompassed
nearly half the West actually

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.590
suggested at one point
that soldiers be sent

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:48.420
to help the Indians eliminate
white buffalo hunters.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.010
The year was 1874.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.410
The buffalo hunters had decimated
the herds of Western Kansas

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.590 position:56%
and early that year they began, they
set up shop in the Texas Panhandle

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:09.390
at a place called Adobe Walls and
resumed the killing of buffalo

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.550
on Indian reservation land,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.970
buffalo that had been promised
the Indians in perpetuity.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.050
When 500 warriors attacked
the despised buffalo hunters

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:29.360
at Adobe Walls in June 1874
the governor of Kansas appealed

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.750
to General Pope to dispatch
troops to save the white men.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.680
Pope turned the governor down flat.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:45.380 position:56%
Indians like white men, he said, are
not reconciled to starve peacefully.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.140
The buffalo hunters have justly
earned all that has befallen them.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.820
If I were to send troops to this
unlawful establishment it would be

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.810
to break it up and
not to protect it.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.530
Unfortunately the buffalo
hunters managed

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.990
to repel the Indians on their own.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:12.050
Now, from these two episodes,
what are we to conclude?

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:17.610
And the essential truth
is that the plight

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:23.610 position:56%
of the Indians deeply disturbed most
senior officers and then more often

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:29.150
than not they sympathized with the
hostile Indians whey were charged

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.150
with subduing.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.240 position:56%
I could give countless more examples

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.490
of other generals who
felt the same way.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.340
Now, what can we say about
the government policy

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.300
that they were charged
with enforcing?

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:51.750
Its wisdom or morality may be
questioned but it cannot be said

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:58.630 position:56%
that the government ever intended to
physically exterminate, I emphasize,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.770
physically exterminate the Indians.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:10.630
That the Indian way of life must
be eradicated, if the Indians were

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.150
to survive, was however
taken for granted,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.990
even among the most ardent
advocates of Indian rights.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.940
The term, the phrase
'kill the Indians,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.930 position:56%
save the man' was quite common then.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.460
Well, federal Indian policy

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.460
after the Civil War
evolved in fits and starts.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.370
When the Civil War ended,
it was in absolute tatters.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.640
Neither the president
nor Congress were able

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.290
to fashion a coherent
policy which left things

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.480 position:56%
as General William Tecumseh Sherman,

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.520
who was the ranking
officer the West,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.710
put it to "caprice and hazard".

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:57.620
Another great problem was
rampant corruption that ran

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.700
through the Indian Bureau.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.550
This slide here is the
famous Thomas Nast cartoon

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.830
from Harper's Weekly
showing a starving Indian

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.180
and a quite satisfied

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.500
and heavily-laden with
cash Indian agent.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:20.470
There was a popular story told of
a chief who described his agent

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.170
to General Sherman thusly.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.610
He said, 'Our agent great man,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.570
when he comes he brings
everything in a little bag.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.480
When he goes it takes
three steamboats

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.820
to carry away his things'.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:45.050
Well, things changed in 1869

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.780
with the newly-elected
President Ulysses S. Grant

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:53.220
who famously declared with respect
to the Indians 'Let us have peace'.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:59.930
He instituted a 'carrot and stick'
policy, a carrot and stick body

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:04.230
of principles that became
known as the Peace Policy.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.530
Grant replaced the corrupt agents
with churchmen and army officers.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.770
He also established independent
oversight of the Indian Bureau.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:18.900
And he directed the Indian
agents to assemble the Indians

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:24.440
in their jurisdictions on permanent
reservations that were well removed

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.150
from the overland travel routes
and from white settlements,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.880
get them started on the
road to "civilization"

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.180
and above all treat them
with kindness and patience.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.040
Indians who refused to settle
on reservations would be turned

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.520
over to the military however and
treated as friendly or hostile

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.870
as circumstances might justify.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:54.910
Now, kindness and patience,
not to mention common decency,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.710
were often lacking in the
implementation of Grant's policy.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:03.880
In the ensuring years some of
the reforms that he instituted

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.200
like replacing these
patronage agents were abandoned

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.210
and the corruption resumed.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:15.330 position:56%
But the principles that Grant
promulgated officially guided Indian

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:21.850
policy during the 25 years of the
Indians Wars of the American West.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.140
The end result as we
all know, however,

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.010
was to dispossess Indians
of their lands.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:36.970
The question then naturally
arises, how did the Indians respond

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.320
to the broken promises,
the broken treaties

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:47.710
and to the relentless white
encroachment on their lands?

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:52.890
And that brings us to the third
enduring myth that I want to,

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:58.540
if not dispel, at least cause
you to think about this afternoon

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.320
and that is the notion
that the Indians united

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.980
to resist white encroachment.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.840
Does anyone recognize this
kind of art, this type of art?

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.280
&gt;&gt; Ledger art.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.050
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Ledger
art, exactly, this,

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:21.490
Indian warriors beginning in the
mid-19th century developed a type

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.860
of art called Ledger art where they
would take ledger books and draw

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.870
or paint in them what
they considered

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.350
to be their most heroic
deeds as warriors,

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.890
deeds that they considered
most worthy

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.650
of remembering and passing on.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:45.560
And invariably they were
nine times out of ten,

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.730
pictures of them killing
Indians of other tribes.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.530
This picture you see here is

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.500
of a Cheyanne Indian
warrior running his lance

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.830
through a Pawnee Indian warrior.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.920
And it graphically I think
illustrates the point

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.570
that the Indians not
only failed to unite

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:09.540
in opposing the westward
expansion of civilization

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.500
but they also continued to
make war on one another.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.970
And the reason for that was simply
that these were warrior cultures.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.860
Inter-tribal warfare was too deeply
ingrained for them to do otherwise.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:32.860
A young man raised in a tribe in
the West, he owed his whole place

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.630
in tribal society to his
success as a warrior.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.710
In some tribes a young man
could not even court a girl

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.570
until had brought home war honors.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:47.790
So, unfortunately there was no
sense of Indian-ness that we,

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.140
the Indians were a common
people until it was,

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.030
until it was far too late.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.480
And during the course of the
Indian Wars an army officer asked a

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.110
Cheyanne chief why his tribe preyed
on their Crow Indian neighbors?

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:11.810
Well, he said, we stole the
hunting grounds of the Crows

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.520
because they were the best.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.950
We wanted more room.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.450
It was as simple as that.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:26.550
Or, as a Lakota chief, Lakota Sioux
chief told a government treaty

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:32.500
negotiator, he said "You have
split my land and I do not like it.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:37.510
These lands once belonged
to the Kiowa and to the Crow

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.530
but we whipped those
nations out of them

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.790
and in this we did
what the white men do

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.680
when they want the
lands of the Indians".

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:53.550 position:56%
Well those certainly were sentiments
that inquisitive Whites determined

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.050
to clear the West of
what they considered

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.900
to be troublesome Indians,
could readily appreciate.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:06.370
Now one side point that I want to
make, that I haven't made enough

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:11.380
in the past, is that while the
Indians fought among themselves

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:17.710
relentlessly and throughout this
whole epic of their dispossession,

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:25.540
the Indians never provoked any
of the conflicts with the Whites

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.730
that you'll read about in my book.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.470
They never provoked any of them.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:38.680 position:56%
They were always driven to war and
I think showed remarkable restraint.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.800
A kind of a subtext
of this third myth,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.030
something that's frequently
lost in the mythos

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:51.190
of the Indian Wars are
the numerous tribes

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.450
that actually accepted
the white presence,

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.780
that actually welcomed the white
presence because it enabled them

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:04.550
to form allies to fight
their own tribal enemies,

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:09.400
sort of along the lines of 'the
enemy of my enemy is my friend'.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.810
The Pawnee Indians for
example were vitally important

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.760
to the construction of the
Transcontinental Railroad,

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.930
specifically the Union-Pacific
Railroad.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:24.650
In the summer of 1867 the
Lakota and the Cheyanne had

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:33.730 position:56%
so severely raided the Union-Pacific
that they essentially brought work

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.930
on the road to a standstill,
to an absolute halt.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:45.140
The army proved incapable of
stopping these fast-moving,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.980
fast-riding Indian raiding
parties and so a battalion

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.850
of Pawnees were recruited
as soldiers.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:21:00.130 position:56%
Here you see a picture of the Pawnee
battalion preparing for action.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.950
Well the Pawnee battalion, how many

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.960
of you have watched
"Hell on Wheels"?

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.610
The series, I imagine
a good number of you.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.110
Well noticeably absent in "Hell

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.060
on Wheels" is any mention
of the Pawnee.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.850
But they mauled one large Cheyanne
war party so badly that raids

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.580
on the Union-Pacific
stopped, completely stopped

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.360
and work resumed unimpeded.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.950
I think it's safe to
say that the presence

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.420
of the Pawnee battalion
along the road shaved

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.590 position:56%
at least a year off the construction
of the Transcontinental Railroad

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:42.590
and probably a season or
two off of "Hell on Wheels".

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:48.200
Now, as destructive as the
fighting between tribes was,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.780
what ultimately doomed the Indians,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:57.000
doomed Indian resistance was the
inability of individual tribes

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.780
to maintain cohesion
against the white threat.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.820
Only those tribes that accepted
the Whites, tribes like the Pawnee,

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.280 position:56%
the Crow, the Shoshone were unified.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.190
None of the tribes that are famous
to us for fighting the government

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:18.370
like the Lakota, the Cheyanne,
the Apache, the Arapaho,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.830
none of these tribes were
ever united for war or peace.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:28.340
Each tribe had its war and peace
factions that are traditionalist

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:33.560
and accommodation of factions
however you want to name them,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.810
that struggled for dominance

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.560
and clashed sometimes
violently with one another.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.260
You get again the traditionalists
or war faction and the peace

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.260
or accommodationist
faction in each tribe.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.900
The Kiowa of the Southern Plains
offer a particularly tragic example

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.510
of this, of a tribe torn asunder.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:00.620
The individual you see here
is named Chief Kicking Bird.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.920
He was the head of the
Kiowa peace faction

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:10.450
and he singlehandedly kept nearly
all of the Kiowas out of the,

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.100
what was called the Red River
War which was a final struggle

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:21.680
for the Southern Plains and that
followed on the Adobe Walls raid

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.980
that I mentioned earlier.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.260
So he kept almost the entire
tribe out of that war.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.870
Nonetheless when the war is
over the government decided

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.370
that they would make an
example for a change of Indians

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:39.790
who they felt were responsible
for instigating the war.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:46.090
And so they ordered Kicking
Bird to select a quota of Kiowa

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:53.060
to be sent east to
Florida for imprisonment.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.850
You know, Kicking Bird
argued that you know,

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.150
we played a very small role in it.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.430
Hardly any Kiowa were
ever in the war.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.840
Nonetheless, he was required

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.670
to choose a contingent
for incarceration.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:13.510
So to ease the burden on the tribe
he chose mostly Mexican captives

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.850
and tribal delinquents.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:22.320
That was well and good but he
also chose a vicious war leader

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.240
by the name of Mamonti [phonetic]

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.970
and Kicking Bird's
complicity cost him his life.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:34.440
As Kicking Bird saw the prisoners
off with words of affection

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.990
and promise that their
incarceration would be brief,

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.310
which in fact it was,
Mamonti hexed him.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.490
"You think you have done well.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.280
You think you are free, a
big man with the Whites,

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.320
but you will not live
long, I will see to that".

00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:00.820
The next day Kicking Bird
died at the age of 39

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.680
after drinking a cup of coffee.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.050
The army surgeon who treated
him said he had been poisoned

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.940
with strychnine.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.590
There had been a fatalistic element

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.880
in Kicking Bird's struggle
to maintain peace.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.180
In the unending hatred
between Whites

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.370
and Indians Kicking Bird
foresaw the apocalypse.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:32.500 position:56%
"I fear blood must flow and my heart
is sad" he told a Quaker friend

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.260
before the Red River War.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:40.080
"The white man is strong but he
cannot kill us all in one year,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.160
it will take him two or
three, maybe four years

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.650
and then the world will
turn to water or burn up.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:57.700
It is our Mother and cannot live
when the Indians are all dead".

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:04.130
I will close my remarks then
with Kicking Bird's words,

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:09.310
review very quickly the three myths
that we talked about, myth one,

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.060
the regular army being the
implacable foe of the Indians,

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.480
myth two, that government Indian
policy was exterminationist

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.800
in nature and that myth three

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.880
that the Indians united
to resist the Whites.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.630
I hope that, I know it is a lot.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.690
We could talk at great
length on this subject

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:33.380
but I hope I've left you a
little less confused and baffled

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:38.690
than our poor friend Dustin
Hoffman here seen looking

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.890
up at Custer at the Little Bighorn.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:46.050
So with that, I will
be more than happy

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.510
to answer any questions
you may have, thank you.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:59.290
[ Applause ]

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:05.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you, with the expansion
of the American population,

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:11.980 position:56%
the desire for land and of course
cold trapping, et cetera, et cetera,

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:18.100
could these Indian Wars
really have been avoided?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.980
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Some of them
could have been, if not avoided,

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.960
at least ameliorated, because
some of the Indian Wars

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.190
like the Nez Perce
War involved tribes

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.270
that were already partly
acculturated.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:43.600
But on the Plains, the Great
Plains where the majority

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.600
of the conflict took place I don't
think they could have been avoided

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.990
because you had tribes
like the Cheyanne.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:56.980
The Cheyanne numbered only about
3500 people yet during the time

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.760
of which we speak they claimed

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:06.970
as their traditional hunting lands
Eastern Colorado, Western Kansas,

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:12.920
Western Nebraska, Northern
modern-day Oklahoma

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.240
and Southern Wyoming.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.200
Now it just wasn't reasonable
to expect the Whites,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:26.760
you know a population of 38
million to turn over the equivalent

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.870
of maybe what, maybe three
modern western states

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:35.940
to 3500 essentially
hunters and gatherers.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:44.460
So, a good portion affect at least
half of the Plains Indians did try

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.790
to make the transition
peacefully to a different way of,

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:53.270
to an agricultural way
of life, but for a number

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:59.050
of reasons the success
was partial at best.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.460
There were strong traditionalist
factions like those led

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.260
by Crazy Horse, Sitting
Bull that didn't want

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.860
to fight the Whites they just
wanted to pursue their old way

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.220
of living and chasing the buffalo.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.470
But that was, unfortunately
that was just.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:21.040
It was just incongruent with
such a huge western population.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.180
So, some of the conflicts
at least were inevitable

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.790
and it was absolutely
inevitable that that way

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.140
of life was going to
have to give way.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.570
Yes sir?

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:39.290
&gt;&gt; You look at Western civilization
and you see what happened

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.570
when something else different,
events sort of that's happened.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:49.930
It was Genghis Khan who unified
the Mongols and nomadic tribes

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:54.620
and essentially you know attacked
civilization quite successfully.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.910
At what point, if the Indians
had gotten a leader like that

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:02.360
who could unify them, and would
it have been able to really wipe

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:07.550
out the civilization, seriously
impede it for many centuries?

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:11.410
At what point, would it
be before the Civil War?

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.710
Would [inaudible]?

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.010
Would it have been
later, at what point?

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:17.320
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: That's
funny you mention Tecumseh,

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.710
the book I'm working on right now
is a biography of Chief Tecumseh

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.770
and I'll be exploring
that very question.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.890 position:56%
At what point could the Whites have,
could the Indians perhaps have,

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:32.320
you know united to have, if
not stopped white encroachment,

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.190
at least seriously impeded it?

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:36.490
&gt;&gt; One leader?

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:37.790
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Yeah, one leader.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.910
In the West I think the best chance
would have been before the Civil

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:49.670
War, would have been maybe in the
early 1850s when the, when Whites

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:53.720
and I use the term Whites to mean,
you know, non-Native-Americans,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.730
were crossing the West, were
trying to get to the West coast

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.440
for minerals and for the
Pacific Northwest, for land,

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.200
and we're not settling the West.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.620
That would have been a time

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:12.220
when I think sufficient costs could
have been, might have been incurred

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:18.750
by the government that
negotiations might have led

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.900
to maybe you know one
state, the equivalent

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.320
of one state being set
aside for the Indians.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:32.110
But even that would have been a
tall order because you know disease

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:37.730
and inter-tribal warfare had so
reduced the tribes of the West

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:43.870 position:56%
that by the time we're talking
about [inaudible] there were no more

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:48.230
than 200,000 Indians
in the West and again,

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:52.300
already at least 3 million
Whites and more on the way.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.980
So, I don't think it was ever,

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.380
ever a realistic possibility
quite honestly in the West

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.600
because the inter-tribal
hatreds were just so great.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.270
You have a different story
east of the Mississippi.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.760
I think there was a time when
that could have happened,

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.080
several cases when it could
have happened but not west

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.110
of the Mississippi unfortunately.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:18.710
&gt;&gt; So, if Tecumseh had been, lived
longer, could he have done it?

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.930
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Ah, stay tuned
for my next book [laughter].

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.230
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you very much.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.830
I really enjoyed your talk.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.130
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Thank you.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:28.430
&gt;&gt; A two-part question, one,
I wondered if you could expand

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.080
on your comment that
these tribes tended

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.500
to show a lot more
restraint than aggression.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.200
And I'm interested in that
because they were such a martial,

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.020
I mean if they had a
[inaudible] culture it was

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.140
that they were martial,
particularly on the plains

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.520
and so I'm wondering why you
think that they showed restraint.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.150
And then the second
part of my question,

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.130
understanding that
you're an historian

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.180
and not really telling
us how we should feel

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.950
about what you've reported, but
I'm interested in your conclusions

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.230
about what the appropriate response
is, should we still feel guilty

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.440
as white people here in America or,
what's the appropriate way to look

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.130
on this now in the totality of
everybody had a part to play in it.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Okay, well look to
the first, to your first question,

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:16.950
interestingly the Indians did
not consider soldiers or Whites

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:23.850
to be particularly worthy opponents
and in fact they had such contempt

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.790
for soldiers that they would often
scalp them and just toss the scalp

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.090
at the side of the soldier.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.000
And scalping, a scalp was, you
know an important war honor,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.580
not the most important but
it was an important war honor

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:38.970
and they didn't consider the
soldiers to be worthy enemies.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.350 position:56%
And a lot of the, the government had
a very wise and insipid practice of,

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:46.560
I actually should say,
nefarious military,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.090
it's whatever word you want to use,
the practice of bringing chiefs

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.700
from the western tribes
to Washington

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.030
and just showing them
what they were facing.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.170
And you know these chiefs
would come out West, out East

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.100
and they would go back
to their tribe and say,

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:03.370
my God I've seen giant wigwams,
giant teepees that hold more people

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.060
than we have in our tribes.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.100
And that all, that tended to have
an effect, a means of kind of like,

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:13.110
maybe we just can't resist this
and we can't resist this onslaught.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:17.720
But it was, I think in large
measure it was the former

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.990
and that they didn't think the
Whites were worthy opponents

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:25.310
and the culmination of that plus a
lot of them saw the inevitability

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.650
of defeat if they did resist.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:31.200
In answer to your second question,

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.080
I mean the answer I'll give will
have to be strictly personal.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:41.950
And every time I go out West
to, to the Cheyanne reservation

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:48.120
or to say San Carlos, the Apache
reservation and see the poverty

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.580
on those reservations and just
to see how bad the land is

00:34:52.580 --> 00:35:00.520
that the Indians were allotted,
it just makes my blood boil

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:06.830
and I think, I think that there's
a tremendous ignorance on the part

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:11.330
of Americans as to the
suffering that is endured by many

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.320
of the tribes out West today.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:21.190
So, I think, I think
the continued sense

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.510
of national guilt is appropriate.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.190
I think it's very appropriate.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.350
And I think that what happened

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.230
with the pipeline should
only compound it.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.290
I think that, I personally think

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:35.510
that was outrageous,
absolutely outrageous.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:41.060
[ Applause ]

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.360
&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.970
This question has two parts
but I'd also like to follow

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:48.420
up on what you just said
regarding the scalping.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.110
Was that something that the
white man started initially?

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.250
And the other two parts
of my question were,

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.350
in regards to myth number three in,

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.160
the support the Indians
getting together.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.770
At the Battle of Little Bighorn
weren't there several different

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.070
tribes there?

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.370
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Right.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:06.670
&gt;&gt; And the last thing I
wanted to ask about was the,

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:13.820
in regards to the status
of the Indians in the West.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.980
Weren't they aware that, you know
the Cherokee Indians had tried

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.830
to assimilate much earlier before
during the period of Jackson before

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.590
and they have a communication
of knowing how

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.200
that had already followed
out that there was no chance

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.230
that they were ever going to be
allowed to assimilate in any case?

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:34.230
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Let me try
to keep all three questions,

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:36.100
that's a lot to keep in my head.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:41.070 position:56%
The first question, scalping, that
existed before the first Whites came

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.170
but the Whites picked
up on that very quickly

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:49.040 position:56%
and settlers began scalping Indians.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.320
Rewards were offered
for Indian scalps

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.660
and so it was done by both sides.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.100
Your second question about
the Indians who were united

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.520
at the Little Bighorn,
you make a very good point

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.050
and it's a point I probably
should have made in my remarks,

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:08.180
is that there were tribes
that did form alliances.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.420
For the Little Bighorn it
was basically the Lakota,

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.890
the various seven tribes of
the Lakota, that is to say,

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.920
the Plains Sioux Indians
and the Cheyanne.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.730
The Lakota and Cheyanne had
a longstanding alliance.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.780
It also included the
Arapaho at one time.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:32.960
On the Southern Plains the Kiowa
and the Comanche had an alliance.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.030
And the Southern Cheyanne also
allied themselves with the Kiowa

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.280
and the Comanche, so there
were these localized alliances

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.090
but no overarching Indian alliance.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.820
And your third question, I?

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.940
&gt;&gt; It was regarding the
assimilation and the fact that,

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.240
you know what happened
to the Cherokee.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.200
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Oh right,
the assimilation and of the,

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.140
the fate of the five
civilized tribes

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.020
who were sent out to
Eastern Oklahoma.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.540
They were actually seen as
interlopers by the tribes

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:05.300
in the West and the contact
between the Plains Indians tribe

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.490
with the Kiowa, the
Comanche, the Cheyanne,

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.060
and the five civilized
tribes, that Jackson had forced

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.400
to cross the Mississippi,
was largely hostile.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.700
&gt;&gt; So they didn't know?

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.000
I guess what I'm saying.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.300
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: They, they.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.600
&gt;&gt; The history of it [inaudible].

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.320
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: I think there was
a sense of awareness among some.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.630
You know I've not.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.370
I've not seen that
topic really explored.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.790
It's an excellent topic
for explorers

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.700
to how much peaceful
communication there may have been

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.730
between the five civilized
tribes, the Eastern Oklahoma

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.030
and the Plains Indian tribes.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.930
Most of it that I'm aware of
was hostile so I don't know,

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:45.300
you know to what extent those
lessons may have been passed on.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.360
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: It's
a good question though.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.550
&gt;&gt; Hello, the first
question is about feedback

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:58.730
from the people you wrote about,
the Natives, could you tell us,

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:01.630
you know was it positive or
negative about the Natives

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:04.850
who read your book, you know?

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:08.540
And also, the second question,
is how can we bring healing,

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:13.170
because as you said earlier
that it's very sad out there

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.660
and how can we bring healing to
stop the, you know suicide and?

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.070
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: I think I
should, sorry to interrupt

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.150
but I think I should probably
just answer the first question

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:25.230 position:56%
because I'm getting a time, you know
time thing and there are more folks

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.180
who want to have questions.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:34.170
And the first question I've
already forgotten, I'm sorry.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.580
This is my fault.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.090
&gt;&gt; Okay, maybe the second
question is more important

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.850
because it's dealing
with current issues.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.150
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: I'd
prefer the first.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.390
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay, okay, because the
second question is very hard.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.120
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: It's
a whole, another yeah.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.250
&gt;&gt; It's a lot of gentleness maybe.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:55.360
But the first question was,
obviously a lot of modern people

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.060
in the city are reading this book.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.130
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Okay, right
they're reading and yeah,

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.660
reaction I've gotten
from American-Indians

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.430
and I don't use the
term Native-Americans

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:07.710
because all the Indians
I've met prefer to be called

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:11.010
by their tribal name or be called
Indians and they don't care

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:12.650
for the term Native-Americans.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.260
We do have a museum
here in the Mall,

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.540
it's called the National
Museum of the American Indian

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.020
and that name was selected
by Indians.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.350
I think that's what they prefer.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:26.290 position:56%
In any case, the reception I got has
been very good, it's been very good.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:34.270
In fact the leading American Indian
current events publication used an

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.730
excerpt not from my book
but from an article I wrote

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:41.130
in the Smithsonian magazine
about the Black Hills,

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:45.910
the seizure of the Black Hills
as part of their discussion

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.810
and arguments against what
was happening with pipeline.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:55.020
So the reception has been
good and that, that it's been.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:59.190
It's been considered a fair, a
fair and even-handed approach.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:06.690
As I said I, in this book, you will
get 50% white people viewpoint,

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.580
50% Indian viewpoint.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:17.100
I've tried to again be
completely down the middle in terms

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:22.260
of representing, you know
both sides to the issue.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:27.160
&gt;&gt; Quick question, what
percent of the Indians realized

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.490
that it was hopeless to stay
at least in the United States

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.760
and made their way to Canada?

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.350
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Ah, there
were Indians that did go

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:41.930
to Canada actually
it was the Lakota,

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:48.980
Sitting Bull's assemblage
of Lakota Indians.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:55.300 position:56%
After the Little Bighorn campaign
and subsequent fighting made a break

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.150
for Canada and about
3000 of them did settle

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.080
in Canada for several years.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.480
And they were welcomed by the
government of Canada so long

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.380
as they didn't cause
any trouble or raid

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.120
across the United States/Canadian
border.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.190
And some of the Nez Perce

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:17.480
who escaped also joined
these Lakota in Canada.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.810
The problem there was that
the buffalo were running

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:27.700
out in Western Canada and the
Canadian tribes were resentful

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.030
of the presence of the tribes,

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:34.230
Indians from the United States
encroaching on their buffalo herds.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:40.080
And so they, I mean the
British government was agreeable

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.380
to the Lakota staying.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:46.940
It took a grand total of a dozen
Royal Canadian Mounted Police

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.660
to keep order among 3500 Lakota

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.660
which shows how easy it would
have been had it been a different

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.960
policy possible.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.700
But it was the Canadian tribes
who put pressure on the Lakota

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.480
to get the heck out and
eventually the buffalo did run

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.060
out the Lakota were starving
and they eventually had

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.540
to make their way into
the United States.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.450
It's a sad story.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:10.790
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:17.150
&gt;&gt; Hi, I wonder if you could talk
about, again about the five tribes

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:20.150
because their territory
belonged to them.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:24.060
The Indian Wars took
place around them.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.980
The territory of Oklahoma was
left because it belonged to them.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:35.420
They were a strong alliance and
the state of Sequoia was discussed

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:42.840
on the floor of Congress and so
that period I think is less talked

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.380
about by historians
because it's such.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.930
It's not as easy to talk
about it as the Indian Wars

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.520
or what happened east
of the Mississippi.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.820
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Well, right.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.120
&gt;&gt; So, if you could address that.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.420
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Well,

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.200
I'll be rectifying some
of that in my next book.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.800
But, during the period
we're talking about here,

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.990
you know the tribes were
settled in Eastern Oklahoma.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:12.160
None of them lost any land
because of what was happening

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.490
in the Indian Wars, on
the Plains, in the West.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:20.260
They weren't affected
by it directly.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:27.380
Tribes like the Cherokee and
the Chickasaw lost some land

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.740 position:56%
because parts of those tribes fought

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.890
with the Confederacy
during the Civil War

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.330 position:56%
and that's what cost them some land.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:39.410
&gt;&gt; I think [inaudible] and I have
a book coming out on it next year,

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:48.090
was an excuse to open up land to
settlement so I think that it's.

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.390
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Well.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:53.190
&gt;&gt; The end of the Indian Wars
made people aware I think

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.280
that that land was there
and had not been exploited

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.710
by Whites so that's something.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:59.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Cozzens: Well some of that,

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:02.800
the land west of the
five tribes was given

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.300
over to southern Cheyanne,
Kiowa and Comanche.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.920
I am told now to wrap it up.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.750 position:56%
I apologize gentlemen, maybe we can.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.120
If you go down to the
book signing we can chat.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.510
Thank you very, very much and
I'll be signing books downstairs.

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:24.530
[ Applause ]

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:28.160
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
