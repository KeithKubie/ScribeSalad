00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.020
MARK HARVEY: We have Neil
Leonard with us again.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.100
You all heard the great
concert we had on Wednesday.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.610
So we thought we'd
start out just

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.020
by asking if anybody had any
questions or comments based

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.202
or that, that you'd like to ask
the performer while he's here.

00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:44.652
AUDIENCE: Did it go how
you expected it to go?

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:46.610
NEIL LEONARD: I was
pleased with how it worked.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.340
I didn't really-- I
wasn't really sure

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.730
how it would all go.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.970
I kind of had the
basic idea, but there

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.210
was a lot of logistical
stuff to do leading up to it.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.450
I was finishing a piece of
the final piece we pay played.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.610
I'd finished that
week, so I just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.270
had my mind full of
details to take care of.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620
But I was really
pleased at how it went.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.505
And I also was really pleased
because Robin, my collaborator,

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:28.430
was very enthusiastic and
wanted to do it again.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.510
And so, that's kind
of like a goal.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.960
If I do something with
a group of musicians,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.860
to reach the point where people
would want to do it again.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.980
Anybody else?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.170
I think last week I
threatened to make

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.211
everybody ask a question.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.200
AUDIENCE: Usually I feel
like a lot of the technology

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.612
that people use detracts
from the performance,

00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:05.580
but I felt like, definitely,
in this performance

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.509
it added a lot of value to
what the audience was hearing.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.630
NEIL LEONARD: How so?

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.040
AUDIENCE: It allows
one person to create

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.770
so much variety of
sound, and the audience

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.171
was able to here all of
the sound at the same time.

00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:29.105
When you're just
playing by yourself,

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:33.727
there's only so much you can do.

00:02:33.727 --> 00:02:35.102
NEIL LEONARD: I
guess, especially

00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:36.660
if you're playing
a wind instrument.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.580
I was reading a biography
of this really famous sax

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.450
player, Stan Getz.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.620
And he did a recording in,
I'm guessing in the '70s,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.720
with like a echo kind of box.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.420
Things a tape delay.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.080
An analog tape delay.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.725
And he talked about--
the first recording

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:02.980
he made was published,
it sounds wonderful--.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.385
Have you ever heard that, Mark?

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:04.650
MARK HARVEY: Who's the Guy?

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.878
NEIL LEONARD: Stan Getz.

00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:05.030
Playing through the echo.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.290
MARK HARVEY: Yes, I have.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.030
NEIL LEONARD: It's
called "Another World,"

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.680
or something like that.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.590
He plays wonderfully,
but he also

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.980
says that this is a time when,
in the jazz world-- and I think

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.450
that in so-called rock
music, electronics

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.610
were embraced,
and don't really I

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.870
don't remember them
being challenged.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.850
If Pink Floyd , or Jimi Hendrix,
or somebody had synthesizers,

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.510
that just seemed like it was OK.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.010
For jazz musicians, it
seemed like it was somehow

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.290
straying from this
tradition that

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.120
shouldn't be tampered with.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.980
And Stan Getz said that
it felt natural to him.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.330
And it gave him
something to do, which

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.860
you couldn't do with the sax.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.060
You play harmony.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.916
So if he played a delay,
he could play one note,

00:03:56.916 --> 00:03:59.290
and while that note's ringing,
he could play second note,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.140
and make chords, basically.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.930
Which he'd never been
able to do before.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.210
There's also another
instance from around that era

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.310
that caught my attention.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.390
There was a flute
player named Paul Horn.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.640
And he did a recording
at the Taj Mahal.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.640
And I think it was like
this gorilla recording

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.557
where he walked in and
set up his tape deck.

00:04:24.557 --> 00:04:27.140
Now you probably couldn't take
a tape deck into the Taj Mahal.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.240
I'm guessing.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.500
Or into the Vatican.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.847
You'd be screened.

00:04:31.847 --> 00:04:34.430
But he said he pulled the tape
deck out and started to record,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.513
and it was the same thing.

00:04:35.513 --> 00:04:37.400
It is a very, very
long reverberation,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.060
so you can build
harmonic structures

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.260
for the flute, which you
can't do in a room like this

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.070
without the use of electronics.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:55.600
And so, I don't see a
difference between using the Taj

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.800
Mahal to do that, versus
using, like, analog tape delay.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.960
If you get to play chords,
and that's a really fun thing

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.642
to play with, then I want to
experiment playing chords.

00:05:06.642 --> 00:05:08.600
If I can get the Taj
Mahal, I'm happy to get it

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.200
but, I'm not going to bring
the Taj Majal to Killian Hall

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.664
downstairs.

00:05:12.664 --> 00:05:14.080
Whatever I bring
is probably going

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.830
to be some kind of
computer software.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.540
But in principle--

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.370
AUDIENCE: I wasn't
saying like-- I just

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.294
feel that usually things
don't work as expected.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.032
People will bring in things, and
mics won't work, or whatever.

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:34.669
At the end of the
performance, it

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.585
might have been better
if they just played it.

00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:40.214
But in this case, things worked
out the way you wanted them to.

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:45.970
NEIL LEONARD: Not
everything worked perfectly.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:54.220
And I was interested in when
things didn't work perfectly.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.320
It was still a performance,
and if something doesn't work,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.129
you go ahead.

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.920
At one point, I put
the wrong page of music

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.260
in the music stand, so
when we got to that point,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.620
we missed the first Bar.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.810
But I figured, just go ahead.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.480
Don't worry about.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.230
But I also noticed-- and I don't
know if anybody else caught

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.820
this-- but when Robin was
doing the first piece,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.230
he played one piece of
just kind of like delays,

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.260
and just like a wah
wah on trombone.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.120
And then he played
a second piece,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.270
that was-- he started
with a drum pad,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.960
and started looping that, and
knowing some of those rhythms,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.090
I knew that if you don't get
the loop right in the drum--.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.010
You can record it with a kind
of a glitch, which he did.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.510
And he didn't
remember how to delete

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.250
the last thing he recorded.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.550
So you just see, do I go
ahead with this thing,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.960
which is not really perfect?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.910
And at one point
I could just see,

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.870
like, he's just
going to go with it.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.700
And put the rest
of the stuff in,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.545
and start over
dubbing the trombone.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.590
And start playing on top of it.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:09.470
So I could look back and
think of a handful of things

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.457
that, if this is a published
DVD, or published recording,

00:07:12.457 --> 00:07:14.290
you would hope you'd
be able to fix somehow.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.120
Or have another take
of, or whatever.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.896
But I think the wonderful
thing about a live performance

00:07:19.896 --> 00:07:25.730
is, it's like how do you get
out of the situation you're in?

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.060
I've seen sax players,
and their neck strap

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.810
breaks during a solo,
and they keep playing.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.500
Or the snare drum breaks
in the middle of a solo,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.352
and the drummer keeps playing.

00:07:36.352 --> 00:07:38.400
In a recording, you would stop.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.217
But in a performance,
it sort of like

00:07:40.217 --> 00:07:42.050
it was like a basketball
game, or something.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.980
You just can't say, I've
gotta go tie my shoe.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.310
Everybody wait.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.750
You just have to
do it, and that's

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:52.225
a really fascinating kind of
challenge You had a question.

00:07:52.225 --> 00:07:55.250
AUDIENCE: What were you
doing in between solos,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.070
when you're going
up to your computer.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.361
Were you changing variables,
or just playing new loops?

00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:02.590
NEIL LEONARD:
Between the pieces?

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.585
AUDIENCE: No.

00:08:03.585 --> 00:08:04.710
NEIL LEONARD: In the piece?

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.293
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:09.120
NEIL LEONARD: I'm
trying to remember.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.750
In the first piece I played--.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.705
Depends on the piece.

00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:18.030
Sometimes there is
a combination of-- I

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.790
would like to be able to
do everything on the fly,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.485
and if I had four hands I
could do everything on the fly.

00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:27.050
So I could play the
saxophone, and I

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.160
could be in front
of the computer,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.618
and make the computer
do its thing.

00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:33.159
So mentally I think
I could do that, too.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.590
I could set it up so
more hands-on involvement

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.090
with the computer
would be possible,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.214
but I could still play sax.

00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:41.340
But I only have two hands.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.700
And the sax is like the banjo.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.280
Your hands really
have to be there.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.670
You can't really get them
off, and keep playing.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.730
You can't get both of
them off and keep playing.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.829
So some of the music
is created in advance.

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:02.370
So the stuff, which
I think it played

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.100
in class last week--
there's a piece I played

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.933
that was like time
stretch voice and bells--

00:09:05.933 --> 00:09:07.020
we talked about that.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.425
So that is really
kind of a module

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.280
of a piece that's composed.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.067
So a lot of time,
it's like working

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:15.150
in Photoshop or something.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.200
You sit there and you
work, and you work,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.158
and you work in sounds.

00:09:17.158 --> 00:09:20.760
And you see if they
need any modifications.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.350
You see how to combine them.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.490
You kind of get a sense of the
dramatic flow of the piece.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.530
You work it out.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.040
And then you bring that
file to the concert.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.050
And some of that's playback.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.390
So some of it's play back,
and some of it's live.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.800
Anything that sounded like
process saxophone was live.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.190
But if it sounds like
it was voice, then

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.790
that was a vocalist who was
recorded, and then processed,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.830
and then kind of montaged.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.100
So sometimes it was like
triggering the next samples.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.910
I think in the last
piece I played,

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.600
I made the software for
that just that week,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.970
if not a couple days before.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.920
That one I think I managed
to mostly do for the panel.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.637
But if it was
getting squirrelly,

00:10:03.637 --> 00:10:05.220
I may have gone to
the computer to try

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.845
to get it to behave better.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.070
So anything from just
triggering files,

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.960
to kind of a small adjustments
to keep it all reined in.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.250
AUDIENCE: So when you
were playing the pieces,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.770
I actually thought that some
of the process saxophone

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.850
was recorded.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.530
As I was watching
your foot and seen

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.040
when you pressed the pedal.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.182
And it looked like the
pedal did lots of-- I

00:10:30.182 --> 00:10:32.140
initially expected the
pedal would be something

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.725
simple, like the
pedal adds the delay.

00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:36.725
But the pedal caused so
many different effects

00:10:36.725 --> 00:10:38.855
that I assumed some of
the saxophone effects

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:41.890
has been pre-recorded and the
pedal was playing them back.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.570
What exactly did you
program the pedal to do?

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.300
NEIL LEONARD: The pedal just
sends a signal to the computer.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.720
So it's kind of like a mouse.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.560
It, by itself, is really simple.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.970
You can read the switches
from the computer.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.580
But the way the computer
is set up to respond,

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.250
the way I set it up in a concert
to respond to the footwork

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.672
work, was fairly
straightforward.

00:11:06.672 --> 00:11:08.970
The computer does three
things to the sax.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:17.170
It will do different
kinds of delays.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.580
And the delays
will-- maybe when we

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.450
get through, if you're
still interested,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.200
I could show how the
delay stuff works,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:36.200
but-- the delay
business works two ways.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.600
One is, it makes an echo.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.810
And the second thing it does, if
you think about the early tape

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:49.014
delays, they have a tape
loop, that just rotated.

00:11:49.014 --> 00:11:50.680
The tape loop was
played, and then there

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.920
were different playback
heads, to play it back

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.370
at different points.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.850
So you have one record
head, and then you

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.750
have multiple playback
heads that can be moved.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.060
And if you move,
they kind of echo.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.550
The ricochet kind of effect.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:18.400
The echo effect changes from
like [MIMING ECHO EFFECT]

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.370
You can change those
echoes where there on time.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:26.390
If you move the
playback head, it's

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.530
also a changing the speed
that its reading the tape.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.265
So if you have a note which
is [MAKES NOTE SOUND].

00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:35.960
And the tape is going like this.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.320
And you move the
playback head this way,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.890
you're going to get
glissando [MAKES NOTE SOUND]

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.090
Because you're increasing the
speed at which the tape is

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.690
passing over the playback head.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.860
If you move it the
other way, it goes down.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.900
So in the digital world,
you can get that, too.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:59.590
So, the delays are kind of
modeling a tape delay system.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.650
You can speed up, while you're
sort of moving the playback

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.630
heads, you get
pitch consequences.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.295
Or kind of result in glassindos,
or glassindi, as well.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.490
The other, third
thing which makes

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.410
the delay business
complicated, is there's

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.350
a foot pedal which--
not everything's

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.520
going to delay-- which
changes things radically.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.370
So if you play a phrase,
and at the end of the phrase

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:38.050
you feed more of
that into the delay,

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.790
it kind of accentuates
that one thing.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.720
Sort of like a sustained
pedal on a piano.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.470
If you put it down for
half of the phrase,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.560
but not the rest of the
phrase, one part of the phrase

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.420
has this accentuation, or this
effect, that the rest of it

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.110
doesn't have.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.310
And that can be a
tremendous, dramatic change.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.060
But to keep it short,
there's a delay.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:04.960
There is kind of like
a pitch bend idea.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.590
There is a flute player
you guys might have heard,

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.230
a gun named Robert Dick,
who made a glissando

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.250
head for the flute.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:19.250
And the way it works is,
it slides in and out.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:24.700
So you play a note, and
there's a thumb thing.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.180
And use this thumb thing,
lever, whatever it is,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.210
to make this head joint slide.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.149
So I think that the blow
hole's not changing,

00:14:33.149 --> 00:14:35.315
but I think something on
this side of the head joint

00:14:35.315 --> 00:14:35.815
is changing.

00:14:35.815 --> 00:14:37.856
So the glissando flute.

00:14:37.856 --> 00:14:38.981
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:40.980
NEIL LEONARD: Is it the
mouth piece that slides?

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.580
I've never actually seen one.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.330
OK.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.820
So I wanted to do that
with the saxophone,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.372
but I resorted to doing
it electronically.

00:14:55.372 --> 00:14:57.080
I wanted, like if
there was a harmonizer,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.490
there are three voices
playing in harmony.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.100
I wanted those three
pages all to be variable,

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.690
so they could
slide in real time.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.600
And I had particular ways in
which I like to slide them.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.557
But sometimes you
heard a harmony,

00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:13.140
and it sounded like
there was a whammy

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.580
bar, or sort of a glissando.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.350
I built like a harmonizer with
a glissando mechanism in it.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.232
And so, the second one.

00:15:23.232 --> 00:15:24.690
And the third one
is really simple.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.650
I don't use it as much.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.680
Actually, there's four
things I've been doing.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.640
The third one was just
a random looping thing.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.540
It's like so the
random cut and paste.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.600
So I'd play something
into the computer,

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.710
and it takes snippets of
that, and kind of like

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.950
feeds them back, or
replays them in sort

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.840
of an arbitrary
fashion a real time.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.300
So it doesn't sound like a
beat-oriented looping effect.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.150
It's just sending
back fragments of what

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.830
you played in a kind
of unpredictable way.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:02.986
So you get a kind of a
stochastic re-compositon,

00:16:02.986 --> 00:16:04.860
or re-improvisiation of
something you played.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.901
That was the third thing.

00:16:05.901 --> 00:16:08.540
AUDIENCE: The final
one, I just figured out

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:16.180
a couple days for the concert,
was a kind of freeze effect.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.830
It's using anybody's intel,
like audio engineering.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.860
It's using fast Fourier
transforms, which basically

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.430
take a snapshot of
the sound, in terms

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.630
of the pitches that
are in the sound.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.540
Remember when we looked at that
piece of software last week?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.200
We took, I think
a trombone sample,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.430
I think that's what we had.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.900
And then we were stretching
, and we were cutting it up,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.230
and playing with it.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.600
So for software like that, you
can take a so-called frame,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.960
we'll say it's a
24th of a second,

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.730
and do a spectral analysis
of that 24th of a second.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.010
And then freeze it.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:09.569
Just play those frequencies
in the frequency domain,

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:10.410
and just hold it.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.079
And so I have, I think
eight of those going.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.740
And every time I
hit a peddle, you

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.270
freeze another instance in time.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.069
So the idea was twofold.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.579
One was to, again, to
build up harmonies.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.740
So every time I had a not
that I wanted to freeze,

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.500
I'd hit the peddle, and
that gets sustained.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.530
But then there was kind
of a poetic idea, which

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.950
is really sort of pun in a way.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.230
But the song I
playing was playing

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.688
is a song called,
"Round Midnight."

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:38.920
It's very slow, and
very kind of somber.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.520
And I thought this idea
also fit with that song,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.390
because it's like stillness.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.410
The song is quiet,
slow, still, and this

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.480
would make it extremely still,
because it freezes things.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.930
So I played around a
little bit with that.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.550
So those were the things that
you could do with the sax.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.150
It's actually quite
a bit of stuff.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:07.100
And when you think of it, when
you think of what guitarists

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.830
like Jimi Hendrix used, he
didn't have that much stuff.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:14.370
He had like fuzz box,
he had wah wah pedal.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.390
And maybe like one more thing.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.750
I'm not a guitar
effects connoisseur.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.900
There isn't a lot of stuff,
but it changes the guitar

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.420
completely.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.530
So I'm finding
that I, too, don't

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.860
need lots and lots of stuff.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.270
In fact, the fewer things you
have to use to process the sax,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.270
the easier it is, because
there's not that many choices.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.660
So you still think
you're playing

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.880
the sax, with a few, fairly
straight forward things

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.310
you can vary.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.810
So that's sort of,
I think for Robin

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.240
and myself, soft
of the inspiration.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.614
We found guitar players
modifying the guitar,

00:18:52.614 --> 00:18:54.530
we think, well, why can't
we do that, as well?

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.202
So, we can.

00:18:56.202 --> 00:19:02.210
We can do it without an
extensive background.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.440
Robin does not have an extensive
music technology background--

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.910
or with a different,
more evolved background

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.270
in music technology,
which I have.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.477
And both of them will work.

00:19:14.477 --> 00:19:16.560
In the case of Robin, he's
such a good trombonist,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.030
and improviser, that you
give me a couple things,

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.060
and he does great stuff with it.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:30.280
Those were some of the
things I was playing around

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.427
with, or using the computer to
do, to extend the performance.

00:19:34.427 --> 00:19:36.760
MARK HARVEY: Let me shift so
we can get our projects in,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.426
and if people have
questions at the end,

00:19:38.426 --> 00:19:41.860
we will hopefully
have time for that.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.790
So we have our teams again.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.710
And so, what I think
we should do is,

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.360
Neil will help with
logistics, if you

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.730
want to set up a computer,
or whatever you have.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.160
So we should just go.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.190
And the team should
just say a little bit

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:00.550
about what it is your idea
is, and then enact it.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.490
So who would like to go first?

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.240
AUDIENCE: So me and Brian,
we both recorded sounds

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:05.740
separately.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.010
I recorded sounds in
my kitchen, and made it

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.090
sort of like a
sound stage thing.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.110
And then, Brian recorded
some guitar sounds,

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.440
and other sounds he found
[? at the bakery ?],

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.650
and he put on them on this
little mini board, which

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.052
you can play different
sounds and stuff.

00:20:22.052 --> 00:20:23.593
So I'm using Ableton
Live [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.175
MARK HARVEY: Did you come up
with a design, or a framework,

00:20:39.175 --> 00:20:42.840
or is it just going to
be sort of spontaneous?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.190
AUDIENCE: The framework
is the kitchen sounds

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:51.690
kind of form a beat, and we're
going to be going around that.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:21:00.875
[MUSIC SOUNDS] I recorded
most of the sounds here.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.280
We'll just go into
some of the sounds.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.340
One was my lamp
switching on and off.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.780
Another is my
guitar feeding back.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.420
Another is an
effects pedal that I

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.545
have that does some
really wacky pitch shifts

00:21:16.545 --> 00:21:18.300
and dive bombs, essentially.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.970
And mine, I was banging
on random things.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.514
And then I used a
harpoon growler as a jug.

00:21:29.514 --> 00:21:31.502
And some other things.

00:21:31.502 --> 00:21:32.993
I forgot everything.

00:21:32.993 --> 00:21:33.987
Bottle caps.

00:21:33.987 --> 00:22:09.768
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:09.768 --> 00:23:26.210
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.655
NEIL LEONARD: That was cool.

00:23:31.655 --> 00:23:34.685
It sounded like a
voice, that last thing.

00:23:34.685 --> 00:23:36.560
AUDIENCE: Yes, that
actually was my voice.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.950
NEIL LEONARD: You've
got new careers.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.430
Very coo.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.100
AUDIENCE: So we recorded
sounds just on an iPad.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.210
And then, put them on there.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.402
And we're just
playing everything.

00:23:50.402 --> 00:23:54.290
About eight different tracks,
[INAUDIBLE], no data tape.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.845
And we're just going to be
looping those all the time,

00:23:56.845 --> 00:23:58.178
on different tracks, on and off.

00:23:58.178 --> 00:24:00.608
And then, I'm going to briefly
play the piano, at the start.

00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:02.108
And then just come
and control this.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.680
MARK HARVEY: What
are the sounds?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.594
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:24:08.594 --> 00:24:10.219
It's sort of more
ambiance, rather than

00:24:10.219 --> 00:24:12.752
snippets of sound bites.

00:24:12.752 --> 00:24:15.674
It's sorta like
longer recordings.

00:24:15.674 --> 00:24:18.324
It's like a shower.

00:24:18.324 --> 00:24:18.990
MARK HARVEY: OK.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.478
Shower type of--

00:24:20.478 --> 00:24:22.462
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:22.462 --> 00:24:26.430
You can figure
out what sort of--

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.414
MARK HARVEY: So
it's a challenge.

00:24:28.414 --> 00:24:32.878
We've got to figure out
what the sounds are.

00:24:45.278 --> 00:29:05.544
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:05.544 --> 00:29:10.514
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:10.514 --> 00:29:12.850
Did you have that
ending worked out?

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.840
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.245
That was actually a
recording of a door creaking,

00:29:18.245 --> 00:29:21.598
that had some pitch to it.

00:29:21.598 --> 00:29:25.085
So we decided to use that.

00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:25.585
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:33.620
MARK HARVEY: Very interesting.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.900
Very interesting.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.190
Let's give a round of
applause, first of all.

00:29:42.682 --> 00:29:45.720
AUDIENCE: I think a
lot of the other groups

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.280
had some mixed background noise
that they recorded, and then

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.110
improvised with their
instruments on top of that.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.460
And I was feeling a
little sick, and didn't

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.070
want to play my
trumpet, so I took

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.700
sort of complimentary approach.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.600
The sounds I recorded
will be the improvisation.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.380
So I went around my dorm and
recorded 15 different sounds.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.455
And then wrote a Python
script that sort of generates

00:30:07.455 --> 00:30:10.190
a random way to
play these sounds.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.940
So at different sections of the
song, like at the beginning,

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.495
it only picks from
a certain number

00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:16.830
of these sounds, all of
which sound like fans.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.352
At the beginning, it's
like a fan and AC,

00:30:19.352 --> 00:30:20.560
a few other things like that.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.200
And then as it progresses, it
adds on more of these sounds.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.500
I have a little solo
section in the middle.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.850
We'll even hear a couple
of appliances, and noises.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.790
Big solos, and then it
goes out to some ending.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:40.320
So the direction of
the piece is planned,

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.670
but exactly what sound
is played, and when,

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.790
and for how long,
all that is randomly

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.350
generated each time we play it.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:33:21.405
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:21.405 --> 00:33:25.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.350
MARK HARVEY: So
it's your program

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.650
that's doing the improvising?

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:29.233
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:29.233 --> 00:33:32.200
MARK HARVEY: Very interesting.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.936
AUDIENCE: So to answer the
other question, what it will do

00:33:34.936 --> 00:33:37.890
is, it will play a sound,
play random sounds,

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.730
wait for a random
amount of time,

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.130
and then play another sound.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.406
Sometimes it waits until
the sound is finished,

00:33:43.406 --> 00:33:44.280
sometimes it doesn't.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.694
So that it can be positive,
that can be restive,

00:33:46.694 --> 00:33:48.110
and there can also
be two or three

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.240
sounds playing at the same time.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.260
The only thing, I put the solos
so there was never two solos

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.310
playing at the same time.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.360
And I made sure that each
solo was played once.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.860
But otherwise, all
the other sounds,

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.156
you have multiple [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:08.360
Yes I had the dishwasher sounds
not play until the very end.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.510
And I closed the
dishwasher a few times

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.080
until I got a nice satisfying
crash and recorded that.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.699
MARK HARVEY: Did
you break anything?

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.000
OK next contestants.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:27.409
AUDIENCE: We
recorded five sounds.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:31.450
A door closing, someone typing
on the keyboard, a pencil

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:35.160
scratching, a zipper, and
a microwave turning on.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.790
I assigned them to different
keys on the keyboard, here.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.280
So I'm going to make a
beat with these noises,

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.440
with these sounds,
while they improvise.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.097
MARK HARVEY: Did you say a beat?

00:34:53.097 --> 00:34:53.722
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:53.722 --> 00:34:56.650
So I'm using them
mostly as percussion.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:04.830
So the sounds were things
that I [INAUDIBLE] homework,

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.952
so I guess that is our theme.

00:35:12.892 --> 00:35:14.374
MARK HARVEY: Homework?

00:35:14.374 --> 00:35:18.326
AUDIENCE: Like you got
the drone or a beat

00:35:18.326 --> 00:35:22.278
or just melody or
some [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:22.278 --> 00:35:24.748
Whatever you want to do.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:38:17.132
[MUSIC PLAYING

00:38:17.132 --> 00:38:23.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.190
MARK HARVEY: So given that's
a sort of existential homework

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.010
moment, what time
of the day or night

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.992
would you project
that to be happening?

00:38:29.992 --> 00:38:31.237
AUDIENCE: After I just ate.

00:38:31.237 --> 00:38:32.570
MARK HARVEY: After you just ate.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:38.820
Very cool.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.050
Very cool.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.120
OK.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.000
Another group.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.785
AUDIENCE: Each of us
had a different idea

00:38:59.785 --> 00:39:02.455
that was discussed
in class last time.

00:39:02.455 --> 00:39:04.455
I think we tried all the
ideas, and none of them

00:39:04.455 --> 00:39:06.910
really worked, because we didn't
have good enough recording

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.451
equipment, and we
weren't good enough

00:39:08.451 --> 00:39:11.350
at using that recording
equipment to effectively do

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.240
anything.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:24.264
So we decided on a--
[INAUDIBLE] So you

00:39:24.264 --> 00:39:25.805
might recognize some
of these Sounds.

00:39:32.342 --> 00:39:35.600
We found a sound
board on the internet.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.826
Unfortunately it's
mono-phonic, so the amount

00:39:37.826 --> 00:39:39.700
of stuff we could do is
a little bit limited.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.470
We were planning on
using this sound [PING]

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.255
as a sort of reset button
for between the sections.

00:40:14.125 --> 00:44:19.200
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:52.109
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:52.109 --> 00:45:00.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.590
MARK HARVEY: Good.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:02.090
Good.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:03.590
That the idea.

00:45:06.442 --> 00:45:08.960
AUDIENCE: I don't
feel so guilty saying

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.495
that at times I was
trying to make you

00:45:12.495 --> 00:45:13.980
guys feel uncomfortable.

00:46:31.012 --> 00:51:07.696
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:07.696 --> 00:51:13.962
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:13.962 --> 00:51:15.670
MARK HARVEY: Thanks
for the extra effort.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:19.482
That was actually fascinating
to watch you do all that stuff.

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:29.730
Neil, do you want to
just make a few comments,

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:31.310
or whatever you want to do.

00:51:33.422 --> 00:51:35.880
NEIL LEONARD: How many people
have done something like this

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.340
before?

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.990
Anybody?

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:41.720
And suddenly you've
done Ableton Live.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.810
And how many people
have done Ableton Live?

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:44.740
One, two.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.611
So, what have you done
with Ableton Live before?

00:51:47.611 --> 00:51:51.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Just
learning how to use it.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.665
I really haven't
been that into it,

00:51:54.665 --> 00:51:58.881
because I feel very limited,
because I haven't actually

00:51:58.881 --> 00:51:59.880
bought the full version.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.550
NEIL LEONARD: So you're
starting to use it now?

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:01.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.588
NEIL LEONARD: OK.

00:52:02.588 --> 00:52:03.214
Just curious.

00:52:03.214 --> 00:52:05.442
AUDIENCE: In the
past, though, I worked

00:52:05.442 --> 00:52:08.200
with Serato Scratch
Live, though.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.276
Actually, I use that for DJ'ing.

00:52:11.276 --> 00:52:12.160
NEIL LEONARD: OK.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:15.585
Yes, but in terms
of-- when I asked

00:52:15.585 --> 00:52:17.710
the question of how many
of you have done something

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:23.405
like this live, what
I'm wondering about

00:52:23.405 --> 00:52:26.710
is how many people have
recorded sounds on their own,

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:30.090
and used them in a
musical performance?

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:32.799
You have?

00:52:32.799 --> 00:52:33.465
For composition.

00:52:33.465 --> 00:52:34.280
OK.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.550
And performance is a
little bit different,

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:37.216
but it's a little bit
the same, as well.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:46.390
It is really interesting to
hear what you guys came up with,

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.370
not knowing you very well.

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:50.680
With my Berkeley
students, I always

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.860
feel like, when they bring
in their assignments,

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.159
it sounds so much like them.

00:52:55.159 --> 00:52:56.950
But I have a longer
time to work with them.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:02.150
So I can make some
more connections.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:11.220
One of the things that came
up in watching you perform,

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:23.120
is where is the value
in doing something

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.370
you haven't done before, or
something that you may not

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:26.750
be comfortable with?

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:31.590
As a sort of
experimental adventure.

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:37.800
And when I listen to Sarah,
and Ben's and James's piece,

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.790
one of the things which
seems to be interesting,

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:46.321
is that you guys didn't really
know where it was going to go.

00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:48.070
You didn't know where
it was going to end.

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:50.970
You said, that's not
quite what we rehearsed.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:54.300
And that can be a
really wonderful thing.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:59.070
Because the opposite is-- when
I played the concert that you

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:01.430
saw, if it happened
exactly the way

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:10.270
it happened a time before,
or happened every time,

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:13.560
you run the risk
of the spark dying.

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.380
So the excitement of
the performance-- kind

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.980
of like rigor mortis sets in.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.470
The spontaneity goes
away, and the spark.

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:24.440
The excitement for
the performer can

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.730
be linked to the spontaneity.

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:28.345
And you lose the excitement
for the performer,

00:54:28.345 --> 00:54:29.410
and the spontaneity.

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:30.910
So when you guys
were playing didn't

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:34.410
know where it was going
to go, I thought, well,

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:38.250
that's actually a good
thing to just bring up.

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:39.905
Because that's the
desired effect.

00:54:39.905 --> 00:54:42.380
And it's a struggle
for the improviser, who

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:47.020
plays for decades, to keep
the thing feeling fresh.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:52.980
I know for me, there
are things you can do.

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.695
I guess it's like when
you're performing,

00:54:54.695 --> 00:54:57.650
and you're distracted, or
you're just not really--.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.510
What I'm getting at is,
for me the performances

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:07.630
are the least satisfying when
one of two thing happens.

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:12.060
Either I can't relax,
and get in the play.

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.820
So if it's a concert,
like with Robin,

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.550
for example, if I feel for
any reason uncomfortable,

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:22.090
if the challenge of it
kinda psych's me out,

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.392
or I don't think I know
the music well enough,

00:55:25.392 --> 00:55:27.225
and I start to play,
and all of a sudden you

00:55:27.225 --> 00:55:31.670
feel that tension, that anxiety
of trying to get to the music.

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:34.450
It's not like a stage fright,
it's not like a performance

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.182
anxiety, but you feel
like you're forcing it.

00:55:37.182 --> 00:55:38.890
And once you feel like
you're forcing it,

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:42.100
in a performance of
improvised music,

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:45.600
you begin to lose a
little bit of control.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.200
And then the other
thing is if I feel like,

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.180
oh I just played what
I played yesterday.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.380
I did what I knew
I could do easily.

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.220
Then you don't
discover anything new.

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.420
And I think that what's kind
of fundamental in improvisation

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.450
is this feeling that you're
discovering something new.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:04.390
Even if small things
are new, but you

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:08.905
keeping that little bit
of the activity alive.

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.460
Doing something which is
not necessarily comfortable

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:24.230
or not something
you've done before

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:28.020
can sometimes turn
into a big gain.

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.240
The other things I was
thinking about with that piece

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.760
are-- At first I was
thinking I wanted everybody

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.980
to record yourself.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:51.520
And then you guys,
Sarah, James, and Ben,

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.529
at first I was a
little bit concerned,

00:56:54.529 --> 00:56:57.070
because you just grabbed some
sounds from the computer, which

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.050
I told you not to do.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.120
But the thing which I
thought worked really well

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:05.470
is, we have such a visceral
connection to those sounds.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:09.350
They have a tremendous
meaning for us.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:12.350
They give us knee
jerk responses,

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:16.300
Like if my cell phone is
in inadvertently right now.

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:20.270
And I hear a text message sound,
all of a sudden I kind of jump.

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.680
My body reacts like I
have to do something.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.490
So those sounds have a
tremendous kind of power.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:31.050
And we have very
important associations,

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:32.920
strong associations,
with those sounds.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.419
So they're totally loaded, and
the way you played with them,

00:57:35.419 --> 00:57:37.362
I thought was
really, really fun.

00:57:37.362 --> 00:57:39.420
I think that the
Windows operating system

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:42.770
is more musical than the Mac.

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:43.280
Side note.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.690
I'm just putting out
some ideas that I

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.880
was thinking about
listening to everybody play.

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.320
The other thing
I was thinking of

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:01.980
is-- and this is also very
true in Austin's piece--

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.157
is that working with computers.

00:58:05.157 --> 00:58:06.740
Computers are not
nearly as responsive

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.870
as a flute, a
violin, as a trumpet.

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:12.510
You're making music
with your index finger.

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:15.190
You're not using your whole arm.

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:16.850
You're not using your mouth.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:19.730
You're not using your breathing.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:21.440
You're not even
using your hands.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.560
Are using your index finger.

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:24.800
You're moving and clicking.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:32.510
But I'm also in my
own work, interested

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:35.920
in the resistance
of the materials.

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:39.380
So, the computer
is totally limited.

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.647
Or this assignment I gave you.

00:58:40.647 --> 00:58:42.980
Make a performance, it's going
to be three minutes long.

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:44.313
You only have a week to make it.

00:58:44.313 --> 00:58:46.440
You're going to record
sounds in your own.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:50.210
Right there it limits what
you can do quite a bit.

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:55.120
But when an artist is
presented with limitations,

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.590
it's amazing to see what
artists come up with.

00:58:57.590 --> 00:58:59.430
So the resistance
of the materials

00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:01.060
takes you someplace new.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:04.344
So for example, I'm
reviewing a piece of music

00:59:04.344 --> 00:59:06.010
which is very difficult
to improvise on.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:08.630
A very complicated
set of chord changes.

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:09.710
I tried the other day.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:12.240
I'm just going to play
with my left hand.

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.790
The metronome was fast,
the harmonic progressions

00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:15.552
really hard.

00:59:15.552 --> 00:59:17.510
I'm playing the same
thing over and over again.

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:19.670
I'm finding my rut.

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:21.753
So what if I just play
with my left hand?

00:59:21.753 --> 00:59:23.350
And I tried that for while.

00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:25.290
And all of a sudden, I felt
like I'm getting out of my rut,

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:27.123
because I had to think
about it differently.

00:59:27.123 --> 00:59:29.970
I had to find new things
that I could do this hand.

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:31.890
Put them both back
into play again,

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:33.520
and it feels like it's fresh.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:40.000
So the idea of doing this
very short exercise that

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:47.110
uses this kind of rigid,
somewhat unresponsive tool,

00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:51.340
to make music, has
historically produced

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:55.170
some really interesting
things that we haven't got out

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:58.795
of the previous
concert music practice.

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:05.450
So those are just some of
things I was thinking about.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.680
I think if we were
to do this again--

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.420
if this was a four unit
class, of if this was Berkeley

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:22.860
and you were doing this
as your thesis project--

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:27.050
I think the kind of challenges
I found in the last two pieces

01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.060
would be very interesting
to continue to explore.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.010
So what about when you've
overextended yourself.

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:38.360
And you're playing some
piano, and some violin,

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.600
and some computer.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.890
Or in my case-- you heard
me in Killian hall--

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:45.232
I'm doing delay effects, and
I'm playing back samples,

01:00:45.232 --> 01:00:46.315
and I'm playing saxophone.

01:00:46.315 --> 01:00:49.710
And I'm beginning to
overextend myself.

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:53.430
It's an interesting
problem, and the solutions

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:55.622
you found-- it was wonderful
to watch you trying

01:00:55.622 --> 01:00:57.330
to grapple with that
problem, and come up

01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.850
with some very
interesting solutions.

01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:04.630
And I am also very
keen on this idea of,

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:06.750
is there a set of
sounds that you

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.995
can find that have a
really special quality?

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.210
When you hear Glenn Gould
play the Goldberg variations

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:23.380
on piano-- and the aria
of the Goldberg variations

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:28.970
is a very, very simple piece--
and he just sounds phenomenal.

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:30.170
He's playing quarter notes.

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:33.102
It's just mind boggling
good, and he has barely

01:01:33.102 --> 01:01:34.060
even started the piece.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.520
This is amazing.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.760
It's the way he plays.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.000
But I guess that's the next
question I have for you guys.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.570
Are there particular
sounds that you

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:45.700
hear that would be a
good start to a piece?

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.420
That just have that kind
of mesmerizing effect.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.170
And they're not
necessarily music.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.270
I think with the Windows
operating system piece,

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:56.350
you also had the
advantage of some

01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:59.610
of those micro compositions.

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:00.922
Like [MAKES NOTE SOUNDS].

01:02:00.922 --> 01:02:01.630
Whatever that is.

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:04.260
That's like the shut down
sound, or the boot up sound,

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.106
or something.

01:02:05.106 --> 01:02:07.230
Like there are already kind
of audio jingles, which

01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:10.147
have been very, very
carefully created.

01:02:10.147 --> 01:02:11.480
And we've heard them many times.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.200
They have tremendous
meaning for us.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.060
But are there sounds that you
hear in the world around you,

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.390
that would make a really
good beginning of a piece.

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:20.790
Let's just forget the
whole piece for now.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.540
Let's just say the
beginning of the piece.

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.248
Something that would
be fantastic to hear

01:02:24.248 --> 01:02:24.980
at the beginning.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.855
That would be an
interesting thing to pursue.

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:37.620
I'm trying to remember the
other solo artist in this group.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.800
Jacob, right?

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:46.425
Jacob, where I would like
to see that work go is,

01:02:46.425 --> 01:02:49.000
is there a way that you
can share the improvisation

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.750
with the computer?

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:53.990
So you created a
piece of software

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:57.990
that basically automates an
idea about improvisation.

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:01.326
You have an idea of how
the sounds could play.

01:03:01.326 --> 01:03:02.950
Sometimes they play
together, Sometimes

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:03.870
there's silence between them.

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.050
Sometimes there's 3 over 1.

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:07.150
Sometimes they're dove
tailing were overlapping.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.380
Sometimes they're not.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:12.660
Is there a way to
extend that so you

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.950
are a physical participant
in the improvisation,

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:19.849
and the computer is
playing a disembodied you.

01:03:19.849 --> 01:03:21.390
Because basically
what it's doing now

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:22.473
is like a disembodied you.

01:03:22.473 --> 01:03:27.850
It's your idea implemented
as a program that

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:30.640
will execute your idea.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.940
Is there a way to
have two of you?

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.970
The virtual you, which is what
we heard, and the you present.

01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:40.380
So, I'm a teacher, so
I'm always thinking

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.360
for my own students,
what do I do

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.730
to get everybody
to the next step?

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:45.950
Because we're never done.

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:47.220
I study all the time.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.270
I try to learn new stuff.

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:48.340
I could tell you all about that.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.140
We don't have the time.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:53.920
But I'm always thinking for
you guys, what's the next step?

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:55.920
And I think that
for Jacob's work,

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.090
that would be a next step.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.290
I'll just try to
touch on one more.

01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:05.765
Alex, Chelsea, and Chris's,
the homework theme.

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:15.470
I guess, if you hadn't
told me it was homework.

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:18.470
I might have been able to
distinguish it from the others.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.770
But I love the idea of homework.

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:24.410
And what moment
of homework would

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:26.280
be really great to zero in on.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.170
It's so rich.

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:29.790
Is it like procrastination?

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:34.500
The feeling that you
learned something new?

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.669
The anxiety of, oh, no
I've got Neil's assignment,

01:04:37.669 --> 01:04:39.460
it's due in and hour
and I haven't started.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:44.240
There's all kinds of ways
to think about homework.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:48.880
And it's such a central
part of your lives.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.160
What could you do to
take that another step?

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.400
I think it's a great theme.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.120
And what could you
do to distinguish it

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.320
from all the other
works we heard?

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.940
So I think that, in short,
all these pieces are really

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.510
wonderful beginnings.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:10.210
And I don't think any
of these beginnings

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:12.730
is more or less
valuable than any other.

01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:15.900
But I guess my bias
is thinking, if we

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:19.150
were to continue this,
what would be a next step

01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:21.950
to engage in.

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:26.899
To take the same ideas and
develop them a little bit more?

01:05:26.899 --> 01:05:28.440
MARK HARVEY: Great
thank you so much.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:28.933
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:28.933 --> 01:05:29.933
NEIL LEONARD: Thank you.

01:05:29.933 --> 01:05:33.753
It was great to hear your work,
and good to talk to you guys

01:05:33.753 --> 01:05:34.360
about it.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.850
MARK HARVEY: Great
job everybody.

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:37.980
Very interesting The
only things I would add

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:42.210
is that I was interested how
much the percussive element

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:44.240
came out in a lot
of people's pieces.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.930
Percussive sounds, the
way you've arranged them,

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.150
and also how the live
instrumentals played with that.

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.050
And actually, very
little silence.

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:54.770
There were a couple pieces that
had more silence than others,

01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:56.790
but interesting to
think about that.

01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:59.200
So again, more things
to keep in mind.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.292
NEIL LEONARD: The Windows
piece had great silence.

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:02.000
MARK HARVEY: Yeah

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.900
NEIL LEONARD: And I
think the performers

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.499
are kept on edge with that.

01:06:05.499 --> 01:06:07.040
MARK HARVEY: It kept
the audience on.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.310
I didn't know what was going on.

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:12.340
OK, so please send in
just a little statement

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.860
about what this was,
this project today.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.420
And your concert reflection
on Neil's concert.

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.320
And we'll see you Wednesday for
something completely different.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.560
Thank you, thank you.
