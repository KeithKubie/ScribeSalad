00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.649
 Hello, my YouTube subscribers! 

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.890
 The relationship between you and me is a bit complicated. You may think that this relationship is only for you and me. 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.630
 I am responsible for making the film for you but actually there are three parties. 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.460
 And in order for you to see my video, you need to reach three conditions: 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.500
 I have to make a film 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 (It took me a lot of time...) 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.600
 2. I have to upload the video somewhere for a lot of considerations somewhere is YouTube. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.029
 3. You must be told that I uploaded the video. 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.279
 The internet is a huge space and it is easy to miss what 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.000
 The last condition must be: Why do you want to be my subscriber? 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.500
 Why are you looking at my film? 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.100
 But I heard a lot of people responding to the news from the new film and not sending it very surely. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.650
 Now I don't want to say anything about who's face, but it's really a YouTube issue. 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.300
 I don’t know why, they can’t receive the message every time for a while. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 As far as my last film was concerned, I suddenly encountered some major technical problems in collecting audience feedback. 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.600
 This random problem has been around for a long time. 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.600
 Not as perfect as a subscription system 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.320
 YouTube has taken the Facebook approach, which is where YouTube picks the movie you want to watch. 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.000
 Instead of just showing the videos you subscribe to 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.600
 Therefore, some of the videos you subscribe to will be hidden by God because of "commercial considerations." 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 Resulting in a "subscription" becoming more like a suggestion than a request 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.000
 Besides, I can't talk directly to you face to face. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.300
 But YouTube can do it at any time without any reason, even if it can turn off the video channel directly. 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.340
 This is really a big power. I hope that YouTube will not threaten it when negotiating with the film owners. 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.400
 In short, I came up with a very crazy and technologically sound solution: E-mail 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.200
 Well, seriously, I know that E-mail feels very lacking in the sense of technology in the post-industrial era. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.820
 But this method has been tested by thousands of people and is in good condition. 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.229
 If you want to always receive the button on the top left of the notification point of my uploaded video, enter your email address. 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.600
 I can let you know that it’s great every time I finish the movie. 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.780
 And we no longer need YouTube as a pigeon 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.000
 Email makes you and my relationship straightforward and clear 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.499
 I spent a lot of time thinking about how to do the best for you. 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:59.000
 Click the left button to know 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.000
 Are you still watching? I don't understand why... 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 What should I say? 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.600
 I thought about the relationship between the creator and the audience for a while. 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.000
 I wrote an article here. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 In addition, on the Potcast, I discussed this topic with co-host Brady. I can click here and here. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.460
 If you are interested, you can also open these things. 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.600
 (still in a daze?) 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.000
 Um... it’s a bit awkward, so I’m going to end the movie. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.600
 seriously
