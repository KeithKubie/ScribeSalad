00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.620
As someone who's married to a
doctor, in the medical field,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.430
I think it's pretty important
to have a precise understanding

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.530
of what the words mean, just
so that you can understand what

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.863
people are talking about if
either you are a health care

00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:15.150
professional or if some health
care professional is talking

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.110
to you, as my wife does
when, well, sometimes does,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.960
when she comes home from work.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.790
So let's get a little bit more
precise with some of the words

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.050
we've been talking about,
especially relative to heart

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.850
disease and heart failure
and all of the rest.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.550
So let's say this is an artery.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.230
The blood is flowing
in that direction.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.060
I'll show the artery
branching off.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.940
It thins as it goes
farther and farther along.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.600
So this right here is an artery.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.870
And let me draw a
plaque in that artery.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.590
And we've been
studying these plaques

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.280
in arteries since the
video on heart attacks.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.750
So let's say that this is a
bunch of white blood cells

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.390
and lipid material.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.970
So it's cholesterol and
fats and all the rest.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.370
Now a word that you might hear
in kind of a medical context

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.053
is stenosis.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.020
And the word "stenosis" just
refers to the narrowing,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.480
usually of a blood vessel.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.830
So this right here, this blood
vessel has been narrowed.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.040
So this right over
here is stenosis.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.060
It's been narrowed
by this plaque.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.920
It can also refer
to the narrowing

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.050
of kind of any type
of tubular structure.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.000
So if you have any type of kind
of pipe in a biological system

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.350
and it gets narrow, they
might refer to stenosis there.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.391
But usually they're talking
about a blood vessel.

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:32.390
In this example that I've
drawn here it's an artery.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.260
So the stenosis is
just the narrowing.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.320
Now once the blood
vessel is narrowed,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.060
that restricts the blood supply.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.570
So you aren't able to get
as much blood through it.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.500
So the blood supply
is restricted.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.080
So restricted blood supply.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.560
Put the I there.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.000
Restricted blood supply.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.050
This restriction
of a blood supply

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.980
that usually leads
to some type of loss

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.380
of function, that's called-- so
this restricted blood supply--

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.440
this is called ischemia.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.150
Another fancy word,
but it literally just

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.720
means restricted blood supply.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.840
Ischemia.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.670
Now if you have stenosis in one
of your blood vessels, in one

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.110
of your arteries, and it
restricts your blood supply.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.990
So it leads to ischemia.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.810
Let's say let me draw a
muscle cell farther over here.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.100
Let's say this is a coronary
artery that we're dealing with.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.370
The muscle cells over here
are going to get less oxygen.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.520
So this guy-- let me draw
this cell right over here.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.020
And I'm just drawing an
oversimplified diagram.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.360
I'm not going to imply
that muscle cells really

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.350
look like that.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.996
And actually, they
won't be-- well,

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:54.370
I won't go into
the details here.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.675
But this guy's not going
to get not enough oxygen.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.560
So you can imagine
that if we're really

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.480
zoomed in on the
surface of the heart,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.610
we're looking at the heart
muscle tissue right here.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.300
If whoever's heart this was,
if they started to go jogging

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.140
or whatever, and this
cell needed more oxygen,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.410
probably wouldn't be able
to get that oxygen because

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.310
of the stenosis which
caused ischemia.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.680
And because of that, it
doesn't have enough oxygen

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.669
so it won't be able to
help the heart pump.

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.210
Remember, this is just one of
the muscles in the heart that's

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.610
going to help it pump
the blood properly.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.505
So it's going to lead
to heart failure.

00:03:38.077 --> 00:03:39.660
And once again, the
word heart failure

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.800
sounds more dramatic
than maybe it really is.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.250
It sounds like cardiac
arrest, where the heart stops.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.330
But heart failure is not saying
that the heart is completely

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.000
failed.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.960
It's just saying that the
heart is failing its ability

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.010
to kind of properly
do its function.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.040
So when this guy goes
jogging, because he

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.720
has a restricted blood
supply, because the heart is

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.830
experiencing ischemia
downstream from this stenosis,

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.620
that's why there's
heart failure.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.390
So not able to deliver.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.070
Now this heart failure, which
is due to the ischemia which

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.480
is due to the stenosis, you
would call this heart failure

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.264
due to coronary artery disease.

00:04:18.264 --> 00:04:18.930
Let me write it.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.930
We talked about
that two videos ago.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.280
Coronary artery disease.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.560
Which is really just kind of
an impairing of the heart's

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.500
function because of
reduced blood supply,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.120
because of a narrowing
in a blood vessel

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.360
restricts the blood
supply ischemia,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.410
that is coronary artery disease.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.210
And because of coronary
artery disease,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.730
when this muscle
cell in the heart

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.950
really needs to pump hard--
maybe because someone's

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.650
going up a hill or
climbing stairs--

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.500
it's not able to do it because
it's not getting enough oxygen.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.530
And that inability to
properly, for the heart,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.207
not just the cell, but for the
whole heart, this is just one

00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:01.540
of many cells that maybe won't
be able to pump properly,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.940
for the entire heart to not do
its job, that is heart failure.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.795
Now you've also probably
heard the term coronary heart

00:05:08.795 --> 00:05:09.295
disease.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.520
Or maybe just heart disease.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.600
These three things are
all the same thing.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.050
These are all the same.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.640
They all imply some type
of narrowing or stenosis

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.970
of arteries that leads to
ischemia, reduced blood flow,

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.290
so that the heart can't function
as well as it otherwise could.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.970
Now the last thing
I want to focus on,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.320
and I talked a little bit
about it in the last video,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.390
is the idea of an
infarct or an infarction.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.480
These are kind of
funny words to say.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.750
I'll write it over here.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.330
So infarct or infarction.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.850
So in the example I've drawn
so far, this cell, for example,

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.680
maybe does not
get enough oxygen,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.690
especially once the
person is going upstairs

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.200
and all of that, to properly
contract and help the heart

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.390
actually pump.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.810
But it's not dead.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.280
It's still getting
some base level oxygen.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.340
Less because of the
stenosis and the ischemia,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.140
but it still gets some oxygen.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.030
And we saw in the video
on myocardial infarction

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.760
or the video on heart
attacks that sometimes one

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.580
of these plaques might become
unstable and they break off

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.600
and then you have
a complete blocking

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.699
of a vessel, a complete blocking
of an artery right here.

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.240
And we saw in the
last video, we call

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.330
this blocking what's
called an embolism.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.210
And an embolism is the
general term for something

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.390
that floated around and then
eventually blocks a vessel.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.190
And if it was due to kind of
a released plaque that also

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.530
had clotting factors around
it after it got released,

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.280
then we would call
this a thromboembolism.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.011
This would reduce the
blood flow so much,

00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:02.010
maybe a little bit might
be able to leak around,

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.600
but it reduces it so much that
the cells downstream from this

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.360
actually die.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.250
So you actually have
the cell right over here

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.360
and this cell will die.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.100
It might get very little
blood or no blood at all,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.990
so it's not getting enough
oxygen to actually survive.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.970
And when you have dead tissue
that's due to a loss of oxygen,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.550
this is an infarct, dead
tissue due to a loss of oxygen.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.970
The process of it becoming dead
tissue due a loss of oxygen

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.280
is an infarction.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.200
And this infarction, this
dead tissue due to loss

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.915
of oxygen, in the myocardium, in
the muscle tissue of the heart.

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.790
So now all of a sudden
you have muscle tissue

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.610
in the heart that's
beginning to die.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:46.730
This is a heart attack.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.510
This is a myocardial infarction.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.250
So hopefully that clarifies
things a little bit.
