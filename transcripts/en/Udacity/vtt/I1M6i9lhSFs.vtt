00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.670
Congratulations, you have
seen how one problem,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.300
satisfiability, captures all of the
complexity of the P versus NP problem.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.430
An efficient algorithm for
satisfiability when imply P equals NP.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.610
If P is different from NP, then it
can't be any efficient algorithm for

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.230
satisfiability.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.010
Satisfiability has efficient algorithms
if, and only if, P equals NP.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.560
Steve Cook,
professor of the University of Toronto,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.290
presented his theorem on May 4, 1971,
at the symposium on the the theory of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.500
computing at the then Stouffer's Inn
in Shaker Heights, Ohio.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.420
But his paper didn't have an immediate
impact as a satisfiability problem

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.919
was mainly of interest to logicians.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.577
Luckily a Berkeley professor,
Richard Karp, also took interest, and

00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:44.509
realized that you use satisfiability
as the starting point.

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:47.827
If you can reduce satisfiability
to another NP problem,

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:50.465
then our problem must
be NP complete as well.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:54.375
Karp did exactly that, and a year
later he published his famous paper,

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:56.984
Reducibility Among
Combinatorial Problems,

00:00:56.984 --> 00:01:01.746
showing that 21 well-known combinatorial
search problems were also MP complete,

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:03.526
including the clique problem.

00:01:03.526 --> 00:01:07.505
Today tens of thousands of problems
have been shown to be MP complete.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:11.145
The ones that come up the most often are
practiced tend to be closely related to

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:12.980
one of Karp's originals.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.760
In the next lesson, we'll examine
some of the reductions that prove

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.010
these classic problems to be MP complete
and try to convey a general sense for

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.280
how to go about finding such reductions.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.380
This sort of argument might come in
handy if you need to convince someone

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.370
that a problem isn't as easy
to solve as they might think.
