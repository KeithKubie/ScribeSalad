00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.660
SPEAKER: In this video,
we'll discuss account hold

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.285
and how to communicate this
account status with your user.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.060
A subscription
begins account hold

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.180
when a user's form of payment
fails and grace period has

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.250
ended.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.920
You should block access
to your content or service

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.250
while a user is in account hold.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.800
Users will automatically
receive access again

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.710
when the payment
method is fixed.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.470
This can encourage users to
update their payment method

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.260
without canceling their
subscription, which can

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.250
lead to greater user retention.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.860
If a user has multiple
subscriptions in account

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.130
hold due to an issue with
the same payment method--

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.590
for example, an
expired credit card--

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.900
then fixing that
payment method once

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.910
will restore all of
the subscriptions

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.250
for all of the
user's apps connected

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.470
to that particular
payment method.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.770
Apps that do not enable account
hold cannot be automatically

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.870
restored when a user
fixes their payment.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.010
We recommend enabling both
grace period and account hold.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.800
Account hold will begin after
the grace period has ended.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.870
To activate account hold,
sign into your Play console,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.430
and select your app.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.660
On the left menu, click store
presence, in-app products.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.900
Select the subscriptions tab,
and expand the subscription

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.430
settings section.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.110
Then check the activate
account hold check box.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.520
With real-time
developer notifications,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.100
you'll receive a notification
when a subscription enters

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.950
account hold.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.090
Call the Google
Play Developer API

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.735
from your server to record the
new subscription information.

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:47.514
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.300
You should then provide
a message in your app

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.000
that tells the user that there
is a problem with their payment

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.540
information.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.890
Be sure to include a deep link
to the Google Play Subscription

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.180
Center so the user can
fix their payment method.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.421
For more information on
setting up deep links,

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:12.420
visit the link onscreen.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.690
It's important to note that
if users expect your app

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.030
to perform services
outside the app,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.940
such as sending your user a
notification for stock market

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.960
alerts or notifying them when
their favorite team is playing,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.750
you may want to send a push
notification or an email

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.180
to the user to let them
know that their service is

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.310
no longer active.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.950
But if your services are
contained within your app,

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.290
it might be OK to wait
until the next time they

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.690
open the app before
informing them of the issue.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.200
