00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.600
So right here, we've got 3 to
the a power-- or a-th power,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.286
I guess.

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:07.160
I don't want to confuse
it with the number 8.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.010
3 to the a power is equal to
the fifth root of 3 squared.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.110
And what we need to figure out
is what would a be equal to.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.850
Let's solve for a.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.640
And I encourage you right
now to pause this video

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.082
and try it on your own.

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.040
Well, if you have a fifth
root right over here,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.498
one thing that you
might be tempted

00:00:27.498 --> 00:00:30.524
to do to undo the fifth root is
to raise it to the fifth power.

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:32.940
And of course, we can't just
raise one side of an equation

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.670
to the fifth power.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.128
Whatever we do to
one side, we have

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:38.430
to do the other side if we
want this to still be equal.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.460
So let's raise both
sides of this equation

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.540
to the fifth power.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.410
Now, this left-hand
side-- we just

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.785
have to remember a little bit
of our exponent properties.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:52.110
3a to the fifth power.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.759
And if we want to
just remind ourselves

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:55.800
where that comes from,
that's the same thing as 3

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.310
to the a times 3 to the a
times 3 to the a times 3

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.585
to the a times 3 to the a.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.330
Well, what's that
going to be equal to?

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.980
That's going to be 3 to
the a plus a plus a plus a

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.870
plus a power, which is the same
thing as 3 to the 5a power.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.590
So the exponent
property here is if you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.290
raise a base to some
exponent and then raise

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.340
that whole thing to
another exponent, that's

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.300
the equivalent of raising
the base to an exponent that

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.680
is the product of
these two exponents.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.990
So we can rewrite this left-hand
side as 3 to the 5a power

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.740
is going to be equal to-- Well,
if you take something that's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.030
a fifth root and you raise
it to the fifth power,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.330
then you're just left with
what you had under the radical.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.810
That's going to be
equal to 3 squared.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.290
So now things become
a lot clearer.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.619
3 to the 5a needs to
be equal to 3 squared.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.160
Or another way of
thinking about it--

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.980
we have the same
base on both sides.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.540
So this exponent needs to be
equal to this exponent right

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.440
over there.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.260
Or we could write that 5 times
a needs to be equal to 2.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.830
And of course, now we can
just divide both sides by 5.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.226
And we get a is equal to 2/5.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.830
And this is an
interesting result.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.960
And what's neat
about this example--

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.490
it kind of shows
you the motivation

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.370
for how we define
rational exponents.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.130
So let's just put this back
into the original expression.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.380
We've just solved for a.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.205
And we've gotten that 3 to
the 2/5 power-- and actually,

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:47.580
let me color code
it a little bit

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.210
because I think
that'll be interesting.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:03:01.510
3 to the 2/5 power is
equal to the fifth root--

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.830
notice, the fifth root.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.340
So the denominator
here, that's the root.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.040
So the fifth root of 3 squared.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.610
So if you take this
base 3, you square it,

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.410
but then you take the
fifth root of that,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.030
that's the same thing as
raising it to the 2/5 power.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.530
Notice.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.020
Take this 3, take it
to the second power,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.720
and then you find
the fifth root of it.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.790
Or if you use this property that
we just saw right over here,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.235
you could rewrite this.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:39.955
This is the same
thing as 3 squared.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.010
And then you raise
that to the 1/5 power.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.010
We saw that property
at play over here.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.880
You could just multiply
these two exponents.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.770
You'd get 3 to the 2/5 power.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.720
And that's the same
thing as 3 squared

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.260
and then find the
fifth root of it.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.100
3 squared, and then
you're essentially

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.731
finding the fifth root of it.
