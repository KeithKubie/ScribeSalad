[INTRO MUSIC]

00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:55.990
BRIAN MOROZ: Good afternoon--
or morning, everyone.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.740
Welcome to the third in our
Google Creative Sandbox

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.880
Gallery Hangout series.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.030
Today, we're going to be talking
about some really

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.180
astounding uses of DoubleClick
technology.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.220
And to kick it off this
afternoon here in New York,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.900
I'm actually going to hand it
over to my colleague, Ryan,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.100
out on the West Coast, who
works with DoubleClick.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.190
He's going to talk a little
bit about the platform.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.900
We're going to run a quick video
that gives you some idea

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.500
of what can be done with it.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.380
And then we're going to be
speaking with Grow and with

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.610
Spinnaker about their fantastic
uses of this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.620
technology.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.860
Ryan?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.150
RYAN TETUAN: Cool,
just in time.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.660
Sorry, guys.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.690
I had a quick venue switch.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.860
So everyone, obviously, on the
Hangout here is familiar with

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.880
DoubleClick Rich Media, right?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.676
Because the creative agencies
here leverage the tool.

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:43.160
Just to give you some
background,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.130
I'm right Ryan Tetuan.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.590
I work on, obviously, the
DoubleClick end of Google.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.490
My team works with creative
agencies across the US, right?

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.180
So we really want you guys to
understand the capabilities of

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.050
DoubleClick Rich Media and,
overall, the DoubleClick

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.110
platform as a whole.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.855
So I think we think have
a video cued up.

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:09.030
We're going to give you guys a
quick 90-second sizzle of what

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.720
DoubleClick Rich Media
is all about.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.219

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:56.508 --> 00:04:57.480
RYAN TETUAN: Cool.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.530
Are we back on?

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.635
BRIAN MOROZ: Back on.

00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:01.410
RYAN TETUAN: Awesome.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.430
So that, obviously, was a number
of Rich Media examples

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.380
we just ran through.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.070
I think that video highlights
some of the big, in your face,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.170
take over Rich Media units
that you might see

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.810
browsing the web.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.360
Working, specifically, I'm
based in Los Angeles.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.860
And a lot of the entertainment
clients here in LA, the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.860
Hollywood studios, have the
budgets and have the luxury of

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.980
media placements, like a YouTube
masthead, to be able

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.030
to create these crazy page
takeovers, right?

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.910
And I think at the end, at the
second half of this, you'll

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.100
see what the Spinnaker team did
taking a James Bond film

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.340
and creating a really engaging
YouTube masthead with that.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.670
But not all advertisers are
brands and have the luxury of

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.930
a canvas that size on the media
plane that includes,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.020
lets say, a media place
for a masthead.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.700
So let's say you're just given
a 300x250, and you have a CPG

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.750
[? grant ?]

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.980
to execute with.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.200
At that point, you've got to
start figuring out the best

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.450
way to get users to engage with
the Rich Media unit when

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.030
you don't have that type
of a placement.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.840
And I think what Drew and the
Grow team did, taking a brand

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.220
like Alka-Seltzer was really
taking the power of

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.930
DoubleClick's technology
platform and all the data

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.870
signals that we can tap into
and really creating a

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.940
relevant, engaging,
rich experience.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.870
And I think with that, I'll
pass it over to Brian and

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.980
Drew, and we'll sort of walk
through that first example.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.510
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.960
So the beauty of having Ryan on
the call here is twofold.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.490
One, the agencies that are on
the call today and going to be

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.110
talking about their work, you're
welcome to grill him,

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.190
yell at him, anything you like
as far as the product goes.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.750
Demand things.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.030
And for those of you that are
watching live, both with the

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.490
agencies that have done this
incredible work as well as

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.730
having Ryan here, please feel
free to pop in on our

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.370
moderator tool-- which we'll
be putting the link up

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.260
throughout the course
of the Hangout--

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.510
and ask any questions you'd
like of the folks in the

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.875
agency, Ryan.

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:07.250
It's a great place to get
your questions answered.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.360
So with that, Drew, are
you on the line there?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.640
DREW UNGVARSKY: I'm
here, yeah.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.600
BRIAN MOROZ: Excellent.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.450
Firstly Drew, do you want to
introduce yourself, your

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.980
position within the company,
and talk a little

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.270
bit about the work?

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.910
And then we'll go ahead
and run the video.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.740
DREW UNGVARSKY: Cool.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.390
I'm Drew Ungvarsky, the owner
and creative director at Grow.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.830
We're a digital agency and
production studio working both

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.860
directly with brands and with
the advertising agencies as a

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.070
production shop.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.280
We partnered with Google on
Project Re:Brief last year.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.500
And Alka-Seltzer is one of
four brands where we,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.300
essentially, tried to re-imagine
classic advertising

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.400
as if it was done today.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.900
And if it was done today, what
are the tools that you could

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.430
have used to do that in
a much more engaging

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.610
and relevant way?

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.800
BRIAN MOROZ: So let's go ahead
and run a video of the work,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.532
and then we'll jump back in.

00:08:07.532 --> 00:08:07.970
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.965
-I can't believe I ate
that whole thing.

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:14.630
-In Project Re:Brief, we
re-imagined Alka-Seltzer's

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.980
iconic "I can't believe I ate
whole thing" by bringing back

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.680
the original ad's character,
Ralph, through personalized

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.500
videos and immersive experiences
about the day

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.240
Ralph ate the whole thing.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.220
Each experience is customized
to its viewer as story

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.080
elements change with cues such
as location, time, weather,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.900
and the context of website,
making Ralph more relevant

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.380
than ever before.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.809
The ad experience begins with a
classic opening montage, in

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.429
which scenes and elements are
customized to make it relevant

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:44.710
to the viewer's environment.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.000
For example, users in New York
would see Ralph driving

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.465
through Times Square, while
those viewing it in Chicago

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:53.680
would find familiar elements
of the Windy City.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.920
As the viewer's weather changes,
so does the weather

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.690
in the story.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.230
Story elements can also change
based on the user's interests.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.400
So when Ralph receives a package
from his postman

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.410
during the afternoon episode,
contents of his package adjust

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.755
accordingly.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.830
-It's a mail-order chess set.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.030
-When the ad is placed on
YouTube, Ralph's TV plays the

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.630
same video, and he reacts based
on the video's category.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.090
Each episode gives the users
an option to influence the

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.360
story directly by interacting
with Ralph.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.290
When Ralph and Fred disagree
about the radio station, a

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.025
viewer can step in to help
pick a song, leading to a

00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:27.406
variety of outcomes.

00:09:27.406 --> 00:09:28.894
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:31.730
-They can even call the lead
character and interact with

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.530
him during the dinner episode.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.430
Each story leads up to Ralph
eating the whole thing.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.870
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.250
BRIAN MOROZ: OK, so that is a
very complicated piece of

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.820
creative with a lot
of moving pieces.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.330
So we'll get into the technology
and how you

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.020
actually put it together
in just a moment.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.840
But just to kick off the
conversation, let's talk about

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.880
the idea process first.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.520
So you've got this square of
real estate and the things

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.560
that you can do within it.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.500
What is the idea generation
process like

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.170
for you guys at Grow?

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.440
How did you approach
this project?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.810
How did you come up with all
of these different moving

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.785
pieces in the way that they
all came together?

00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:12.855
DREW UNGVARSKY: Sure, yeah.

00:10:12.855 --> 00:10:16.990
Well, keep in mind, we kind of
had the luxury of this being a

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.970
twofold process.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.775
Yes, one, we were
doing this ad.

00:10:19.775 --> 00:10:21.930
We're re-imagining this ad.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:27.570
We're also creating an
experiment about the process.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.470
So in a lot of ways, we
were analyzing what

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.320
it is we were doing.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.130
How do you actually
create this stuff?

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.530
How could we get in a room with
legends of advertising

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.420
and teach them to do
the same thing?

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:44.560
So the process, for us was
understand all of the tools in

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.100
the toolbox.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.520
Try to get some understanding
of what are

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.510
the different platforms.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.220
Why is it a relevant tool?

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.270
Why is it not just,
as it's often

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.270
treated, a print ad re-sized?

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.980
But that we can do the things
that the Google platform

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.590
allows us to do--

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.160
serving ads to people.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.810
When you say at the right time
and the right place for the

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.570
right person, what
does that mean?

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.380
And how can that be a really
effective tool not just for

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.190
sales and engagement but even
for entertainment, in the case

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.785
of Alka-Seltzer?

00:11:21.785 --> 00:11:22.490
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.310
So basically, just rethinking
the entire concept of what

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.520
that ad unit could be.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.990
So you mentioned what are all
the tools in the toolbox.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.880
And I think that's something
that comes up with agencies

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.060
and with clients, and even
sometimes here, internally, at

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.550
Google, there's just so much
you can play with.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.240
How did you guys, A, figure out
what are all the tools?

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.620
How did you just stockpile
all that list?

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.770
And then how did you select
amongst the things that you

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.545
had to say, these are the six
things we want to play with?

00:11:49.545 --> 00:11:50.820
DREW UNGVARSKY: Sure.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.600
To be honest, I'd say early on
in the process, a lot of the

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.410
stuff wasn't very
well documented.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.440
So we had a tough time
getting through it.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.140
Since then, we know, even
through the end of the

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.690
campaign in some stuff that
we're doing now, lots of the

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.200
tools, specifically how the GDN
works, how a YouTube buy

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.930
works and what features are
available to you, some of the

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.430
different tools, certainly
across platforms, are very

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:18.700
well documented and even nicely
packaged into the right

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.700
pages and videos and so forth
to learn those things.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.870
In our case, we wanted to,
again, survey those

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.780
technologies.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.410
We were looking for ways we
could use them in places that

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.700
they hadn't yet been used.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.970
And we identified a list of
about 20 things that we

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.140
thought, from a creative and
technology standpoint, would

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.250
be really amazing if
we could highlight.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.450
And then, as we looked at each
brand, Alka-Seltzer in

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.780
particular, we would say, OK,
what is that brief all about?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.350
If that brief is all about, in
the case of Alka-Seltzer, was

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.920
relevancy, it was everyone could
relate to Ralph sitting

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.410
on the side of his bed.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.160
And so, what are the tools that
are available to us that

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.840
really allow us to showcase
relevancy?

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.280
And so you could look at that
across other brands like Coke,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.490
Buy the World a Coke, where you
say, well, that's a social

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:07.825
experiment.

00:13:07.825 --> 00:13:08.990
That's a social brand.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.390
Let's look at social
tools and so forth.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.736
So picking the tools
based on that.

00:13:13.736 --> 00:13:14.820
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.160
So let me ask you a question.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.820
Did you pick out the
technologies you guys thought

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.100
were relevant and then develop
the idea around that

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.960
technology, which sounds like
maybe that's what you did?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.350
But I maybe am misreading
that.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.100
Or did you say, these are the
stories we want to tell, and

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.140
now I need to find the correct
technology that will actually

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.460
make this story happen?

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.410
What was the chicken, and
what was the egg?

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.910
DREW UNGVARSKY: So we had the
chicken and the egg and, I

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.560
think, the farmer all at the
table at the same time.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.640
The goal was look at
it from all angles.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.820
Look at it very much from
a creativity standpoint.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.960
Look at it from the
original brief.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.070
Look at it as, how could we
re-imagine that brief?

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.850
And again, if you've got a room
full of people who are

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.280
creating ideas, make sure that
they know what tools are in

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:57.950
their toolbox.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.100
And so the part of the process
I just described was, really,

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.480
just about toolbox building.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.000
When we actually went and
started concepting, we really

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.390
looked at things creatively.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.850
We looked at what were the
stories we wanted to tell.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.660
And then we immediately knew
what types of tools we had

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.632
available to us to do
that sort of thing.

00:14:14.632 --> 00:14:15.310
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.020
And so you mentioned having all
the people in the room,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.070
which leads me to my
next question.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.140
Who worked on the project?

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.300
What kind of roles?

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.180
How big was the team?

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.870
Can you give us a sense of just
who all was involved and

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.810
what they did?

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.240
DREW UNGVARSKY: Sure.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.560
The project is an experiment
from Google, and we

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.070
essentially engaged Grow
and another agency

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.280
called Johannes Leonardo.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.330
Grow was the lead
digital agency.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.770
Johannes Leonardo was the
lead creative agency.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.490
And then we worked with the
original creative or art

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.790
directors on the project to
bring them into the room.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.760
In a lot of ways it sort of
became a microcosm of what is

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.500
going on right now in the
industry, that you have

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.710
agencies, that you have
production partners, that you

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.780
have brands.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.510
You try to figure out when
you get them in the room.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.370
And there's an increasing trend
towards getting everyone

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.010
in the room at the same time.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.030
And that was certainly the
model that we had.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.530
Everyone was in the room.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:15.140
And so to answer your question,
we had a number of

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.350
creatives, whether those would
be traditional creatives, art

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.920
directors, copywriters, people
you might classify as creative

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.840
technologists, and onto full-on
developers who just

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.690
understood some of
the technologies.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.670
And critical to the whole
process was the idea of a

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:36.920
visionary creative director
who could guide us through

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.410
what the thinking was behind
that specific insight and how

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.220
we could bring that
to life today.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:42.640
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.380
And that actually, I think,
leads to an interesting

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.000
question, because I think
commonly, when you have people

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.800
that really get the technology,
get what can be

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.530
done with it, and come up with
the creative ideas, if the

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.790
client or if other folks in the
agency, depending on your

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.730
situation, aren't that
comfortable with the

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.830
technology, it can be a little
bit of a hurdle to try to get

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.500
them to understand it, back it,
and get excited about it.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.780
So how did you go about that?

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.830
Did you have any issues,
especially with working with

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.280
people who built this campaign
decades ago?

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.910
How did you approach teaching
them about the technology and

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.040
getting them excited
about that?

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.110
Or were they just naturally
gung ho about it?

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.750
DREW UNGVARSKY: Because a lot
of them were kind of coming

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.660
into it, learning so much new
stuff, they felt like we were

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.810
the teachers in that regard.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.290
They were going to teach
us about the brand.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.460
They were going to teach
us about their insight.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.000
We were going to show them what
was possible creatively

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.890
and technologically today.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.940
I think the push-pull that
happened in the process is

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.840
more, again, synonymous of what
happens right now where

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.480
you have to try to figure
out what is the right

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.710
balance of the idea.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.170
What's the right balance
of the technology?

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:56.110
And show people that, for
example, to tell a story with

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.540
just video and just to put a
video in that space doesn't

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.800
take advantage of all of the
things that can make it

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.579
relevant to its audiences,
that can make people more

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:08.819
likely to engage with it, to
make people stick with it

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:09.810
longer, and so forth.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:13.470
And so, once people understand,
that's probably

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.990
the way to get past
those hurdles.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.470
And we had them, very much so.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.130
There was a constant push-pull,
and I think a

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.202
healthy one of creative
and technology input.

00:17:24.202 --> 00:17:25.780
BRIAN MOROZ: Great.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.580
And I think that tension
can be very helpful.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.520
In some places, it can
be more difficult.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.090
So it sounds like you guys had
a really good experience with

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.380
that, which is awesome.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.540
And, obviously, the output
was amazing.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.430
What was the biggest hangup you
guys came across as you

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.650
were trying to put this
thing together?

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.780
Be it a technological one or a
cultural issue with the team,

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.390
or what was the one thing that
you would say, that was the

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.090
real dark night of the soul
for this project?

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.765
And how did you get past it?

00:17:52.765 --> 00:17:54.890
DREW UNGVARSKY: Oh gosh.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.080
Now, I'm not going to go
too deep into the--

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.050
BRIAN MOROZ: You don't
have to name names.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.970
DREW UNGVARSKY: --closet
of skeletons.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.860
There were a lot of
moving parts.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.650
In that campaign, we're looking
at the brand's most

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:13.130
iconic work, work that has
defined that brand, some of

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.130
their most famous and
revered advertising.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.660
And we couldn't screw that up.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.950
So we knew right away that was
something not to touch.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.670
Our project was also about
making sure that Google's

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.210
technology was used in its most
optimum way, to serve as

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.820
an example of how to do
these sort of things.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.800
And so, again, there's trying
to find the right balance of

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.900
all those things.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.180
There's individual components
that were--

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.930
every project presented
its own hang-ups.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.060
With Alka-Seltzer, we did this
as both a desktop execution

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.350
and a mobile execution.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.270
So trying to find a way to do
all of the very dynamic things

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.240
that we're doing in desktop, and
do them in mobile without

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.930
doubling the work-- a lot of
the stuff that we did in

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.290
desktop can't be done in
mobile in the same way.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.550
So thinking about both of those
platforms at the same

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.235
time, so we only solve
the problem once.

00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:07.736
BRIAN MOROZ: Right.

00:19:07.736 --> 00:19:12.560
And I think that's actually a
huge concern for anyone doing

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.760
this kind of really, really deep
digital creative work.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.920
I think right now, just across
any platform, is that

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.560
connection between desktop
and mobile.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.730
And how do you make that,
exactly like you said, so it's

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.470
not double the work?

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.270
And I think sometimes it's
almost impossible to do that.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.440
Obviously the technology,
hopefully, is moving in the

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.840
direction where it's
easier and easier.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.750
But we've heard that pain point
from everyone in the

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.910
past couple days
here, actually.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.180
So I am going to ask you one
final question, and then I'm

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.060
going to toss it over to Ryan to
see if he has any questions

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.090
for you or if you have
any comments for him.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.400
But if you were going to give
people who want to do

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.200
something similar to what you
did, obviously different

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.720
ideas, but something in the
direction of the work that you

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.180
guys did with Alka-Seltzer,
which has so many moving

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.210
pieces, so many API's feeding
into it, so many different

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.980
elements, if you had one piece
of advice to give them before

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.260
they set out on this
is very large task,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.295
what would that be?

00:20:06.295 --> 00:20:09.560
DREW UNGVARSKY: There is a level
of that that the Google

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.160
platform is built to do.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.980
The platform is built to know
about its audience.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.480
It's built to know
about location.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.910
There's some very simple signals
that are very easy to

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.780
bring into your creative and
very relevant for both

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.690
creative and media placement.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.240
And those things, everyone
can and should be doing.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.370
I don't think people are doing
those nearly enough.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:34.170
If you want to go so far as to
find the limits of those

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.170
things, to explore some of the
things that are really finite

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.090
details of that, my advice
would be bring a smart

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.740
developer in the room and
pair up with Google.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.070
And not just because we worked
with them on the

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.630
project with you guys--

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.730
Project Weave--

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.910
we worked with you guys
on a number of

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.490
campaigns just for agencies.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.670
And we always find a technical
correspondant to work with and

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.930
make sure we're navigating all
those waters properly.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.920
BRIAN MOROZ: And we didn't even
ask him to say that, by

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.628
the way, at all.

00:21:05.628 --> 00:21:09.396
DREW UNGVARSKY: I wasn't sure
you'd want me to say that.

00:21:09.396 --> 00:21:11.150
BRIAN MOROZ: Well, I'm
fine with that.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.580
Our Developer Relations folks
might now be panicking a

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:13.950
little bit.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.890
But yeah, that's a great
piece of advice.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.200
Wherever you can, partner up.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.830
And your point is really well
taken in that there's just a

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.390
lot of very simple triggers you
can use in these kinds of

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.780
units that, to your point
exactly, don't

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.680
get used very often.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.600
And you can do a lot of
very fun, narrative,

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.230
engaging stuff with that.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.082
Ryan, any questions or
comments for Drew?

00:21:33.082 --> 00:21:36.180
RYAN TETUAN: Actually, sort of
leading off what he just said.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.690
I'm curious, now that creatives
are starting--

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.370
and this is sort of
new in my opinion.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:45.115
I came from a creative agency
four or five years ago, and we

00:21:45.115 --> 00:21:46.960
weren't really thinking
about data signals.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.190
We weren't thinking about how
I can tie weather feed API,

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.650
which Drew has done really
well in that

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.920
example, into the creative.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.360
And I think now with
programmatic buying and the

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.970
way the industry's moving, was
it difficult for you guys to

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.990
either find those resources
or identify what

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.250
triggers you can use?

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.130
Can we, as Google and
DoubleClick, be doing a better

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.730
job having creatives understand
what opportunities

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.331
there is right now with data?

00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:23.930
DREW UNGVARSKY: As I'm engaged
in a project right now that

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.220
has got some similar ideas--
what can we do, what are the

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.360
latest things--

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.220
I really have found that a lot
of the documentation and a lot

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.690
of the sales materials
are hugely accurate.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.240
Only the very minute
details of some of

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.420
the things are missing.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.220
And those things are always
a quick email away.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.650
So no, I think people have the
tools that they need to do

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:46.650
this kind of stuff.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:47.340
RYAN TETUAN: Yeah, cool.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.800
I think it's just you guys, and
other creative agencies,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.250
leveraging it and having these
examples to share where are

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.346
other great things, as you
start to understand them.

00:22:55.346 --> 00:22:55.732
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:55.732 --> 00:22:58.900
DREW UNGVARSKY: And to your
point, how and where to

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.420
introduce it into the
conversation?

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.390
Where in the process
does it come up?

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.510
If you look at Alka-Seltzer, the
whole idea was let's use

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.620
those signals that are usually
used for very simple things.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.400
We know the weather, and so
we'll serve you a hot coffee

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.480
or an iced coffee.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.940
But we could use that for
a creative platform.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.240
So then, all of a sudden, people
who are used to, say,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.530
writing in Alka-Seltzer's
example, a sitcom script need

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.590
to understand cues that
are available to them.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.660
And how do you get those in
there in the right place?

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.535
And, again, just sort of a
back and forth process.

00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:32.050
RYAN TETUAN: Yeah, cool.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.265
If anyone hasn't seen
it, who's watching,

00:23:34.265 --> 00:23:35.940
go to Project Re:Brief.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.940
And actually, I've watched the
Alka-Seltzer ad many times.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.250
And Andrew, I just told you,
there's a little segment where

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.420
it actually tied into weather
API, pulled my Los Angeles

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.810
weather, and brought that
into the ad unit.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.560
And I used to be a developer.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.480
I can see how that's done.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.000
But what was really cool is
it was on the TV set.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.090
And you guys had a little
shimmer effect to it.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.600
So you sort of took it
to the next level.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.520
So I thought, overall, the
project was great.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.040
And thanks for joining us.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.459
I'll pass it back
over to Brian.

00:24:05.459 --> 00:24:06.089
DREW UNGVARSKY: Absolutely.

00:24:06.089 --> 00:24:06.405
Thank you.

00:24:06.405 --> 00:24:07.440
BRIAN MOROZ: Well,
thank you, Drew.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.420
And for those of you, again,
on the Hangout, if you have

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.610
questions for Grow and about
this particular unit, you all

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:14.440
go ahead and throw them
on the moderator.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.870
And Drew, if you'll hang out
with us for another couple of

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.430
minutes, we'll switch over now
and talk with the fine folks

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.810
at Spinnaker.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.330
Everyone still there?

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.100
MALE AND FEMALE SPEAKERS:
Yeah.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:25.600
BRIAN MOROZ: There they are.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.270
All right.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.070
We have a party going on
over across the pond.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.920
So we're going to go ahead, and
we're going to show the

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.715
Sky Fall example.

00:24:33.715 --> 00:24:35.040
It's super fun.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.210
Let's go ahead and play the
video, and then we'll jump

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.930
back to you guys, do a quick
round of intros, and jump to

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:40.700
some questions.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.692
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:41.692 --> 00:25:25.836
[MUSIC - "JAMES BOND THEME"]

00:25:25.836 --> 00:25:26.828
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:26.828 --> 00:25:28.420
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.680
Super, super cool stuff.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.230
Looks pretty complicated, so
I've got some questions for

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.560
you guys on how that all
actually was done.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.790
Let's start with the same
question that I asked Drew.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.050
So when you got this as a
client, and when you were

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.370
thinking, what do we want to do
with this, how in the world

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.230
did you come up with
that specific idea?

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.270
Because, like I said, it's
a pretty complicated,

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.770
interactive, environmental
thing.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.110
It's involving multiple
devices.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.650
It's a game.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.960
It's social.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.650
What was the idea
process like?

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.640
Who was involved in that?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.611
And how did you guys
come up with this?

00:26:04.611 --> 00:26:09.260
MALE SPEAKER: Well, in terms
of the inspiration for the

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.900
actual game, it was actually
two years in the making.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.430
And then one day, me and my
creative partners, we were

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.360
talking about certain
aspects of the film.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:24.120
And one of the important bits
they were documenting was this

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.790
motorbike scene that everyone
was really excited about.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:33.720
And we thought, what can we do
to engage our audience using

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.920
this motorbike scene?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.760
Because it would be really cool
to draw out a motor bike

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.790
online or on a banner ad.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.130
And from there on, we just
have experimented with

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.190
different stuff.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:51.380
And then we discovered that the
DoubleClick technology,

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.710
the Channel Connect, which
you had used before.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.330
And we thought we'd just
experiment with it.

00:27:00.192 --> 00:27:04.160
BRIAN MOROZ: So you knew very
early on that you wanted to do

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.960
something game-like using
the motorbike scene.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.070
And then you went and explored
the technologies that were

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.030
available and found
the one that fit.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.976
Is that accurate?

00:27:12.976 --> 00:27:16.510
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, that's
accurate to some extent.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:21.300
With "Skyfall" and Bond, a lot
of the assets, a lot of the

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.950
film is kept secret, as
you're probably aware.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.885
And the creative guys had the
challenge of not actually

00:27:27.885 --> 00:27:31.190
knowing what was going to be
the concept at the time.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:35.090
So we had been working on
"Skyfall" for about two years,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.460
so we knew that it was
going to be big.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:40.800
But the actual masthead, we
didn't actually know until

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.970
about a month, six weeks, before
we saw the media plan.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.422
And that's really the timeline
that we were working towards.

00:27:47.422 --> 00:27:49.160
So the guys came up with
the creative concepts.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.720
My and Alice's job to sell
it into the client.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.275
And then from that point, it was
really about bringing all

00:27:57.275 --> 00:28:01.550
the people to the project
and delivering the game.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.985
MALE SPEAKER: They actually came
up with three concepts.

00:28:02.985 --> 00:28:05.300
And this one was, actually,
the craziest one.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.830
And we didn't think it
would actually run.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.820
And when the client chose
it, we said oh shit.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.512
We have to make it.

00:28:10.512 --> 00:28:13.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.680
BRIAN MOROZ: Yeah, did
I hear that right?

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.960
Did you just say you
had four to six

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.865
weeks to put that together?

00:28:16.865 --> 00:28:17.493
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:17.493 --> 00:28:18.665
MALE SPEAKER: About
that, yeah.

00:28:18.665 --> 00:28:22.340
BRIAN MOROZ: Let's
talk about that.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.770
So we hear about tight
deadlines.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.470
That's part of agency life
is that's just going

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.170
to happen to you.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.950
But that seems unbelievable
to me.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.480
So how did you guys pull that
together that quickly?

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.700
You mentioned you've
used it before.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.890
Did you guys just have in-house
experience that made

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.130
it a lot quicker?

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.760
Who all piled on to make
sure that happened?

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.980
Can you talk about that
insane deadline?

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.255
So it's something that we're
quite used to working in with

00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:49.465
film, because often, those
assets don't get signed off

00:28:49.465 --> 00:28:51.740
until the very last minute.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.610
So it's something that
we're used to,

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.350
although it's painful.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.740
So, yes.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:04.190
And we did a similar experience
for "Spider-Man"

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:08.760
back in July, which was
a swipe shooter game.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.420
So we kind of had an idea
of the technology.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.260
But we knew that the Bond, we
wanted to make it slicker and

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.320
more exciting, really engage the
young audience, which is

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.300
something that Sony were
really keen to do.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.873
And so, once the concept was
signed off and we all caught

00:29:25.873 --> 00:29:30.990
our breath, we got Koko
involved, because they have

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.070
the gaming knowledge, which
we don't have in house.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.240
And we knew we were going to
need to work [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.930
to make it all come together
so quickly.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:46.162
So that's where [INAUDIBLE] and
his team were involved. .

00:29:46.162 --> 00:29:49.970
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so from our
side of things, the usual

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.160
deadline for most games
tends to be around

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.640
about four to six weeks.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.610
And to be truthful, this game
engine that they proposed to

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.460
us, it's something that we'd
kind of done before in a

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.360
previous advert game
that we'd created.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.490
So that was all pretty cool.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.990
Obviously, the main aspect and
the main complication that

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.550
really pushed the boundary
out was the dual screen

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.540
technology, the fact that you
could actually use the mobile

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.102
phone as the controller, and
obviously the fact that its

00:30:20.102 --> 00:30:22.230
actually being played inside
a YouTube masthead.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.690
So with that together, that
really did kind of push the

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.180
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.400
It obviously--

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.620
whereas we're used to tight
deadlines, like four to six

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.350
weeks, that additional aspect,
it was quite a tricky and

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.060
quite a daunting task
to begin with.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.850
But it all came together.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.880
And I think, by having the
experience in the game engine

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.510
that we'd already created in the
past certainly helped us

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.880
to actually overcome the initial
problems that we

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.962
[INAUDIBLE] faced with
the controller.

00:30:51.962 --> 00:30:53.040
BRIAN MOROZ: OK, yeah.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.270
And that's absolutely fantastic,
the fact that you

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.550
can use the phone
to play with it.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.030
I hope that you guys had a lot
of internal experimentation as

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.650
you were building it and
had some fun with that.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:06.236
It's just a really, really
cool use of the device.

00:31:06.236 --> 00:31:09.650
To what we were saying earlier,
it's very important

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.580
in a lot of cases to have
something that's both desktop

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.110
and mobile.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.390
This is a really unique way to
combine those, literally, at

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.470
the same time.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.550
Super cool.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:22.650
Let me ask this, just to go
around the table and all that,

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:24.010
who was the team
that was on it?

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:25.520
What kind of roles
were the people--

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.290
because this was such
a unique project.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:30.600
What kind of people
were pulled in in

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.410
order to work on this?

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.236
What types of roles?

00:31:34.236 --> 00:31:36.980
MALE SPEAKER: So I'm the
innovations planner, and my

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.060
role really is to make sure that
I'm pushing the client in

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.360
the right direction in digital
and innovation.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.235
So with Alice and the creative
guys, we work as a team to try

00:31:48.235 --> 00:31:50.130
and sell the creative
vision and concept

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.440
into the client now.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.205
As you see, with something like
this, it takes a leap of

00:31:56.205 --> 00:31:56.990
faith for the client
to do this.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.500
Now luckily, we've mentioned
that we did this for

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.990
"Spider-Man."

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.500
So we have a very fortunate
sector and industry we work in

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.590
within film, where they're able
to make those kind of

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.370
leaps of faith.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:13.950
Also, with "Skyfall" being such
a high profile film and

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:18.710
franchise, and the whole 50th
anniversary thing, the idea

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:22.270
that we had to come up with had
to be completely slick and

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.050
on brand with "Skyfall."

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.920
So Jon and Chris are
the creative team.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.750
They've been working on Sony
for about eight years.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.940
Alice has also been working on
Sony for quite some time.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.615
So we all know Sony
quite well.

00:32:36.615 --> 00:32:39.980
So as a project team, we're
quite used to Sony.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.560
People like [INAUDIBLE] and
Koko, they're gaming experts.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.900
And we knew straightaway that we
needed somebody to deliver

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:53.211
that gamification, because we
don't have that in house.

00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:56.460
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so from our
team, we actually helped

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.590
with this development
side of things.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.990
So we have a group
of developers in

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.470
house that we utilize.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.430
We also helped with
some of the actual

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.430
animation side of things.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.690
While Spinnaker were
responsible, primarily, for

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.130
the project planning and the
creative, we were responsible

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.240
more for the actual
developments

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.520
and the actual campaign.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.632
So yeah.

00:33:17.632 --> 00:33:19.880
BRIAN MOROZ: So a lot of
experienced folks in the room,

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.060
it sounds like.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.050
It sounds like everyone really
knew what they were doing, has

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.290
a history with doing stuff
like this in their own

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:26.080
individual role.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.180
So I imagine that had
to help a lot.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.710
So, interesting team and
interesting project.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.450
And I'm going to ask you the
same question that I asked

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.570
Drew, which is, what was the
one biggest issue you guys

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:41.630
ended up confronting?

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.090
Be it something with the client,
be it a technical

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.250
issue, or team concern, what
was the one thing that made

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.600
you all very nervous that
you came through on?

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.396
And how did you do it?

00:33:52.396 --> 00:33:53.372
MALE SPEAKER: File size.

00:33:53.372 --> 00:33:55.812
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I think [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:55.812 --> 00:33:59.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.760
Yeah, we got together
with the guys at

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.280
DoubleClick very early on.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.210
And when we presented
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:12.152
they said, I doubt that you're
going to be able to do this

00:34:12.152 --> 00:34:13.050
within the file size.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.770
And so we went back to the
drawing board, and we

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.458
contemplated doing a 2D version,
kind of a bird's-eye

00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:20.030
view type version.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.069
But no one had wanted
to let it go.

00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:25.090
And so we pushed on.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.989
And thanks to the amazing work
that Koko did, we were able to

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:32.610
make an amazing game but within
file size, which I

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:33.860
think [INAUDIBLE] happy with.

00:34:36.271 --> 00:34:37.190
MALE SPEAKER: I'm not
going to deny it.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.250
It certainly was a very
big challenge.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.310
Most of our games tend
to come around about

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.630
three to four megs.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.860
So to try and get a game at
this size with the kind of

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.150
innovation that was involved,
around the one and a half meg

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.370
file size, was certainly
a challenge.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.960
And especially because it needed
to look really slick.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.110
I mean, at the end of the
day, it was James Bond.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.810
So we had to make sure that we
retained that slickness that

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.390
you'd expect from a
James Bond game.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:08.030
And trying to get that
underneath the file size and

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.770
make the game actually
playable,

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.460
yeah, it was a challenge.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.530
But it was one that we managed
to overcome through quite

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.305
careful planning.

00:35:16.305 --> 00:35:18.780
It wasn't without its pitfalls,
as we were quite

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.360
over towards the end.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.190
But we managed to get it under
a knee in the end outcome.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.770
BRIAN MOROZ: All right.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.950
So I'm going to actually
pass it over to Ryan.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:32.226
Ryan, any questions for these
guys on this execution?

00:35:32.226 --> 00:35:34.930
RYAN TETUAN: Yeah,
I'm just curious.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.890
I feel like QR codes have been
given somewhat of a bad rep in

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.790
the industry, potentially
because people have been,

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.620
honestly, using them
incorrectly-- or at least in

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.840
marketing incorrectly.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.890
So I'm wondering, when
you brought this--

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:49.300
I guess the initial one was for
"Spider-Man"-- when you

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.300
brought it to Sony, were there
any sort of naysayers in the

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.550
room saying, are
you guys crazy?

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.955
Who scans a QR code?

00:35:55.955 --> 00:35:59.950
MALE SPEAKER: Yes, they
were, in fact.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.980
As a creative team, we'd
been trying to get

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.230
QR codes into anything.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.540
I mean, we'll try anything,
really.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:10.750
But I think this was the very
first time we felt quite

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.860
strongly that it worked
quite well.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.130
It wasn't redundant.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.550
Most QR codes are redundant.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.720
We just use them in the
Tube, and there's no

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.210
reception in the Tube.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:26.720
And we felt that, for the very
first time, we could actually

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.520
use it as a means to connect the
phone, because there was

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.630
no other way.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:35.140
And it could be a quite easy,
simple, and intuitive role in

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.270
getting people to punch in a
very long URL, which we do

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.702
offer the opportunity for people
to do that if they

00:36:41.702 --> 00:36:44.030
[INAUDIBLE] tapping
out a long URL.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:48.170
But on top of that as well, I
think we were quite familiar

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.030
with a quite youthful
audience.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.405
They know what a QR code is.

00:36:52.405 --> 00:36:52.734
They know how to react to it.

00:36:52.734 --> 00:36:55.713
They're quite familiar with
that language, so they can

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:56.540
just [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.690
MALE SPEAKER: I think it's
also about reducing the

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:02.310
barriers to entry to getting
people to the game as quickly

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:03.010
as possible.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.786
And QR codes seemed the most
obvious way to do that.

00:37:06.786 --> 00:37:07.425
RYAN TETUAN: Cool.

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.930
And without going into
performance, because that's

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:14.570
proprietary of Sony and
[INAUDIBLE], but would you say

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:18.751
you had what you expected in
terms of game plays, or at

00:37:18.751 --> 00:37:21.765
least engagements in the QR
code, or more or less?

00:37:21.765 --> 00:37:24.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I'd say
we've been definitely happy

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.336
with the results of the
placement avenue we've had

00:37:28.336 --> 00:37:31.964
with the game plays and then
people who went back to play

00:37:31.964 --> 00:37:32.750
again and again and again.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.625
So, yeah, everyone
was definitely

00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:36.110
happy with the results.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.272
RYAN TETUAN: Cool.

00:37:37.272 --> 00:37:39.682
MALE SPEAKER: I know James
Bond was happy.

00:37:39.682 --> 00:37:41.128
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:41.128 --> 00:37:44.310
RYAN TETUAN: Cool.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:45.880
That's all I had.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.100
I'm pretty sure we have you
guys' "Spider-Man" example in

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.220
our Rich Media gallery.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.755
Richmediagallery.com, I'm going
to try my own lower

00:37:53.755 --> 00:37:56.334
third right here and
see if this works.

00:37:56.334 --> 00:37:58.147
BRIAN: This is how we
roll at Google.

00:37:58.147 --> 00:38:00.940
We're very high tech.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.500
RYAN TETUAN: Yeah, I don't think
you can click on it.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.280
It's not that interactive.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.790
But regardless, there's other
Channel Connect examples in

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.900
there, so check them
out, everybody.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.325
Good stuff.

00:38:11.325 --> 00:38:14.370
BRIAN MOROZ: All right, so I'll
wrap up with you guys

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.510
before we see if there
are questions.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.810
Again, it's the same question
that I asked Drew, which is,

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.690
given all that you learned from
this very complex, very

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:28.050
short time frame, kind
of intense and

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.450
high-profile campaign.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.000
If someone was trying to do
something similar-- they

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.560
wanted to do gamification,
they wanted to use mobile

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.200
phones, something in the general
direction that you

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.810
guys pioneered here--

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.265
what would be your one piece
of advice to them?

00:38:42.265 --> 00:38:45.570
MALE SPEAKER: I would say get
the technology working first

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:48.916
before you start applying the
creative look and feel.

00:38:48.916 --> 00:38:52.010
And also partner up--

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.220
as mentioned on the previous
call-- but partner up

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.720
extremely quickly with
DoubleClick and Google, and

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.110
open all communication
channels.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.835
Make sure everybody knows what
you're trying to achieve and

00:39:02.835 --> 00:39:05.990
what the output is and what
the [INAUDIBLE] is.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.830
MALE SPEAKER: And what
the deadline is.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:10.820
MALE SPEAKER: And basically,
don't give up.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.320
Just if you think it's going
to work in your mind, just

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.770
push for it.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:16.860
BRIAN MOROZ: Push through.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.890
Know your technology
first, though.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:21.600
Good pieces of advice.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.090
All right, so we just have a
couple of questions from the

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.650
folks that are listening in.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.380
And the first is-- and we can
ask actually both groups here.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.195
And Drew, are you still
hanging out with us?

00:39:32.195 --> 00:39:33.160
DREW UNGVARSKY: Still here.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:33.530
BRIAN MOROZ: Excellent.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.810
So we'll start with you, and
then we'll jump over to our

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:36.530
Spinnaker friends.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.550
But the question first, from
Dave in London, is what were

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.180
the metrics?

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.860
Were you guys looking at clicks,
hits, engagement?

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.040
Because these units are very
different from your standard

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.310
display ad unit, what was
actually being measured?

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.442
What meant success?

00:39:50.442 --> 00:39:52.520
DREW UNGVARSKY: Yeah, that's a
weird question to answer for

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.940
this because ours was an
experiment to show

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:55.600
advertisers.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.730
The ads didn't actually
run in media.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.955
They ran for Google.

00:40:01.955 --> 00:40:06.090
The metric, though, is whether
we could get people to engage,

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:11.310
whether we could capture all
of the functionalities that

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:17.470
are available to us, and do so
in a way that re-imagined that

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.750
ad and did it justice.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.900
Again, with advertising at that
level, we were going to

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.790
be scrutinized very,
very heavily.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:31.110
So if we put too much technology
into it or didn't

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.940
really push the idea to a new
place, then we were certainly

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.950
going to be scrutinized.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:35.890
BRIAN MOROZ: Gotcha.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:40.090
And for "Skyfall," you mentioned
people coming back

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.050
to the game again and again,
posting their scores.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.050
What were you guys looking
for as saying this was a

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.371
successful engagement
with this unit?

00:40:46.371 --> 00:40:48.320
MALE SPEAKER: So it's really how
long you spend on the page

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.000
and the duration.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.380
Also, we had some social
elements to that, so it's

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.277
about sharing and getting
everyone to come not only to

00:40:55.277 --> 00:40:57.940
the masthead but to
keep them there.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:02.050
So that was really
our main KPI.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:02.480
BRIAN MOROZ: OK.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.370
And that's an interesting use
of those types of ads units

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.620
and I think a really exciting
way to do that, rather than a

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.490
simple, we just want
to accumulate the

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.490
maximum number of clicks.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.150
Very different way of measuring
and looking at, how

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.360
are people engaging with this?

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.790
So our second question-- and
we'll still hang out with you

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.760
guys, Spinnaker, and
then we'll flip

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.660
back to Drew at Grow--

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.160
is what is your advice for
balancing the client and the

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.310
creative and using DoubleClick
Rich Media specifically?

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.860
So how do you balance
those two things?

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.320
That's from Jill in Denver.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're very
fortunate that our client also

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.190
really wants to push
the new technology.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.740
So we often, when we know we've
got a particular film

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:47.090
coming out, we'll go in and
speak to people at DoubleClick

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.740
early, before we even know what
sort of media plan so we

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.625
can look at what new ideas are
out there, work with them, put

00:41:53.625 --> 00:41:54.995
those ideas foward
to the client.

00:41:54.995 --> 00:41:58.745
But yeah, we're lucky that he's
as [INAUDIBLE] as we are

00:41:58.745 --> 00:42:00.035
in terms of new digital
technology.

00:42:00.035 --> 00:42:03.233
MALE SPEAKER: I think also, just
to add to that, it's got

00:42:03.233 --> 00:42:05.190
to be relevant within
the film market.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.050
It's got to be relevant
to the film.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:11.650
So something like the YouTube
masthead DoubleClick Channel

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.970
Connect technology, "Skyfall"
is perfect for that.

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:17.220
So it's about getting
the balance right.

00:42:19.925 --> 00:42:20.770
BRIAN MOROZ: Gotcha.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:24.250
DREW UNGVARSKY: And on our end,
I would just say make

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:30.300
sure your client is aware of
what the real opportunity is.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.900
If you look at this as a resize
of a website, if you

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.960
look at it as a resize of a
print ad, then you're not

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.530
doing with the media what
it's capable of doing.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:42.240
And you won't see any of the
types of things that you

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.700
really expect to
get out of it.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.600
But if know what those things
are, if you know that this is

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.560
a channel that does things that
no other channel does,

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.700
you can create creative for
that and see it perform

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.685
remarkably well.

00:42:55.685 --> 00:42:57.100
BRIAN MOROZ: That's
a great point.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.260
So we will end on that.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.060
And I want to say a huge thanks
to Drew over at Grow

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.290
and to all of our friends over
Spinnaker for joining us.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:11.780
You can see their work at
www.creativesandbox.com, and

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.820
we recommend that you guys go
there and check out some of

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.560
these amazing DoubleClick units
and the things that

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:16.970
they've done.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.250
They go way beyond a
unit in that term.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.730
They're full-blown experiences,
so please go

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:23.410
check them out.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:27.210
And for those of you that will
join us tomorrow, same time,

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:27.970
same channel.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:31.120
We'll be talking about
Google+ API.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.820
So hopefully I will
see you there.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.870
And thanks so much to both
agencies for coming on board

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:36.870
and chatting with us.

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.120
And have a great afternoon.
