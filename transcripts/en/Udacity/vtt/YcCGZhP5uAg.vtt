Okay, so back to this picture real quick. You know,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.710
I drew these little caches you know, these were the little

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.165
caches you've already seen before. Remember our program ask each

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:10.215
end presently right now is using a dictionary cache to store

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:13.005
stuff. And when we have multiple app servers, this can

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.798
create a problem. Because we have multiple caches. Which brings me

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:21.340
to my next quiz. Why is our dictionary cache problematic with

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.940
multiple app servers? It's not this is actually a trick question.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.710
Multiple app servers means multiple caches. How do we

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.490
keep those caches in sync? Each app server may

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.160
have to hit the database to update its cache.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.710
Or we'll caching data redundantly. Check all that apply.
