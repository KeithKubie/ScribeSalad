00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:10.273
Grammatical tense 
is how languages talk about time

00:00:10.273 --> 00:00:12.734
without explicitly naming time periods

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:17.014
by, instead, modifying verbs 
to specify when action occurs.

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:20.484
So how many different tenses are there
in a language like English?

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:22.685
At first, the answer seems obvious:

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:23.584
there's past,

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:24.385
present,

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:25.805
and future.

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:28.365
But thanks to something called
grammatical aspect,

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:32.034
each of those time periods 
actually divides further.

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:34.144
There are four kinds of aspect.

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:36.555
In the continuous or progressive aspect,

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:39.885
the actions are still happening 
at the time of reference.

00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:43.905
The perfect aspect describes actions
that are finished.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:46.437
The perfect progressive aspect 
is a combination,

00:00:46.437 --> 00:00:49.967
describing a completed part 
of a continuous action.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.446
And finally, there's the simple aspect,

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:55.945
the basic form of the past, 
present, and future tense,

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:59.936
where an action is not specified
as continuous or discrete.

00:00:59.936 --> 00:01:03.616
That's all a little hard to follow,
so let's see how it works in action.

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:06.827
Let's say your friends tell you
they went on a secret naval mission

00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:09.567
to collect evidence 
of a mysterious sea creature.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:12.587
The tense sets the overall frame
of reference in the past,

00:01:12.587 --> 00:01:15.066
but within that, there are many options.

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.658
Your friends might say a creature
attacked their boat,

00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:20.617
that's the past simple,
the most general aspect,

00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:23.287
which gives no further clarification.

00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:25.577
They were sleeping when it happened,

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:29.009
a continuous process 
underway at that point.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.387
They might also tell you they had departed
from Nantucket

00:01:32.387 --> 00:01:35.338
to describe an action 
completed even earlier.

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:38.088
That's an example of the past perfect.

00:01:38.088 --> 00:01:41.198
Or that they had been sailing 
for three weeks,

00:01:41.198 --> 00:01:44.389
something that was ongoing 
up until that point.

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:48.558
In the present, they tell you that 
they still search for the creature today,

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:50.840
their present simple activity.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.708
Perhaps they are preparing for their
next mission continuously as they speak.

00:01:55.708 --> 00:02:00.158
And they have built a special 
submarine for it, a completed achievement.

00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:04.803
Plus, if they have been researching
possible sightings of the creature,

00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:08.267
it's something they've been doing 
for a while and are still doing now

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:11.469
making it present perfect progressive.

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.722
So what does this next mission hold?

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:18.138
You know it still hasn't happened
because they will depart next week,

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.596
the future simple.

00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:22.730
Your friends will be searching 
for the elusive creature,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.899
an extended continuous undertaking.

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:30.517
They tell you the submarine will have
reached uncharted depths a month from now.

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:31.989
That's a confident prediction

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.719
about what will be achieved 
by a specific point in the future,

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.059
a point at which they 
will have been voyaging for three weeks

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.409
in the future perfect progressive.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.009
The key insight to all these 
different tenses

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.631
is that each sentence takes place
in a specific moment,

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:50.900
whether it's past, present, or future.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.159
The point of aspects is that they tell you
as of that moment

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.369
the status of the action.

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.059
In total, they give us twelve 
possibilities in English.

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.940
What about other languages?

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.219
Some, like French,

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.080
Swahili,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.069
and Russian
take a similar approach to English.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.811
Others describe 
and divide time differently.

00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:12.979
Some have fewer grammatical tenses,
like Japanese,

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.730
which only distinguishes past 
from non-past,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.482
Buli and Tukang Basi,

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:21.742
which only distinguish future 
from non-future,

00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:26.192
and Mandarin Chinese 
with no verb tenses at all, only aspect.

00:03:26.192 --> 00:03:31.622
On the other hand, languages like Yagwa
split past tense into multiple degrees,

00:03:31.622 --> 00:03:35.602
like whether something happened hours, 
weeks, or years ago.

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:39.592
In others, tenses are intertwined
with moods that can convey urgency,

00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:40.706
necessity,

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:42.902
or probability of events.

00:03:42.902 --> 00:03:45.966
This makes translation difficult
but not impossible.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:50.215
Speakers of most languages without certain
tenses can express the same ideas

00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:53.767
with auxiliary words, 
like would or did,

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.876
or by specifying the time they mean.

00:03:55.876 --> 00:03:58.085
Are the variations 
from language to language

00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:01.992
just differents ways of describing
the same fundamental reality?

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:06.616
Or do their diverse structures reflect
different ways of thinking about the world

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:08.337
and even time itself?

00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:12.086
And if so, what other ways 
of conceiving time may be out there?
