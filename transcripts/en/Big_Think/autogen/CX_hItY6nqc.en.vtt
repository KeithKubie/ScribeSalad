creative people don't really understand

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
creative people don't really understand
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.580

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
that what they're doing is also a
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.340
that what they're doing is also a
business and so they kind of need to be

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350
business and so they kind of need to be
 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.500
business and so they kind of need to be
trained in that way to operate on the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
trained in that way to operate on the
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.080
trained in that way to operate on the
same level as the business people and so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
same level as the business people and so
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000
