00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.140
There's no denying that the script is one of the most important aspects of a film

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.630
It's the source of the story, characters and great lines of dialogue that hopefully will form a strong connection with the audience

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.440
but the screenplay is more of a guideline than anything else.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.660
There are no rules that state directors and actors need to stick to what's on the page

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.420
Filmmaking is a fluid creative process and ideas can be thought up on the spot.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.700
In fact some of the most iconic movie moments were ad-libs

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
Here are 10 memorable movie scenes that were completely improvised

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.640
Bad Boys 2

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.820
Improvising has become a staple of the comedy Genre

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.040
And you'd be hard-pressed to find two funnier action stars than Martin Lawrence and Will Smith

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.980
The two headlined the bad boys films and used

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.600
their talents in a hilarious sequence in Bad Boys 2

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.680
where Mike and Marcus harass a teenager looking to take Marcus's daughter out on a date

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.680
Dennis Greene, the actor who played Reggie was told to not look or speak with

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.640
Lawrence when he arrived on set so he was scared of him

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.520
and nobody told Greene that Will Smith was going to pull a gun on him

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.180
It was all in good fun, but Greene didn't seem to be laughing

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.250
Django Unchained

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.260
Few actors are as dedicated to their craft as Leonardo DiCaprio and the now Oscar winner will stop at nothing to get a scene right

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.520
He doesn't even let personal injuries stop him

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.560
While filming Django Unchained, DiCaprio cut his hand on a piece of glass after slamming a table.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.900
He started to bleed, but remained in character delivering his monologue

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.879
He even incorporated the wound in the sequence smearing his blood-soaked hand all over Kerry Washington's face

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.000
It was pretty amazing to watch and Quentin Tarantino was left with no choice, but to put that take in the finished film

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.120
Leah may not have been nominated for this role, but he left a strong impression

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.280
Aladdin

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.220
Robin Williams was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.210
Full of energy and non-stop enthusiasm

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.240
That's what made him a perfect choice to play the Genie in Disney's Aladdin

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.559
where he was the clear star of the show

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.280
Williams improvised so much during recording that the team ended up with

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.530
nearly 16 hours of material with which to work

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.580
William's performance even hurt Aladdin's Oscar chances

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.420
So many of the Genies Lines were ad-libbed that the script was

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.380
turned down for a Best Adapted Screenplay nomination at the Oscars

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.160
You're a lot smaller than my last master either that or I'm getting bigger

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.259
Look at me from the side do I look different to you?

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.488
Best of luck to whoever takes over the role in the remake... You have huge shoes to fill

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.380
The Empire Strikes Back

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.190
The scene where Han Solo is frozen in carbonite

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.540
Is one of the most heart-wrenching in the entire Star wars Saga

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.890
But the filmmakers had a hard time getting the dialogue right

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.000
Han Solo's reply to princess Leia's declaration of love went through several iterations

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.910
many of which failed to capture the spirit of the character

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.020
It was Harrison Ford who ultimately suggested the now-famous line, "I know"

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.100
and the rest is history.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.920
I love you!

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.900
I know.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.940
It's a moment that's become the stuff of legend and is now even

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.580
plastered on Star Wars-themed couples merchandise

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.000
Who knew not saying "I love you too" could be so romantic?

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.100
The Dark Knight Rises

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.779
Bane is a vicious villain who threatens Gotham with a nuclear apocalypse

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.880
But even he can appreciate the talents of a fine singer

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.159
Shortly before blowing up Gotham's football stadium, a young child sings the National Anthem

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.270
Bane, hidden from sight in a tunnel, remarks, "That's a lovely lovely voice"

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.500
It's a line that got a chuckle from audiences and they have Tom Hardy to thank

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.160
Per the film's producers, the actor improvised the line on the spot

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.620
Christopher Nolan was obviously a fan and Led his bad guy provide a brief

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.559
moment of levity before returning to his more terroristic ways

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.120
Ghostbusters

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.100
When you combine the comedic minds of Bill Murray Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.960
improvisations are going to happen

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.339
While filming the original Ghostbusters

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.719
Almost none of the scenes were shot as scripted, and many included at least one or two ad-libs

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.000
I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.710
forthwith to your place of origin, or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension!

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.450
That ought to do it

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.580
Thanks very much, Ray..

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.580
One of the more noteworthy examples of this

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.500
was the scene in which Lewis Tully is interacting with his party guests

00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:50.969
where he comments on things such as the price of salmon

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.060
What makes this sequence all the more remarkable

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.860
is that it was all one continuous shot

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.760
which meant everyone had to be on their game to not ruin the take

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.020
Fortunately, Rick Moranis was in control and made many people laugh

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.260
Casablanca

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.880
It's one of the most well known lines in cinematic history:

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.730
"Here's looking at you kid"

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.740
Rick's Farewell to Ilsa is so perfect and memorable, it had to have been

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.260
scripted in the equally acclaimed screenplay, right?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.760
Nope!

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.200
Humphrey Bogart improvised that bit of dialogue during the Parisian scenes

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.820
that take place earlier in the film

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.580
It worked so well that it was used throughout the movie

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.060
including its climactic sequence

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.509
Bogart first uttered "Here's looking at you kid" for his

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.160
1934 vehicle Midnight

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.440
But it's using casablanca is what many cinephiles remember

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.179
In fact the AFI named it the fifth best line of dialogue of all time!

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.460
Full Metal Jacket

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.360
It's a misconception that R. Lee Ermey ad-libbed much, if not ALL, his

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.210
dialogue in this Stanley Kubrick war drama

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.800
but some improvisation did take place

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.879
Though the actor worked with the director to make the screenplay more believable

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.569
Ermey did go off-script at times, including the famous

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.340
disciplinary scene where he shouts insults at the soldiers

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.980
Most notably was the instance where he told Private Cowboy

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.720
that he was the type of guy who would have sex with another man

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.380
and not have the courtesy to give him a reach-around

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.489
When Cupric learned what that was, he thought it was funny and kept it in the final cut

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.750
The Wolf of Wall Street

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.960
Perhaps THE sequence of this Martin Scorsese flick

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.680
is when Jordan Belfort has taken way too many lemons for his own good

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.400
and is basically incapacitated and he tries to make his way back to his car

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.969
The director claims that it was improvised on the day of filming with

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.420
Leonardo DiCaprio suggesting the famous stunt

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.020
where he opens the door with his foot

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.860
The actor strained his back during shooting and could only pull off the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.360
Act once so luckily Scorsese got everything he needed in that take

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.100
This whole scene was a sublime

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.660
illustration of the Wolf of Wall Street's Dark Comedy

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.369
And it's great to know it was as fun to film as it was for us to watch

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:39.980
Saving Private Ryan

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.029
When Private Ryan is upset by the fact he can't remember his deceased brothers' faces,

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.680
John Miller tells him that he needs to think of a context or a memory that involved them

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.639
Ryan goes into an amusing story that

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.580
Involved his brother and a girl who hit every branch on the Ugly Tree (lol ouch)

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.700
As it turns out that whole bit was improvised by Matt Damon

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.529
A telling sign that it wasn't in the script is when Tom Hanks glances off-camera

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.440
looking at Steven Spielberg to see if they should keep rolling

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.100
Fortunately, Spielberg let Damon complete the monologue

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.620
and a moment of heartfelt humor was injected - right before a harrowing battle

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.000
Those were our picks for memorable improvised movie moments! Are there any we missed?
