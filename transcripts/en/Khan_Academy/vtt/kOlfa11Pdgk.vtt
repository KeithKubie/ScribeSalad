00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.970
- [Instructor] We are told
a student hangs blocks

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.850
with different masses
from a pulley of mass, M,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.650
and radius, r,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.420
and releases them from rest.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.230
The student measures
the time of the fall, t,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.180
and the magnitude of the
angular velocity, omega sub f,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.720
when the block reaches a distance, d,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.370
below the axle.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.700
There is considerable friction
between the axle and pulley.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.250
Which of the following plots

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.110
could show the student's measurements

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.380
as a function of the applied
torque on the pulley?

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.340
So pause this video

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.590
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.260
All right, so let's first
understand what these axes are,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.330
and then we'll talk a little bit

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.460
about what's going on with
this mass pulley system.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.060
So, on our horizontal axis here,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.780
we have our applied torque.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.130
Now where is the applied
torque in this system?

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.120
Well, you're going to have some mass here,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.930
and we assume we're on a planet

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.470
or probably on Earth.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.790
So you're going to have
gravity pulling down on this,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.900
so you're gonna have the force
of the weight of this object

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.030
pulling down,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.810
and we know that this has radius, r.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810
So that force times that radius

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.510
is going to be the applied torque.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.830
And of course, the more mass you have,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.600
the more weight you're going to have,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.260
and you're going to have more torque.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.400
So this is really showing

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.440
that as the student applies
larger and larger masses,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.610
right over here,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.320
we're going to have more
and more and more torque.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.160
Now, what is in our vertical
axis right over here?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.460
Omega sub f divided by t.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.900
So this is our final angular velocity,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.560
once this thing has
gone down a distance, d,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.850
that's what they tell us,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.080
divided by the time it took to get there.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.410
Well, if we assume that it
started from a standstill,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.540
you could view this as
your angular acceleration.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.710
So this is the angular acceleration

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.120
as a function of applied torque.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.180
So I could write angular
acceleration right over there,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.010
or you could say your
average angular acceleration

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.930
over that time period.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.010
From when you start to time, t.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.880
So what do we think would happen?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.390
Well, if you have small masses here,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.580
it would create a small torque.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.520
But if you have considerable friction,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.910
which they talk about right over here.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.950
There is considerable friction
between the axle and pulley.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.010
So for small masses right over here,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.080
the torque will likely
not be strong enough

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.900
to overcome the friction.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.250
And in that situation,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.950
you would not have any
angular acceleration.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.980
Everything would just stay still.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.000
But then at some point,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.980
once your mass gets large
enough, right over here,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.710
then your torque would be large enough

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.270
to overcome the friction in
between the axle and the pulley.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.260
So which of these graphs describe that?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.683
Or which of these plots?

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.520
Well, this first one,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.790
describes a situation when
you have a low applied torque,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.560
you have a high angular acceleration.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.730
That does not make sense,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.480
so we should rule that out.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.340
This one kinda shows angular acceleration

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.450
is indifferent to applied torque.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.680
And that doesn't make sense.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.340
The more applied torque you have,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.000
the larger masses here,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.990
well then you should have
more angular acceleration.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.700
So that doesn't make sense.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.550
Now, both of these show an upward trend

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.010
where as you have more applied torque,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.130
you have more angular acceleration.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.780
So which of these would you pick?

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.360
Well, this one here, on the right,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.160
this kind of paints a picture

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.370
that as soon as you
have any applied torque,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.610
you start having angular acceleration.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.530
And if this was a frictionless system

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.320
or if there was very little friction here,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.020
maybe this would make sense.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.040
But as we talked about,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.280
for low masses,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.040
which should have a low weight,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.410
so it would generate low applied torque,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.530
it wouldn't be able to overcome friction.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.390
And so you should not have

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.470
some angular acceleration for low torques,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.170
but then as the torque gets larger,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.410
you will overcome the friction

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.640
and then start to accelerate the system.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.793
And so I would pick B.
