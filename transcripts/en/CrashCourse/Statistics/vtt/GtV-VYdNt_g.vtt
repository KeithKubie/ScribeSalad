00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.120
Hi., I’m Adriene Hill and Welcome back to
Crash Course Statistics. Today we’re talking

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.957
about relationships. No, not why you and your
bestie are platonic soulmates, or why your

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:12.769
cat just doesn’t seem to like you, we’re
talking about data relationships like how

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.379
you can use one variable to predict another.

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.640
Like if you can predict whether people who
write in all capital letters are more likely

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.340
to default on loans. Whether people drive
faster after they watch Fast &amp; Furious movies.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.880
Or whether blink more often when they're lying.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:37.040
INTRO

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.420
We’ll start with the simplest data relationship,
one between two continuous variables, also

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.329
called bivariate data. But first, we’re
going to need to visualize our data using

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.070
a scatter plot.
The scatter plot has been called “the most

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.129
versatile, polymorphic, and generally useful
invention in the history of statistical graphics.”

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.829
Impressive....And...as such...they are pretty
much everywhere.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.530
Including on your favorite news site...News
outlets now have data journalists on staff

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.650
to visualize and make sense of data.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.690
To make a scatterplot of Old Faithful eruption
duration and latency--which is the time between

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.500
eruptions-- we put one variable on the x -axis
and the other on the y-axis. Then each data

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.580
point is placed so that it’s in line with
both it’s eruption duration, and it’s

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.140
latency.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.140
Now we can see a relationship. There are clusters,
two blob-y looking groups of points, which

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.250
supports our guess that there are likely two
kinds of eruptions, one with a longer build

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.040
up and longer duration, and one with a shorter
build up and shorter duration.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.880
Just like the histogram and dot plot, a scatter
plot allows us to see the shape and spread

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.280
of data--but now in two dimensions! This data
is clustered, but scatter plots are useful

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.590
for identifying all kinds of relationships,
both linear and nonlinear.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.140
For now, let’s focus on linear relationships
with a classic example--the relationship between

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.920
the the heights of fathers and sons. It makes
sense that a tall father would produce a tall

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.000
son, but we can do better than just a hand
wave-y statement.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.640
In 1903, the statistician Karl Pearson published
an influential paper--in his own journal,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.060
Biometrika. One section of the paper describes
the relationship between the heights of dads

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.510
and their male children.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.909
In this paper, Pearson fit a line through
the data to describe the relationship, rather

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:20.250
than just relying on his eyes to see a pattern.
The line--called a regression line--is the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.989
line as close as possible to all the points
at the same time.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.280
And note here Pearson used feet and inches
in his paper so we will too.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.280
Lines are a great way to describe a relationship because they have a nice formula, y = mx + b

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.180
just like you learned in algebra. The m
--or slope--tells you a lot about your data.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.430
It tells you that an increase in 1 inch of
a father’s height, leads to an increase

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.239
of m in the son’s height (about half an
inch in Pearson’s paper).

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.200
So on average dads who are 6’1 tall have
sons that are about half an inch taller than

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.290
the sons of fathers who are 6 feet tall. That
allowed Pearson to make a prediction about

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.520
the height of the son from the height of the
father.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.049
And this is why these lines are so useful;
they allow us to pretty accurately predict

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.989
one variable based on the value of another.
The relationship between car weight and gas

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.390
efficiency allows us to be pretty sure a SMART
car gets better mileage than a Hummer.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.209
One note of caution: the slope relies heavily
on the units of x and y since it’s a measure

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.790
of how many units y increases with each increase
of 1 unit in x. If I decided to measure the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.390
Son’s height in meters, the m...or slope...
will change, even though the relationship

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.000
didn’t.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.220
When we see a non-zero slope--also called
a regression coefficient--it’s a sign that

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.620
there’s some kind of relationship between
our two variables, but that’s pretty much

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.120
all it tells us. We don’t know how strong
that relationship is. For more information,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.900
we need to look at correlation.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.620
Correlation measures the way two variables
move together, both the direction and closeness

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.440
of their movement.
You may have read articles claim that there’s

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.849
a positive correlation between exercise and
heart health. That just means if you exercise

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.269
more, your heart tends to be healthier. A
positive correlation looks something like

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.599
this on a scatter plot:

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.630
While a negative one, like the correlation
between number of cigarettes smoked each day

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.560
and lung health, might look like this. Higher
values of cigarettes smoked tend to have lower

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.999
values for lung health:

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:19.650
We now know what correlations look like in
general, but to understand them more deeply,

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.050
we’re going to take a closer look.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.570
If two variables have a positive correlation,
they move in the same direction. We can see

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.800
this in our scatter plot if we draw two lines
across the graph--one at the mean of each

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.100
of our variables--to divide the plot into
four quadrants.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.890
When two values are positively correlated--like
how many miles you run and the number of calories

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.000
you burn--most of the points will be in the
upper right and lower left quadrants. In these

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.790
quadrants, the values for miles and calories
burned are either both large, or both small.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.210
The more miles you run, the more calories
you burn.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.420
The opposite happens when the correlation
is negative, like the relationship between

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.670
vaccination rates and the rates of preventable
illnesses. Instead of moving together, the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.160
variables move in the opposite direction.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.950
So, the points are mostly in the upper left
and lower right quadrants where either vaccination

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.260
rate is small and rate of illness is large,
or visa versa. Since vaccination rate and

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.080
rate of preventable illness have a negative
correlation, as vaccination rates increase,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.380
rates of preventable illness decrease.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.141
The more closely two variables move together...
the stronger the relationship will be, positive

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:26.141
or negative.

00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:30.980
If the points are in all of the quadrants
pretty evenly. You just have a blob or a cloud.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.360
You don’t have a strong relationship.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.660
As I mentioned before, the units of your variables
can affect the regression coefficient, and

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.980
can also affect the calculation of our correlation.
To get around that, we use the standard deviations

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.860
to scale our correlation so that it is always
between -1 and 1. This is our correlation

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.050
coefficient, r.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.961
Interpreting r involves two things: the sign
of the number...that is whether it’s positive

00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:57.560
or negative and how big the number is. The
sign will tell you whether your two variables

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.500
move together (positive r), or in opposite
directions (negative r).

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.720
A correlation of 1 or -1 would be a perfectly
straight line, meaning you can exactly predict

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.810
one value from the other. Say we looked at
correlation of the number of hours you’re

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.000
asleep vs. awake. If I know one of those values
I can tell you exactly what the other one

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.390
is. We all have only 24 hours a day even Beyonce.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.320
As you get closer and closer to a correlation
of 0, the points are more and more spread

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.150
out around our regression line, and eventually
at 0, there’s no linear relationship at

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.150
all...it’s just dots.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.130
When you look at a scatterplot, remember that
you can’t deduce a correlation just by the

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.770
steepness of the regression line. In our earlier
father/son heights example we changed the

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.290
units to meters and our line didn’t look
as steep, even though it’s the same data.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.050
Data with steep lines can have low or high
correlations.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.811
We also use the squared correlation coefficient
r^2 .... R^2 is always between 0 and 1, and

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:01.110
tells us--in decimal form--how much of the
variance in one variable is predicted by the

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.200
other. In other words, it tells us how well
we can predict one variable if we know the other.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.200
While they won’t usually give R^2 an explicit
mention, you’ll see articles claim things

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.820
like “ the ounces of soda a person drinks
is highly predictive of weight”, which means

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.690
there’s a large R^2. You can think of R^2
as a measure of how accurate your guesses

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.130
would be if you used your linear equation
to predict one variable from another.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:28.060
If you have an R^2 of 0.7 for the cigarettes
and lung health data that would mean cigarette

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.440
usage predicts 70% of the variation in how
healthy our lungs are. You could pretty accurately

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.780
predict someone’s lung health if you knew
how many cigarettes they smoked.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.570
An R^2 of 1 means you can perfectly predict
one variable from the other since 100% of

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:47.900
the variation is in one variable. This can
seem pretty obvious when you think about conversion.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.200
Like temperature in Fahrenheit can be predicted
by temperature in Celsius. In this case we’re

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.480
not actually measuring the temperature in
Farenheit, but it is perfectly predicted by

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.020
Celcius. So in general, the higher the R^2,
the better the fit.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.640
Crash Course World News

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.120
Breaking news from city hall today! The mayor
has announced a plan to cut down on the number

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.920
of people who drown every year.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.700
Sources close to the Mayor tell us that he’s
seen some very interesting correlations between

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:23.530
drownings and air conditioning usage and drownings
and Nicolas Cage movies. Or as I like to call

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.020
it...air cons and Con Airs.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.100
Both are highly correlated with drownings.
Here’s evidence.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.740
If we look at AC sales data over the past
10 years. And even more proof if we look at

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.480
Nicolas Cage movies over the same time period.
The Nic Cage data was provided to the city

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.800
by Tyler Vigen.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.649
So as of today, our mayor has enacted the
Cool-Cage act which will prohibit sale of

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:52.499
air conditioners and create a Nicolas Cage
task force who will do everything-- to prevent

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:57.960
Nicolas Cage from starring in any movies.
The Mayor assures us that because of the strong

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.920
correlations she saw, as well as the strong
will of our city, we will surely have next

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.620
to no drownings this coming year.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.910
The Cool Cage act may seem silly, but we’re
constantly flooded with messages--that equate

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:15.319
correlation with causation. And as you’ve
heard before: CORRELATION DOESN’T EQUAL

00:09:15.319 --> 00:09:16.680
CAUSATION.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.660
Just because two variables are related doesn’t
mean that one variable causes the other. The

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:28.120
examples the mayor uses are perfect examples of things that can go wrong when interpreting correlations.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.720
When one thing (A) is correlated with another
(B), there’s a few possible reasons

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.900
A causes B
B causes A

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:40.319
There’s a third Variable C that causes both
A and B, even though A and B aren’t related

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:43.010
Or there’s no relationship at all. it’s
just a coincidence.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.570
The correlation the Mayor saw between air
conditioning and drownings is probably caused

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.509
by a third, unmentioned variable: heat! When
it’s hot people buy more air conditioners

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:56.890
and go for a swim leading to a correlation
even though there’s no direct link between

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:57.400
the two.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.980
And as for Nicholas Cage, he probably shouldn’t
feel too guilty about causing world-wide drownings.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.830
Sometimes two completely unrelated things
are correlated just by random chance, with

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.559
no causal link at all.

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:12.160
These correlations get called spurious correlations,
and they can be hard to catch.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.670
But when the correlation is between two VERY
specific things, like Nicholas Cage movies

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:21.009
and all drownings in 3 feet of water when
a dog was present you should be suspicious

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:24.870
that someone tried every weird subset of data
until they found a relationship.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.319
Before we finish with correlation, I just
want to warn you: r and R^2 aren’t everything;

00:10:29.319 --> 00:10:32.279
It’s important to look at a scatter plot
of data when you can.

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:36.760
These are the “Datasarus Dozen”... these
very different plots all have the same correlation,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.000
but we can see that the relationships are
completely different.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.400
Correlation is an important piece of the puzzle
when you’re looking for a linear relationship

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.240
between two variables. It goes above and beyond
the Y=mX + b and gives us information about

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.220
how well that line explains the data.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.580
Understanding the relationships between variables
and events helps us predict what things are

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.470
going to happen in the future, and also reflect
on why things occured in the past.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.249
A correlation could help you predict how much
money you’ll make after years of working

00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:10.009
your way up as a lemonade salesperson. Or
if watching that next Fast and Furious movie

00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:15.180
in the theater...might encourage people to
speed. According to an analysis by a Harvard

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.320
Medical School professor Anupam Jena those
two things do look related.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.980
Relationships are important--the human kind
and the data kind.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.300
Correlation allows us to better understand
relationships between data.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.660
And maybe also the data of our relationships.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.660
Maybe you can find correlations between the
amount of time you spend at work or school

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.100
and with how much affection your cat shows
you. Mr. Fluffy misses you.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.360
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next time.
