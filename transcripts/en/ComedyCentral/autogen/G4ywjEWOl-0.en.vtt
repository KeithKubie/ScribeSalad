- Citizens of Eggmanland,

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:09.108
I am better than all of you,

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:12.612
and you love me for it!

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.480
[cheers and applause]

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:17.450
I come to you today
with great news.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:19.552
The future is bright.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:20.720
The future is big.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:23.723
The future's soft, warm,
and cuddly.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:27.226
There's nowhere else
you wanna be but the future.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.295
It's like resting in a valley

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:32.465
between two majestic mountains.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:35.401
[cheers and applause]

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.237
You may ask,
"Where is this great future,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.339
and how do I get there?"

00:00:40.372 --> 00:00:42.208
[cheering]

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.776
I'll send you a postcard.
