00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:02.255
- [Instructor] Let's
now get some practice.

00:00:02.255 --> 00:00:04.628
Estimating multiplying with decimals.

00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:08.193
So first here, we have 7.8 times 307,

00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:10.510
is approximately equal to what?

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.334
When you see the squiggly equal sign,

00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:15.088
that means approximately equal to what.

00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:17.324
So pause this video, and
see if you can figure it out

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:18.324
on your own.

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:21.752
Alright, so the way that I
would think about doing it,

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.761
even if I was trying to do this in my head

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.407
at the supermarket or something,

00:00:25.407 --> 00:00:27.375
I'd say, well, okay,
I'd probably need paper

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:28.928
to do this properly,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.817
but gee, 7.8 is awfully close to eight,

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:36.140
and 307 is pretty close to 300,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.392
so maybe I can estimate
this by multiplying

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:39.942
eight times 300.

00:00:39.942 --> 00:00:41.281
Now, this isn't going to be exact,

00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:42.766
it's definitely going to be off,

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.058
but it's gonna give me a good sense

00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:47.451
of roughly what 7.8 times 307 is.

00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:49.532
So what is eight times 300?

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:52.388
Well, eight times three is 24,

00:00:52.388 --> 00:00:55.482
and so eight times 300 would be 2,400,

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:57.882
we got these two more
zeros, two more zeros.

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.870
And so there you have it, and luckily,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.236
the people who wrote this question

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.648
estimated in a very similar way.

00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:05.262
Two people when they
estimate might not get

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:08.724
the exact same answer, but
in this case, we happen to.

00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:11.016
Let's do another example.

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:15.099
So here, we're trying to
estimate 99.87 times 19.

00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:19.159
So pause the video again
and see if you can come up

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.581
with a good estimation.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.851
Alright, so once again, not
easy to do this in your head,

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:28.925
but this, 99 and 87/100 is pretty close,

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:30.327
let me do this in a new color,

00:01:30.327 --> 00:01:33.755
this is pretty close to 100 times,

00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:36.466
and I could multiply 100 times 19,

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.839
that's actually not so difficult,

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:40.526
so for example, I could say 100 times 19

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:43.585
is equal to 1,900, but notice,

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:44.903
we don't see that choice here,

00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:46.682
we could say, look, 1,900 is definitely

00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:49.443
much closer to 2,000
than any of these other,

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:52.063
so that might be a good approximation.

00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:53.798
Now, how did they get 2,000?

00:01:53.798 --> 00:01:55.849
Well, they rounded both of these numbers,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.094
they said, this is
approximately 100 times 20.

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:03.902
So, it's not that it's
the right thing to do,

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:05.670
to round this 19 up to 20,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.081
if you could do 100 times 19,

00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:08.039
this is actually gonna give you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.665
a slightly more accurate result

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:11.587
than doing 100 times 20,

00:02:11.587 --> 00:02:15.373
but 100 times 20 is even easier
to estimate in your head.

00:02:15.373 --> 00:02:17.546
But either way, the closest choice here,

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:18.754
and that's why, I guess, these had to be

00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:22.297
multiple choice questions, is 2,000.

00:02:22.297 --> 00:02:24.380
Let's do another example.

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:30.055
So here, we are asked to
multiply 2.21 times 5.1,

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:33.739
and we wanna know what
it approximately equals,

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.141
so once again, we are estimating,

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:38.250
so pause this video and
try to figure it out.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.644
Well, we're just gonna do the same thing

00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:41.280
we did in the last two examples.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.722
2.21, and, well, first of all,

00:02:42.722 --> 00:02:44.341
this is hard to do in my head,

00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:47.273
and so 2.21, well, that's approximately,

00:02:47.273 --> 00:02:49.465
if I round to the nearest two,

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:51.479
or to the nearest one, I should say,

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.814
this is gonna be two times five,

00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:56.894
which is equal to 10, so this would be

00:02:56.894 --> 00:03:00.021
approximately equal to
10, and that is a choice.

00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:01.068
Now, some of you might say,

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:03.547
"Whoa, there's ways to
get better estimations

00:03:03.547 --> 00:03:05.585
"that you could still do with your head,"

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.201
so for example, you could say
that this is pretty close to,

00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.992
this is approximate,
let me do it over here,

00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:14.742
this is approximately
equal to two times 5.1,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.164
this is still pretty
straightforward to do in your head,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:19.747
this would be 10.2.

00:03:21.354 --> 00:03:23.263
And so, but you'd still
say that this is by far

00:03:23.263 --> 00:03:24.361
the closest one.

00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:26.110
Or you could even say something like,

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.943
this is approximately
equal to 2.2 times five.

00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:32.394
What is this going to be equal to?

00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:34.704
Well, two times five is 10,

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:37.929
and 2/10 times five is another whole,

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.549
and so this is going to be equal to 11,

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.827
so all of these might be
things that you could estimate

00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:44.526
that you might be able to do in your head,

00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:47.353
but the important thing to
realize is however you do it,

00:03:47.353 --> 00:03:50.549
by far, 10 is going to
be the closest response

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.832
to what you're getting at,

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:53.931
and 10 would be a very natural estimation

00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:56.549
if you try to simplify
both of these numbers

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.697
when making that estimate.
