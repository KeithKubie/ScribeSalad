00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.176
Honeypot can be low or high interaction.

00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:07.981
A low interaction honeypot typically,
emulates some network services,

00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:09.515
such as the web server.

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:13.009
For example,
you can speak the HTTP protocol.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.132
On the other hand,
it is not a full version of the service.

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:20.971
For example, the emulated web server
does not have all the web content and

00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:23.310
server side programs.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.150
A low interaction honeypot is typically
sufficient to detect network skin and

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.160
probe and imminent attacks.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.530
On the other hand, a sophisticated
attacker may realize that

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.370
these services are not full version and
probably are not real.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.050
A high interaction honeypot, essentially
replicates what what a real server or

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.230
work station has in terms of operating
systems, services and applications.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.800
In other words,
they look really realistic and

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.420
they can be deployed alongside with
the real servers and work stations.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.820
Since a high induction honeypot mimics a
real server and workstation, an attacker

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.340
may be attacking it for a long time
without knowing it is a honeypot.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.360
Therefore, we can learn
more about the attacks.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.490
On the other hand, it is also quite
challenging to make a honeypot

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.100
look like a real server and workstation.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.550
For example,
we must emulate user activities and

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.120
never traffic on honeypot and
this requires

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.090
a significant amount of programming
effort as well as data storage.
