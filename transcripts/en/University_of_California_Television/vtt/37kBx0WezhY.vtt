00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.160
- This program is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.303
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:14.163
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:38.530
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.720
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.010
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.010
Our guest today is the 2008
Hitchcock professor at Berkeley.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.713
Leon Lederman is an
internationally renowned scientist

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.680
for his work on neutrinos,
ghost-like particles

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.420
that pass through
everything in the universe.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660
Among his many honors are the Wolf Prize

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.130
in Physics in 1982.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.130
And in 1988, along with Melvin Schwartz

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.180
and Jack Steinberger, he won
the Nobel Prize in physics

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.790
for his discovery of the muon neutrino

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.390
proving they're at least
two families of neutrinos.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.700
He's a founder and resident scholar

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.080
at the Illinois mathematics
and Science Academy,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.483
Director Emeritus of the Fermilab,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.080
and Pritzker professor of science

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.840
at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.140
For many years he was the
Eugene Higgins professor

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.890
of physics at Columbia,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.810
and then the Frank Salzburger professor

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.880
of physics at the University of Chicago.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.290
Professor Lederman, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.123
- Thank you.

00:01:50.123 --> 00:01:51.300
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.560
- New York City.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620
- And looking back, how do you think

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.683
your parents shaped your
thinking about the world?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.570
- That's an interesting question.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.070
Well, fundamentally, I think
they had a big role in this

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.313
because they were hard working.

00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:11.743
They were free thinkers.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.560
My father varied in his political leanings

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.440
depending on who was doing
what, and who was saying what.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.820
So he wasn't rigid in all of this.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.820
And both of them were intensely
interested in education,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.423
especially my education.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.920
We lived within about two
or three hundred yards

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.160
from a high school.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.990
I remember asking my parents
about the possibility.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.130
At that time Bronx High School of Science,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.260
famous school, didn't exist.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.270
But there was the best high school

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.390
in New York City was Stuyvesant.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.310
It's still a great high school.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.530
And I asked my mother
about the possibility

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.290
of my going to Stuyvesant.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.530
And her answer was, can
you walk to Stuyvesant?

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.910
And I said, oh, no, you
have to take a subway.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.400
She says, well, you can walk to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.260
this high school we live near.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.430
We moved here so that you
could walk to high school.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.310
It's James Monroe High School,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.720
and that's where you're going.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.820
And that's where I went.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.820
- So it was an exciting
time to be in New York City.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.160
And then the important role
that science was playing

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.420
as a result of World War II and after.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.480
I'm very curious about
how you were drawn in

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.570
as a high school kid, young person,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.186
into the culture of science, basically.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:42.390
What were the formative early experiences

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.223
that got you interested--

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.040
- Well, it was the classes.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.040
The classes were taught by
extremely competent teachers.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.980
And that was the drawing
features that I took.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.810
First, I was fascinated by
chemistry and drawn into that.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.720
And there was a young man who was

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.980
working his way through night school,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.950
but he worked in the
laboratory with glassware

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.780
and taught me how to blow glass

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.200
and shape the various
devices that you need to make

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.620
in order to filter and
precipitate various things.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.500
So I was charmed by the
chemistry initially,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.120
and the teaching of chemistry
by the high school teacher.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.230
And then a little bit later, physics.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.430
And when I was absolutely overwhelmed

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.842
by the lectures we had in physics,

00:04:43.842 --> 00:04:46.150
- This is in high school now.
- This is all in high school.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.983
- Yeah.

00:04:46.983 --> 00:04:51.983
- Yeah, and so the high school
experience was first rate.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.630
And there was also writing
exercises and creative writing.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.860
I remember going into a
class of creative writers

00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:07.710
where the teacher would tell
us how to organize words

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.310
and expressions into something,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.310
which is a little different
from standard expressions.

00:05:16.452 --> 00:05:17.940
So I had a good education.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.590
And our fellow students
were part of that education.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.060
We talked to each other about
the school work very often,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.560
and argued politics and things like that.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.560
- What was the attitude
towards science at that time

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.452
better than it is today, and therefore,

00:05:40.452 --> 00:05:43.370
there was a heroic quality
to being a scientist?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.708
- I'm not sure we could
have defined attitude.

00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:46.541
(laughing)
- Yeah.

00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:51.060
- But really, it was one of the subjects.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.700
And we didn't have a yes or a no opinion.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.700
Science was interesting,
sometimes difficult,

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.300
sometimes too easy.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.920
We took it as it was given to us.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.920
We were not aware of the crucial role

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.030
that science played in society.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.010
I mean, in school at that time,

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.650
and unfortunately, too often today,

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.530
you spend most of your time
on the content of science

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.310
but not on the significance of it,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.230
the process of science.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.800
Who becomes a scientist?

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.590
We didn't think of ourselves
as becoming scientists.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.290
We were interested in science.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.350
I guess it was the laboratory
work was fascinating,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.280
and every once in a while
something would go kaboom.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.050
And that was exciting.
(laughs)

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.020
- Were you a tinkerer?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.210
Did you like to do experiments?

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.043
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:06:46.043 --> 00:06:48.770
- Yes, actually, I had an older brother

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.210
who later turned out to
be a high school drop-out.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.500
But he had magic hands.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.060
He could do things with his hands.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.440
He could make things.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.570
And my greatest joy was in watching him.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.450
And so, when it came to
the household chores,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.490
I would do mine, and I would do his

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.440
just because if I did his chores

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.230
he would let me watch him in the basement

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.980
working with chemicals and stuff
he got from the drug store,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.130
occasionally chemistry O3

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.410
or some set of chemical experiments.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.660
He loved to tinker in that way.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.193
And I loved to watch him.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.490
- Where did you do your
undergraduate work,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.900
and then what year was that?

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.900
- Well, I started, let's see,
City College of New York,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.860
and in '39.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.630
Graduated in '43.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.950
So that was my four years of City College.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.443
And City College was
available by street car

00:07:50.443 --> 00:07:55.420
(laughs) from my house, changing twice.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.500
- You were old enough
to get on the subway.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.333
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:07:58.333 --> 00:07:59.166
Well, it wasn't the subway.

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.889
It was the surface transportation.

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.913
- And then you serviced in the military?

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.463
- Well, that came later.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.587
I was inducted into the Army in '43.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.763
Almost didn't graduate.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.000
And was in the Army for three years.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.050
- And then, graduate work,

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.850
where did you do your graduate work?

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.950
- I did my graduate work at Columbia.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.900
I got into Columbia University

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.390
when I was discharged from the Army.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.390
First thing I did was to
register as a physics major.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.290
I had switched interest
from chemistry to physics

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.610
somewhere in the inner room.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.160
I thought physics was more challenging,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.437
and in fact, in many ways,
simpler than chemistry.

00:08:54.437 --> 00:08:56.130
And it didn't have the smells.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.410
And it didn't have the
(laughing)

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.730
tribulations of sweeping up the materials

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.270
you dropped on the floor,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.850
and getting the wrong
answer on the analysis

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.090
of what mysterious stuff was there.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.460
But physics was a challenge.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.480
And that was when I really thought about

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.610
a career in science.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.613
- And in graduate school,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.203
any particular professors
who mentored you,

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.493
and who became your
dissertation advisor, and so on?

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.653
- Well, let's see.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:38.219
The physics department at
Columbia was chaired by

00:09:38.465 --> 00:09:43.465
Isidor Isaac Rabi, one of the
founders of American physics.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.110
He on the East Coast

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.510
and Robert Oppenheimer on the West Coast,

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.710
really started the American
schools of physics.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.610
And they were helped
by lots of immigration.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.223
And in fact, at Columbia,

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:05.030
Rabi had invited a
particular rather well-known

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.760
cosmic ray expert by the
name of Gilberto Bernardini.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.440
And so I tell a lot of
stories about Gilberto

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.983
because he came from Italy with a rather

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.230
severe war time experience,
and we got to know each other.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.470
And his command of English
was limited but enough.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.830
And we got to be very friendly.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.830
And I think he was a major
element in my education

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.440
because he'd been an
experienced cosmic ray scientist

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.803
and knew how to do research.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.550
But he was also different.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:59.550
He was so different from the
Anglo-Saxon professors I had.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.700
He was passionate and excitable.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.340
And the thing he taught me that I think

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.340
was the most important
was his sense of wonder.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.230
He'd walk into a room and
push the light button.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.390
The lights would go on.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.870
He'd say, fantastico!

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.150
That's Italian.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.500
It means fantastic.
(chuckles)

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.500
And then he would turn the lights off,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.250
and turn 'em on again, turn
'em off, turn 'em on again.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.833
He was amazed by simple things.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.300
If you asked him how did it happen?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.300
Well, he would say, behind
the switch there's a contact.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.540
Then the contact closes a circuit.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.740
And somewhere 100 miles away
water is falling on a wheel

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.940
and turning, and making the electricity.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.010
He would know all that.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.680
But for him, the idea that
this is a button on the wall,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.340
and you push it, and the
lights go on, was a miracle.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.340
And never tired of being
awed by simple things.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.670
- And that's really
something that you picked up.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.060
And I guess, that's an
important ingredient

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.030
in being a scientist, of maintaining that.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.320
- I think it's crucial.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.370
I mean, the sense of wonder

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:21.870
and the sense of understanding something

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.620
after working at it a long time,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.500
or the since of discovering
how something works

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.253
when you first look at
it it's total mystery.

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:34.547
You can make a discovery as a scientist,

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.450
an important discovery,
once in a lifetime,

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.470
maybe two or three times if you're

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.380
very, very fortunate and very clever.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.380
But the daily process of doing science

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.760
has to bring you some satisfaction too.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.410
You just can't wait for the discovery,

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.780
and wait for the fame, and so on.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.840
You have to enjoy the day-to-day
activities in some sense.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.200
And that's what I learned from Bernardini.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.360
- And let's explore that some more.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.890
An important component in the culture

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.670
and the attitudes of a scientist

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.710
is really being very curious,

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:22.710
wanting to know what is this
made of, how does it work?

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.940
- Well, there's a list of
qualities that go into science,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.780
and one of them is curiosity.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.770
Another one is open-mindedness.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.640
But as somebody wise-cracked,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.791
not so open that your brain falls out.

00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:43.708
(laughing)
- Yeah.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:51.559
- And then the pursuit
of answers to questions.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.763
If you're curious you wanna
know why this happened.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:02.350
You've got to take some joy
in the day-to-day processes.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.168
Most of the time, you're developing tools.

00:14:07.168 --> 00:14:11.240
I was more interested
in experimental science

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.680
than theoretical science.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.160
And so, being familiar with tools

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.160
and getting them to work
was part of the daily grind.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.760
- A lot of frustration
in that daily grind?

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.700
- Oh, sure, sure.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.270
- Things break?

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.293
- Things break.
They don't work.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.943
You make stupid mistakes.

00:14:37.174 --> 00:14:40.317
Your elbow knocks over
a flask of something,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.620
some gook that (laughing)
you shouldn't have dropped.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.240
There's all kinds of disappointments
that go into science,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.010
especially if you're kind of clumsy.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.050
And I was probably among the more clumsy

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.570
of the experimental scientist.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.632
- There seems to be this interplay

00:15:01.632 --> 00:15:05.667
as you become socialized into science

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:09.480
of knowing where the work is,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.450
where the important problems are.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.159
So developing experience in that regard.

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:19.490
And on the other hand, being creative

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.790
and sort of looking at something anew.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.790
Talk a little about that tension

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.663
between experience and creativity.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.530
- Oh, it's tough.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.363
It's tough.

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:34.963
Creativity is something
we talk a lot about,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.010
especially in the search
for graduate students,

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:43.750
or even in your dealing
with high school students

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:44.583
once in a while.

00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:47.390
And creativity is a
property you wish you had

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.610
this kind of magic paper.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.790
You put it to the tongue of the student,

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.390
and if it turns orange he's creative.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.770
But there's no measurement of creativity.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.650
You can find kids who are
excellent at solving problems.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.423
They can do all the problems
in the back of the book.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.850
They can get good grades on exams.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.933
But creativity is a more subtle thing.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.840
It's very hard to predict creativity

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.500
unless you spend a lot
of time with a student,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.100
and you begin to see how
the student's mind works

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.470
when it comes to certain problems.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.620
And when the student says something

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.370
that you don't understand,

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.670
and little by little you grasp

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.160
what the student is getting at.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.800
And even though his
articulation may be poor,

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.810
you suddenly see his thinking.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:44.810
He's got an idea, and he
or she may be creative.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.080
Creativity is a subtle thing.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.617
And of course, in your
own pursuit of science,

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.710
sometimes you'll wake up
at three in the morning

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.170
with an idea.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.750
And then you want to record it.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.180
You might forget it.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.330
Is it a good idea?

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.230
Well, we'll see what it
looks like in the morning.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.440
Sometimes you get an idea,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.740
and you don't even wanna
think about the idea

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.590
because more often than not
the idea you think is good

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.970
turns out to be a flop.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.380
A soon as you explain
it to your colleague,

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.340
or your professor, or someone,

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.440
they say, oh, that doesn't work.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.750
And more often than not,
that's what happens with ideas.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.880
But from time to time, the idea will live.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.280
And you get more courage
about it with time,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.550
and eventually you have enough nerve

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.740
to broach it to your colleagues.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.320
And they will, of course,

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.850
start throwing blackboard
erasers at you, and chalk.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.950
And saying, that's crazy.
Go away.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.690
But you stick with it, and
ultimately, you can sell it.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.810
And then suddenly, your team has

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.440
a pursuit that's very interesting.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.920
- And so, what I'm
hearing you say is that,

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.610
also another tension
between self-confidence,

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.130
and arrogance, and being
comfortable with your own ideas,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.963
running with them.

00:18:07.963 --> 00:18:10.840
But then on the other
hand, working with teams

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.480
to move the idea forward.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.210
- That's crucial.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.210
I mean, and especially
in experimental science,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.763
where you really have to work with people.

00:18:24.213 --> 00:18:27.530
A, to get financial support.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.700
B, to get equipment together.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.300
C, just the sheer effort
of getting an experiment

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.860
together requires collaboration.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.360
So collaborative research
is how I grew up.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.360
Really is being crucial is to
get people to work with you,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:52.583
whether they're students or
colleagues, usually both,

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.910
is an important part of the whole issue.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.830
That means you have to be convincing.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.720
I've got an idea.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.623
Oh, come on.

00:19:02.987 --> 00:19:04.820
But you keep persisting,

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.510
and eventually you get a discussion going.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.590
And maybe they'll say, yeah,
yeah, it is a good idea.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.910
Or they'll say, it would be a good idea,

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.410
but you forgot the following principle.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:20.390
And so that interaction
with your colleagues

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.940
is a very important part of science.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.443
- You focused in your
work on particle physics.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.416
How did you come to that field?

00:19:30.416 --> 00:19:34.120
And help us understand what
it is and why it's important.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.120
- Well, I must say that,
we're now talking 1950,

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.940
and particle physics was a
new subject in some sense.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:47.560
And we didn't know we were
breaking in a new subject,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.607
but we were working with
the properties of matter.

00:19:53.654 --> 00:19:58.654
You look at a piece of wood,
and you can splinter it,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.420
and you being to realize
the chemical composition,

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.120
and then you go beyond
the chemical composition

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.390
of the material into detail properties.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:15.390
We were in a field in which
the atom was an old story.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.840
Atomic physics was thriving,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.380
but we knew the properties of atoms.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.910
But there were other things that happened

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.710
that had to do with production of energy

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.603
and mostly in machines.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.880
So there were particle accelerators.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.660
We had a Columbia, thanks
to the efforts of Rabi,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.400
built, at that time, was one
of the world's most powerful

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.670
newspapers called an Atom Smasher.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.930
We keep saying, we don't smash atoms.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.201
We love atoms.

00:20:55.201 --> 00:20:56.495
(laughing)

00:20:56.495 --> 00:20:59.020
But this was a way of generating

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.980
a lot energy into a small space.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.510
And because of that energy,
particles would appear

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:09.510
via Einstein's famous
equation, E=mc squared,

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.250
energy and mass were connected.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.400
And by producing a lot of
energy with this machine

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.730
we could create new masses,
and study those masses,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:24.343
and begin to get a vision
and an understanding

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.100
of the microstructure of matter.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.520
In other words, what's
inside is the key thing.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.780
So what's inside the atom?

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.610
Well, there's a nucleus.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.050
And then there are
electrons on the outside.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.800
What's inside the nucleus?

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.600
Well, there are protons and neutrons.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.770
And we continued that process.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.890
It was called reductionist, if you like.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.810
We wanted to reduce the
properties of matter

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.470
to their simplest forms,

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.110
and then see how these
simple forms combine

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.400
to make the more complicated things,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.400
which we recognize as quantitative matter.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:13.270
And again, it's a combination
of energy and imagination,

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.620
sprinkled with a little bit of good luck.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.510
And all of a sudden you found the particle

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.420
that nobody knew existed.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.530
- And ultimately, this
really moves into cosmology

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:31.330
to answer questions about
how it all came into being.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.300
- Well, that's a good statement

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.350
because, in fact, today
we have a new subject

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.860
that's called particle astrophysics.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:45.860
It turns out that our study
of the structure of matter

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:52.530
turned out to be crucial
to the larger picture

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.593
of the structure of the universe.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.870
Planets we knew about
because we live on one.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.740
And so we were experienced.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.740
But then there were galaxies
and millions of suns,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.470
each son having its share
of planets around them.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.480
And so the two subjects, in fact,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.850
turned out to be very closely related.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.280
And when I became director of Fermilab,

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.300
the first thing I did was to create

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.320
a group of astrophysicist,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.320
even though the lab
itself was the repository

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.980
of one of the largest
accelerators in the world.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.160
And that accelerator is
like a big microscope.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.210
So you can look at the small.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.290
But at the same time, we knew that

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.230
if you're going to try
to understand the cosmos

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.600
you have to have a good knowledge of

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.330
the fundamental structures.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:57.330
So particles in cosmology
became a unified quest.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.073
Very exciting and still is.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.610
- Help us understand what
you and your colleagues

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.520
got the Nobel Prize for.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.190
Can you, if I sit here and introduce you

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.660
and say that you did
important work with neutrinos,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.363
people out there are scratching
their head and so on.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.563
- Well, it's a bit of a story.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:29.630
We cataloged the various particles.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.880
And then electron was
an important particle.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.613
It had an electric charge.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.160
It had a certain mass.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.950
We measured the properties of
the electron in great detail

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.460
that was discovered in 1890 something.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.040
And the properties of the
electron were viewed upon

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.520
for the next hundred years to
know more and more about it.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.270
We then also discovered radioactivity,

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.440
and the processes by which spontaneously

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.750
particles would explode

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.580
and give rise to lesser mass particles.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.330
And one of those particles was a neutrino.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:11.120
It was named, of course, by Enrico Fermi,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.754
because it had an Italian sound.

00:25:13.754 --> 00:25:15.384
(Italian accent)
Neutrino.

00:25:15.384 --> 00:25:16.453
Neutrino.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.420
It literally, the small neutral one.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:26.420
And these neutrinos were
produced in radioactivity.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.480
And then it turned out
that there was a puzzle

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.100
in the properties of the neutrino

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.210
that we thought was
pretty well understood.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.810
Wherever you had radioactivity,

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.623
you have the emission of neutrinos.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.660
And then we actually, at that time,

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.190
and looking at some of these
processes were very puzzled.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.880
And eventually, the puzzle was clarified

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.380
by the assumption that there were

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.410
two different kinds of neutrinos.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.680
One kind related closely to the electron,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.030
and the other kind,
that was the new thing,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.960
related to a cousin of the
electron called a muon.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.000
And so, our prize was given for

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.910
the discovery of the muon neutrino.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.620
And so there were two
families of neutrinos.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.720
One related to the electron.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.750
One related to the muon,

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.710
which is a heavy cousin of the electron.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:33.350
Now we know.
Had we known then,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.499
maybe they wouldn't
have given us the prize.

00:26:35.499 --> 00:26:38.490
But there are in fact
three kinds of neutrinos.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.410
There's one related to the electron,

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:44.770
one related to the muon,
and one related to the tau.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.260
Nevermind.
(laughing)

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.520
You don't wanna go into that much detail.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.520
But we essentially clarified
the structure of neutrinos

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.917
by means of this muon type neutrino.

00:27:01.917 --> 00:27:06.303
And that involved using the
most powerful accelerator.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:13.080
And producing essentially
a stream of radioactivity

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.700
and a wall about 20 feet thick,

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.610
which stopped all
radioactivity except neutrinos,

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.310
which were very penetrating.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.370
We know, for example, that
right now we're sitting here,

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:31.210
and somewhere if it's
after 10 o'clock at night,

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.470
there are neutrinos coming from the sun,

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.690
which is on the other
side of the planet Earth

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.350
and pouring through the
Earth, very penetrating.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.283
Coming through us, and then
going on off somewhere.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.980
So the electron neutrino
properties was sort of known.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.000
And then now we had
another kind of neutrino,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.150
which we call a muon neutrino,

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.830
which in all of it's reactions

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.900
was associated with
this muon type particle.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.140
So that structure became clear

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.990
as a result of our experiments.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.260
And the King of Sweden was
very curious about this

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.570
and sent for us.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.760
And there was a great party.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.930
I recommend it highly.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.320
- This is the Nobel Prize now.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.153
- Yes, that's right.

00:28:13.153 --> 00:28:14.270
- And I think I read
somewhere that you said

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.790
that you had Swedish holy
water sprinkled on you.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.153
- That's another way of talking about it.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:26.580
- I'm curious, how long was
the experiment in preparation?

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.180
I mean, what was the lead
up time to actually saying,

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.630
we need to do this, and
then implementing the--

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.640
- I think it was a couple of years.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.640
This was '59 to '61 we did the experiment.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.260
And by '61 we had clarified this.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:55.150
But the committee are slow readers, so.

00:28:55.598 --> 00:28:56.820
(laughing)

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.690
And there were so many
good things happening

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:02.183
in science in those
days that it took to 80,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.400
I guess '88 when we were
actually awarded the prize

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.360
and had our trip to Sweden.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.410
- And so you do the experiment,

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.810
and then is there like a
wow moment at that time?

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.730
Talk about the fruits of your labor

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.360
and you're experiencing,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.270
is it a moment or does it take
longer to analyze the data?

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:29.103
Yeah.

00:29:29.103 --> 00:29:30.218
- It's a series of moments.

00:29:30.218 --> 00:29:32.652
You set up the equipment,

00:29:32.652 --> 00:29:36.700
and in this particular case, and you wait.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.130
And I remember once, it usually happens

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.350
at three in the morning
or something like that.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.530
You're watching the apparatus,

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.370
and suddenly the apparatus is telling you

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.760
something happened.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.800
And you look at the data, and you see that

00:29:55.115 --> 00:29:58.532
a particle appears and makes a collusion.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.520
And out of that collusion
comes some energy,

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.570
and the energy goes a certain
distance and then stops.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.930
And when you analyze that,
the only thing it could be

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.120
is a neutrino type particle,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.510
which disintegrated
and gave rise to a muon

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.970
rather than an electron.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.150
So this was, whereas all
the neutrinos before this

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.880
were related to electrons,

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.100
we had succeeded in making a stream

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.320
of different kinds of neutrinos,

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.003
which were related to the muon.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.520
We checked this, and rechecked
it, and rechecked it,

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.680
and finally, we were convinced that

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.780
this a different kind of neutrino.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.370
And we announced it, and published it,

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:48.150
ang gave a lot of talks
all over the place.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.490
This was in the early 60s.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:54.030
And then went on to many, many
other kinds of experiments.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.910
But eventually, the Nobel committee

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.260
came to this particular discovery.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:06.260
A lot of Nobel Prizes really
require more information

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.710
than just the experiment
that makes the discovery.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.180
It has to be in a context.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:19.180
And what happened was, a
structure of fundamental particles

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.620
was beginning to take shape.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.620
And knowing the existence
of a muon neutrino

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:30.530
was crucial to building that structure.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.740
And so, that's when the prize was awarded.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.360
- And so, it's not just the
recognition of the Nobel,

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.250
but it's the recognition over time

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.970
of the fellow scientist
of what you have done.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.803
- That's right.

00:31:44.803 --> 00:31:47.330
It fit into a pattern.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:52.330
And the pattern became clarified
by that experiment as so.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.930
- Now, being able to do this, obviously,

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.080
required these accelerators,

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.250
which in a way were a major investment

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.130
by the government presumably,

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.900
and also by Columbia University.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.670
So talk a little about that

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.950
because in this recent period
there has been a decline

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:19.950
of that commitment to funding big science,

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.480
but that was not the case
when you were able to do this.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.510
- Well, I think there's a pattern.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.570
I mean, the structure
of elementary particles

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:35.230
is now very largely understood.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.560
It's called the standard model.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.560
And so it's a little
bit like in chemistry.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.690
There's something that decorates the walls

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:50.690
of all the chemistry
classes around the planet.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.400
And that's called the periodic
table of the elements.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.270
So you have hydrogen
here, and helium here,

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:01.640
and you have all the hundred
or so chemical elements.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.670
And knowing that, that's the
battle flag of chemistry.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.160
That's the whole subject of chemistry

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.520
is involved with that periodic table.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.120
Well, we have a different periodic table

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:18.230
at a scale much, much finer
than the chemical scale,

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.880
and that is the fundamental particles.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.330
And we now know that the neutrino,

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:30.330
there's the standard model has
electrons, muons, and taus,

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:39.200
leptons, and then it has
the heaver particles,

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.200
the strange quarks, the charm
quark, the strange quark,

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.170
and in a pattern.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.300
And that's like a periodic table.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.960
In other words, everything we have,

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.070
everything we know about in matter

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.980
is composed of various
components of that standard model

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.980
providing you know not only the
properties of the particles,

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.250
but their social behavior.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:09.190
How does the muon behave
compared to the tau?

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:14.060
Or how does a top quark behave
compared to the bottom quark?

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.010
We have these funny names for things.

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:22.010
But the standard model is a
very powerful summary of nature.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:29.750
And we're (chuckles), I could
say we're charmed by this

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.590
because there's a charm quark too.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:38.590
But today we're left
with this standard model

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.730
and some very, very mysterious puzzles.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:47.730
So I think, and hopefully,
we try to, in the U.S.,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.710
to build a particle accelerator

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.523
that would address these puzzles.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.580
It was canceled by congress in 1993

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.510
for reasons which are complicated

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.233
and probably not worth going into.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.980
And then the Europeans led in

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.410
the construction of a new accelerator.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.760
And the U.S. and all
the other major nations

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.930
contributed to this.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.290
So it's a world collaboration.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.550
It's being built in Switzerland.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:24.550
And it turned on six or seven months ago,

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.010
and then had some difficulties.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.180
And we expect it to start up again

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.170
and within the next few months.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.970
And yeah, it'll take another year or so

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.720
to become familiar with this huge machine,

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.520
very huge, very expensive machine.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.240
But the whole world of industrial nations

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.810
that are interested in science
have contributed to this.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.730
So we expect that some of
our puzzles will be solved

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.150
when this machine really gets going

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:59.270
and begins to explore parts of nature

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.360
that have not yet been explored.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.580
- But before we talk about your work

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.550
in trying to transform science
education for young people,

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.940
I have a question because an
important period in your career

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.953
is you were director of the Fermilab.

00:36:21.468 --> 00:36:26.170
And I'm curious about
what from that experience

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:30.770
you learned about organizing bit science.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:33.600
Because as we face challenges

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.730
such as the environment and so on,

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.780
we're gonna have to be thinking about

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.860
science at the strategic level.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.073
Do you have any insights that
come from that experience?

00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:49.503
- A lot.
I mean, this is big science.

00:36:49.503 --> 00:36:51.480
I other words, it's big expensive science.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.243
It involves large machines.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:58.780
We're comfortable with the notion that

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.430
when we do big science,
there are byproducts of this

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:06.270
that are societally very beneficial.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.700
And so, there are many, many examples

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.700
where the quest for
understanding in an abstract way

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.880
gives rise to very useful offshoots

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:24.910
and a broadening of our
deep knowledge of things,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.600
which have to do almost anything

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.120
you wanna do with human activity.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:36.120
So we're confident that
research pays, in some sense,

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.783
even though it may sound
to be very abstract.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:46.780
Yet, today, if you got up on a platform

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:52.970
and said, we really have
to build some xyz machine,

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.000
you would probably be ushered out

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.250
because this is a time of economic chaos

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.720
and environmental catastrophe,

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.943
and all kinds of problems
we have, health care,

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:11.550
many, many issues that
our government is facing

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.103
that require a lot of attention.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.573
Nevertheless, in spite of that,

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:21.110
many of us feel that ultimately

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.010
both science and education
are essential features

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.910
in getting out of this problem.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.430
Because if you make a
list of all the problems

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.460
that our president is facing
and that our congress is facing

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.270
and make a list, you begin to see that

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.820
addressing those problems is gonna require

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.670
scientific knowledge, scientific wisdom,

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:48.670
engineering wisdom, and understanding.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.990
So we can't give up on our quest for

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:58.340
understanding of how nature works,

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:03.340
and the process of
understanding the world.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.320
And then today, there are some mysteries

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.640
that come from the thing you
raised earlier, the cosmology.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.230
Cosmology, there's a.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.450
At Fermilab when I was a director

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:19.640
I started a cosmology group,

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:24.000
and it became one of the more
powerful groups in the nation,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
in which cosmology plays a
role in the macroscopic world

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:35.892
of galaxies of trillions and
trillions of miles across

00:39:35.892 --> 00:39:40.892
to the microscopic world
of sub-nuclear particles.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.960
It's the big and the small
combined in many ways.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:52.640
And so, we're very anxious
to continue our research.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.600
We don't wanna stop research

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.250
because there are too many things

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.900
that will come out of
it that will be useful.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.250
And of course, direct research on

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.660
environmental energy sources is crucial.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.520
We know that many things,
we know what to do,

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.840
and other things we don't know what to do.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.930
And so, we just let curiosity play a role,

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.393
and we follow that in the best way we can.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:25.690
- Let's talk now about the
need to revise the curriculum

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.490
to change our public
schools so we can create

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.410
another generation of
scientists like yours.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:36.410
You're a critic of the current curriculum.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.190
What's wrong with it,

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:42.480
and what are the
difficulties in changing it?

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.811
- Well, curriculum is, first of all,

00:40:44.811 --> 00:40:48.763
it was designed in 1890 something,

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:56.140
which was perfectly okay
in 1890 to teach biology.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.390
And after biology, chemistry.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.930
And after chemistry, physics.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.713
It's alphabetically okay.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:08.790
But it turns out that
in 1890 that was okay.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:15.210
But in 1930s we made major discoveries,

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.930
which show that chemistry and
physics are closely allied.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:23.460
That there's no phenomenon in chemistry

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.790
that doesn't require an explanation

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.290
which goes through your
knowledge of physics.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:30.600
And same thing with biology.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.670
Biology now is the most
complicated of all subjects.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:39.670
And therefore, it should
wait for an understanding

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.570
of physics and chemistry before you tackle

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.720
the big subject of biology, and life,

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.480
and processes of that kind.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.683
But our schools are not adapting to it.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.520
The old criterion of starting
in 9th grade with biology,

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.660
then going to chemistry,
and then going to physics

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.790
in the U.S. is done in 92%,

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.610
or some number like
that, of all our schools.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.150
And it's out of date.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:14.280
It's wrong.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.680
It doesn't take into
account all of the knowledge

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.140
we've gained in the 20th century

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.250
about chemistry, physics, and biology.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:25.040
They are connected subjects now,

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.930
and we have to teach them that way.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.693
Our schools are failing to produce,

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:35.070
not only failing to
produce the kind of quality

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:38.850
and number of dedicated scientists,

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.500
to me I'm more worried about

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.900
the ignorance of the general public.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.650
What we need is public science literacy.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.630
We need the public to have some
grasp, not to be scientist,

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.120
but to have a grasp of how science works.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.410
Because they're gonna vote.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:55.270
They're going to elect.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:58.140
They're going to, the
government is gonna seek

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.550
their approval for lots of things.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:03.230
Do we need more nuclear weapons today?

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:06.290
Maybe we don't need any that we have now.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:10.200
There are many issues in which you need

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.720
a public science literacy,
and we don't have it.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.210
We're not producing it
in the high schools.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.700
We're not producing it in the colleges.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:23.410
And I particularly find
fault with universities

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:28.120
who have a responsibility for
producing educated citizens.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.840
But an educated citizen
has to have a grasp

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.670
of what science is, what science can do,

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.650
what science cannot do.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.323
And that's where we're failing.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.100
- The changes you were
suggesting yesterday

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.810
in your lecture that are required,

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:48.600
one is really involved in
changing the role of the teacher.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.600
When I grew up, one, the
teacher was an authority figure

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:59.270
who passed on, this is the
information that we have.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.300
And you're suggesting really,

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.000
we've gotta really overhaul
that notion of the teacher.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.810
- Well, yes, I think.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.800
I mean, and the way I put it
is you wake up one morning

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.120
and you're the President
of the United States.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.510
And you won on a mandate
of fixing education.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:19.660
And the pentagon doesn't know
what to do with all the money.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.140
So you have infinite resources.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:22.973
What do you do?

00:44:22.973 --> 00:44:25.140
The first thing usually you do is

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.520
you look at the teacher core.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.970
And there are some
wonderful teachers around.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:34.970
But the teacher education
is essentially poorly done.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.490
Teachers are not well-educated,

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.360
especially in mathematics and science.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.663
So you look at primary school teachers.

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:45.920
It's a disaster.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.430
And that's not only in the U.S.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.670
In most countries primary school teachers

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.150
are not trained in math and science,

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:55.990
and yet, small children are eager to know

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.680
and learn, and enjoy the beauty,

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:04.290
and the fun of mathematics and science.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.220
It's supposed to be a glorious activity.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.080
It should be fun.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.323
Teachers don't see that.

00:45:09.323 --> 00:45:11.430
They're not trained well enough,

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.670
especially primary school teachers.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:17.080
So teacher education
becomes a major thing.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:22.080
And teacher, it's not
only the pay of teachers,

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.260
which is inadequate,

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.670
but it's the social status of
teachers, which is inadequate.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:32.110
So we have to pay attention
to respect of teachers.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.710
In Germany, I think,

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:37.620
a kindergarten teacher's a Frau professor.

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.220
We have to give teachers,

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.900
and teachers have to earn, respect.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.430
And that doesn't happen.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.640
I've seen, often I'd sit in a classroom

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.190
after discussing something with a teacher,

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.300
and just as she erases the blackboard,

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.960
out comes the loudspeaker saying,

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.430
all teachers hand in
their attendance summary.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.500
How dare you interrupt a teacher

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.700
in the holy moment of teaching

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.230
for some stupidity,
administrative stupidity.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:12.440
So it show a lack of the kind of respect

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.691
we have to have for our teachers.

00:46:14.691 --> 00:46:18.670
They have to earn it, but they
have to have that respect.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.010
They have to have the remuneration.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:26.010
We have to look carefully at
present high school students

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.630
for potential teachers,
and glamorize the teachers,

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.920
and make more movies about teachers

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.020
like famous movie, Dead Poets Society.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:39.020
We have to embroil the media in elevating

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.980
the task of teaching
because that's so crucial

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.070
to improving your educational system.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.523
And our system isn't working.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.320
- A third point that I heard you making is

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.300
that we have to re-figure
how we teach science,

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:05.190
and in a way draw in
the humanities in a way.

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:10.290
And I think you're suggesting
that story telling,

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:15.840
stories what we think of
in the literature courses,

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.460
in a way, have to be brought into science.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.140
So scientist become attractive.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.850
Their stories become attractive.

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.680
The steps in there doing
the work become important.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.410
- Yeah, I think the key word is process.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:33.520
Right now, when we teach science,

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.790
let's say even a reasonably good teacher,

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:38.600
and maybe it's 9th grade, 10th grade,

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.020
the content of science is taught.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.950
So you learn about
velocity, and acceleration,

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:46.200
and momentum, and energy,

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.300
all these things that have
to do with the content.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.360
But there's another aspect to science,

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.610
and that's even more important

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.940
if we're thinking not
about future scientists

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.500
as much as by our future citizens,

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.720
future family members who
have to make decisions,

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.540
future voters who have to make decisions.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:09.280
For that, we need to
teach, what is science?

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.690
How does it worK?

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:12.460
Does it ever go wrong?

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.620
If it goes wrong, how do we fix it?

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:17.260
There are many questions
that have to do with

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.550
the process of science rather
than the content of science,

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:23.020
or in addition to the content of science.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:28.020
So my strong feeling is
that we sacrifice maybe 20%,

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.050
or maybe 30% of content for process,

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.610
for telling stories
about how science works,

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:38.750
how we made discoveries.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.032
What is a scientist?

00:48:40.032 --> 00:48:42.280
How do they grow?

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.683
How do they behave?

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.800
What makes exciting science?

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.460
Is science ever wrong?

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:50.510
If it's wrong, how do we fix it?

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.620
Many, many issues that have to do with

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:57.530
the process of science is
part of being educated.

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:02.460
So I'm shocked when college presidents

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.310
decide that the science
requirement for this college

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.700
will be a semester of what
they call rocks for jocks,

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.855
or something.
(laughing)

00:49:10.855 --> 00:49:12.870
In a non-serious way.

00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:17.230
I actually believe that
University of Chicago,

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:19.660
which is probably more advanced than most,

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:24.200
requires two full years of
science for all its graduates.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.380
You don't graduate from
the University of Chicago

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.380
without two full years of science.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.620
One in biological sciences,

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:33.550
the other in physical
sciences with laboratory.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:36.380
And even that may not be enough to produce

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.960
what you would call an educated citizen

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.970
who can participate in many decisions.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:44.730
Now, again, if you go back and look at

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.380
all the problems poor Mr. Obama is facing,

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.860
all those problems have a science side.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.050
It's not that science
can fix all the problems,

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.140
but the knowledge of science is crucial

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.900
to these environmental
catastrophe we're facing

00:50:02.812 --> 00:50:05.953
even to the failure of our economy.

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.190
And you look one after
another at these problems,

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.280
and they're not all fixed by science,

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.910
but they are all have a role,

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:19.910
science has a role to paly
in repairing our society.

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:23.240
And I think our education
system is not up to it.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.290
That's what we have to do.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:29.290
We have to really begin to
say that we need a total,

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:35.370
not reform, but transform
nation of the way we teach.

00:50:39.063 --> 00:50:43.130
- In your work, and just talking
with you about your career,

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.330
one has the sense that you have,

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.920
you develop in your work
a sense of the particular,

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.150
the little thing that you have to do,

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:51.880
but also at the same time a sense of

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.700
the big picture in science.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:57.370
I'm curious, when you look
at the educational system,

00:50:57.370 --> 00:51:00.240
do we fix the whole thing at once,

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.850
or is it a step-by-step process?

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:04.807
And if so, what is the first step?

00:51:04.807 --> 00:51:07.091
- Now you're over my salary level.

00:51:07.091 --> 00:51:08.593
(laughing)
- I see, okay.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.660
- We had some ideas about what to do.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.100
Clearly, if you look at our
system you see where it's wrong.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.330
We have 50 states.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.660
We have 16,000 school districts

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.360
and very little communication

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.100
between different parts of the country.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:32.310
I mean, does New Jersey
know what Montana's doing.

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:33.853
And if a poor teacher
goes from one to another,

00:51:33.853 --> 00:51:37.084
does she have to learn a new language.

00:51:37.084 --> 00:51:42.084
We have this incoherent
array of things now.

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:46.347
I do believe that local
participation is very important.

00:51:46.347 --> 00:51:51.347
You just can't shut out the
parents and the local people.

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:52.990
But that doesn't mean that you

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:55.380
can't have better communication.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.100
I think the states have
to organize themselves.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.120
I think the business community should play

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.800
an extremely important role in unifying

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:09.560
the different state activities.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.010
There's a business higher
education round table

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:15.410
that issues papers.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.610
There's an enormous
amount of literature out.

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:19.850
They are telling us what's wrong

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.770
with our educational
system and how to fix it.

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:26.440
What's missing, what's
missing is a mechanism

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:29.593
for implementing all the good
ideas that are out there.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.370
We're missing an implementation structure,

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.420
and that's very important.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.610
Remember when Sputnik.

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:40.910
Well, we had a crisis in Sputnik.

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:45.910
And we needed an organization
that could allow us

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:49.580
to compete with the Soviets in space.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.950
It was called NASA.

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:53.960
So we created NASA before it existed.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.270
We needed that.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:58.650
In the same way now, I think
we need an organization,

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:01.980
a compact, not administrative,

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:06.980
but really philosophical
group that looks at

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:09.830
the needs of our educational system,

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:14.130
and does all the propaganda,
gets the media involved,

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:15.460
gets the public involved.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:20.360
We've gotta have an Oprah
Winfrey type of support system

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.193
form the public.

00:53:21.193 --> 00:53:25.840
If the public is not joining
into this revolution,

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.810
it won't work.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:27.990
We've gotta get the public.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.560
We've gotta explain to the general public

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.830
why it's so important that
our educational system

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:35.930
be brought into the 21st century.

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.520
That's where we are.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.040
- One final question
looking back on your career,

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.340
is there a piece of
advice, one piece of advice

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.470
that you would give students out there

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.600
who might wanna become scientists,

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.380
or citizens out there who wanna become

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:53.070
more scientifically informed?

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:55.066
- Well, I think the advice is,

00:53:55.066 --> 00:54:00.066
I think that the public has
to be aware of the problem.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:04.280
And the public has to be realistic.

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:07.690
I mean, too often, parents charge in

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.030
without knowing enough about
what it is that has to be done.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:17.410
And I've seen this sometimes
with disastrous results.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:20.990
So we need a sympathetic public.

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:25.460
And what we need is leading
citizens that might take

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:32.860
advise, and lead, and cajole, and so on.

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:35.790
Because if the public
really gets upset now,

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:38.020
and begins to understand the repercussions

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.833
of a failed education system,

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:44.523
and the things we have to do to fix it,

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.330
if they don't get involved
in this nothing will happen.

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:52.710
So we need public leadership,
people who can lead.

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:57.710
And certainly, we've
never been, in my memory,

00:54:57.950 --> 00:55:00.760
as well off as we are now in Washington

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.610
with gifted leadership.

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.700
But unfortunately, we
have so many problems,

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:11.700
one on top the other, that
may frustrate the great power

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.440
that we now, in principle,

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.470
could bring to bear on the problem.

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:22.220
- And what about advice to
students who wanna be scientists?

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:26.330
- Well, that's, it's a wonderful career.

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:29.980
I mean, the main thing about science

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.580
that people ought to be aware
of is how much fun it is

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:33.824
and how beautiful it is.

00:55:33.824 --> 00:55:38.700
And the joy of doing
science is something that

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:42.380
more scientist should not be
embarrassed about extolling.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.043
I mean, it's fun.

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:49.900
Sometimes you're looking for
somebody in a science building,

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.650
and there's noise, and
you suddenly realize

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:53.880
there are three or four scientist.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.810
They're rolling on the floor laughing.

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:56.643
Why are they laughing?

00:55:56.643 --> 00:56:01.380
Well, they just worked for
three years on some subject,

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.360
and they couldn't solve it.

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.730
And all of a sudden, they solved it.

00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:07.690
And the solution was so
simple and so beautiful

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:09.700
that they just burst into laughter.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:14.700
I think that joy of science
is there if you work at it.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.740
It's fun, it's beautiful,
and it's profitable.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.970
