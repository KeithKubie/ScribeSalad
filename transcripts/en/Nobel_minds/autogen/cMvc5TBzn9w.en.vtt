hi I'm Mike Considine and I'll read

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310
hi I'm Mike Considine and I'll read
 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.789
hi I'm Mike Considine and I'll read
Gilligan and I'm reek a shower and we're

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
Gilligan and I'm reek a shower and we're

physics students at st. rose high school

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600
physics students at st. rose high school
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.600
physics students at st. rose high school
and our question is this universal

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
and our question is this universal
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.669
and our question is this universal
expansion have any ties with the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679
expansion have any ties with the
 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.480
expansion have any ties with the
original big bang theory oh hi Mike and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
original big bang theory oh hi Mike and
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.029
original big bang theory oh hi Mike and
read and read yes the universal

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
read and read yes the universal
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.160
read and read yes the universal
expansion today is the result of the Big

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
expansion today is the result of the Big
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.320
expansion today is the result of the Big
Bang that happened 13.7 billion years

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
Bang that happened 13.7 billion years
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.730
Bang that happened 13.7 billion years
ago yes they're directly tied together

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740
ago yes they're directly tied together
 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.099
ago yes they're directly tied together
what we think is that the Big Bang

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
what we think is that the Big Bang
 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.859
what we think is that the Big Bang
started the expanding universe and then

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
started the expanding universe and then
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540
started the expanding universe and then
for the first nine billion years of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550
for the first nine billion years of
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.760
for the first nine billion years of
history the universe was slowing down

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
history the universe was slowing down
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.819
history the universe was slowing down
after the Big Bang coasting as the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
after the Big Bang coasting as the
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.709
after the Big Bang coasting as the
gravitation pulled back the expansion

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
gravitation pulled back the expansion
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930
gravitation pulled back the expansion
but for some reason that we call the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
but for some reason that we call the
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090
but for some reason that we call the
dark energy the universe has now been

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
dark energy the universe has now been
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.860
dark energy the universe has now been
accelerating again for the last five

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
accelerating again for the last five
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420
accelerating again for the last five
billion years and this is a great

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
billion years and this is a great
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.160
billion years and this is a great
mystery one of the great mysteries of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
mystery one of the great mysteries of
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.709
mystery one of the great mysteries of
modern science so we can't tell you why

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
modern science so we can't tell you why
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.810
modern science so we can't tell you why
that is but we hope to tell you more in

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
that is but we hope to tell you more in
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630
that is but we hope to tell you more in
a few years or decades as we learn more

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
a few years or decades as we learn more
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.750
a few years or decades as we learn more
about the dark energy
