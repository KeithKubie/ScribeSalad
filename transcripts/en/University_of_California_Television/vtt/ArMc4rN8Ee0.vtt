00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:08.270
(bright upbeat music)

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.300
- Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.470
And thanks Ellen for a great organization.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.190
My name is Rui de Figueiredo,
I'm emeritus professor

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.130
at the Haas School of Business

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.260
in the Department of Political
Science here at Berkeley.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.320
And, I'm also the chair of the
Weinstock Lecture Committee.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.080
Along with the graduate division
and the graduate council

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.550
of the academic senate,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.900
I'm very pleased to
welcome today's speaker

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.563
Professor Samuel Bowles.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.890
This year's speaker

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.360
in the Barbara Weinstock
Lectures on the Morals of Trade.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.550
I'll introduce Dr. Bowles in a minute.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.200
But, first let me take
a moment to tell you how

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.610
the endowment supporting the lectures

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.430
came to the University
of California Berkeley.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.200
In 1902 Harris Weinstock,
a well known business man

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.390
based in Sacramento, provided
the university with a fund

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.410
in honor of his wife Barbara,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.100
who the lectures are named after,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.800
to support an annual public
lecture on the morals of trade.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.410
Weinstock explained his
motivations in an article written

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.970
after the first lecture
was delivered in 1904.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.507
Thus, he said, "Hope is in the air

00:01:37.507 --> 00:01:39.807
"and there is a better
and clearer day in store

00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:41.687
"for all destined to spend their lives

00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:43.367
"in commercial pursuits.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:46.927
"The thing to do at this hour
is to accelerate the movement

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:48.727
"and to bring this hopeful day

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:51.027
"as near to our own as possible.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.837
"The California University Lectureship

00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:54.087
"on the Morals of Trade,

00:01:54.087 --> 00:01:56.047
"is a small effort in that direction."

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.080
Others who've delivered
the lecture include,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.170
consumer advocate Ralph Nader,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.490
member of the British
Parliament Neil Kinnock.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.850
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.900
Former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.580
Former Secretary of US Department

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.590
of Health and Human
Services, Kathleen Sebelius.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.030
And most recently, nutritionist
and author Marion Nestle.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.730
And then last year,
Governor Jennifer Granholm

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.380
who was a two term governor
of the state of Michigan.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.480
And now, a few words about our
distinguished speaker today.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.260
A very noted economist.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.561
Professor Samuel Bowles
is the research professor

00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:35.420
and director of the
behavioral sciences program

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.330
at the Santa Fe Institute
in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.230
He's published prolifically
in many journals

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.550
including, Science,
Nature, The New Scientist,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.240
American Economic Review,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.660

Antiquity, The Harvard Business Review,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.330
and The Journal of Political
Economy, amongst others.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.030
A very wide spread of disciplines.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.560
He's also published a
number of books including,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.040
A Cooperative Species:

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.400
Human Reciprocity and Its Evolution, 2013.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.510
Microeconomics Behavior,
Institutions and Evolution in 2006.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.680
And his most recent
book, The Moral Economy:

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.910
Why Good Laws Are No
Substitute for Good Citizens,

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.980
which was published in 2017.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.980
He's currently working on
another manuscript called,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.120
Equalities Moment: The Origins and Future

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.723
of Economic Disparity
and Political Hierarchy.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.170
With a global team of
researchers and teachers

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.800
he's also developed an new
introduction to economics

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.330
that demonstrates the
power of modern economics

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.830
to eliminate problems
such growing inequality,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.830
climate change, innovation,
wealth creation and instability.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.800
A year long highly
interactive eText called,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.880
The Economy, is open
access and freely available

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.050
to anyone in the world
with internet connectivity

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.120
on their phone or other device,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.813
at www.core-econ.org.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.210
Professor Bowles received
his bachelor's degree

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.530
from Yale University,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.650
his PhD in economics
from Harvard University.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.380
He's advised South African
President Nelson Mandela,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.860
Dr. Martin Luther King Junior,
US presidential candidates,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.870
including Robert F
Kennedy, and Jesse Jackson.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.420
And in 2006 he was
awarded the Leontief Prize

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.740
for his outstanding
contribution to economic theory.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.990
Today, he'll be speaking
about, The Moral Economy:

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.450
Why Good Incentives are No
Substitute for Good Citizens.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.770
So with that, please welcome
Professor Samuel Bowles.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.160
He will give a lecture and
then we'll have a discussion

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.587
once his comments are completed.

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:36.837
(applause)

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:44.390
- Well, I gotta say that morals and trade,

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.800
and a moral economy sound
like an oxymoron, doesn't it?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.150
I mean, there's something a little jarring

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.920
about somebody who gives a
grant to study morals and trade,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.320
at least in economics
where we try to separate

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.770
these issues as much as possible.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.120
But, I'll try to convince
you that's a mistake.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.060
The picture in front of you is a fresco

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.873
in the town hall in Siena
where I often teach.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.100
And, it's a representation
in the 14th century

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.570
of good government.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.110
Notice it's a secular image.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.590
If you look carefully
you can see it's an image

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.020
about commerce and peaceful
intercourse among people.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.880
The constitution of the town
of Siena at the same time

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.017
made it quite clear, it said,

00:05:26.017 --> 00:05:27.537
"This city must be governed by men

00:05:27.537 --> 00:05:29.540
"who love peace and justice."

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.160
So the a marriage of
morality and good governance

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.420
was the basic idea of that period.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.210
An idea which came to be displaced

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.610
particularly in economics
in the years later.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.710
A story which I'll tell.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.810
And then try to reverse
before we're finished.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.030
It's a long story.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.570
So let me give you the basic idea first,

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.090
just a few, there summary points.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.880
This is what I would like to pursued you

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.383
is worth considering and is perhaps true.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.650
First, is something which
I think you're aware of,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.450
it's widely held that in
designing public policies

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.130
and legal systems, and so on,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.250
we should assume, at least
on grounds of prudence,

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.770
that citizens are entirely
self-interested and amoral.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.060
That's the so called, Homo
economicus assumption,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.550
which is the foundation
of the public policy,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.010
sciences in economics,

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.883
what's called, mechanism
design, and so on.

00:06:20.883 --> 00:06:24.700
And, of course it effects
legal practices as well.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.080
But, and this is the main point here

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.850
it's anything but prudent to
assume that Homo economicus

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.810
is a good representation of our citizens

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.900
and the people who make
up the body politic

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.120
which we're governing.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.250
And there are two reasons for this.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.990
The first is, and I'll try to convince you

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.010
this is really true,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.820
policies that follow from that paradigm

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.710
are more likely to make
it's assumptions true.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.830
That is are more likely to convert people

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.090
to acting more like Homo economicus,

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.330
than they would in the
presence of other policies.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.623
So, the policies are self
defeating and backfire.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.300
But, the reason why this takes place

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.500
is not per se something
wrong with incentives.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.540
This is a more subtle point.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.640
I'm not going to argue here
that incentives are the problem.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.960
I'm going to argue that
incentives are used

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.610
for purposes that people reject

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.470
because they're either
attempting to implement

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.040
an unfair outcome, or are
attempting to implement

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.870
a type of domination
of the incentive giver

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.750
over the target of the incentives.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.450
So, we should be thinking,
not about incentives

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.940
as intrinsically a problem,

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.680
but rather the social
relationships that are behind

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.000
the incentives as the problem.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.700
And again, I'll try to
give you some reason

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.100
for believing that.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.640
And finally, in economics
we have a field called,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.310
mechanism design, in which
we think of very clever ways

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.730
of defining new property
rights, new incentives,

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.510
new constraints and so on.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.780
Whereby, we can implement
good outcomes no matter what.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.440
No matter what the people are like.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.300
I'll return to this theme later.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.000
But, the conclusion that I
think I will convince you of

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.870
is no matter how clever we
are in designing incentives

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.710
and property rights, and so on,

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.100
that alone will never be
sufficient for good governance

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.840
in facing the kinds of problems
that humanity now faces,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.560
such as, climate change,
mounting inequality,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.320
economic instability,
political violence, and so on.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.313
So that's what I'm gonna talk about.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.473
The ideas, many of them here are not new.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.550
It begins in the social sciences
with Richard Titmuss's book

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.960
called, The Gift Relationship,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.227
in which he said, "The
commercialization of blood

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:43.237
"and donor relationships
represses the expressions

00:08:43.237 --> 00:08:46.247
"of altruism, and erodes
a sense of community."

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.640
The idea was that public spirited motives

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.860
are crowded out by the explicit
application of incentives.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.730
And therefore, we should
use these incentives less

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.930
because they have that
crowding out feature.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.070
Now, at the time that he wrote, early 70s,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.470
there was a lot of research being done.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.450
A lot of it happen to be in
near by Stanford University,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.770
by Nisbett, Deci, Green,
others, Lepper in particular

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.053
who I'll come back to.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.600
That was in psychology it's called

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.763
the over-justification literature.

00:09:17.763 --> 00:09:20.640
An what it shows, for example,
is that you can crowd out

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.150
children's desire to paint

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.183
by paying them for their
paintings, things of that nature.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.210
So, it received a warm
welcome in psychology

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.470
but a rather chilly one in economics.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.470
It was surprising, Arrow and
also Solow, reviewed the book

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.390
and I suppose if you're a sociologist

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.520
that's the most you can hope for,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.740
that an economist would actually

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.760
read your book and review it.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.060
Two Nobel price winners is not bad.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.640
But, what they said is,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.510
they didn't believe
that there was evidence

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.040
for this crowding out phenomenon.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.573
Here is kind of Arrow,

00:09:58.727 --> 00:10:01.527
"Why should it be that the
creation of a market for blood

00:10:01.527 --> 00:10:04.527
"would decrease the altruism
embodied in giving blood?

00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:07.427
"I do not find any
clear answer in Titmuss.

00:10:07.427 --> 00:10:09.747
"I see no real evidence that the presence

00:10:09.747 --> 00:10:11.037
"of a commercial blood supply

00:10:11.037 --> 00:10:13.027
"decreases the amount of altruism."

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.880
I had the same reaction.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.860
I read the book with great interest.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.253
And I didn't think that he made his case.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.653
Now, of course, since
then a lot has changed.

00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:31.000
The skepticism announced by
these two great economist,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.480
Arrow and Solow, was on
the basis of the fact

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.780
that at the time there was little evidence

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.500
that the kind of moral incentives

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.170
that Titmuss was talking
about were important.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.030
And there was even less evidence

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.900
that they would be crowded
out by the use of incentives.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.130
So, Arrow and Solow were on good grounds

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.910
and Titmuss was essentially
making a good argument

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.120
that turned out to be probably correct

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.270
based on later evidence.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.990
In fact, an unpublished dissertation

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.610
the same year that Titmuss wrote

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.970
made a pretty good case for the fact

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:00.940
that Titmuss had been right.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.750
Though Titmuss had been
unaware of this dissertation.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:09.750
Now, since then in
economics a lot has changed.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.150
And here I'm gonna refer

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.128
to things going on within economics.

00:11:14.128 --> 00:11:16.350
Bear with me because
I'll come back to them

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.390
in the course of the talk.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.980
So if you don't, if you're
not familiar with the themes

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.300
they'll come around again.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.440
The first is obvious
you all know about this.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.140
There's now a lot of experimental
evidence in economics

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.670
that these moral incentives
or ethical principles,

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.060
other-regarding preferences,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.240
generically called, social preferences,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.640
these are important as
a basis for behavior.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.690
It doesn't mean they're important
instead of self interest.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.380
Self interest is also important.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.850
But, there's no question on the basis

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.460
of the experimental evidence
that our introspection

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.830
and our natural observation around us

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.740
which says to us, yes
other motives matter.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.433
That is now strongly confirmed
in the experimental evidence.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.710
Equally important but
a little less obvious.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.180
Economics has now taken
up the idea as the norm,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.860
that when I contract
with you for something

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.400
the contract is probably incomplete.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.110
If I hire you for example, or you hire me,

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.570
the contract says I'm
supposed to show up on time

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.710
and obey the supervisor.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.190
It doesn't say what
work I'm supposed to do.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.650
Now, why is that important?

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.590
How does that get norms into play?

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.770
It gets the norms into play directly.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.673
Because if I hire you I
care about your work ethic.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.300
If I loan money to you I care about

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.490
whether you're telling me the truth

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.010
about what you're gonna do with the money.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.470
Because the contract of
a lender to a borrower

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.950
is also incomplete.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.760
So, because we have, because
most contracts are incomplete

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.580
including very important ones,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.780
for credit and labor for example,

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.660
it now becomes obvious even to economist

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.130
who have resisted interdisciplinarity,

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.710
it becomes obvious that
the exercise of power

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.690
and the salience of social norms

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.410
is a part of very conventional
economic problems.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.810
Like, what's the wage,
what's the interest rate?

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.700
Now finally, perhaps even more esoteric

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.450
to those of you who've never
heard of the Lucas critique,

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.710
the Lucas critique is a very important

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.330
intervention in economics.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.000
And it said, when you
design a economic policy

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.433
you have to take account of the effect

00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:21.830
that that policy will have on the beliefs

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.850
that individuals in the society have

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.520
about what's gonna happen next

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.100
and how the government will behave.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.560
In other words, when you design a policy

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.130
don't take the beliefs
of people as exogenous,

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.830
they'll be affected by the policy.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.440
Well, all I'm doing here is
I'm taking the Lucas critique

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.020
and instead of applying it to beliefs,

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.280
I'm applying it to norms and values.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.000
And saying, when you implement a policy

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.670
don't think that the preferences

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.070
which existed before
you had the intervention

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.620
are gonna be around later.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.253
And I'll come back to that.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.160
Now, in response to these three things,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.070
some economists have
rediscovered Aristotle.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.050
At least that's what they said.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.683
I suspect that some of them
just had discovered Aristotle.

00:14:06.683 --> 00:14:09.140
(crowd laughing)

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.700
But, if they did, probably the thing

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.000
they would like to read
most is the following.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.110
This is from, The Ethics.

00:14:16.955 --> 00:14:18.637
"Lawgivers make the citizens good

00:14:18.637 --> 00:14:20.867
"by inculcating habits in them,

00:14:20.867 --> 00:14:23.117
"and this is the aim of every lawgiver.

00:14:23.117 --> 00:14:25.137
"If he does not succeed in doing that,

00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:27.217
"his legislation is a failure.

00:14:27.217 --> 00:14:29.537
"It is in this that a good constitution

00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:31.100
"differs from a bad one."

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.430
Now notice, it's not
this is a characteristic

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.730
of a good constitution.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.890
This is the characteristic
of a good constitution.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.000
This is the sine qua non
of a good constitution.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.740
Teaching the public to be good citizens.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.050
Now, this gives us a dilemma then.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.030
If Titmuss is right, that
incentives compromise

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.680
the kind of values that we would hope

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.153
to have in a citizenry,

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:57.614
then what is Aristotle's

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.650
sophisticated legislator supposed to do?

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.510
Because by now Aristotle's
legislator knows

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.900
that incentives are essential.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.810
You're not gonna run a
society without incentives.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.200
You're not gonna abolish markets.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.420
So, we set up a little tension here

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.420
between Titmuss's insight and
Aristotle's view of politics.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.290
Now, there's one way out of this.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.563
Maybe we don't have to worry about this.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.240
Now, economists are really of the view

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.690
that we can do without Aristotle's values.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.363
That's the way we do our public economics.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.650
I started to trace where
this idea came from.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.220
And it really comes not from the meaning

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.560
of an important body of work,

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.130
but rather by a supposition
that has been adopted

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.130
by great thinkers as a thought exercise.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.193
Think about this, this is Machiavelli.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.150
I'll come back to the rest of
the quote in just a minute.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.527
But, the important part in red is,

00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:07.347
"All men are wicked,

00:16:07.347 --> 00:16:09.277
"hunger and poverty make them industrious

00:16:09.277 --> 00:16:10.657
"and laws make them good."

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.390
Does that sound familiar?

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.750
That's the idea that we
can organize a constitution

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.730
on the basis of the incentives,
based on hunger in this case

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.410
to induce people to do things

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.363
which will add up to the social good.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.900
Now, it's not that of course Machiavelli

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.910
was not saying that
hunger makes people good.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.390
He says, hunger makes people
act as if they were good.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.730
And that's good enough.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.430
Now, there are many
others who had this idea.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.100
A contemporary of Machiavelli, Marsiglio.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.210
But also, if you think
about the way Hobbes

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.370
posed the problem of
order and limited freedom

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.300
in what was then modern society.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.233
Mandeville, Hume, Smith, Bentham.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.440
Bernard Mandeville, famous in economics

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.010
for a wonderful book that he
wrote, The Fable of the Bees.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.600
This is what he had to say
about the relationship between

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.127
vice and governance.

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.117
"Thus every part was full of vice.

00:17:10.117 --> 00:17:11.690
"Yet the whole mass of paradise."

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.263
He's describing a hive of
bees were nasty animals.

00:17:16.387 --> 00:17:18.187
"Such were the blessings of that State,

00:17:18.187 --> 00:17:20.557
"their crimes conspired
to make them great.

00:17:20.557 --> 00:17:22.047
"The worst of all the multitude

00:17:22.047 --> 00:17:24.197
"did something for the common good."

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.320
So, this is a really big idea

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.790
that we should distinguish
between motives and consequences.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.410
And this is Mandeville and
it's of economics after that.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.863
He wrote it about bees because

00:17:35.863 --> 00:17:38.040
it would have been too scandalous

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.480
at the beginning of the 18th century

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.580
had he written it about humans.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.750
In fact, he got into a
lot of trouble as it was.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.570
What happened in the
hive was that the hive

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.070
was this scandalous hive

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.060
and everything work out pretty well.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.260
But then, they got religion

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.310
and they all acted like good little bees,

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.650
and the hive collapsed and so on.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.200
That was the story of the bees.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:02.250
Now, the subtitle of one of
the additions of his book was,

00:18:03.287 --> 00:18:06.167
"Human frailties may be
turned to the advantage

00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:08.267
"of civil society and made to supply

00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:10.077
"the place of moral virtue."

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.790
Now that is a very very interesting idea.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.790
That is, the ordinary motives
could substitute for virtues.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.210
He didn't explain how that could be done.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.670
But, it would very soon be provided

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.440
by the classical economists.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.600
The invisible hand is

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.030
of course just a statement of that view.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.240
That ordinary motives
when organized properly

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.910
by the proper social institutions

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.730
can induce people to
act in the public good.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.210
So, here we have one of
the most famous quotes

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.057
even rivaling one where
mentions the invisible hand,

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:46.087
"It's not from the
benevolence of the butcher

00:18:46.087 --> 00:18:48.537
"the brewer, or the baker
that we expect our dinner,

00:18:48.537 --> 00:18:51.607
"but from their regard
to their self interest."

00:18:53.253 --> 00:18:57.420
Now, this view was taken
up by people at the time.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.830
Hume, of course, preceded Adam Smith

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.323
by about half a generation.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.830
And, what Hume said about policy making

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.440
and constitution making, really epitomizes

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.387
the way modern economists have thought.

00:19:11.387 --> 00:19:14.567
"Political writers have
established it as a maxim

00:19:14.567 --> 00:19:17.107
"that in contriving any
system of government

00:19:17.107 --> 00:19:20.177
"every man ought to be
supposed to be a knave

00:19:20.177 --> 00:19:22.277
"and to have no other
end in all of his actions

00:19:22.277 --> 00:19:23.847
"than his private interest.

00:19:23.847 --> 00:19:25.777
"By this interest we must govern him

00:19:25.777 --> 00:19:28.367
"and by means of it make
him, notwithstanding

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:30.517
"his insatiable avarice and ambition,

00:19:30.517 --> 00:19:32.467
"cooperate to public good."

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.100
Now by the way, doesn't it sound like

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.970
he must have been reading Machiavelli?

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.120
Even the structure of
the sentences, right?

00:19:40.052 --> 00:19:41.820
Anybody who wants to form a republic

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.080
should supposed that,
that's the translation

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.433
of Machiavelli's Italian.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.880
Hume is saying the same thing.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.280
And, we get Bentham who
wrote the first book

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.060
in what we would now
call public economics.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.963
How to design public policies.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.530
He announced what he called
his duty on interest principle.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.370
He was talking about
compensation of public officials.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.677
And he said, "We should
make it every man's interest

00:20:08.677 --> 00:20:13.677
"to observe that conduct which
it is his duty to observe."

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.520
Now, in economics we just
call that aligning incentives.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.680
Or, an incentive compatible policy.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.290
That is, it's a policy that induces people

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.820
as a result of their self interest

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.090
to do the thing that
the society as a whole

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.340
would deem profitable
or good for the society.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.400
And once again, these two statements here

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.400
are about not making people
care about their morality

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.730
or the benefits they give to others,

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.090
but rather given them
private incentives to do so

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.573
by the clever design of public policy.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.410
And so, what happened during this period

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.883
from Machiavelli through to Bentham,

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.620
was that good laws replaced good citizens

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.603
as the sine qua non of good government.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.270
We could displace Aristotle concern

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.640
by the design of good principles.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.020
And that was by the way a very key idea

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.450
in Machiavelli's Discourses.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.170
Not, The Prince, but in The Discourses.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.390
That's what he's really saying.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.010
The thing that we have that we can do

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.430
is we can design roles
which will induce people

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.650
as he put it, of ordinary humors,

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.740
we can induce people of ordinary humors

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.247
to conduct themselves in way

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:23.047
that contributes to the public good.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.480
And this is really a big
idea right up to the present.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.970
I think it's familiar to you.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:32.640
But, this is a wonderful
editorial from 1988

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.800
from The New York Times.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.743
A previous financial crisis.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.850
Program, trading, index
arbitrage and so on.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.787
Could go on about this
but the key line is this,

00:21:43.787 --> 00:21:46.177
"Perhaps the most
important idea here is that

00:21:46.177 --> 00:21:49.307
"to distinguish between
motive and consequence.

00:21:49.307 --> 00:21:51.357
"Derivative securities attract the greedy

00:21:51.357 --> 00:21:53.487
"the way raw meat attracts piranhas.

00:21:53.487 --> 00:21:54.447
"But so what?

00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:56.137
"Private greed can lead to public good.

00:21:56.137 --> 00:21:58.257
"The sensible goal for
securities regulation

00:21:58.257 --> 00:22:02.100
"is to channel selfish
behavior, not to thwart it."

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.690
And I'm imagining that
that was written by some,

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.720
that line was put in there
by some Yale graduate

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.720
from economics who was
assisting the editorial board,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.420
had read Mandeville and so on.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.100
And thought that was a
clever thing to put in.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.600
It's just straight Mandeville.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:22.060
Now, so now think about it.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.260
It may be repugnant to
you to think that way.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.163
But, should we worry really?

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.293
Why not just harness greed?

00:22:32.274 --> 00:22:35.691
Well, economist say that a market economy

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.230
or a capitalistic economy has the benefit

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.643
of not relying on
morality to function well.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:49.487
Of course, a very famous
expositor of this view is Hayek.

00:22:49.487 --> 00:22:51.697
"The liberal market economy
is a system under which

00:22:51.697 --> 00:22:53.487
"bad men can do least harm.

00:22:53.487 --> 00:22:56.237
"It does not require out
finding good men for running it,

00:22:56.237 --> 00:23:00.020
"or that on all men becoming
better than they are now."

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.440
That's just Machiavelli.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.840
Ordinary humors, that's all we need.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.620
A little more explicitly Charles Schultze

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.827
of the Brookings Institution.

00:23:08.827 --> 00:23:11.727
"Market-like arrangements
reduce the need for compassion,

00:23:11.727 --> 00:23:14.950
"patriotism, brotherly love
and cultural solidarity."

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.393
And finally, I think the
most astute one is Buchanan.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.530
Nobel laureate in economics.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:27.097
He's shopping near his home in Virginia.

00:23:27.097 --> 00:23:29.047
"I do not know the fruit
salesman personally,

00:23:29.047 --> 00:23:31.257
"I have no particular
interest in his wellbeing.

00:23:31.257 --> 00:23:33.267
"he reciprocates this attitude.

00:23:33.267 --> 00:23:35.637
"I do not know, and have no need to know,

00:23:35.637 --> 00:23:37.580
"whether he is in the direst of poverty,

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.897
extremely wealthy, or
somewhere in between.

00:23:39.897 --> 00:23:42.707
"Yet, the two of us are
able to transact exchanges

00:23:42.707 --> 00:23:45.507
"efficiently because both parties agree

00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:48.692
"on the property rights relevant to them."

00:23:48.692 --> 00:23:51.340
Now that is a very bright statement.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.330
I mean, I don't endorse his indifference

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.900
towards the fruit salesman.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.360
But, he understands what
it is about the economics.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.190
Which, I'm happy to say,
we can now call former

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.010
economic conventional economics.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.260
Which is no longer taught in grad school

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.517
thank you very much.

00:24:06.517 --> 00:24:10.070
"Because we agree on the property
rights relevant to them."

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.640
That's just another statement for saying

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.280
the contract is complete.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.380
Everything that we care about
has been contracted for.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.980
So I don't care about his morality.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.590
If he gives me a bag of bananas,

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.770
and it's not a bag of bananas,

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.690
I get my money back.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.970
So that's what he's saying,

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.450
complete contract is what
makes his indifference

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:29.823
an appropriate stance.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.123
Well, but economist have had,

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.720
you may wonder why I said it was ex.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.553
Did you wonder?

00:24:39.553 --> 00:24:40.390
It is ex.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.400
I'm coming to that.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.970
Why it is that we once thought that

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.270
but we no longer think it?

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.470
Why did economist think that

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.660
we should be concerned with preferences?

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.710
We could put them aside.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.510
Well, we once had a theory that showed

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.870
that desirable social outcomes

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.920
are possible with
unrestricted preferences.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.820
So, let me run through this argument.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.820
Unrestricted preferences mean
essentially, bring them on.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.320
We don't care what the preferences
are, we can handle them.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.960
So, here I'll lay out in a single slide

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.300
what the argument is and then
I'll tell you why it's wrong

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.840
and why economist have now rejected it.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.800
First, the market is
obviously decentralized

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.490
it's privacy preserving.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.530
It's, when guided possibly by a good

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:32.530
but not omniscient planner
or social designer,

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.710
policy maker, it's capable
of implementing outcomes

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.320
by means of procedures.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.330
And the italicized parts
are the three things

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.770
that matter as far as a
liberal commitment like that

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.223
of, for example, Hayek.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.200
That is, it avoids coercion.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.640
It avoids paternalism
and it's free of waste.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.830
Those three things.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.980
I'll come back to them.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.800
It avoids waste.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.970
What we mean in economics by that is just

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.970
the outcome is Pareto efficient.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.973
It's not possible in the outcome

00:26:03.973 --> 00:26:07.000
for all parties to be made
better off by some change

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.500
without anyone being made worse off.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.990
So that's the rather
minimalist view of efficiency

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.083
which is part of this liberal commitment.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.040
It avoids paternalism.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.180
It doesn't say that people have to be

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.870
of one type of preference or the other.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.160
It completely rejects Aristotle's view

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.230
that he constitution
should take a position

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.340
on what the citizens should be like.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.910
So by unrestricted preferences it means,

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:33.160
that you can any preferences you want.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.190
This is now, it's called
preference neutrality

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.620
among liberal philosophers.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.760
By the way, it's a very new term.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.520
It's not an ancient term.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.070
But it just means, if you're a liberal

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.660
you don't make a position
about the nature of the good,

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.890
or what people consider to
be the good life and so on.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.220
And finally, whatever the outcome is

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.760
it should avoid coercion.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.763
If you participate in an
exchange it has to be voluntary.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.290
Now think about it.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.330
That's not all you could
ask of a philosophy

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.890
as the basis for economics.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.760
But you must agree, that's pretty basic.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.560
Those are things that liberal people,

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.193
I count myself among them,
liberal people are committed to.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.473
Now, some people think
that it's been done.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.500
A great professor from
this great university

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.713
certainly claimed that it had been done.

00:27:26.487 --> 00:27:27.980
"The superiority of liberalism

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.387
has been mathematically
demonstrated," by Gerard Debreu.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:33.643
This is in Figaro.

00:27:33.643 --> 00:27:35.820
Actually, Figaro misquoted
him in the headline.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.080
What he said actually,
was virtually identical,

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.167
what he said is,

00:27:40.167 --> 00:27:43.457
"The superiority of the liberal
economy is incontestable

00:27:43.457 --> 00:27:46.270
"and can be demonstrated mathematically."

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.420
He was talking about the famous theorem,

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.880
so called, invisible hand theorem,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.240
the he and Kenneth Arrow
proved 30 years earlier,

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.320
which showed the conditions under which

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.140
a competitive economy would support

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.573
a Pareto efficient outcome.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:04.470
So, let's think of this liberal trinity.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:05.890
Has it been demonstrated?

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.181
Those are the three desiderata
that I mentioned before.

00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:10.210
Pareto efficiency,

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.560
preference neutrality,
voluntary participation.

00:28:14.813 --> 00:28:19.813
Now, so this is what economist
thought as of the late 80s

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.260
that we, I mean, or the early 80s,

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.610
that we had actually shown.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.220
And, let me say why we thought that.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.380
That is, we had some theories

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.010
under the heading of mechanism design

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.923
which appeared to show that implement

00:28:34.923 --> 00:28:38.170
Pareto efficient outcomes
with unrestricted preferences

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.130
and with voluntary participation.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:44.555
But, that hope turned out to be false.

00:28:44.555 --> 00:28:47.210
For decades of mechanism design,

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:51.110
and a good number of Nobel
prices for these results showed,

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.330
and I'm summarizing here,

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.070
what the Swedish Nobel Committee said

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.781
in awarding the prizes the first time,

00:28:56.781 --> 00:28:59.077
the really big mechanism
designer got prizes,

00:28:59.077 --> 00:29:01.397
"The implementation of
Pareto-efficient outcomes

00:29:01.397 --> 00:29:04.157
"in the absence of complete
contracts is generally

00:29:04.157 --> 00:29:07.017
"impossible for unrestricted preferences

00:29:07.017 --> 00:29:08.927
"if participation is voluntary

00:29:08.927 --> 00:29:10.837
"and there's a limit on
the extent of penalties

00:29:10.837 --> 00:29:13.537
"that may be imposed,
excluding physical punishment

00:29:13.537 --> 00:29:15.690
"imprisonment for debt," and so on.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.683
That's the result of this body of work.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.460
Now, there are many parts of it.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.460
Getting people to truthfully tell

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.020
what their preferences
are, or their capacity

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.840
turns out to be not incentive compatible.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.450
That is, you can't design
a way that does that

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:31.860
if there are more than two options.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.980
That was shown in 75.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.670
Private voluntary exchange,
even when you have

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.783
complete contracts does not
implement efficient outcomes.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.300
That was shown by Myerson
and Satterthwaite,

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.850
and Chatterjee, and Samuelson
also in the late 80s.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.260
Now as result, the
mechanism design literature

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.660
has for the most part abandoned

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.510
the Pareto criterion entirely.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.690
And what it does, it talks
about something called

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:56.870
incentive efficiency.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:00.970
Which means, the best you
can do given the preferences.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.870
Which obviously means that
then preferences are important.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.320
They've abandoned the idea,

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.363
the strong idea of Pareto efficiency.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.970
And these are the guys
Hurwicz, Myerson and Maskin

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:16.830
who one the price for
their contribution to this.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.520
Now, a number of people
have worked on this problem.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.983
And, I wanna say that this
is a trilemma, not a trinity.

00:30:25.053 --> 00:30:29.500
And, the idea is you can
have any two vertices

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.400
but not all three.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.650
And, I'll show some results on the edges

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:35.290
about why that's true.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.593
And what you lose if you do,

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:44.360
for example, you can
have Pareto efficiency

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.023
and voluntary participation,

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.380
but you can't have preference neutrality.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.530
So, if you have that one and that one

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.130
what Hwang, that's Hwang there,

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.700
what Hwang and I showed
is you can have these two

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.620
but only by violating
preference neutrality.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.430
If at least, by the way it's not true

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:08.020
that both of the agents have
to be honest or altruistic,

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.990
just one, but they have
to be sufficiently so.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.270
So you have to violate the idea that,

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.653
bring them on, when it
comes to preferences.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.030
You can have voluntary participation

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.700
and preference neutrality,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.220
but this is what Chatterjee
and Samuelson showed,

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.500
then there'll be unrealized
gains from trade.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.400
And you can have Pareto efficiency
and preference neutrality

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.740
but only by a very clever mechanism

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.260
which requires people to
commit to making a trade

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.610
before they find out what the deal is.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:38.590
In which some of them,

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.060
once they find out what the deal is

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.470
they won't wanna be part of it.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.173
So, that violates voluntary participation.

00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:53.140
So, I conclude that that attempt failed

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.990
and it failed, you know, a long time ago.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.120
Interestingly the paper
from Figaro in which

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.853
Debreu was quoted was exactly the time

00:32:00.853 --> 00:32:02.630
that these papers were coming out.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.150
And he, Debreu, was extremely
on top of that literature

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.850
to his wonderful credit.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.020
Why he said that to Figaro I can't imagine

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.090
because the house of cards was collapsing

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:14.700
right in those years.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.460
And the date in Figaro was 84,

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.220
and these papers were
all in the early 80s.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:25.220
Now, so virtue, to use
the old style expression,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.470
it is still essential.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:32.000
And this is especially the case

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.150
where relevant information
is not verifiable.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.810
The non-verifiability of information

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.440
is what gives rise to
incomplete contracts.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.030
If there's some kind of information

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:45.240
that either is lacking, so
called asymmetric information,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.940
or even if present can't
be used in a court of law

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.510
to enforce a contract,

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.820
then you'll have an incomplete contract

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.410
and then all of these problems will arise

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.173
and norms and other things
will become necessary.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:02.760
It's also the case that imagine a state

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.860
that had the capability
of implementing a system

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.380
whereby contracts would be complete.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.690
That would be an extremely invasive state

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.620
capable of collecting information from you

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.480
which is, now it cannot be collected.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.670
In other words, trying to
make all the information

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.300
about your life verifiable in a court

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.260
is exactly what most liberal people

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.890
on privacy grounds would resist.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.490
So, making the liberal economy

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.130
that is the neoclassical model

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.150
which was supposed to
be the economic basis

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:31.680
of the liberal philosophy,

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.000
making it work is a dystopic vision

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.340
because it would require
contracts to be complete

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.330
which would require a state

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.030
that no liberal would ever accept.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.520
Now, other regarding preferences,

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.480
ethical commitments become important.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.020
And here we have Arrow again

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.743
once again getting it
right, 1971 he wrote this.

00:33:54.587 --> 00:33:56.317
"The process of exchanges requires

00:33:56.317 --> 00:33:58.127
"or at least is greatly facilitated

00:33:58.127 --> 00:34:01.247
"by the the presence of several virtues,

00:34:01.247 --> 00:34:03.437
"not only truth, but also trust, loyalty

00:34:03.437 --> 00:34:05.950
"and justice in future dealings."

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:07.397
Again, still Arrow,

00:34:07.397 --> 00:34:09.417
"In the absence of trust opportunities

00:34:09.417 --> 00:34:11.067
"for mutually beneficial cooperation

00:34:11.067 --> 00:34:12.677
"would have to be forgone.

00:34:12.677 --> 00:34:15.767
"Norms of social behavior
including ethical and moral codes

00:34:15.767 --> 00:34:18.197
"may be reactions of society to compensate

00:34:18.197 --> 00:34:19.637
"for market failures."

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:23.201
Once again, he's got it right except

00:34:23.201 --> 00:34:25.180
it's suggesting that
we had market failures

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.070
before we had morals is
a little bit ahistorical

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.190
because clearly human being had morals

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.350
long before they had markets

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.400
and therefore they couldn't
of had market failures.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.780
But I'll set aside for the
great and sadly departed

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.323
economist Kenneth Arrow.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.163
Now, let's think about
were economics went wrong.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:52.250
The classical writers assumed something

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.720
that nobody's really put their finger on.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.220
They did not assume that
people were selfish,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.113
far from it.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.780
They didn't assume that
preferences were somehow

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.060
outside of economics or exogenous.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.050
I mean think about,
Hume's moral convention.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.660
Hume who said we should act
as if people were knaves

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.510
the next sentence said it
may seem odd to you reader

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.150
that something which is
a true axiom for politics

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.673
should be false in fact.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.610
That's what he said.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:24.940
We're gonna assume this
and we know it's not true.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.350
Or, think about Adam Smith,
Theory of Moral Sentiments,

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.640
very aware of that.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.317
Let's go back to Machiavelli.

00:35:31.317 --> 00:35:36.025
"It's necessary to anyone
who would organize a republic

00:35:36.025 --> 00:35:39.387
"and it's laws in the republic

00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:43.630
"to suppose that people are wicked."

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.390
He didn't say people are wicked.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.420
He said, you should adapt this assumption

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.530
if you're gonna design a constitution.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.860
We want to, or as Hume put it,

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.750
we want a knave proof constitution.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:56.853
We want a wicked proof constitution.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.680
And in fact, Machiavelli went on and on

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.250
about how societies were well governed

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.970
where they have high levels of morals.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:05.850
People misunderstand what
Machiavelli was all about.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.650
Read The Discourses, not The Prince.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:14.130
Now, so they were very aware
of the importance of norms.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.140
But, they did make the
following assumption,

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.760
they assumed that what Smith
called moral sentiments

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.300
and material interest could
be pursued independently.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.350
That is, they assumed that policies

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.860
which were designed to shape behavior

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.570
by appealing to the material interest

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.720
in monetary incentive for example,

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.890
wouldn't interfere with
the moral sentiments.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.870
Which might also assist
in governing a society.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.640
And similarly, that appeal
to the moral sentiments

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.890
would not interfere with

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.120
the exercise of the material interests.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.870
So, the key idea here is that
incentives affect actions

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.820
only by altering the cost and benefits

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.450
of the targeted activities.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.500
So, there's no effect on the preferences.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:59.580
Now, these proposition
as you will recognize

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.360
now come into play in policies to get kids

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.250
to stay in school, to not get pregnant,

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.170
sentencing guidelines,

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.130
not to mention more standard
aspects of economics.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.230
Let me lay out what I just said

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.220
somewhat more analytically.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.793
We have here something called values.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.130
Which is here this,
sorry, social preferences.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.570
Suppose there's an
incentive maker, a designer,

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.390
social planner, call 'em.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.900
And, she wants to affect the action

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.270
the pro-social action on the right.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:35.500
She has some incentive
that she can impose.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.730
A tax or subsidy or something.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.160
That would affect the material payoffs.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.240
And that will have a positive effect

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.970
on the right hand term pro-social action.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.340
The problem is that people
have social preferences

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.040
which might have led them to
take the pro-social action

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.393
anyway in the first place.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.970
And, that's not a problem.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.330
The problem is the arrow going downwards

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.630
from incentive down to social preferences.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.880
If that arrow's negative
so that the incentive

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.100
has a negative impact
on social preferences

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.550
then you have a problem.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:09.550
So, let me lay out the total effect is,

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.580
the direct effect, that's the top route

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.700
going through the benefits and costs.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.220
The indirect effect is
the effect going from

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.870
the incentive to the social preferences

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.320
and to the pro-social action.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.413
Typically economics has
ignored the lower route.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.210
And in recent years we've found out

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.023
that the lower route really matters.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:35.830
So, what I mean by separability is

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:38.110
that the total is just the direct effect.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.390
There isn't any indirect effect.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:45.283
Now, empirically there's some bad news.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:51.820
The firemen in Boston in
2001 just before Christmas

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.680
got a message from the fire commissioner

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.000
who said that he'd noticed
that the people calling in sick

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.730
tended to get sick on Mondays and Fridays

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.740
and he found that very irritating.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:08.190
And so, until then they'd
had unlimited sick days.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.800
In fact, very few people
abused the sick days

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.280
or at least very few people
abused them very much

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.673
so they went up to 15.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.610
But the commissioner then said, as of now

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.800
if you call in sick more
than 15 times a year

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.800
your pay will be docked.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.173
So it's a penalty.

00:39:26.936 --> 00:39:28.380
And, what happened on
Christmas and New Years

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.723
was the call ins doubled.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.810
And what happened in the next year

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.350
was over the whole year
the number of people

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.390
calling in sick doubled.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.763
And the firemen who were interviewed said,

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.860
sorry, I go to work when I'm injured,

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.300
I go to work when I'm sick.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.960
I do that because I'm a public servant

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.860
and so on and so on.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.811
They felt insulted.

00:39:48.811 --> 00:39:51.410
And, so they just retaliated.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.760
That's what's called strong crowding out.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.100
That's when the incentive
not only blunts the effect

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.660
but actually reverses it.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.530
Now Sandra Polania-Reyes and I,

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.707
that's Sandra by the way in Bogata.

00:40:02.707 --> 00:40:03.840
She's from Columbia.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.450
She's doing an experiment in the streets

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.140
among market people in Bogata.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.610
She's an fantastic experimental economist.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.667
We did a bunch of papers.

00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:15.080
In most of the experiments
of which we collected

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:19.340
a large number, there was crowding out.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.920
So the incentive in economics
would be called a substitute

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.130
for the morals.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.020
A substitute in economics
is the following,

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.760
if an incentive and a moral
preference is a substitute

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.310
then the higher the incentive

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.960
the less is the effect
of social preferences.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.420
The larger one variable is

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.000
the less is the derivative
of the outcome effect

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.833
with the other one.

00:40:40.833 --> 00:40:42.739
So that's what a substitute is.

00:40:42.739 --> 00:40:43.920
And that's what we found out.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.920
We did find out that in some
cases there was crowding in.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.690
And obviously in is gold.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:54.800
That's what the mechanism designer

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.070
or social planner should be thinking of.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:00.740
Now, just to get a few words on the table.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.330
Wanna talk about the
nature of crowding out.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.550
It can be categorical.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:10.040
If there's an incentive
for something you'll say,

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.070
it has an effect.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.700
Like, you know, he did it for the money.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.533
Well, how'd you know that?

00:41:13.533 --> 00:41:15.660
Well, there's some tax incentive
I don't know how big it is.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.940
That's a categorical effect.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.050
So, I wouldn't be as
likely to for example,

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.180
give to the university if
there was some tax advantage

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.380
because people might
discount my generosity.

00:41:26.423 --> 00:41:27.910
Now, the other is that there's,

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:29.820
sorry, there's marginal crowding out,

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.520
just means it depends on
how big the incentive is.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.600
And obviously you can
imagine psychologically

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.670
both could be the case.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.260
And I'll tell you in two slides

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.550
that we observe in experiments

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:40.050
that both indeed are the case.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.990
And entirely different
dimension is the causes.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:45.850
Of which I think there are two.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.440
One I has to do with framing.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.420
That is, the incentive makes it

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.880
a different kind of situation.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.300
So it doesn't change your preferences

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.080
it just tells you, oh
this is like shopping

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.480
and not like dealing with my family.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.313
So that's framing.

00:41:59.313 --> 00:42:02.020
It's called, situation
dependence in social psychology.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.550
Economist would call it state dependence.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:08.130
The states differ because in
one case there an incentive

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.380
or an incentive of a particular size,

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.490
and the other case there is no incentive.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:13.630
So those states differ

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.600
and then we have state
dependent preferences.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.050
Finally, a consequence of
this crowding out phenomena

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:23.080
is that the idea in economics

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.140
is the way you implement and outcome.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.780
You have a some Nash equilibrium

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.360
which is somehow not okay,
and you wanna change it.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.300
Well, what do you do?

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.660
Well, you change the situation
so there's Nash equilibrium

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.650
which has the desirable features.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.310
That's called, in mechanism design,

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:40.700
implementation by Nash equilibrium.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.490
So the idea of the game is
to shift the equilibrium

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.570
and it's a very good idea

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.990
'cause when you're shifting,

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.130
if you wanna shift an outcome

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.210
you better make sure that
the desirable outcome

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.500
you're trying to get is
actually a Nash equilibrium

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.440
otherwise it will be
undone by private actions

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.860
and the policy will fail.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.230
That's not a bad idea.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:02.230
But, we have to make sure
that that new Nash equilibrium

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:06.140
that were desiring actually
reproduces the preferences

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.030
of which support the equilibrium.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.940
So, we have a rather unusual concept.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.110
Remember where you heard it
first, equilibrium preferences.

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.000
Okay.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.040
What it means is what has to be stationary

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.360
for a policy outcome to be the expectation

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.410
that you get by implementing a policy

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.020
is that given the preferences

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.140
which will result from these incentives,

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.830
the outcome that you want will actually

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:29.480
be implemented by private action.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.210
So, and this is the analogy

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.433
to the so called, Lucas critique.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.753
Now, let's look at some data.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.210
This is an experiment,

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.870
this is a state dependent
preferences subject

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:46.430
both categorical and marginal.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:47.410
You're just using the terms

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:49.030
I just introduced in the last slide.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:52.060
It's a wonderful experiment
with a public goods game.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.660
I won't describe the details of the game

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.210
but the public goods game is
in person prisoners dilemma

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:00.560
in which the dominant
strategy is not to contribute.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.410
Self interested person
would not contribute

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:04.520
everybody else should contribute.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.749
And so, no sorry, in this game

00:44:08.749 --> 00:44:12.180
the strategy of a purely selfish person

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.210
the person's own benefit
from the public good

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:17.560
would motivate them contributing 25.

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.670
So, there are, there is

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.640
here there's no incentive.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.500
Here there's an incentive
of 12 and that's 60.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.100
This is just, you get an incentive

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.600
if you're a hight contributor.

00:44:30.576 --> 00:44:33.553
So this is all played
anonymously with real money.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.730
Let's look at the red dots here.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.350
That's what a selfish
person would contribute

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:40.720
with no incentive.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.050
If you add the incentive then
they would contribute more

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:45.533
if they're totally selfish.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.290
And then, if you have a big incentive

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.640
they contribute a lot more.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.450
So that's what a selfish person would do.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.030
Now let's look at what people actually did

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.930
in the experiment.

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.900
With no incentive they
contributed a lot more than 25.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.530
They contributed 37.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.280
This distance here is a measure
of their social preferences

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.650
or their ethical desire to
contribute to the public good.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.400
And when you add the incentive
sure enough it goes up.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.060
It goes up from 37 to 38.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.040
So if you just looked at that

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.230
you'd say the incentive worked.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.170
But now look at this.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.173
If it goes up to 60,

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:23.383
what do you got?

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.310
There's no effect at all
of the social preferences.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:29.630
Those two numbers out there
obviously, statistically

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.350
and significantly different.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:34.330
So, these individuals with no incentives

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:38.470
made a very major commitment
to the social good

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:42.430
which they didn't do at all
when there were incentives.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:45.210
And the difference is, as you
can see, were quite large.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.970
That's crowding out.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:48.710
Now, is it marginal crowding out

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.900
or categorical crowding out?

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.640
Well, to do that what I did is

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.120
well, I said, well, suppose
that there was a incentive

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.620
of epsilon, a small number,

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.010
and that would be somewhere right here,

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:03.790
right near the vertical axis.

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:05.330
How much would they have contributed?

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.740
Well, I just projected this
line from that purple dot

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.670
that's what they did with
that incentive to that.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:13.210
And then back to here and said,

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.760
that's roughly what
they would've considered

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.803
if you had a vanishingly small
incentive but it was there.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.143
And, that gives you 34.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:26.173
And, now notice this says that,

00:46:27.056 --> 00:46:29.983
this is a categorical crowding out.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.040
The fact that this line is flatter

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.220
means that varying the
incentive has less affect.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.780
That's marginal crowding out.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.570
So both were going on.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:42.230
And you know, both were quite substantial.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:44.550
And when Sandra and I did this

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:46.190
in lots of different experiments,

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:48.950
it turns out that almost
always you get both effects.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:50.623
It's quite surprising.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.030
Okay, now let's turn,

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:55.910
this is the kind of information,

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:58.130
you know, when people say,
okay how do you use this

00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:59.630
to design policy?

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.360
Well, I think a combination of
looking at these experiments

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.110
and also looking at what social
psychologist already know

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:09.970
about why crowding out
occurs, will help us.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.240
This is from Mark Lepper,

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.020
whose work I admire very much.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.220
That's the social planner.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.230
Suggests how complicated his,

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.620
I guess his in that case, task is.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.427
Lepper says this, "The
multiple social meanings

00:47:21.427 --> 00:47:22.887
"of the use of tangible rewards

00:47:22.887 --> 00:47:25.107
"are reflected in our
everyday distinctions between

00:47:25.107 --> 00:47:28.817
"bribes and bonuses,
incentives and salaries.

00:47:28.817 --> 00:47:31.987
"They carry different connotations
concerning, for example,

00:47:31.987 --> 00:47:34.917
"the likely conditions under
which the reward was offered,

00:47:34.917 --> 00:47:37.157
"the presumed motives of the person

00:47:37.157 --> 00:47:38.697
"administering the reward,

00:47:38.697 --> 00:47:40.267
"and the relationship between the agent

00:47:40.267 --> 00:47:41.660
"and the recipient of the reward."

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.860
Yes, that's sound right.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:44.150
That sounds like something economists

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:45.640
should pay attention to.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:50.023
So let's look at some actual policies.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.060
We have rural Colombians

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:58.223
and they're playing a public goods game.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:03.550
And, these are real rural
people, not students.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.232
And the game was designed to look like

00:48:05.232 --> 00:48:07.700
how much stuff are you
taking out of the forest.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.610
'Cause they were deforesting a place.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.930
This was an experiment
by Juan Camilla Cardenas

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.050
who intervened there in Columbia

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.698
before he became a grad student.

00:48:16.698 --> 00:48:18.330
He only found out later

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:19.650
that he could publish papers on this.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:22.620
He was trying to change
whether people could cooperate

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.150
and not deforest the place.

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:26.920
When he came to grad school he
got a couple of publications

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.530
from stuff that he was doing primarily

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.210
'cause he was community organizer.

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:31.173
Which is very nice.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.840
If you look here, or there,

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.420
this is the first, this the game played

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.920
and they, what the vertical axis is,

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.570
how far did they deviate

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:48.140
from what a selfish person would do?

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.070
Now, the ideal for all of the society

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.883
would be deviated by six.

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:55.720
And, an entirely selfish person

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.780
would've deviated not at all.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.610
And so they were kind of in between.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.530
So this says round after round

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:03.240
they are kind of halfway between being

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.190
the sinner and the saint.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:07.430
Then he stops the game here and he says,

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:10.260
okay, the groups that's black

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.540
are gonna be subjected to a fined

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.730
if they take out too much.

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:15.700
They'll be monitored and
if they're discovered

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.840
to have taken out too
much they'll be fined.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.720
The group that's red are gonna be allowed

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.270
to communicate with each other verbally,

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:25.810
and then after that the
game is played anonymously.

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.440
So, you see what happened here

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.340
at first the fine worked exactly.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.680
They exactly implemented
the social optimum

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.530
which is to deviate six from
what a selfish person would do.

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.013
And as time with on they
went right down to zero.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.290
The fine wasn't big enough.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:48.300
So essentially, these people who had acted

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.480
halfway between being selfish
and being completely generous

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.450
ended up after eight rounds
being entirely selfish.

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.370
Sounds a little like
the previous experiment.

00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:00.420
The ones who communicated
did a little better.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.870
These red dots here are a
little better than those.

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:06.540
They did surprisingly not well to me.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.217
It was class divided society

00:50:08.217 --> 00:50:10.450
and these groups were of different classes

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.000
and they didn't communicate very well.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.323
There's some great stories
I could tell you about that.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:20.240
But, I think the best
way of explaining this is

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.080
once the fine was announced people engaged

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.120
in what psychologist
call moral disengagement.

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.470
They just thought, oh
it's not a moral problem.

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:33.040
They're fining us so not playing the game

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.500
in a publicly responsible way

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.123
is a commodity which I can
buy despite paying the price.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.083
Here's another experiment.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.140
This is a trust game.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.860
In the trust game there are two parties,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.230
the first party gets a sum of money

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:52.113
which he or she then can
allocate to the second party.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:56.410
Before it gets to the second
party it's triples in amount.

00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:58.320
And the person who gets the tripled amount

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.370
then can send some back
to the first person.

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:02.420
It's like an investment.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.730
You invest in the second person

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:05.080
and they give you some stuff back.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.040
But, there's no way of enforcing it.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.210
Well, you don't have to
be a genius at game theory

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.530
to figure out that if you
thought the other person

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.800
was entirely selfish
you should send nothing

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.160
'cause they won't send it back anyway.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.820
So, that's the way the
game should be played.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.480
That's not the way the
game is played hardly ever.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.320
People send a lot and they
get a lot reciprocated.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.470
And if they send more
they get a lot more back.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:31.150
So, if we look at just the gray bars,

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:34.260
the gray bar says that if
you send between two and four

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.530
you get on average four back.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:38.130
If you send between five and seven

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:39.880
you get a little over six back.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.350
So essentially the more you
send the more they send back.

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:44.240
Though they don't have
to send back anything.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.290
So people are reciprocal.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.290
They respond to that signal.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:50.330
But then the experimenters
did a very clever thing.

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.580
They gave the sender, the first person,

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:54.470
the option to impose a fine.

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:56.760
So, I can send a message to you saying,

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.830
I'm sending you five and
if you don't send me back

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:02.040
at least 10, remember
the thing is tripled,

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.890
if you don't send me back at least 10,

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.090
then I'm gonna fine you.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.093
And so,

00:52:10.274 --> 00:52:13.770
when the fine was imposed here,

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.770
the black bars, that's what happens.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:18.540
Now look at the black bars.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.210
What do they tell you?

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.290
Much less reciprocity.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:23.663
They're not reciprocating.

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:28.200
So imposing the fine should
improve the situation

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.410
'cause you're improving the incentives

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:31.650
that's what economist
are always trying to do

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.150
to get the thing closer
to a complete contract.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:37.070
But the closer you got,
the farther people came

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:38.470
from the thing which would maximize

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:40.800
the wellbeing of the two summed.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.820
But then, and even cleverer
move with the experiments

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.206
gave the option to say,

00:52:45.206 --> 00:52:48.240
you can impose a fine
but you can publicly say

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.970
I'm not imposing it.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:51.450
So here's five.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:54.140
I can impose a fine but I'm
not gonna impose a fine.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:54.973
And then what happens?

00:52:54.973 --> 00:52:56.350
Look at the white bars.

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:57.710
That's what happens.

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:59.550
Now, why did that change?

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.390
And, what changed?

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:04.500
The fact that fine was possible
but you didn't impose it

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.880
allowed you the first person

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.550
to signal to the other
person, I trust you.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:12.570
It said, I'm not tryna
get the most out of you.

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:16.130
So, it was, this tells us something

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:17.870
about designing institutions.

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:20.950
A little change like that
allowed a piece of information

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:23.013
to transmitted in a truthful way.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.330
I'm gonna go passed this because

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:31.440
I wanna get to, but it's just a summary

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.110
from a paper that Sandra
and I wrote about.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:34.463
How every thing works.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:38.150
After I published this paper in Science,

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.010
I guess it was in 2008.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:44.540
Thomas Schelling,
unfortunately also departed,

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:45.477
wrote me this note.

00:53:45.477 --> 00:53:46.727
"Dear Sam,

00:53:46.727 --> 00:53:49.188
"Your article in Science," blah blah.

00:53:49.188 --> 00:53:50.757
"I worked in Washington,
in the White House

00:53:50.757 --> 00:53:54.058
"and Executive Office of the
President from November,"

00:53:54.058 --> 00:53:56.067
blah blah, "These were
exciting and stimulating times.

00:53:56.067 --> 00:53:58.531
"People worked long hours
and felt compensated

00:53:58.531 --> 00:54:00.917
"by the sense of accomplishment.

00:54:00.917 --> 00:54:03.957
"And I believe a sense
of personal importance.

00:54:03.957 --> 00:54:06.117
"Regularly a Friday
afternoon meeting would go on

00:54:06.117 --> 00:54:08.607
"until eight or nine, when
the chairman would suggest

00:54:08.607 --> 00:54:11.697
"resuming Saturday
morning, nobody demurred.

00:54:11.697 --> 00:54:14.447
"We all knew it was
important, we were important.

00:54:14.447 --> 00:54:17.067
"Some time in 52 I believe it was,

00:54:17.067 --> 00:54:19.007
"President Truman issued an order

00:54:19.007 --> 00:54:20.877
"that anyone who worked on Saturday

00:54:20.877 --> 00:54:22.717
"would receive overtime pay.

00:54:22.717 --> 00:54:23.657
"What happened?

00:54:23.657 --> 00:54:28.066
"Saturday meetings virtually disappeared."

00:54:28.066 --> 00:54:29.590
Well, that's crowding out.

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:31.470
President Truman was just introduced

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.150
to the crowding out phenomenon.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:34.980
Or the chairman of the committee.

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:39.660
Now, other people who
have real responsibilities

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.620
face this problem.

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.133
Consider the tax collector
somewhere near Hyderabad.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.220
A number of people were not paying taxes.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.113
And so, it's small to read.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.510
What he did was he hired
a bunch of drummers

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:57.700
to go outside the houses of the people

00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.690
and just drum outside the houses.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.050
And he sent along a couple
of clerks with computers

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:05.317
in case the people decided
to pay up their taxes.

00:55:05.317 --> 00:55:08.740
And, it turns out it was very effective.

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.193
Now, why was that effective.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:13.390
It was effective because
actually people know

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:15.270
they're doing something wrong
when not paying the taxes.

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:18.270
And they don't wanna be seen
in that light by the neighbors.

00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:24.111
So, this drumming taxes out of
the recalcitrant tax payers.

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.630
This by the way, I mean, I'm
sure they invited it himself.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.250
But look at this, this is a picture

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.240
from the 14th century, early 14th century,

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.870
what's called a charivari.

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:35.300
A charivari in Europe was a method

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:38.760
by which communities enforced
moral standards on people

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.570
by gathering outside the
homes of the miscreants.

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:44.273
The baker who charged high for bread

00:55:44.273 --> 00:55:46.370
when there was a bread shortage.

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:49.220
The person engaging in
sexual misconduct and so on.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.650
It was very often women,

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:52.620
they almost always had musical instruments

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:54.290
or some kind of sound making equipment

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:55.860
and you still find charivaris in Europe

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.960
mostly New Years Day now,
just at celebrations.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:01.750
But, so this thing about shaming people

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:06.260
into compelling, into conforming
with social procedures

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.253
is an old idea.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:12.850
Now, it's been carried out also.

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:16.530
This is seeing, I love the town of Bogota.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.990
This is a mayor of Bogota by the way.

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.190
A former, a mathematician and philosopher,

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:22.790
former rector of the University.

00:56:23.906 --> 00:56:27.010
When he became mayor he
had a very serious problem

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:29.730
which is, tremendous traffic fatalities

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:32.670
on these, they're called zebras, zebras.

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:33.813
These stripped things.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.580
And Bogota was really notorious for this

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:38.597
and it was a very serious problem.

00:56:38.597 --> 00:56:39.870
And what did he do?

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:42.430
He hired over 100 clowns

00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:44.810
to go and ridicule drivers.

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:45.643
And there they are.

00:56:45.643 --> 00:56:47.080
You can see they're,

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.860
and they were very aggressive
and extremely funny.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.350
And then everybody talked about it.

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:55.180
And then he also, he
appointed what he called

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:56.570
the order of the zebra.

00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:58.100
The order of the zebra

00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.070
which was a bunch of taxi drivers,

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:01.380
they were the worse offenders.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.490
The 100 taxi drivers who got compliments

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.003
from the pedestrians and so on,

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.100
then they had a little zebra

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.150
they could carry around in the car.

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:10.260
There was a lady of the zebra,

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.750
one of the taxi drivers
was a female, and so on.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:13.910
So, what was going on?

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:16.000
I mean, and he did a
lot of things like this

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.063
in terms of water shortage and so on.

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:20.600
I mean interestingly,

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:24.940
he did not reduce the
enforcement by ordinary police.

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.060
In fact, he upped it a little bit.

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:31.880
And so, this was a combination
of making this a moral issue.

00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.880
How you drive.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.890
And then also for the real accosters

00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:37.660
making sure they didn't get away with it.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.980
By the way, which is another part

00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:40.970
of that great fresco in Siena.

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:41.803
Go and have a look.

00:57:41.803 --> 00:57:43.530
It's not about the virtues only.

00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:44.980
It's also about getting the cops

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.630
and the virtues to work together.

00:57:47.655 --> 00:57:49.940
Well, I'm gonna close with what I think

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:53.043
we may have learned about
some of these cases.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.880
This is an iconic experiment.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.670
I didn't put it first
because you'd all say

00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:59.830
oh, we all know that.

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:02.490
This is an experiment, it
wasn't actually experiment,

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:04.880
done in Haifa, Israel.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.770
People coming late to pick
up their kids at the daycare.

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:09.810
I think any economist here
has already heard about this

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:11.650
but if there's anybody
in the room who hasn't

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:13.400
I'll tell you a few of the details.

00:58:15.598 --> 00:58:17.113
A sign was posted saying,

00:58:19.153 --> 00:58:22.240
as of tomorrow anybody coming
more than 10 minutes late

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.100
will be fine, actually
the fine happened to be

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.513
10 New Israeli shekels.

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:32.360
And, they counted before the lateness

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.393
and then they counted afterwards.

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:38.430
The group for the fine are the dark line.

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.080
And the groups without the
fine are the open squares.

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:41.913
And as you can see,

00:58:41.913 --> 00:58:43.930
what happened is once
they imposed the fine

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.230
people doubled the amount of coming late.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:47.500
And not only that,

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.630
they aborted the
experiment here in week 17

00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:52.930
not surprisingly because it
was inducing a lot of lateness.

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:55.210
And what happened was, lateness continued.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:57.763
Now, there's lots of ways
of interpreting this.

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.900
But I think the simplest way,

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:01.797
the most parsimonious way,

00:59:01.797 --> 00:59:06.380
and the way I think is true,

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.120
the title of the paper
is, A fine is a Price.

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.700
A Fine is a Price.

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:12.460
A fine is a price means,

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:15.840
a price is something if
you pay for it that's it.

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.490
Nobodies gonna arrest you
on the way out of a store

00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:18.810
if you paid for the good, right?

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:19.908
Fine is a price, okay.

00:59:19.908 --> 00:59:23.304
So, fining people for coming late is,

00:59:23.304 --> 00:59:25.570
you turn lateness into a commodity.

00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:29.170
Step right up, if you wanna
pay 10 Israeli shekels fine.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:31.940
Now, if you wanna ask if it
would've been 100 or 1000

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:32.773
would they've come late?

00:59:32.773 --> 00:59:33.800
Of course they wouldn't of come late.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.760
That's not the question.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.160
The question, of course
there's some incentive

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.840
which will get people to come on time.

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.060
But, that particular
incentive wasn't enough

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.840
to do the job.

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.210
But, and that experiment
is talked about a lot.

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:48.043
But think about this,

00:59:48.043 --> 00:59:50.253
think about another fine, looks identical.

00:59:51.908 --> 00:59:56.908
Ireland imposes a small tax
on plastic grocery bags.

00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:59.760
It was proceeded by a huge media campaign

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.100
about don't trash the Emerald Isle,

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.040
and so on and so on.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.170
And, within two weeks
no one was using bags.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.300
I mean, it was an
extraordinary elimination

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.970
of plastic bags.

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:13.470
So, I mean, plastic bags were like wearing

01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:16.730
a fur coat in Berkeley, I
mean you just didn't do it.

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:19.900
And so, but it's the same.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.740
You impose a fine.

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.187
And in Ireland they essentially, it seems,

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:24.790
I mean the fine was so small

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:26.930
it'd be hard to think
that it got rubbed out

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:28.150
just because of the fine.

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:30.610
It's not, you can't
exclude that possibility,

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:33.340
but it's probably not just the price.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.353
It probably crowded in
social preferences so how.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.990
Now, there are lots of
differences we might draw upon.

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:45.520
But I wanna come back to
Bentham who I chided before.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.550
'Cause this is in the
Morals and Legislations,

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.467
a very wise thing that he says.

01:00:51.467 --> 01:00:54.147
"A punishment should be a moral lesson.

01:00:54.147 --> 01:00:58.477
"When by reason of the ignominy
it stamps upon the offense,

01:00:58.477 --> 01:01:01.297
"it's calculated to inspire
in the public with sentiments

01:01:01.297 --> 01:01:03.907
"of aversion towards
those pernicious habits

01:01:03.907 --> 01:01:05.767
"and dispositions with which

01:01:05.767 --> 01:01:08.207
"the offense appears to be connected

01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:11.127
"and thereby to inculcate the
opposite beneficial habits

01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:12.267
"and dispositions."

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:17.640
So, a fine, a fine is a lesson.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.040
It's not a payment.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.930
It's teaching something.

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:23.080
A punishment is supposed to be a teacher.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.490
Well who does that sound like?

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:25.780
That's Aristotle.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.010
That's Aristotle saying, in doing this

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:31.500
we're trying to sustain
or create a population

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.630
of citizens capable of good governance.

01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.880
And that's what the
charivaris all about too.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.940
Now, I don't want you to go away from this

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.870
thinking that fines are wrong

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:45.913
and the Irish case suggest
that that would be a mistake.

01:01:47.754 --> 01:01:48.587
Here is a case.

01:01:48.587 --> 01:01:50.510
This is a public goods game

01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:52.990
in which here's the standard game,

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:54.260
you can contribute or not.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.700
You can contribute 20.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.840
People start by contributing two

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.930
and then it goes basically down to zero.

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:03.440
So people just, basically
people lower their contribution

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.960
because other people are not contributing.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.390
And the other way they have to punish them

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.090
is by not contributing themselves.

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:12.400
Then here at period 10,

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.840
you change the rules and say,

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.860
after each round you'll see on your screen

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:17.810
not the names of course

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:19.930
but the numbers of all
the people in your group

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:21.260
and how much they contributed.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.470
And you then have the
option of taking some money

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:25.800
out of your own kitty,
out of your own pocket,

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.130
and reducing the fining of somebody else.

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:29.700
We never use the word
punishment of course.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.170
We just say, you can
pay to reduce the fining

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.053
of somebody else.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.383
So, they start off a little
higher and it goes up.

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:41.700
Now what happens in here,
those places there is,

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.180
there were a lot of people
not contributing much

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.190
and people were punishing.

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:47.040
By the end of the game
everybody contributing a lot

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.940
and nobody's punishing.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:51.470
Now notice, that's a very
small change in the rules.

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:54.070
That had a huge impact.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:57.470
Here, there were a few selfish people

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:58.930
who were driving this downwards

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:00.410
because the ones who were,

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.380
would've liked to contribute
were getting angry

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.120
'cause the other people
weren't contributing.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.220
Over here, possibly a
small number of people

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.190
who are civic minded

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.120
and willing to actually punish the others,

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.623
were driving the equilibrium.

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:15.173
Now, there's a wonderful
puzzle here by the way.

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:18.780
This game here is a public goods game

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.650
in which the dominant
strategy is to not contribute.

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:23.570
That means, whatever anyone else does

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:25.780
what you should do if you're
maximizing yourself interest

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.683
is don't give.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.760
This game over here, the punishment game,

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.139
it's the same game.

01:03:33.139 --> 01:03:34.890
Punishment's a public good.

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:36.450
The dominant strategy about punishing

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:37.870
is you shouldn't punish.

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:39.253
Let somebody else punish.

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:42.700
So, in the second round
people should've been

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.720
as selfish as the first.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.790
It's a very interesting characteristic.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.630
And I think they're good
evolutionary reasons

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:49.770
why we have this.

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.130
That people here were acting selfish

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.560
but when it came to
ability to punish people

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.393
who were breaking rules,

01:03:55.393 --> 01:03:57.950
people are very happy to participate.

01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:59.390
It would take us somewhat farer field

01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:02.143
to explain why that would
be true evolutionarily.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:08.230
If you compare these two games
with which you're familiar

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:09.770
the top one I just described.

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:12.970
And this was the one
in which the incentives

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:15.253
drove out reciprocity.

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.173
So that's a contrast, right?

01:04:17.173 --> 01:04:19.830
In once case fining people over here,

01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:23.150
fining people was leading
people to contribute more.

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:24.850
They didn't contribute
less when they got fined

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:26.670
they contributed more.

01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:28.200
And in the lower one,

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.840
the prospect of a fine made
people less reciprocal.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.560
So in one case it seemed to be building up

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.030
social preferences, the top.

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:35.750
And the other case not.

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:38.800
Well, I was able to look into

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.090
why this experiment
worked out the way it was.

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:43.110
Remember, I can give you five

01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:45.570
and then I can say I want
seven and a half back

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:47.070
then we'd split the total.

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:48.360
Or, I could say I want 10 back

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.520
then I'd get most the total, right?

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.670
The ones who were greedy were the ones

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:55.450
who were being negatively responded to.

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:58.950
So, the negative response was
not a response to incentives.

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:00.910
It a response to greed.

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:02.870
The ones who were saying I'll fine you

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.690
if you don't split it 50-50 with me

01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:06.520
were not negatively affected.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.353
So there's a lesson there.

01:05:07.353 --> 01:05:09.113
That it's not the incentive per se.

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:13.110
I'm gonna run through
these are all thing that,

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:14.603
I wanna go back to Aristotle.

01:05:17.145 --> 01:05:21.440
Okay, this was during Aristotle's lifetime

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.660
but I do not that he was involved.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.250
But, the dates right, right.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:26.960
So, there's a mission to set up a colony

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.763
in the Adriatic because
of the Etruscan pirates.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:34.330
And the ships had to be
recruited from private lives.

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.240
The ships were owned and the crews,

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.280
it's a huge operation.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.760
There was like, 200 ships
and horses and soldiers,

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.120
and sailors and so on.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.120
And, the people who were wealthy

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:50.060
were appointed to deliver
a fully equipped ship

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.653
to the port Piraeus.

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:54.950
Fairness was assured.

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.500
Now this is amazing.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.640
What the council said is,

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.360
okay, these things are called
liturgies, I'm not sure why.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.200
Hundreds of them were
given out to wealthy people

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.630
and said, you have to produce this ship

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:06.980
you have to do that.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.900
Now here's how fairness was ensured.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:09.733
Brilliant.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.283
The liturgy was allocated
in the following way.

01:06:18.056 --> 01:06:20.380
Suppose I got a liturgy.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.630
But, I happen to know that Micheal

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:25.330
who didn't get a liturgy
was wealthier than me.

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.380
I go to Micheal and I say,
"Micheal take my liturgy."

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.950
And if he refuses then his alternative

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:32.723
is we exchange our wealth.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.900
Got it?

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.380
I'm a citizen.

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.370
The citizen's council
doesn't how wealthy he is,

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:40.810
they just thought I was wealthier.

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.350
But I know, I'm his neighbor.

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:44.140
I know how many cows he has, or whatever.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.570
So I go and I say, you take my liturgy

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:47.713
or I take your cows.

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.340
That's mechanism design at its best.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.280
Because it's using private information

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.270
the fact that I know
he's wealthier than me

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:59.170
to essentially allocate
the burdens of this thing.

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:02.542
So, this was a set of
incentives which were fair.

01:07:02.542 --> 01:07:05.080
The incentives were given as prices.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.940
They were not set as
incentives, for example,

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.920
the herald of the council of 500

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.320
is to announce the crowns at
the contest, the festival,

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.360
in the order that the competitive zeal

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.660
of the trierachs, that is
the captains of these ships,

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.940
towards the demos would
be evident, and so on.

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.973
A clear public purpose was stated.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.293
Substantial fines for those
who didn't do it were imposed.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.960
Now, think about if the Athenians

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.860
instead of two economists had designed

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.363
the Haifa daycare experiment.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.463
It was two economists who did it.

01:07:36.463 --> 01:07:38.990
And they do great work it's
a wonderful experiment.

01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:40.730
So, the Athenians in their time machine

01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:41.930
they got to Haifa first.

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:45.260
And, how would they have done it?

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.870
Well, this was what was on the door

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:49.230
of the daycare centers in Haifa.

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:51.670
As you know, official
closing time, blah, blah.

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:55.620
As of next Sunday, fine
of NIS 10 will, da, da.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.920
So that's what the economists did.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.570
And, the Haifa people they
didn't make it in time.

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:04.700
But here's what they had
planned to put on the door.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.410
It would of said,

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:08.060
the council of parents wish to thank you

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.910
for arriving on time to
pick up your children.

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:11.640
Since this reduces the anxiety

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.810
that the children sometimes feel.

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:14.860
And allows our staff to
leave at a timely manner

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.120
to be with out own families.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.550
We recognize that all parents

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:20.270
who have a perfect record
of unblemished by lateness

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.890
for the next three months
with an award of 500 NIS,

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:26.500
to be given at the annual
parents and staff party,

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.300
with the option to contribute your award

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.920
to the school's Teacher
of the Year celebration.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.080
Now, do you think if that
what they'd had on the door

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.360
they would of had people coming later?

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.770
I don't think so.

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:36.890
We haven't run that experiment

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:38.970
but if the Athenians had
just gotten there first,

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:41.470
it all would of work out a lot better.

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:46.470
Now, the economy and society
into which we're now entering

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.330
couldn't be farther from
the world of James Buchanan

01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:53.163
dealing with his fruit seller.

01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:56.970
We're not living in a
world in which we agree

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.230
on the property rights being transacted.

01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:00.530
We're not living in a world in which

01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:02.890
everything that matters,
that goes on between us,

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:06.310
is covered by a costlessly
enforceable contract.

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:09.430
Whether it's secondhand
smoke, or climate change,

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:12.320
or epidemic spread, or hiring a worker,

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.350
or giving a loan, or a taking a loan.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:20.350
And so, think of the 18th, 19th century.

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:23.180
The sinews that connected
the world was trade,

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.800
and grain, and steel.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.500
That's not what connects us today.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:31.930
We do that, but it's also
sneezes and burning carbon.

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:34.280
And all kind of other things.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:36.403
That will never be subject to contract.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:42.250
So, obviously, the
economist's job until now

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.100
is extremely valuable still.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.330
Perfecting incentives which will work

01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:48.150
even in the case of self interests.

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:53.150
But, these will fail if they
compromise moral commitments

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:55.910
that are necessary to
govern a modern society

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:57.660
in which incomplete contracts

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.573
is just a very dangerous kind of utopia.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.010
Now, securing a
sustainable and just future

01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:09.930
will require that we take
seriously, as Aristotle did,

01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:11.670
the kinds of moral development

01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.960
that we're engaging in our society.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.210
I don't underestimate
how troubling this is

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:18.640
to any liberal, and I'll say twice now,

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.440
and I count myself among them,

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.650
who sees this as also
a problem in society.

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:26.110
A society which could be dominated

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:29.430
by the commissar of culture and so on.

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:32.053
Let me end with a hopeful thought.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:36.140
I had the word, CORE, next to my name.

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:39.750
Curriculum Open-access
Resources for Economics.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:42.130
This a new introduction to economics

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:43.950
based on modern economics

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:45.740
not on what's the text books today.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.390
Which is mostly something that you'd,

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.823
came from the 1980s.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.290
We take for example incomplete contracts

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:55.070
as the normal case, market
failure as a standard case

01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:56.670
and so on.

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:58.520
It's available on your telephone,

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.828
you can get it right now if you want.

01:10:59.828 --> 01:11:01.528
I will count it as being impolite.

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:06.837
Core-econ.org.

01:11:07.799 --> 01:11:09.890
There it is up there.

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:11.800
It's around the world.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.210
It's already accepted
as the standard course

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:15.680
at the Toulouse School of Economics

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.830
thanks to Jean Tirole.

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:21.290
And at the UCL, the top
economics department in the UK

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:22.930
and one of the top in Europe,

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:25.700
Humboldt University in Germany, and so on.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:28.300
And, it's also available in a book form.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.010
Crazily enough a publisher
agreed to publish it

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:34.038
even though it's available
on everybody's telephone.

01:11:34.038 --> 01:11:38.960
It's a very new way of teaching
and learning economics.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.260
It's highly interactive.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.730
I mean, we're digital first.

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:42.563
We didn't do a book.

01:11:42.563 --> 01:11:43.980
We just did a platform.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:48.310
And, we also have a course called,

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:51.440
Economy, Society and Public
Policy, for non majors,

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.090
also being used at graduate
level public policy courses.

01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:58.810
And, we have a new course
also called, Doing Economics,

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:01.660
which is a fairly sophisticated teaching

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.190
of how to handle data on economics

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:06.270
using a lot of the economic arguments

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:08.610
and cases in these other books.

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:11.720
But it's basically handling in R.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.250
And it's very popular amongst students.

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.410
'Cause students understand now,

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.950
that knowing R is really
an important thing

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.758
to have on your CV.

01:12:18.758 --> 01:12:21.340
So, that's it.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.010
Thanks to all of my collaborators

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.645
and thank you for coming.

01:12:24.645 --> 01:12:26.895
(applause)

01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:35.220
- Thank you very much for an
extremely stimulating lecture.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.760
Couldn't think of one that fit

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.180
the Weinstock lectures better.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:44.180
We have time now for
questions and discussion.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.420
The only think that we would ask,

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.250
I'll let Professor Bowles
call on people himself.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:51.890
Ellen will provide a microphone.

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:54.200
Just we would appreciate if
you could keep your comments

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.000
or questions brief.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.470
So we can hear from
Professor Bowles as well.

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:00.110
Thank you.

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:01.540
Just put your hand up if you,

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:04.340
- Could I ask, first question
to come from a student?

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.200
And you can't lie if you're a student.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.480
Like, I know you're not a student.

01:13:09.710 --> 01:13:11.560
- [Kelsey] Hi, my name
is Kelsey Alford-Jones.

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.710
I'm a student here in the
energy and resources group.

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:18.830
And I worked a lot with
endogenous communities

01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:22.170
who were facing development projects

01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:24.940
implemented by large
transnational companies.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:27.110
And, this is fascinating to me

01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:30.310
and I'm wondering if
any of the experiments

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:32.560
that have been run include scenarios

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.760
in which there's a very
large power imbalance.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.430
It sounds like most of these games include

01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:38.630
people who are generally operating

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:42.670
maybe with the same resources
or with the same incentives.

01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:44.920
And could you just speak more about how

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.250
these games might be different

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:48.460
or whether there're
experiments that have been done

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.660
under other scenarios of those types

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.660
of large power imbalances.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:54.493
- There are.

01:13:54.493 --> 01:13:56.090
I mean there are two
kinds of power imbalances

01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.923
in the experiments.

01:13:56.923 --> 01:13:59.790
There are experimentally
induced power balances.

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:02.950
That is, you give a
principal a lot of power,

01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:04.590
I can set bounds on what you do.

01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:07.230
That's an experimentally given difference.

01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:09.580
But then, there are real
world differences in power.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.180
That is, the people actually,

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.793
the experimental subjects
come from different location.

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:17.070
I'll give you two examples.

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:20.150
I mentioned the great
that Juan Camilla Cardenas

01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:22.040
in Columbia does.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.710
And how, the communications

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:25.890
didn't actually improve things very much.

01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:27.443
Well, and I said the problem was

01:14:27.443 --> 01:14:29.290
that the groups were heterogeneous.

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:32.620
And in one case and one
of the cases I represented

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.070
these were groups of five

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.080
and there was one group
in the public goods game,

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.830
there were three women and two men.

01:14:38.733 --> 01:14:42.930
The older man, whose name
was Don Ricardo and his son,

01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:45.720
the were the two richest guys in town.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.070
The two rich guys in the group,

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.410
obviously a huge imbalance,

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:52.440
and they, the two rich guys,

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.080
were trying to pursued
everybody in the group,

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.600
oh look, don't take
anything out of the forest.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.200
We'll all do better.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.163
So, do the optimal thing,
you know, deviating six.

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.680
And then, Juan Camilla noticed
the group hadn't down well.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.960
And he asked one of the women,
well what was the problem?

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.300
And she said, well you know,

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.550
Don Ricardo was saying
we should all not take

01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:16.040
anything from the forest.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.040
And Juan Camilla said, well
why did you take so much?

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:25.040
And she said, you know, well
I don't trust him, you know.

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:26.950
I could never look in his eyes.

01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:28.660
I didn't really believe him.

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:29.990
And so I asked Juan Camilla,

01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:31.400
well, what had Don Ricardo done?

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.230
And he had taken the maximum.

01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:35.290
And his son had taking the maximum.

01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:37.130
And the women in the group
had taken some middle thing.

01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:40.490
So basically, and that
was a general result.

01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:43.140
That is, groups of mix
wealth in his experiments

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.950
did extremely poorly.

01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:48.140
Also, homogeneous wealthy
groups did poorly.

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:51.480
The groups that did best
were homogeneous poor people.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.020
And I don't know if
there's a lesson there.

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.530
The other thing is that in some place

01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:57.240
there are a lot of, there's a fantastic

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.760
experimental economics community

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.433
based in University of Cape Town.

01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:04.870
Justine Burns is a name to follow.

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:06.560
And they do a lot of experiments across

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.363
racial and class boundaries.

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:13.170
And so you see about how
do white and black people,

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:16.670
and how do people of
Indian origin and so on

01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:18.250
relate to each other in these games.

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:19.610
So those are two things.

01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:22.190
But, I would ask Juan Camilla
Cardenas and Justine Burns

01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:23.430
and follow on.

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:25.130
I hope you find something.

01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:27.730
Or, maybe think of a good
experiment to do yourself.

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.870
- Hi, we're a group of PhD students.

01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:36.590
How do you think we
could apply these ideas

01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:40.200
on your framework to nonexperimental

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.913
kinda like empirical work?

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.840
- I think, if by this framework you mean,

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.053
the crowding out by incentives and so on.

01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:55.670
What you're always looking
for is a natural experiment

01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:56.710
of some kind.

01:16:56.710 --> 01:17:00.840
Like changing the rules
for giving blood and so on.

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.310
Those are quasi-experimental.

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:05.940
But, if you mean the more
traditional econometric work,

01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.913
I don't think it's been done.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.840
And the problem is,

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.840
when you have radically
different incentives

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.980
so that you can actually see a difference,

01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.210
too much else is also changing.

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:22.690
That is, you know I've been
just trying for a long time

01:17:22.690 --> 01:17:25.440
to say, well okay, a society which lives

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.920
primarily by monetary incentives

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.180
is a different kind of society culturally

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.810
than the one that
basically deals with other,

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:36.780
other kinds of ways of enforcing norms.

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:41.200
But then, it's very hard to
find sort of clean changes.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.371
You know, national boundaries
as you probably know

01:17:43.371 --> 01:17:45.820
in Switzerland, there's
some very nice cases

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.670
about two sides of the
German-French boundary

01:17:47.670 --> 01:17:51.410
because German speaking,
French speaking boundaries.

01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:54.520
But, it's very hard to do.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.833
It would be very good
if you could, you know,

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.680
what's been done is there've
been a lot of studies

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.090
of the validity of the experiment

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:03.070
that is seeing whether or not

01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.410
fishermen who contribute
to the public goods game

01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:07.050
are also those who engage

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:09.590
in environmentally
friendly fishing practices.

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:12.110
And the answer to that is yes.

01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:13.420
But that's, you know, so that's showing

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.680
there is a real world analog to it

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.330
but it's not the kind of
thing you're asking for.

01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:20.203
- [Woman] So I wanted to ask is it,

01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:25.890
is it necessary that the
actions are visible to others.

01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:29.880
So, I'm thinking you can be an
immoral in an invisible way.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.510
Right, like if you, a company

01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:35.120
that is polluting or something,

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.670
if they're not accountable to
anyone they can still, I guess

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:41.470
yeah they can still pollute.

01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:46.470
Another thing is, I
guess we also maybe need

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.460
communities to which you are accountable.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.760
That's another question I have.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.840
Do we need that, those two things?

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.600
- Yes, I agree.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.530
And you probably know a least
as much about that as I do

01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:01.690
because of your research.

01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:06.340
But, the role of community is suggested

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:11.340
by the fact that when you
have a peer punishing you

01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:13.630
in a public goods game
it has a big effect.

01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:15.440
And by the way that effect takes place

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.610
even if we introduce what's called

01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:20.000
the perfect stranger treatment,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.320
which means every round
the groups are shuffled.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.160
So, if we're in a group together now,

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.820
and I don't contribute and you punish me,

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:29.220
you couldn't possibly be doing that

01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:32.120
in order to, that I would
shape up to your benefit.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.226
'Cause you know I'll
be somewhere else next.

01:19:34.226 --> 01:19:37.150
And, the other thing which we notice is

01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:39.190
being punished by a peer

01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:43.230
who apparently has no
selfish reason for doing that

01:19:43.230 --> 01:19:44.520
has a big impact.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.490
That is, it's not the punishment.

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:49.890
For example, in these
games a verbal admonition

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.130
is almost as effective
as a financial fine.

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:56.530
What people care is,

01:19:56.530 --> 01:20:00.470
they care about their own
standing in the community.

01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:04.030
But when you said, how important is it

01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:05.093
that it's observed.

01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:07.820
Distinguish please with me between

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.260
the two following concepts.

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:11.653
One is guilt and the other is shame.

01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:14.690
Guilt is something that
you feel privately.

01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.810
Even if nobody knows about it.

01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:19.000
Shame is what you feel as
if you've done something

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.760
about which you feel guilty

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.110
and it's publicly recognized.

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:25.920
Now, I think it's useful
to have those distinctions

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.270
because both are at work.

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:34.270
And when I do something good,
I do something generous,

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.400
most economist would say,

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.910
well you probably did that
because you're signaling

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:42.560
to others your generosity
and that will improve

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.260
the kind of trades that you
can engage in in the future.

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.760
Which of course could be true.

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:50.160
But, there's a concept in psychology

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.910
called the looking glass self.

01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:53.690
You're looking in the looking glass.

01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:57.200
A lot of our signaling we do
to ourselves for ourselves.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.610
And here's why.

01:20:58.610 --> 01:21:01.640
We're never sure about
our goodness, our bravery,

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.320
our kindness, or whatever it is.

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.700
And we occasionally engage in activities

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:09.570
to reassure ourselves to
daily reproduce ourselves.

01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:11.920
Reconstitute ourselves.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.200
So that kind of self signaling
is something which goes on

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.480
even in the absence of
others observing you.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.740
Now, how important is one and
how important is the other

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.883
surely depends on the context and so on.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.620
But, when people do things which are kind,

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.580
brave and so on, entirely
with nobody looking

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.540
it could have a part of
that looking glass self

01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.100
aspect of it.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.733
But, I think the last question is,

01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:43.140
your last question about
the role of the community,

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:44.543
it's absolutely essential.

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:47.470
The difference between Ireland and Haifa

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:50.600
was the explanation at
Haifa really deprived

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.140
people of any opportunity to say,

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.170
oh, this something we
should be doing together.

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.990
Whereas for accidental reasons

01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:58.690
the deal by which the
law got passed in Ireland

01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:01.270
had as part of it a
massive publicity campaign

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:02.610
which said, look we Irish people

01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:03.610
are all in this thing together.

01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:06.530
You know, garbage bags are
really anti-Irish and so on.

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:09.110
So, it was a notion of an us.

01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:10.460
That was implementing them.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.540
- [Man] What you said
was very interesting.

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.050
But, I would like to ask,

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:20.490
one of the tenets in
Buddhism is right action

01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:23.570
independent of the results.

01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:27.400
And, I don't, do you have any comments on

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.090
how all you've been saying tonight

01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:33.760
might work in a Buddhist community?

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.180
- I have thought about that.

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.620
I spent a lot of time in
India when I was a youth.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.220
And I was very attracted to Buddhism.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.920
Unfortunately, I think
one of the leading experts

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.550
in the world on Buddhist economics

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:45.620
was just sitting behind you.

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.650
Unfortunately, she left.

01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:50.223
So we should ask here.

01:22:52.090 --> 01:22:55.750
I think that, the idea of doing good,

01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:58.010
because inconsequentially that it's not

01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:59.050
for consequential reasons

01:22:59.050 --> 01:23:00.950
but because it's the right thing to do.

01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:03.110
I think that's a lot of our morality.

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:06.100
And, in economics the term

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.830
other regarding preferences is used.

01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:10.920
It means I'm doing this action

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.840
because I have concern for you.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.020
And so, the way that's
done in mathematics is

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.920
well I have some benefits of my action

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.020
and I care about the benefits of yours.

01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:23.970
So I put some little extra
next to your benefits.

01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:26.330
Well, that's a lot of what generosity

01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:27.950
and being a good citizen is.

01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:31.040
But, a lot of it is not
that I'm doing something

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.830
like I'm transferring something to you.

01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:35.410
I'm doing something because
it's the right thing to do.

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:38.650
Deontologically, that
it's not consequentially.

01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:40.723
It's a fundamental aspect of Buddhism.

01:23:42.093 --> 01:23:43.970
And, I think a lot of, for example,

01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:45.960
a lot of the self signaling is actually

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.150
reassure ourselves that we are good

01:23:48.150 --> 01:23:49.763
quite apart from who's looking.

01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:55.650
And so, I think there's
a missing set of terms

01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:58.090
in the way, at least in economics,

01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:00.000
we think about these things because

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.730
we're always, I mean, if get
away from Homo economicus

01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:05.440
then what the individual is

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.710
is putting a weight on
someone else's wellbeing.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.720
Instead of being a moral
being in it's own right.

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.913
And, both are important obviously.

01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:17.800
- [Woman] Kind of a,
maybe a little bit of a

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.430
more bizarre question.

01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:22.980
But, I'm thinking of
you mentioned Buchanan.

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.220
And you're sort of, I wasn't clear

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:29.210
if you were sort of trying to create

01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:33.750
sort of like this comparison
between a past time

01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:35.930
when economics was simpler,

01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:40.300
it tapped into simpler
relationships, right.

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.190
And now, particularly as someone

01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:44.600
who likes to do comparative studies

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.900
that incorporates the past,

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:51.980
couldn't say Buchanan's
relationship with the fruit vendor

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.980
be problematic, say the fruit vendor

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:57.000
spite of the fruit or
something like that, right?

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.050
This idea that like
Buchanan tapped into this

01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:03.490
particular economic phenomenon that is

01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:06.100
as you mentioned related to the property

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:08.583
and the belief that,

01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:15.200
anyways, so could you explore
that a little bit more.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.330
And could you actually tell
me if that's what you mean

01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:20.810
or am I misinterpreting you?

01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:23.530
- No, I can say something about that.

01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:25.320
For most of the time

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.730
when biologically modern
humans have existed,

01:25:28.730 --> 01:25:31.420
we did not live in Buchanan's world.

01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.820
We lived in worlds in which we interacted

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.830
with relatively small number of people.

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.430
Not as small as most people think.

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:39.760
I mean it could be
dozens or even hundreds.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.940
But, we interacted with a group of people

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:44.710
in which there were no contracts,

01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:47.690
there was no state to enforce
the contracts if there were.

01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:51.200
There was expectations promises and so on.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.880
But, none of that was remotely like

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.730
the perfect contracting rule.

01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:59.100
Nor were there rules of private property

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.670
applied to virtually all things of value.

01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:02.830
A few things were.

01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:05.750
So, I'm talking about hunter-gather life

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:08.200
up until 11000 years ago.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.240
And even the first three or
4000 years of the Neolithic

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.240
there was very little of what
matters was private property.

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:19.360
For example, almost certainly not land.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.440
But probably stores.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.963
So the idea that we were,

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:28.930
as a species we evolved to
do very well in an economy

01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:30.740
in which there was a limited role

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.980
for private property and contracts.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:37.120
Now, I think that the world
Buchanan was describing

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.530
was really a very short period of time

01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:41.870
in which a lot of the stuff that mattered

01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:43.890
you can actually weigh and measure it

01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:46.620
and there for transact it in a contract.

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.640
Maybe half a millennium or something like,

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.910
some period of time.

01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:52.120
And, I think from what I said at the end,

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.450
I think we're now moving into an economy

01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:57.160
in which that will be
increasingly not the case.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.980
The most important stuff that's gonna on

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.520
in a modern economy you cannot
weigh, you can't measure it,

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.700
you can't contract for it.

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.050
That's knowledge base, that's affect,

01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:07.660
that' caring for people.

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.760
The knowledge and caring based economy

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.130
is a lot more like the
hunter-gather economy

01:27:12.130 --> 01:27:13.900
than it was like the economy

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.740
of Buchanan and his fruit stand.

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:18.990
So, we may be able to
learn a lesson from that.

01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:21.780
Obviously, given the modern
communication abilities,

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:23.590
given also modern states,

01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:25.630
the modern means of coercion and so on,

01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:27.320
it's an entirely new world.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.810
I'm not suggesting we
can model our society

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:32.340
on a sorta modern day Flintstone economy

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:33.990
but we do have something to learn

01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:38.490
about our capacities to cooperate
are really extraordinary.

01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:39.323
And,

01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:44.340
if you look at human
institution that have been

01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:46.850
a big success, the cooperative

01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:51.230
and egalitarian hunter-gather
society is far and away

01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:52.690
the most successful.

01:27:52.690 --> 01:27:55.220
Enduring for 100 thousand years.

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:57.373
Capitalism is just a few centuries old.

01:27:58.390 --> 01:28:01.850
And, I think we may be moving
into an economic situation

01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:05.120
in which, if can quote
Kenneth Arrow again,

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.370
it wasn't on the slide.

01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:10.157
Arrow said, "Information, knowledge,

01:28:10.157 --> 01:28:12.577
"is a fugitive resource.

01:28:12.577 --> 01:28:13.790
"It runs away."

01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:15.290
Just like that animals who ran away

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:16.670
from the hunters and gatherers.

01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:18.040
You cannot own it.

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.030
He said we're just beginning to understand

01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:23.340
the contradiction between
fundamental economics

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:24.593
and property rights.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.460
So he was talking, and
this was three decades ago,

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:32.290
Arrow was talking about
a fundamental problem

01:28:32.290 --> 01:28:34.110
about moving into an economy in which

01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:36.560
it's not possible to own stuff.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.390
And when you try to own it with
intellectual property rights

01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:42.060
it's actually dysfunctional for society.

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.850
We're moving into a society in
which those rules don't work.

01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:47.220
And so, Arrow was saying,
three decades ago,

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.270
we're gonna have fundamental
institutional changes

01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:51.840
because the stuff the
economy is now made of

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.310
doesn't work anymore for
this private property

01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:57.320
and complete contracting regime.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.153
Now, I don't think it means

01:28:58.153 --> 01:28:59.850
we're gonna do away with private property.

01:28:59.850 --> 01:29:00.790
And I certainly don't think

01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:02.670
we're gonna do away with
contracts in markets.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:05.050
It means it'll play a
much more limited role

01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:06.370
and we better find out some way

01:29:06.370 --> 01:29:07.670
to deal with the other stuff.

01:29:07.670 --> 01:29:10.550
Whether it's intrinsic motivation, trust,

01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:13.190
morality, and other things.

01:29:13.190 --> 01:29:15.820
Arrow didn't say what they might be.

01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:19.310
- [Man] Hi, do you have
a stance on whether

01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:22.570
we should use public policy
to foster social norms?

01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:27.570
For one point, it's clear
that some norms are universal,

01:29:29.233 --> 01:29:33.740
say, trustness and being
generous and so on.

01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.840
But saying fostering egalitarian norms

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.490
would be much more controversial.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.670
- I think, this is a
very difficult question.

01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:46.080
Having listened to my lecture

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.320
it's a question which
absolutely has to be asked.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.690
If you take the Aristotelian position

01:29:51.690 --> 01:29:53.410
you must also then say,

01:29:53.410 --> 01:29:55.810
what would it mean to be a good citizen?

01:29:55.810 --> 01:30:00.770
Now, there's an easy way
to answer the question

01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:05.770
which is, States today are
engaged in inculcating norms.

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.970
They do it in schools, they
do it through patriotism,

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:10.970
they do it through political
leadership and so on.

01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:13.450
It goes on all the time.

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:15.630
So, I could say at a minimum,

01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:16.820
what I would like us to do

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.670
is have a public discussion
about which norms

01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:22.800
we would like to see brought to the fore.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:27.190
Now, if you have a
reliably democratic society

01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:30.080
in which sincere communication and debate

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.960
following Habermas for example,

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.690
as a philosophical principle,

01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:35.570
you can see that might be a frame work

01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:37.560
in which we can then have some confidence

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.613
in the kinds of norms
that would inculcated.

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.193
I don't think we have any reason to think

01:30:43.193 --> 01:30:44.900
that that's gonna solve the problem.

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.530
And think there's a lot to fear from it.

01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:48.780
For example, I think one of the things,

01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:52.340
I think human beings are
generous and also very

01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:55.520
given to us and them distinctions, both.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.100
We're generous towards the us

01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:59.130
and we're often indifferent
towards the them.

01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:01.183
I think we evolved that way genetically.

01:31:02.225 --> 01:31:05.390
I worked on that for a
long time in biology.

01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:07.690
I think there's a very good
case that that's who we are.

01:31:07.690 --> 01:31:10.250
If that's true, that's a problem.

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:12.924
Because, we'd like to
inculcate the altruistic

01:31:12.924 --> 01:31:16.140
and common norms, and
we'd like in most cases,

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.900
not all, but in many cases,

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:21.540
to obliterate those repugnant
us and them distinctions

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.040
which work to the
disadvantage of less well of

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.425
and people of other groups.

01:31:27.425 --> 01:31:29.030
I don't know how that can be done.

01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:30.650
I don't think it can be avoided.

01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:35.650
And I think that the idea
that this is going on anyway

01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:39.690
without an open discussion
about the people

01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:42.060
we would like to be, and I mean globally,

01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:44.020
that's certainly a problem.

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:46.660
Whether or not bringing
that discussion to the fore

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:50.190
would address the problem and
address all the possibilities

01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:52.220
of norms which would come to the fore

01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:55.300
in that discussion might
be racist, or homophobic,

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.083
or other repugnant things.

01:31:58.110 --> 01:31:59.943
That, of course we can't know.

01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:02.710
But thank you for your question.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.433
Are you from economics?

01:32:05.433 --> 01:32:06.266
- [Man] Yes.

01:32:06.266 --> 01:32:08.312
- Don't write your
dissertation on that one.

01:32:08.312 --> 01:32:09.520
(crowd laughing)

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.270
Unless you have a really good idea.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:17.650
No, by the way, a brilliant dissertation

01:32:17.650 --> 01:32:20.870
was written in Harvard in the mid-60s

01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:24.710
by Herbert Gintus on
endogenous preferences.

01:32:24.710 --> 01:32:27.400
And you might go and
find it it was a very,

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.360
Amartya Sen was on his committee.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.250
But, have a look.

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:33.580
Some people have gotten away
with writing dissertations

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:36.040
about really big questions
like the one you asked me.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.410
But as I say, (chuckles)

01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:40.370
- [Rui] We'll have one final question

01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:42.360
from one of the committee members.

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:43.260
- [Woman] Thank you.

01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:44.410
Thank you very much.

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.500
I'd like to ask a question

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.610
not so much about the economy part.

01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:52.870
But, when you were
speaking about Aristotle

01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:55.780
and being a good citizen and
also the title of your book.

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.300
I started thinking about

01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:00.330
hundreds of years later Michel Foucault.

01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:03.610
And, I'm wondering what you would consider

01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:05.520
the distinction is between I think

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.520
a fundamentally liberal
notion of the good citizen.

01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:15.070
And maybe Foucault's notion
of the governable citizen

01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:16.820
or the governable subject.

01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:19.160
Which has always struck
me as somehow at its core

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.373
not very liberal.

01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:27.700
- This is a time in
which people are reticent

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.573
to criticize liberalism.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:34.300
And for good reason 'cause
liberalism is in serious trouble.

01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:37.890
But, one of the reasons why
liberalism is in serious trouble

01:33:37.890 --> 01:33:41.730
is the very limited nature of the idea

01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:43.650
of the individual and the role society.

01:33:43.650 --> 01:33:46.073
Recognizing families and states basically.

01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:50.393
And, that seems to me to be a major flaw.

01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:57.310
So, and if you look at
the history of liberalism

01:33:57.310 --> 01:34:00.380
of course, I mean I
started working on a paper

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:05.380
which was, if John Stuart
Mill had been Florentine,

01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:08.340
if he'd come from Florence, Italy,

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:11.770
because there the idea of Librata,

01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:15.600
was a both individual
and a community idea.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.530
And that was a fundamental
philosophical commitment

01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:20.900
of those places.

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:22.200
Machiavelli was by the way,

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.120
Machiavelli of The
Discourses was a very good

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.270
representative of that.

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.130
Now, I think that's,

01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:32.440
it's the lack of the emphasis on community

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.363
between family and nation that's the flaw.

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.410
I don't know whether how that relates.

01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:40.690
Why don't you say.

01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:42.280
What do you think the
relationship between that

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.310
of the governablity,

01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:46.410
good governable individual of Foucault is?

01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:49.163
- [Woman] I mean, not his.

01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:51.483
I'm sure there are other people

01:34:51.483 --> 01:34:52.680
who know much more about
Foucault than I do.

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:56.110
But, I always interpreted
Foucault as saying that

01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:58.280
laws and norms, and schooling

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.280
which you referred to is to
make people sort of docile.

01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:09.080
Live harmoniously according
to the convenience

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.170
of a stably functioning society.

01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:14.190
And that doesn't carry the connotations

01:35:14.190 --> 01:35:17.720
of individual autonomy agency and liberty

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.730
that the liberal vision
of the good citizen

01:35:20.730 --> 01:35:24.810
typically carries, all the
way from Athenian times.

01:35:24.810 --> 01:35:28.710
Which I thought you were more
hearkening to when you spoke.

01:35:28.710 --> 01:35:29.740
That's all.

01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:34.103
- I think that, this
again is a long story.

01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:37.370
If you think of early liberalism

01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:40.050
it was a body of thought
that defended the weak

01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:41.590
against the strong.

01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:43.320
And advocated for tolerance.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.820
And for example, even the early
advocacy of property rights

01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.750
remember, it was advocating
private property rights

01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:52.120
against the States that
were run by the elite

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.263
and run by the rich.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.730
The idea of private property rights

01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:59.900
was a defense against a State which was

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:02.490
an autocratic State of the rich.

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:06.210
And so, if you think about
a lot of early liberalism

01:36:06.210 --> 01:36:11.210
it had a definitely pro
less powerful, outsider.

01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:15.420
Then at a certain point, obviously,

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:18.940
political liberalism
married economic liberalism.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.020
Laissez faire.

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.420
And that was the beginning
of the current troubles

01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:24.530
of modern liberalism.

01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:28.500
That turns out to be a
very unstable marriage.

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.550
Because, it went through,
as you surely know

01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:33.150
liberalism was not democratic.

01:36:33.150 --> 01:36:35.610
It became democratic
early in the last century

01:36:35.610 --> 01:36:38.040
when the working class
and women got to vote.

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.860
And now, we have a situation

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.520
of a politically empowered working class

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.950
which is living under an economic model

01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:46.820
which is destroying their communities

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.480
and essentially serving them very ill.

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:52.680
Well, that's a very dangerous,
dangerous situation.

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.220
And that's, I mean I
recently wrote a paper

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:57.803
called, The End of Liberalism.

01:36:57.803 --> 01:36:59.460
By the way, it was not a prediction.

01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:02.010
The double entendre was intended.

01:37:02.010 --> 01:37:04.430
The end of liberalism used be defense

01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:06.650
of the weak against the strong.

01:37:06.650 --> 01:37:08.930
So, I meant people to
think maybe it's over

01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:12.240
but maybe we should try
to re-wed liberalism

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.290
to its original ends.

01:37:14.290 --> 01:37:16.620
Having don that I
wouldn't say that is the,

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:19.130
all that we could expect
from a normative position

01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:20.423
for the good society.

01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:23.870
But, we better defend
it now while we need to.

01:37:24.977 --> 01:37:26.759
- Alright with that,
thank you very very much.

01:37:26.759 --> 01:37:27.717
It's been a pleasure.

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:30.561
(applause)

01:37:30.561 --> 01:37:32.895
(mumbling)

01:37:32.895 --> 01:37:35.478
(upbeat music)
