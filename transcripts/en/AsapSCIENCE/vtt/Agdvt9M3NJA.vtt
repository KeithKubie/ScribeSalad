00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.480
We've all witnessed the beauty of a
shooting star, but what would happen if

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.000
an asteroid was on a collision course
for earth?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.780
Could we detect it ahead of time?  And more
importantly could we stop it?

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.740
Bill: I belive I have an answer, now you see, asteroid
impacts

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.020
are serious business, when I was in second
grade Ms. McGonigal told us

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.580
that the dinosaurs the ancient dinosaurs
died out because they had small brains

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.400
...Maybe like...

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.800
my old boss.  But even she knew that was
kinda lame, that theory was

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.599
nothing.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.039
It turns out in my lifetime people found
this crater,

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.550
off Chicxulub, Mexico.  This crater was so
big, how big was it, it was so big

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.899
that an asteroid hit the earth (or impactors hit the earth).

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.899
Threw so much stuff into the
Earth's sky it was bigger in diameter

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.329
than the earth itself so the earth was
surrounded by red hot rock for weeks at

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.870
a time,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.739
it cooked everything, and just the
animals that lived in burrows and caves,

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.449
our ancestors lead to us so serious
business you may recall Valentine's Day

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.180
2013?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.600
Chelyabinsk, Russia *boom* air burst.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.230
See if you are an asteroid, and you are going 10 km /s or 20 km /s

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.840
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.500
And you hit the Earth's atmosphere, the atmosphere is like concrete.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.900
you can't get out of the way so the
asteroid just explodes in air burst.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.700
So these asteroids are serious, most of
them

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.340
are very small.  If you're under 10 meters in
diameter you hit the Earth's atmosphere you burn up, big

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.870
blue streak, green street

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.990
white streak and then humans make wishes
upon you.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.790
I don't know house efficacious those
wishes are but people do that, alright

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.270
so,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.750
if ther asteroid starts to get bigger, starts to
get into the twenty-five meters and the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.180
45 meters in diameter then you get
Meteor Crater Arizona *wham* huge

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.890
thing.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.180
That would be like a city killer, or a county killer.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.740
And then when they get to be a 100 meters / 140 meters now you're into a country killer,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.469
and then they get bigger than that and it's a
continent killer, much bigger than that

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.800
and you're taking out a whole races of ancient species.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.540
So, what if we found an asteroid that
was headed our way, how would we find it?

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.469
How would we find an asteroid headed our
way?  That's a good question, well

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:30.409
you can use telescopes.  Skilled people
can point the cameras at the sky and

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.370
look for fast-moving objects.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.260
Objects that are crossing the Earth's
orbit, but we're missing perhaps a

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.930
hundred thousand

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.299
of these things, of these county
killers, city killers, country killers.

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.889
So, what we want to do is build a
spacecraft called The Sentinel,

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.829
and as we say "it's like looking for a
charcoal briquette

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.689
in the dark", these things are hard to
find.  They are tiny compared to the vastness

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:57.540
of space.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.810
But infrared light / heat bounces off them
so what you will do -

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.120
you are a satellite, you are a surveying
spacecraft,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.719
you get your back to the Sun and look
out

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.099
from about the orbit of Venus.  And try to
find

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.739
all these asteroids.  And then you find one, what
do you do? Do you run in circles

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.040
screaming "AAAAAHHH"?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.389
No, No No, we've got to deflect it, just

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.180
a little, just a tiny amount.
Asteroid might be going 10 km/s

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.419
we want to change its speed

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.819
about 2 mm/s.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.959
So ten kilometers, that's ten times a
thousand meters, that's 10,000 meters.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.069
A millimeter that's a thousandth of

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.219
a meter so that you take the one over
the thousand its a thousand times ten

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:46.040
thousand,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.019
that's 10 million. You want to change its
speed a 10 millionth

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.109
of its total.  That's not very much,

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.430
but if you're an asteroid that comes in at

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.669
10,000 tonnes / 100,000 tonnes,

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.779
it does take quite a bit force to
change it a 10 millionth of its speed.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:11.019
Okay, how do we do that? Well, the easiest way

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.340
is to get a rocket, just a big rocket, just go out there and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.940
smack into it. Except as an outer
space so it just goes *silence*

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.560
like that.  Okay, that would change its
speed a little, now notice everybody,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.260
what if it's not just a rock?  What if its
a pile of rocks just

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.330
loosely held together by primordial
gravity?

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.470
And so if you hit them they will just spread out and you will have a shower of

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.920
rocks.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.680
That would be bad.  So, how about
this?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.990
We will get a big space craft that is massive,  a massive spacecraft will go out there

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.000
and just get nearer to the asteroid.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.280
Just get near it, and then the mutual
gravity

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.900
of the you the asteroid and me the spacecraft

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.670
will tug the asteroids just a
little bit

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.500
just a tiny amounth or maybe get on the other side and tug

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.010
this way.  That might work but here's
the problem.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.080
We need a huge amount of fuel, for days

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.600
and weeks and months and years.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.690
And what if it stops working, you can't
go out there and fix it. Okay,

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.320
how about this? The Laser Bees?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.100
A swarm of sunlight powered lasers,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.680
that are zapping the surface of the
asteroid,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.720
for days and weeks and monthsand years

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.960
*zapping noises*, so some asteroids, some rock is
vaporized

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.660
so the ejecta, or the stuff ejected has
momentum

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.250
just like rocket fuel, just like just
like standing on a skateboard and playing

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.110
catch with a bowling ball...

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.610
the way you do.  And so it would then

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.190
cause the asteroid to change its speed.  And
so you send a swarm of these laser

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.660
spacecraft, so that

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.450
if one of them stops working
you can use the other one.  And you can

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.280
have them come in from all
different angles.  And what if the asteroid is

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.540
irregularly shaped (like this)

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.050
you could beam it when the thing is
smooth

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.420
and then when there's a pit or an
inefficient place to be beaming you turn

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.250
off,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.900
you wait for the asteroid to turn,
then you turn it back on. You see everybody,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.570
just because it's unlikely, doesn't mean
it's not a big deal.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.580
You know if it only happens once every
few thousand years, well if it happens

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.110
on my watch

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.710
it would as the kids say "suck".  Okay, so we
don't want that to happen, we want to

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.310
avoid that.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.790
Asteroids are serious business, but
they're exciting.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.260
*Spaceship noise* Except we are in space so its *silence*.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.170
Got a burning question?  Well be sure to
subscribe asapscience, follow us

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.850
on Twitter and Facebook, that's what all
the kids are doing.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.470
And if it's an asteroid it may not be a burning
question, it might be

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.340
an impacting question, or even

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.690
and ablating question.
