00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:00.500
 Hello everyone 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.330
 Thank you for coming to London for the Playtime Conference. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.130
 This is my first time at this conference, so I should be a rookie in this regard. 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.040
 However, I have been engaged in game production for a long time. 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.910
 And I also like this line myself. 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.440
 I want to share with you today is one of my favorite topics. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.350
 Introduce how to attract users 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.670
 Keep playing your game every day, every week, every month so that all players can’t stop 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.014
 And want to experience more game content. 

00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:21.430
 This is one of the topics I want to share with you most. 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.490
 I am very honored to be here. 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.480
 Let's discuss this topic with everyone. Thank you for coming. 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.190
 In order to avoid everyone not seeing me, I will introduce myself again. 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.366
 My name is Alan Gutterman. 

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.990
 I work for the business development team at Google Play. 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.600
 Mainly responsible for game design and consulting with developers 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.050
 How to promote the best game design 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.133
 And best practices on the platform 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.790
 Then let's get started. 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.440
 This is today's topic 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.660
 First, we need to define the definition of "interaction" 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.881
 Because this theme is very simple and easy to understand. 

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:51.380
 But there are still some places worth clarifying 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.620
 To ensure that everyone has a consistent understanding 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.170
 Make sure that we are all talking about the same thing 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.336
 Then we have to talk about the core part of today’s speech. 

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:01.410
 That is to design the game for the purpose of improving the degree of interaction. 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.959
 We will talk about Google Play Game Services. 

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.020
 Just now Ben and John are very clear 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.960
 Introduced this kind of service it is a game for you 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.670
 Create a wonderful interactive toolbox 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.430
 A variety of essential tools are basically available 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.210
 Followed by the fourth theme 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.140
 We are talking about the community because the community is really important. 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.270
 It’s your attraction to developers, sorry, wrong. 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.900
 Should be your way to engage users as a developer to interact with your game. 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.340
 So what is interaction? 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.150
 I think everyone in the room may know 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.800
 How to measure engagement 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.020
 I mean, we will see the retention rate of 1 day, 7 days, 30 days. 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.610
 Through this method 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.490
 We can understand how users interact with the game. 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.250
 Do they love the game? 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.409
 We will also look at the number of daily sessions and session duration. 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200
 In addition, we will also look at an indicator 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.866
 It is similar to sticky factors 

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.240
 That is the ratio of the number of active users per day to the number of active users per month. 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.070
 That is DAU/MAU, this is a percentage value. 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.140
 But what is the nature of interaction? 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.204
 We know how to measure it but what is it? 

00:01:56.204 --> 00:01:57.620
 In fact, there are two types of interactions. 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.670
 I want to introduce these two types of interactions. 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.430
 The first is direct interaction 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.220
 This is an interaction we often see. 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.760
 It is also a relatively intuitive one. 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.720
 Because it refers to 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.100
 Someone is using games and playing games 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.530
 This is a game called Two Dots. 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.747
 This is the picture after I passed the 123rd level. 

00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:15.955
 This is how direct interaction is very easy to understand. 

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:17.720
 Is the player directly in the game 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.239
 All interactions 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.530
 But there is another type of interaction that we will cover in detail later. 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.071
 I will mention it a little now. 

00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:25.690
 Because this interaction is also very important 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.980
 I call it community interaction. 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.850
 This concept can be understood in this way 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.470
 Think about what your hobbies are 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.620
 Very interesting is 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.720
 I was thinking about this example before watching the opening video. 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.770
 It was before this opening theme speech by Purnima this morning. 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.930
 The opening video that was played 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.750
 Let me think of this example of fishing. 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.750
 Suppose there is a great fishing app. 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.370
 Then this app will naturally attract 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.600
 Members of the fishing enthusiast community interact with it 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.570
 So this example is just right 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.470
 Thanks to the coincidence 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.320
 Otherwise I am afraid I can't find a better example. 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.380
 The example I want to say is when I was younger. 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.780
 Once I returned to my hometown of Houston, Texas. 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.240
 That is the border between the Gulf of Mexico and the United States. 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.680
 There is a small town called Galveston nearby. 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.295
 Is a great place for fishing 

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.420
 One night, the night is beautiful. 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.850
 So my friend and I decided to go out fishing. 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.220
 So we went and caught the fish 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.460
 Last 10 minutes before returning 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.430
 We caught a big fish of 10 kg. 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.226
 Honestly, that was the most productive night I have ever fished. 

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:27.100
 I am here to tell you this story. 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.140
 Everyone started playing earlier today. 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.040
 The app introduced in the video 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.390
 These behaviors are social interactions 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.340
 This kind of interaction means that you are not directly engaged in a hobby. 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.370
 Or everything that is done with a game or this hobby 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.280
 Or this game related activity 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.340
 When I throw a fishing rod 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.520
 Or when I play Two Dots or other games 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.954
 This is direct interaction 

00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:49.620
 The second type of interaction is community interaction 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.499
 This kind of interaction is also important 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:52.790
 We will explain the exact reason later. 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.490
 Let's talk about the topic of "designing games for the purpose of enhancing interaction". 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.130
 I have just introduced the exact definition of interaction. 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.950
 Now let's talk about how to design games for this purpose. 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.954
 I can cite countless games as examples. 

00:04:06.954 --> 00:04:08.370
 Explain for everyone 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.630
 Why are they designed to increase engagement? 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.960
 But this is not very useful. 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.714
 So I decided to narrow the scope to three games. 

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.130
 I have been playing these three games for a long time. 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.750
 Their styles are very different 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.400
 But their launch time is almost 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.090
 Almost all launched for about a year and a half 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.560
 And have very good results on Play. 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.670
 One of the games is "Two Dots" Has anyone played "Two Dots" in the audience? 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.800
 Please raise your hand 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.970
 Ok 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.290
 About half of people have played this game very well. 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.290
 Another game may be a bit like the US 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.070
 Called "Family Guy: Quest For Stuff" 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.810
 Developed by TinyCo 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.730
 People who have played, please raise your hand and have two people, not bad. 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.752
 Oh, no, three people are great. 

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.460
 The last game is Hearthstone 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.200
 Who played this game developed by Blizzard Entertainment? 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.711
 Ok, let me see how many people have played with Two Dots. 

00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:52.210
 awesome 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.856
 These three games are very good 

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:55.230
 And the style is very different 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.600
 "Two Dots" is basically 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.000
 Casual games that everyone usually play 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.810
 TinyCo's "Family Guy" belongs to the construction game 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.610
 It is similar to the game "Sim City" which is a medium hardcore game. 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.636
 The Hearthstone is 

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:06.760
 Hardcore games on the Play platform 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.270
 The three games I picked 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.956
 Very different in terms of game design, style and type 

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:14.330
 Let's talk about these games and their design concepts. 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.542
 This is the picture of "Family Guy: Quest For Stuff" 

00:05:19.542 --> 00:05:21.000
 This picture I found online 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.870
 This picture clearly illustrates the game 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.320
 Why can it be so popular for so long? 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.520
 This is the content screen after the game is launched 1 year later. 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.930
 This game has been launched for 1 and a half years. 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.400
 And this is exactly the content screen when it was launched for 1 year. 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.830
 This game is through the following loop mode 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.620
 To operate and provide services 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.870
 TinyCo releases new content 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.120
 Players create these in the game 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.450
 The gameplay of this build game 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.400
 Similar to games like Sim City or Farmville 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.680
 Players need to build content and they slowly complete the construction of these content 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.580
 So they will present a variety of content in their beautiful city. 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.619
 Then TinyCo will release more content. 

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:57.160
 For the player to experience and build and complete all the build work 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.350
 The whole game is constantly cycling in this mode. 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.390
 TinyCo must complete this cycle in a very fast pace 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.040
 So the company releases new content every two weeks. 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.280
 I call this model "content stove" 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.430
 I didn't mean to downplay this game. I really like this game. 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.987
 The so-called stove is used to burn things. 

00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:17.570
 I call it the content stove. 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.870
 Because TinyCo is constantly introducing new content. 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.830
 Players experience this content and slowly burn it out 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.120
 Just like you keep adding coal to the stove 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.857
 Just to keep the fire strong 

00:06:26.857 --> 00:06:28.940
 If you stop adding coal to the stove 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.149
 The fire in the stove will go out 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:32.690
 This is one way to maintain user engagement. 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.630
 But this way must invest a lot of resources 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.440
 And the resource consumption is also very fast 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.820
 In this way, the content stove actually 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.790
 Unable to expand flexibly 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.000
 So I put the content stove again. 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.180
 Metaphor for single player content 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.150
 One item for an interaction 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.900
 After experiencing an item 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.670
 I can't experience it again. 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.580
 Therefore, it does not improve the degree of interaction well. 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.400
 So the question now is when you design the game for the purpose of improving your interaction. 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.595
 How to improve the interaction when using this mode? 

00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:04.220
 How can I make my own development time or development cost? 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.553
 Get a higher profit? 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.920
 Next 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.620
 Let's take a look at the example of "Two Dots". 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.840
 Because half of the people here have played this game. 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.870
 So I don't need to introduce this game in detail. 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.920
 However, it is still a matchmaking game for people who have never played. 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.790
 But it is different from Candy Crush or Cookie Jam. 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.110
 In fact, the matching game itself is very much like the content stove. 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.320
 Both Cookie Jam and Candy Crush 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.710
 More than 1000 levels of content are amazing 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.880
 And each level has been carefully designed and measured 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.590
 "Two Dots" has more than 400 levels 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.900
 So it is also a content stove 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.400
 The game launches a new level 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.441
 The most loyal players will quickly break through 

00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:47.860
 Then I started to wait for the game to launch a new level. 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.609
 So definitely it’s the content stove. 

00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:52.100
 But things are not over 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.670
 Next is the most interesting part 

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.040
 Look at this again, this is the score when I broke 123. 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.530
 242 points 

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.540
 I got a star for the top three stars. 

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.490
 Then there is my avatar on the leaderboard. 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.030
 My friend Aaron got a higher score than me. 

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.000
 And my score is higher than Eric 

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.880
 So what can I do? 

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.320
 I can continue to play the 124th level. 

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.740
 Continue to consume game content 

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.562
 Because it is a content stove 

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.270
 But the subtlety lies in 

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.110
 I will replay this level under the encouragement. 

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.120
 In fact, this incentive comes from two aspects. 

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.590
 On the one hand, I want to replay this level. 

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.940
 To get a higher star rating 

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.262
 This is the incentive set by the developer. 

00:08:30.262 --> 00:08:32.470
 On the other hand, I want to play again to defeat Aaron. 

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.350
 Let his smile face behind me 

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.516
 Because his smile is a bit like laughing at me to show off his high scores. 

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:40.890
 Therefore, whether it is the pursuit of personal achievement 

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.980
 Like getting three stars 

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.110
 Or hope to exceed friends' high scores 

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:50.030
 These motivations will prompt players to play the same content repeatedly. 

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.980
 This actually increases the level of engagement. 

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.670
 So from this perspective, the repetitive playability of content 

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.690
 Can increase engagement 

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.300
 This is the key 

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.150
 If you want your own development costs and development time 

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.870
 Bringing you higher returns 

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.070
 Repetitive playability of content is the key 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.670
 Thus 

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.650
 What is different from what we saw in the TinyCo example is 

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.680
 A content is more than just an interaction but can create multiple interactions 

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.580
 I want to explain one thing through the last slide. 

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.871
 Let's go back to the previous slide. 

00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:25.202
 The three stars representing achievements 

00:09:25.202 --> 00:09:26.660
 Belonging to a limited achievement 

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.265
 Once the achievement of Samsung is achieved 

00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:29.640
 I basically don't want to play this off again. 

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.340
 As long as I get three stars, I will be satisfied. 

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.410
 But look at this leaderboard again. 

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.440
 Suppose I actually won him in order to overplay Aaron. 

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.100
 I may post this message on Facebook or Twitter. 

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.210
 Or send an email directly or you may go to Aaron and say 

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.070
 Hey, man, I am over your score. 

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.580
 Then he may be stimulated and want to beat me. 

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.481
 Maybe Eric will join the battle at the time. 

00:09:49.481 --> 00:09:51.730
 As a result, everyone began to compete with each other. 

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.800
 Then evolve into a long-term competition 

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.160
 In contrast, the developer is here 

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.700
 Set the personal achievements of the three stars 

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.530
 Ultimately limited in terms of increased engagement 

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:07.030
 But this kind of competition for high scores can improve game engagement endlessly. 

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.640
 This is why we say 

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.310
 Repeatable playability is actually the key to increasing engagement 

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.680
 In general, the competition of multiple players, or any competition 

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.857
 Usually allows players to interact with the game infinitely 

00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:19.440
 Honestly, we can continue to compete for the highest score of this level. 

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.950
 Everyone saw this in the early years when game consoles were popular. 

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.870
 Gamers of the 80s 

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.640
 I like to compete for high scores in games like Pac-Man. 

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.624
 It’s still the same today because the game’s approach is similar. 

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.930
 I said before that I will talk about Hearthstone. 

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.410
 This is the scene of the Hearthstone Championship. 

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.600
 Many players gathered together to compete in the game 

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.041
 The scene is quite spectacular 

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:47.040
 "The Hearthstone" was released about a year and a half. 

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.910
 But the player’s enthusiasm for the game has not been reduced. 

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.310
 You may ask yourself 

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.290
 Should I add a multiplayer mode to the game? 

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.770
 Will multiplayer games be a "magic bullet"? 

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.897
 This is of course a good start. 

00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:01.480
 What else can you do? 

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.817
 Let the multiplayer game successfully enter the market? 

00:11:02.817 --> 00:11:05.400
 You won't say that we are going to join the multiplayer mode and see what happens. 

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.292
 Things are definitely not that simple 

00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:08.250
 Hearthstone uses a unique method to build games 

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.850
 To increase user engagement 

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.830
 Allow many players to be in different levels 

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.330
 Play at different paces for everyone 

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.190
 Let's take a look at this game. 

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.060
 This is the picture I saw when I first logged into Hearthstone. 

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.275
 This is a daily task 

00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:26.780
 I can be a mage or a shaman. 

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.602
 Or the identity of the paladin or samurai won two victories 

00:11:28.602 --> 00:11:30.060
 After completing all these tasks 

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.200
 I can get all the gold coins 

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.710
 That is a total of 140 gold coins 

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.850
 These tasks are at the end of each day 

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.750
 That is, it will be refreshed after 24 hours. 

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.950
 So I can log in to the game every day. 

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.680
 Complete these tasks 

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.025
 Great design 

00:11:46.025 --> 00:11:47.650
 They recently released a feature 

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.924
 Called "tavern chaos" 

00:11:48.924 --> 00:11:51.340
 This feature has not been released when I capture this screenshot. 

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.090
 But I still use this screenshot 

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.710
 It’s convenient for me to explain the pace of the game. 

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.110
 Hotel chaos is a competition from Wednesday to Sunday 

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.940
 The system will bill the reward at the end of Sunday 

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.182
 And will show the player’s ranking in the tournament. 

00:12:03.182 --> 00:12:04.640
 The competition is held once a week 

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.870
 I have to log in to the game to join the competition once the day of the week arrives. 

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.795
 So this type of activity is similar to the daily task mode. 

00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:13.710
 Just it is once a week 

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.310
 This is a screenshot of the March 2015 season. 

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.080
 Players reach level 6 in casual mode at the top 3% of all player rankings 

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.550
 Someone wants to guess this is my achievement. 

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.510
 Or is it a screenshot of the achievements of a player I am looking for online? 

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.490
 This is a screenshot taken online, not mine. 

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.540
 I am so good, just fine. 

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.870
 I once played to level 10 

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.410
 This is the ranking of the March 2015 season. 

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.550
 Is the monthly ranking 

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.710
 Therefore, Hearthstone has a daily mission weekly tournament 

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.200
 There is also a monthly ranking 

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.090
 Do you see their strategy? 

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.120
 Let's see how they design this architecture. 

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.460
 There is a variety of multiplayer game modes in Hearthstone. 

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.062
 Single player mode 

00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:54.020
 For example, there is a single adventure mode in the arena. 

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.394
 Players can play with the last progress at any time 

00:12:55.394 --> 00:12:56.970
 And everyone can play 

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.760
 This part is content that can be played at any time. 

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.250
 Again, the daily task 

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.410
 You can get the rewards when you play the game every day. 

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.970
 You can also participate in the weekly competition of "Bar Fighting" 

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.620
 The other is the game mode designed for the core players. 

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.510
 Let them compete to compete for monthly rankings 

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.200
 Do you see any tricks? 

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.940
 They designed a multiplayer game 

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.829
 The whole game is designed in a variety of ways. 

00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:24.620
 Let the player want to play how to play 

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.200
 Whether it is a daily task or a weekly competition 

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.650
 Still monthly ranking 

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.970
 They try their best to take care of every player. 

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.619
 Let players follow their own specific way 

00:13:34.619 --> 00:13:36.160
 Looking for fun in the game 

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.730
 Whether it’s extremely casual or extremely intense or in any way between the two 

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.130
 I think this is really smart. 

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.600
 We just talked about the tasks in this game. 

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.730
 Also mentioned in all of these games 

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:49.867
 Multiplayer competition 

00:13:49.867 --> 00:13:51.450
 Also mentioned the leaderboard 

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.397
 And achievement 

00:13:54.397 --> 00:13:55.980
 These things sound familiar 

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.660
 I have just talked about all of this before. 

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.840
 That is the Google Play game service. 

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.000
 Play Game Services is a toolbox designed for developers 

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.990
 Assist them in developing all these great features 

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.270
 Make the player in the process of playing the game 

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.790
 Keep an interest in the game 

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.920
 These are the images I took from the Play Games app. 

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.160
 By the way, its installation has exceeded one billion. 

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.777
 If you have never used this app before 

00:14:16.777 --> 00:14:17.860
 It may be useful to use it immediately. 

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.560
 This is a great app. I can use it to manage how I play games. 

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.910
 I am a player on this platform. 

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.114
 I will open this app to see the new game news. 

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.530
 Let's take a look at these things. 

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.660
 There is a leaderboard here. 

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.690
 This is a game I played "Threes!" 

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.820
 This is one of my favorite casual games 

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.694
 Doug is much better than me, I always win him. 

00:14:34.694 --> 00:14:36.610
 I will continue to play this game under the encouragement. 

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.540
 Strive to exceed his score 

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.790
 This is another very popular game on our platform. 

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.980
 Called "Island" 

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.280
 I have completed 48% of my achievements 

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.460
 My progress is slow 

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.020
 I know that John and Ben are better than me. 

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.550
 Next, let me talk about the task. The example I gave is the game of PennyPop. 

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.270
 Called "Battle Camp" 

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.590
 Every time a new task is displayed in the Play Games app 

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.110
 I will be anxious to complete the new task. 

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.600
 In addition, we still have multiplayer games. 

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.700
 Includes time-based multiplayer and real-time multiplayer games 

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.120
 Allows you to compete directly with other players 

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.020
 This is very important 

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.580
 We mentioned before 

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.200
 How to make your development costs and time bring you the most benefit 

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.665
 If you like, you can build all of this content 

00:15:21.665 --> 00:15:25.160
 But to be honest, Ben Frankel can help you. 

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.940
 Very easy to achieve this 

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.611
 You can use our service directly 

00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:30.860
 Achievements, leaderboards or multiplayer games 

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.710
 All content is readily available and ready to use 

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.280
 This is a toolbox that can help you increase the user engagement of your game. 

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.300
 That's it 

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.402
 Let’s go back and look at this picture of Hearthstone. 

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.110
 This tournament looks very exciting. 

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.115
 Many players are actively participating 

00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:49.240
 I don't know how many screens there are in total. 

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.000
 There are about 10 

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.500
 Did everyone notice it? There are many people next to you who are not playing games. 

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.140
 There is also a replay screen above 

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.350
 This tournament itself is a community interaction. 

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.570
 Someone is playing the game, someone is watching, and some people are talking about it. 

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.260
 Actually not everyone is playing games 

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.420
 And those who are not playing games 

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.830
 As we have defined before 

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.230
 These people are participating in community interaction 

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.287
 Why is community interaction so important? 

00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:22.690
 You may have seen such a graph before. 

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.510
 This is a very typical marketing curve in Marketing 101. 

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.285
 Used to track the adoption of products by people over time 

00:16:30.285 --> 00:16:32.285
 These objects include innovators and early adopters 

00:16:32.285 --> 00:16:36.430
 Early majority, late majority and laggard 

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.330
 If you read Malcolm Gladwell's book 

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.620
 You must have seen this curve 

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.750
 What I want to say is 

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.640
 Some influential people will encourage others to download the game. 

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.850
 Go fishing, buy magazines or try a restaurant 

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.970
 These are the people who actually engage in community interaction. 

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.779
 They are not only influential 

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:00.320
 And they are all well-known experts. 

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.420
 They basically belong to this section 

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.135
 For any new product 

00:17:06.135 --> 00:17:07.010
 They are the people who are most active to experience 

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.319
 And this applies to any industry 

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.940
 So the importance of community interaction is self-evident 

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.859
 People talk about your game 

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.280
 Post information about your game on various social media 

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.030
 And making a YouTube video. 

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.920
 Behavior like this 

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.970
 All belong to the category of community interaction, so community interaction is crucial 

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.730
 Because the community is actually 

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.110
 Your game’s interaction and marketing channels 

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.880
 So the community is very important 

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.200
 Currently, the cost of acquiring users is extremely high. 

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.380
 On our platform or most other platforms 

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.660
 Sometimes the cost of getting a user is more than $15. 

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.150
 However, community interaction can 

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:54.030
 Free new users for your game 

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.840
 Very incredible! 

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.340
 If you want to make the game attract users for a long time 

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.820
 And keep getting new users 

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.165
 This is one of the most effective methods 

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.010
 Finally, I want to talk a little more about social interaction. 

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.370
 I wish I still remember 

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:12.720
 I talked to the community administrator about this. 

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.740
 But the conversation is very interesting 

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.930
 And very important 

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.000
 We explored a lot today how to make the most of it. 

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.400
 Development costs and development time 

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.020
 Because our resources are limited 

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.560
 For the community, you can build your own community in real time. 

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.520
 No need for trouble engineers 

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.470
 Graphic designer and product manager 

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.410
 No need for quality assurance 

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.430
 No need to post a new version on Google Play 

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.290
 No need to go through the review process 

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.550
 You can develop the game at the same time 

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.680
 Create a community in real time 

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.620
 This is obvious 

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.190
 But also very important 

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.240
 Your community should be open at all times and be engaged at any time 

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.840
 At any time, you can engage with community members through a variety of activities. 

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.280
 And no need to bother the development team 

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.180
 Will not interfere with other progress and compete for resources 

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.930
 Your community manager or community team 

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.705
 Is completely independent 

00:19:10.705 --> 00:19:12.204
 this point is very important 

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.960
 Regarding the community, I will add the last point. 

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.640
 We just discussed the online community 

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.531
 I showed some pictures of the Twitter feed. 

00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:25.780
 Also talked about YouTube, etc. 

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.150
 However, the best way to interact with users 

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.947
 There is no one-to-one interaction with users directly in real life. 

00:19:34.947 --> 00:19:36.530
 I want to take Glue as an example. 

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.340
 I have worked with Glu for a long time. 

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.400
 The two games they developed are the most popular games on our platform. 

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.400
 One of the games is "Racing Rivals". This is the most popular racing game on our platform. 

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.220
 Another game is "Kim Kardashian Hollywood" 

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.480
 I believe everyone is very familiar with this game. 

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.850
 Their community activities are quite ingenious. 

00:19:55.850 --> 00:20:00.260
 Really shows what the community can bring 

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.210
 Powerful role 

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.814
 Let's take a look at Racing Rivals. 

00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:06.230
 "Racing Rivals" has been available for several years. 

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.880
 It was originally a Facebook game that has now been turned into a mobile game. 

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.710
 It has a large number of players 

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.480
 I have been playing this game for years. 

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.355
 And collect the car 

00:20:14.355 --> 00:20:16.230
 These players love this game for ten minutes. 

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.605
 They spent a lot of money in this game and actively participated in it. 

00:20:18.605 --> 00:20:20.440
 As people say, this type of player is a car enthusiast. 

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.770
 They love cars and are addicted to this game. 

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.580
 When the developer is at the studio in Long Beach 

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.791
 When developing the next function kit 

00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:30.290
 They will think 

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.050
 We have a group of diehard gamers. 

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.900
 For what we want to develop next 

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.740
 They should be able to make some suggestions 

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.940
 Because when you look at the development blueprint 

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.480
 You can develop with imagination 

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.320
 Can also follow the example of Glu 

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.250
 They invite 20 or 25 most loyal players 

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.970
 Take a flight to Long Beach 

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.940
 Sitting together and discussing next should be 

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.142
 What features are developed in Racing Rivals 

00:20:55.142 --> 00:20:57.350
 They started a heated discussion about planning new features 

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.400
 They are equal to the community 

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.340
 Turn into a game designer 

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.080
 I promise, when these guys and girls 

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.230
 After flying back to my hometown 

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.834
 It is very likely that "Racing Rivals" will be highly recommended. 

00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:12.500
 Maybe everybody will say 

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.050
 I personally experienced this unforgettable event. 

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.730
 I went to Long Beach and discussed with the Racing Rivals development team. 

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.930
 Help them design this game together 

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.730
 I dare to package tickets with everyone. 

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.110
 This will make these players and their friends more like this game. 

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.834
 The publicity effect is even more amazing 

00:21:25.834 --> 00:21:27.250
 Like me, I am also promoting them now. 

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.630
 This is the social interaction of Racing Rivals. 

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.820
 Similarly, for the game "Kim Kardashian" they held a competition in the game. 

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.910
 And invite some of the most loyal young players in the game. 

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.072
 Take a flight to meet Kim 

00:21:40.072 --> 00:21:41.530
 They are not discussing game design 

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.980
 Just held a meeting 

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.680
 But I promise everyone who goes to meet Kim, including me. 

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.569
 If everyone is interested 

00:21:48.569 --> 00:21:50.610
 I can see the photos on my phone later. 

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:51.680
 I will come to me later. 

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.050
 I can't put these photos publicly here. 

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.820
 I promise everyone who attends the meeting. 

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.270
 Will definitely promote this game to people 

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.700
 This is a social activity in real life. 

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.720
 You can take this opportunity to talk face to face with consumers. 

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.760
 And listen to their feedback 

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.890
 This is the most effective way to promote community interaction 

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.600
 Will definitely return after a period of time 

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.402
 This is the end of my speech today. 

00:22:16.402 --> 00:22:19.930
 [applause] 

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:26.580
 [play music]
