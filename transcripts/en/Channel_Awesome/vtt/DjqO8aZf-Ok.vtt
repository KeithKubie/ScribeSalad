[Nostalgia Critic Theme]

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.780
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.440
A Warner Bros. animated film that isn't The Iron Giant?

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.580
Pfft! Sold!

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.560
[whimsical orchestral music plays]

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.760
I honestly think from Day 1, 
I've been getting requests to review this movie.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.200
While I don't know anyone that sees the 1994 
adaptation of Swan Lake as the worst thing ever,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.400
it does carry this awkwardness that just enough people saw it to make four more direct-to-DVD awkwardnesseses.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.960
It also helped that the movie, 
at the time, was very well advertised.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.100
Every other kid show had a
 commercial for this playing in between.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.080
But also keep in mind that at the time, 
the only animation studio

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.700
making any kind of profit back then was Disney.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.340
And just the same way Disney 
re-released The Little Mermaid for a limited time when Anastasia posed a threat,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.920
guess what movie, only five months after its premiere, they decided to re-release on the exact same day--

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.860
D'oh! Highest-grossing movie 
Disney's ever made at the time!

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.740
What lousy luck!

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.580
What are the chances we just happened to re-release this film on the exact same weekend?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.360
"That company's a monster."

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.980
But after it went to video, kids were still kinda curious whether or not there was anything worth watching in it.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.440
The answer? Well, let's take a look for ourselves; 
this is the long-requested Swan Princess.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.860
The film opens up once upon every fairy tale backwash as an old king awaits the birth of his first child.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.160
Narrator: "He was growing old 
and had no child to inherit the throne."

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.180
"Then, happily, a daughter was born,
 and she was given the name Odette."

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.180
Nostalgia Critic: "Here's to the assumption 
that her mother died in birth!"

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.560
Crowd: "Yayyyyy!"

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.180
Nostalgia Critic: Many come from
 across the land to visit the newborn...

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.000
...3-year-old.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.040
and the king forms a plan with a queen from another kingdom to play matchmaker with their kids.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.900
But an evil sorcerer named Rothbart,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.920
whose name is so strange, I need 
more time to think of a proper joke for it,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.540
apparently has other plans.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.780
Narrator: "For he was preparing 
to take William's kingdom,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.500
by means of the Forbidden Arts"

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.140
Nostalgia Critic: "Through the evil leprechaun magic of pink hearts, yellow moons, green clovers, and blue diamonds."

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.180
"They're magically diabolical."

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.180
Nostalgia Critic: Though his scheme is stopped, 
our villain - played by the late Jack Palance,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.160
swears his life to get revenge.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.720
"Someday, I'll get my power back...and when I do,"

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.620
"Everything you love will be mine!"

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.320
"You were my Number One Guy!"

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.440
So a young Odette and a young Derek 
are forced to hang out with each other.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.400
But as is typical of any 90's romance,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.220
they, of course, have to hate each other 
through out the majority of the process.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.580
Derek: ♪I can't believe I'm stuck with her all summer♪

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.580
♪I'll bet she doesn't wrestle, hunt, or box♪

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.880
Now to its credit, the fact that they're bitter 
kids does make this scene work a little better.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.980
And... yeah, it's actually kind of a cute number.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.160
That is when they're not obviously
 ripping off other Disney trademarks.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.880
Bromley: ♪I think you really sorta like her, 'fess up♪

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.820

[romantic music plays]

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.140
[Coughing] So obviously Sleeping Beauty, I can't believe you're ripping off Sleeping Beauty, have you no shame?

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.840
[clears throat]

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.320
Odette: ♪This is not my idea♪
Derek: ♪This isn't my idea♪

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.600
♪Of fun♪

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.980
But then, quite literally out of nowhere, 
they suddenly love each other.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.940
Again, I guess like most 90's romances.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.100
Derek: ♪She started out as such an ugly duckling♪

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.480
♪and somehow suddenly became a swan♪

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.840
Oh, now isn't that a charming lesson?

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.320
Years of hate and abuse are fine in a relationship

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.860
as long as your sexual urges 
deem your partner a sweet piece of ass.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.820
Hey, it worked in Meg Ryan films 
and she turned out just fine--

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.520
Don't do what they do in Meg Ryan films!

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.180
Derek: "Arrange the marriage!"

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.120
[excited chatter]

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.280
Arrange the marriage?

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.820
They've been arranging it 
practically since you were a sperm!

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.680
"Wait."

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.400
[music stops abruptly]

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.480
"What? You're all I ever wanted."

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.260
"You're beautiful!"

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.540
"But what else?"

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.700
"What else?"

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.520
"What else is there?"

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.260
Nostalgia Critic: "Wait, wait! I know this one!"

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.120
"Um...I can put my dick in you--uh, 
you're sizzling arm candy, uh--"

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.640
"You're a means to my incredibly shallow end!"

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.040
King William: "We tried, Uberta."

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.460
"No one can say we didn't try."

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.220
Queen Uberta: "All of these years of planning..."

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.380
"WASTED!!"

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.160
Yes, the parents should be very upset that a couple who hated each other and yet were forced to be together

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.840
still end up hating each other.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.320
Clearly, this is all the children's fault!

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.840
"You must see something other than Odette's beauty."

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.800
"Ha! Of course I do, Rogers."

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.860
"She's like...you know..."

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.560
"How about...?"

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.040
"And then... I mean, right?"

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.620
"Look, she makes my hose jump, okay?"

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.580
"It's the Middle Ages, love is like an appetizer. 
It's good to start off with but not essential."

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.460
But little do they know that Rothbart--

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.120
God, it's like the sound you make 
when you hiccup and belch.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.240
[burping hiccup sound]

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.320
--turns into an evil animal and takes Odette away.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.280
Derek arrives on the scene.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.520
"Who did this?"

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.980
"A...great animal..."

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.220
"It's not what it seems...it's not what it seems!"

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.660
"We're not Disney!"

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.040
"No matter how hard we try to make it look, 
we'll never be Disney!"

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.780
"Where is Odette?"

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.440
"Odette...is..."

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.580
"Odette..."

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.820
"Well, I know she's Odette, but 
that doesn't answer my question."

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.960
[rimshot]

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.580
"...gone..."

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.360
Derek: [shouts] "ODETTE!!"

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.220
Nostalgia Critic: "I will forever 
miss your beauty and nothing else!"

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.920
So we discover that the evil Rothbart,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.000
sounds like a gay porno with 
the lead singer of Van Halen,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.400
has kidnapped Odette and has whisked 
her away to the horrible...devastating...

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.580
...prettiest evil lair banishment can buy.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.840
Why the fuck does he want the king's land?
He's living in a resort by Thomas Kinkade!

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.600
"Now, don't let my little spell make you sad, Odette. 
It doesn't even last the whole day."

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.600
So he turns her into a swan, but apparently the moonlight only on the lake can change her back to normal.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.200
He also reveals that the confession of one's true
 love is the only thing that'll stop the transformation.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.140
"What I really want is your father's kingdom."

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.440
"Take it then! You have enough power."

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.720
"Once you steal something, 
you spend your whole life fighting to keep it."

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.660
"If I marry the only heir to the throne, we'll
 rule your father's kingdom together-"

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.240
"Never!"

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.700
"Where are you going?"

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.080
"As soon as moonlight leaves the lake, 
you'll turn back into a swan."

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.620
[sobbing]

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.500
Wow.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.400
I mean...wow.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.540
You've been waiting over, what, 
ten years to put this plan together

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.780
and THAT'S...that's your big magnum opus 
that you finally scrounged up?

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.180
[sighs]

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.500
Alright, come in here, come in here.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.540
I'm sorry, it's just, I need help to get 
this out as quickly as possible

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.800
because there are just too damn many to go through.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.520
So, without further ado:

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.060
GO!

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.380
If she did agree, what's to stop her from 
changing her mind after the spell is broken?

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.360
If Odette is a swan, 
what's to stop her from flying away and communicating with someone by writing in the sand?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.140
If he wants to marry her legally, 
why doesn't he just hypnotize her to say yes?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.820
The only thing to break the spell 
is a person confessing their love.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.060
Why? It seems counterproductive to the plan.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.640
What's to stop her in human form from sneaking 
up behind him and knocking the fucker out?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.840
Is there really no law to marrying banished people?
Kind of seems like a no-brainer.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.700
He disappears in the day doing nothing.
Why doesn't he do SOMETHING?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.100
Couldn't he threaten someone she loves to force 
her to marry him? She doesn't really have an incentive.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.280
If he can change anyone into anything, 
why doesn't he change anyone into anything?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.740
He can make himself look like the king!
He can make someone else look like Odette!

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.340
There's a million other ways around this--!

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.280
[loud buzz]

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.360
Oh! That's it, but thank you guys so much.
Now back to the closet until I need you again.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.120
No, but it smells like dead armpit in there!

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.680
GO!

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.680
I'll use you next time I have a Sam &amp; Max joke.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.860
Malcolm: He never makes enough of those.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.840
So Derek tests his skills by 
having an arrow shoot at him.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.900
One could only hope this 
leads to a Saint Sebastian homage.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.740
You don't even know who that is, do you?

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.460

Don't go to Google, your soul knows the truth!

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.760
"Now!"

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.480
Uh, yeah. Can we get the judges' take on that?

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.420
That's what I thought.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.460
Even for a fantasy aimed at two-year-olds, 
that's pretty fucking stupid.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.140
But he also practices his hunting 
skills on some of his servants.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.960
And sadly, it's not as violent as you would think.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.180
[yelling]

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.340
Ah, five episodes of Animaniacs 
were given up to bring you this.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.300
Now we'll never see the episode 
where Pinky and the Brain kiss!

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.960
"Lord Rogers, I must object. We are musicians!"

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.080

Um...is this really warranting of a song?

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.900
Do these characters we've never 
seen before and won't see again

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.220
demand a musical interpretation 
of their emotional struggle?

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.440
Well, something you'll discover is,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.740
remember how even though it was kind of corny, the child characters were actually pretty distinct, memorable,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.900
and even surprisingly enjoyable?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.600
Well, that was before they remembered,
"Oh, yeah! We're diet Disney!"

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.420
Anything that was different and unique 
has to be tossed out for one calorie of the enjoyment.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.520
Because of this, Odette and Derek

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.520
Yeah, see how expressive they are? 
See how funny they are?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.880
See how different from every other 
animated film out at the time they seem to be?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.240
Chuck it! Now watching our characters is like seeing an unsalted cracker propose to a sheet of sand paper.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.180
Nothing stands out about them at all and that 
somehow is supposed to make you care about them.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.640
So, to make up for how incredibly boring they are,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.900
they give all the colorful songs to hastily rushed comic relief that serve little to no purpose in the story.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.980
Like the coach servant song.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.380
♪Girls would walk around or even crawl♪

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.060
The women we know aren't going to marry Derek,
 so there's no purpose to them at all song.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.200
♪Princesses on parade♪

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:10.120
And, of course, a song so desperate to be popular
 they named it after a dying 90's T-shirt franchise.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.280
♪No fear♪

Not that I'm complaining. 
Keep it alive, people. Keep it alive.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.420
That last song, by the way, is sung 
by diet Disney comic relief as well.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.520
One is a frog voiced by John Cleese 
doing a god-awful Lumiere impression.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.700
"Ha! What a love dunce!"

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.280
"I don't want zees flowers, I must 'ave zos."

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.960
I don't know, I like his other French take better.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.620
"I fart in your general direction!"

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.820
"Your mother was a hamster and 
your father smelt of elderberries!"

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.200
"Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!"

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.280
And an upbeat old turtle voiced by--

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.740
"Why don't you just give her these flowers?
These are pretty."

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.340
Oh, God, shit, are you serious? Steven Wright?!

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.280
"Friends call me Speed."

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.840
"Ready for action, sir."

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.620
"Hey, batter, batter..."

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.080
"Have a nice flight!"

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.940
Okay, you dumbasses that put a Brit as a French man,
I'm not against this guy as an actor at all, far from it.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:13.780
I'm sure he can be great, but you have to 
put a fitting voice with a fitting character!

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:19.840
The turtle is usually smiling, always getting involved
 and feels a constant need to help people.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.480
Would you choose THIS guy for that?

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.820
"She said if you could know how and when 
you were gonna die, would you wanna know?"

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.380
"I said 'no', she said 'forget it then.'"
[audience laughing]

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.220
He's the only actor who could completely not try for a role and you would never know the difference!

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.760
Unless your character is called Depressy Duck or Suicidal Salamander, it's not gonna work!

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.220
"I can only kiss the man I love... and then he--"

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.960
"Must make a vow of everlasting love, I know!"

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.740
"And prove it to the world."

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.420
Prove it to the world?

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.520
Wow. That's a pretty egotistical spell you got there.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.280
Don't a lot of Hollywood couples try that and 
it doesn't usually turn out very good for them?

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.340
♬Derek, you and I were meant to be♬

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.960
But hey, that would be indicating 
that this movie knows nothing about real love

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.000
and hell, we all know that's not true!

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.900
Take this scene, where our couple sings 
about how much they love one another...

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.700
even though they left on bad terms,
 called off a wedding,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.360
90% of what we saw of them convinces 
us why they shouldn't be together

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.540
and absolutely nothing about them has changed at all.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.820
Um...true love?

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:30.320
Yeah, there's nothing in this movie outside of
 one look where they ever share any chemistry.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.460
Remember when Odette wants Derek to say something else he likes about her aside from her beauty?

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.700
"Is beauty all that matters to you?"

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.360
"What else is there?"

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.300
No, the more I think about it, I'm siding with him!
What else is there?

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.180
Nothing stands out about you two 
that makes you interesting at all!

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.340
If this movie can't even explain what else about them 
is supposed to be unique,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.860
why should the characters?

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.420
Disney developed more onscreen charisma with characters that you only knew for a few days!

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.600
You guys had a fucking childhood to develop their romance and you still ended up botching it!

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.140
How is that possible??

♪I'll never be alone♪

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.740
So Derek is bound to figure out what the King's last words meant by "the great animal, it's not what it seems."

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:25.580

he confessed his love to Odette!

Okay? OKAY? Because there's not much 
more of this diet Disney I can take!

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.520
This film feels like the movie that 
Enchanted was satirizing in the first third.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.180
It doesn't feel like someone wanted 
to tell a story out of passion,

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.840
it feels like it was told because someone else 
was making money with this other formula

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.780
and now they're gonna try that formula.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.360
The leads are a bore, the comedy's weak,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.300
the animation is much better at being wild 
and energized rather than soothing and romantic.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.440
But even then, a lot of the timing and characters are so poorly executed that even that doesn't hold much water.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.000
The only thing close to enjoyable 
is that opening number.

unimaginative and just a dull waste.
