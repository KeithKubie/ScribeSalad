Did you bring the needle? I'm excited. You're got to give us DNA.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.330
&gt;&gt; Well, we may not actually need a needle, because we first have to figure

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.100
out which cell type is going to be most

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.090
valuable for getting the genomic information from that.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.850
&gt;&gt; Well, let's say we can choose from any cell type

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.040
in the body no matter how difficult it is to obtain. Genetically

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.550
speaking, which cell type of the following would be the least

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.220
likely that we'd want to choose to obtain information about my whole genome?
