00:00:00.479 --> 00:00:04.135
- Hello and welcome to Khan
Academy live SAT class.

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:06.328
My name is Eric, I'm an SAT tutor

00:00:06.328 --> 00:00:09.407
and one of the SAT experts
here at Khan Academy.

00:00:09.407 --> 00:00:11.939
This is class number two of three

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.322
that we have planned for the
SAT over the next few weeks

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:19.709
and I'm very excited to be
covering SAT Reading today.

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:21.547
Before we jump into SAT Reading,

00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:23.548
I want to give you a preview
of what we're going to cover

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:26.793
today and next week, let's take a look.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:31.585
So last week we covered SAT
Math, in our first class,

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:33.547
and if you missed that class, don't worry,

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:36.172
we recorded it and you can
find it on our YouTube channel

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.716
so go ahead and check that
out if you're interested

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:42.844
and today, like I mentioned,
we're gonna cover SAT Reading

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:45.976
and then the following week,
we'll cover SAT Writing

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:48.140
and all of these classes
will be at the same times,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.473
so Thursday, they'll all be on Thursdays

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.793
at 7pm Eastern, 4pm Pacific,

00:00:57.484 --> 00:00:59.854
so these are all the classes
that we'll have planned

00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:01.843
and for today, let's take a look

00:01:01.843 --> 00:01:05.468
at what we'll cover for SAT Reading.

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:08.628
So for today's class, the first 25 minutes

00:01:08.628 --> 00:01:10.756
I'll spend giving some instruction

00:01:10.756 --> 00:01:12.627
and doing some practice problems together.

00:01:12.627 --> 00:01:14.847
Specifically, I'm going
to introduce a strategy

00:01:14.847 --> 00:01:16.849
called Rephrase &amp; Predict,

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.644
which is a more proactive approach,

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:21.510
that you can use for SAT Reading questions

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.082
that I found really helpful

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:27.198
and that many students
find helpful to try.

00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:30.394
Next, I'll cover Words in Context problems

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:34.304
and Command of Evidence problems as well

00:01:34.304 --> 00:01:36.990
and we'll do some practice
problems together.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.611
Then, in the next 10 minutes,

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:41.200
I will answer some student questions,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.853
and so at that point, you'll have a chance

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:46.400
to add comments in YouTube
and I'll try and answer

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.481
as many questions as I can
in the time that I have,

00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:51.667
I'll give out the Khan
Academy badge and all of that

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.334
and then in the last 25 minutes,

00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:58.381
you'll practice what you've
learned on Khan Academy

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:01.501
and just like last class, we have a number

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.835
of Khan Academy and College
Board experts available

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:07.918
to help you while you have questions.

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:13.265
Unlike last class, after
the instruction and Q&amp;A,

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:15.887
I'll sign off and you'll just head

00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:16.970
to Khan Academy to practice.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.806
You won't need to come back
to YouTube this time around

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.062
so you'll spend 35 minutes on YouTube

00:02:23.062 --> 00:02:25.359
and then, in the next
25 minutes, practice,

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.073
do reading problems and we'll be there

00:02:29.073 --> 00:02:31.382
to help via one-on-one chat.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:33.591
So, let's take a look at
what we're gonna cover

00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:34.924
and get started.

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:40.406
So why are we talking about proactive

00:02:40.406 --> 00:02:42.234
reading strategies today?

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:44.057
Well, let me pose a few questions

00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:46.324
and let me know if any
of these sound familiar

00:02:46.324 --> 00:02:48.716
or if you've ever been in
this kind of situation before.

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:51.128
So, have you ever read the answer choices

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:54.094
and thought, well, all of these look good,

00:02:54.094 --> 00:02:56.421
and, you know, you're kind of stuck there?

00:02:56.421 --> 00:03:01.251
Or, maybe you get the
question down to two choices

00:03:01.251 --> 00:03:03.176
but then end up picking the wrong one,

00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:07.186
or you're always 50-50 and
not sure which one to pick?

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.560
Or maybe you're like I
was, when I first started

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.269
practicing for the SAT Reading

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.563
and maybe you run out of time
on the SAT Reading section?

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.447
Well, that's why we're chatting

00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:22.328
about the Rephrase &amp; Predict strategy.

00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:24.204
So this strategy is one that I found

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.004
that was really helpful for me

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:28.343
and helpful for a number of students

00:03:28.343 --> 00:03:30.855
and so, I'd recommend giving it a try,

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:33.020
it's certainly not the
only way to approach

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.036
SAT Reading questions but it's,

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:38.002
it can be really helpful
once you get the hang of it,

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:41.888
when you are approaching
SAT Reading questions.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.164
So this strategy really focuses

00:03:43.164 --> 00:03:46.603
on coming up with your own
answer to reading questions

00:03:46.603 --> 00:03:49.005
before you look at the answer choices.

00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:52.181
So this is the most important word, before

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.090
and there are really two parts,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.657
so this first part, involves,

00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:59.494
is called the Rephrase portion

00:03:59.494 --> 00:04:01.703
and this part involves
reading the question

00:04:01.703 --> 00:04:03.064
but covering the answer choices

00:04:03.064 --> 00:04:04.083
and this is really important,

00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:06.120
so that you don't distract yourself

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.506
with the answer choices up front

00:04:07.506 --> 00:04:09.878
and then if possible,
rephrase the question

00:04:09.878 --> 00:04:12.389
into a how, what or why question,

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.352
and this can really help
simplify the question

00:04:16.352 --> 00:04:19.497
to put it in your own words
and can just make sure

00:04:19.497 --> 00:04:23.636
that you understand the
question before you move on.

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:26.171
The next step in this
strategy is to predict

00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.646
and so you would start by reviewing

00:04:28.646 --> 00:04:30.555
the relevant parts of the passage,

00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:32.774
so go back and re-read
a little bit before,

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:34.758
a little bit after where you need to

00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:37.619
and then, based on
that, predict the answer

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:39.716
to the question in your own words

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:41.732
and so if the question is asking

00:04:41.732 --> 00:04:45.400
the author's purpose in paragraph two is,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.632
you would actually say, in your own words,

00:04:47.632 --> 00:04:51.215
well I think it was to
introduce amphibians

00:04:56.243 --> 00:04:59.835
as a relevant population
for this biological study,

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:01.458
so you would say something
in your own words

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:03.214
to answer the question.

00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:06.127
Then, and only then, would
you uncover the answer choices

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:08.406
and then start crossing out the choices

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:09.788
that don't match your prediction

00:05:09.788 --> 00:05:12.446
and select the choice that best matches,

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:16.460
and so, instead of a different approach

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.669
of reading the question,
looking at the answer choices

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.317
and then evaluating one by one,

00:05:20.317 --> 00:05:23.643
you come up with your own prediction first

00:05:23.643 --> 00:05:25.221
and then that really can help

00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:27.871
when you do finally look
at the answer choices

00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:29.607
and it can help you hone in on the ones

00:05:29.607 --> 00:05:32.805
that match your prediction and
are supported by the passage

00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:35.735
and eliminate the ones
that might look plausible

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.900
but once you have that
prediction in your mind

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.527
of, oh, well, I think the
answer is this amphibian thing,

00:05:40.527 --> 00:05:42.889
it's easier to do that matching

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.447
and to hone in on the right question.

00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:46.903
So let's take a look
at what this looks like

00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:48.206
for a practice problem now,

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:52.206
just to make it a little
more tangible and real.

00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:56.774
So, step one, if you're
watching from home,

00:05:56.774 --> 00:05:59.944
is to take your hand, right
hand, left hand, whichever one

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:03.203
and cover up answer choices A through D,

00:06:03.203 --> 00:06:05.813
so go ahead and cover
up those answer choices

00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:09.004
and now, we'll do the Rephrase
part of that strategy.

00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:12.509
So, as used in line three,
vent most nearly means,

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:15.632
and so this is a more
straightforward question

00:06:15.632 --> 00:06:18.190
but it is just, essentially,
we could rephrase it

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.023
to what does vent mean

00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:26.236
and now, if I had the passage,

00:06:26.236 --> 00:06:28.054
I would go back to the passage,

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.474
read a little bit around the word vent,

00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:34.257
gather some context clues,
and then say my prediction

00:06:34.257 --> 00:06:36.535
for the second part of the strategy

00:06:36.535 --> 00:06:40.702
was that vent meant gap, and
so I'd write down my prediction

00:06:41.827 --> 00:06:44.627
or just say it in my head,
and then, and only then,

00:06:44.627 --> 00:06:46.165
so you can lift up your hand now,

00:06:46.165 --> 00:06:48.624
would I look at the answer choices,

00:06:48.624 --> 00:06:51.272
and at that point, with gap in mind,

00:06:51.272 --> 00:06:54.132
it's a bit easier to eliminate
some of the answer choices

00:06:54.132 --> 00:06:56.805
that don't match, and narrow
it down to the ones that do.

00:06:56.805 --> 00:07:00.487
So, for example, gap
doesn't fit passage as well,

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:02.795
doesn't fit outlet as
well, and then I'm down

00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:06.125
to opening and crack, and in the real SAT

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.877
I would go into the reading passage,

00:07:07.877 --> 00:07:12.044
gather some context clues and
see what I'm finding there.

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:15.867
So, that's an example of how

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.106
this Rephrase and Predict strategy looks

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:21.551
for a standalone sample problem

00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:24.370
and later in class we're
gonna apply this strategy

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.537
in a real SAT reading
passage with a few questions

00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.142
just so you get used to it.

00:07:31.142 --> 00:07:34.671
But before we do that, I want
to cover Words in Context

00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.233
and Command of Evidence problems,

00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:38.856
which are two common problems

00:07:38.856 --> 00:07:41.773
that you'll see in the SAT Reading.

00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:48.258
So Words in Context questions,
what are these exactly?

00:07:48.258 --> 00:07:50.213
So these problems measure
your understanding

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:54.483
of the meaning and use
of words and phrases

00:07:54.483 --> 00:07:57.147
in the context of passages
and this word, context,

00:07:57.147 --> 00:07:58.633
is the most important part.

00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:02.800
And so these questions don't
ask you to define words,

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:06.887
you might know the meaning
of words in day to day life

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:09.664
like determination, but what
makes these questions unique

00:08:09.664 --> 00:08:11.816
is that the context of
the passage is crucial

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:14.204
and so you wanna look a little bit before

00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:16.141
and after and around the word,

00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:18.324
so that you can gather
the surrounding words,

00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:21.157
ideas and circumstances to pick up

00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:24.180
on how the author is using the word

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.428
in the passage and what it means.

00:08:26.428 --> 00:08:28.248
And so there are two specific types

00:08:28.248 --> 00:08:30.577
of Words in Context
questions and the first one,

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:33.655
is interpreting words
and phrases in context.

00:08:33.655 --> 00:08:38.005
So these questions ask you
what word or phrase means

00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:39.905
as used in the passage,
and so that's very much

00:08:39.905 --> 00:08:43.360
like the sample problem we
did around the word vent

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.502
as used in line three, most nearly means

00:08:45.502 --> 00:08:48.531
and so you're probably
familiar with these.

00:08:48.531 --> 00:08:50.559
The next type asks you

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:54.416
how the author's choice of
words affects the passage

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:57.255
and affects the meaning, tone and style.

00:08:57.255 --> 00:09:00.513
So if this first question type
is more of a what question,

00:09:00.513 --> 00:09:04.680
this second question type is
more of a purpose or impact,

00:09:07.364 --> 00:09:10.106
is one helpful way of thinking about it.

00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:14.616
So we'll take a look at these
Words in Context problems

00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:18.452
later in class but this should
give you a good overview

00:09:18.452 --> 00:09:20.188
of the types of Words in Context questions

00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:24.080
you might see on the SAT
on the Reading section

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.075
and also in the Writing Section,

00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:29.992
so let's keep going now
to Command of Evidence.

00:09:33.297 --> 00:09:36.772
So Command of Evidence
questions are designed

00:09:36.772 --> 00:09:38.977
to see whether you
understand how an author

00:09:38.977 --> 00:09:41.618
uses evidence to support a claim

00:09:41.618 --> 00:09:43.980
or argument or point that they're making

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.746
and this is a skill
that's tested on the SAT

00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:49.314
because it's really crucial in college,

00:09:49.314 --> 00:09:52.193
in the workforce, you
know, once you graduate,

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:55.491
or in day to day life and so it really is

00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:58.457
very applicable to creating arguments,

00:09:58.457 --> 00:10:00.087
defending arguments, evaluating them

00:10:00.087 --> 00:10:03.405
and on the SAT, how will they show up?

00:10:03.405 --> 00:10:06.237
Well, there are three
types of evidence questions

00:10:06.237 --> 00:10:08.750
that you'll see, and so
the first one asks you

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.706
to determine the best type of evidence,

00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:13.858
so it'll ask you what textual evidence

00:10:13.858 --> 00:10:17.040
provides the best support or,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.898
the other type of question
here, will show up in pairs

00:10:20.898 --> 00:10:25.065
where it'll ask you what is
the main point of paragraph one

00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:29.722
and then the second question will ask you

00:10:29.722 --> 00:10:31.358
what evidence best supports

00:10:31.358 --> 00:10:34.191
your answer to the first question.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.477
Now, the second type of question
under the evidence section

00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:44.347
will ask you to interpret data

00:10:44.347 --> 00:10:45.947
in graphics of different kinds

00:10:45.947 --> 00:10:47.841
and it'll ask you to look at the graphic,

00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:50.556
understand it and how it
relates to the passage

00:10:50.556 --> 00:10:53.433
and any claims the author may be making.

00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:55.121
Now, a tip I would have here,

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:57.636
would be to break down
the graph piece by piece,

00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:00.532
so rather than trying to
understand it all at once,

00:11:00.532 --> 00:11:03.115
ask yourself just one
simple question at a time,

00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:06.208
so that you build up your
understanding from the ground up

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.224
and so you could ask what is the title,

00:11:08.224 --> 00:11:09.535
and what is it telling me?

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:11.927
You could ask about the axes next,

00:11:11.927 --> 00:11:14.110
and so the axes and units,

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.944
you might look at the key,

00:11:15.944 --> 00:11:18.635
and all of these questions will
help you build to the point

00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:20.857
where you can state, in your own words,

00:11:20.857 --> 00:11:24.358
this graph is showing me the distribution

00:11:24.358 --> 00:11:26.941
of fir trees around California.

00:11:28.384 --> 00:11:31.596
Now, the third and final
type of evidence question

00:11:31.596 --> 00:11:33.973
asks you how an argument uses

00:11:33.973 --> 00:11:36.459
or doesn't use specific
pieces of evidence,

00:11:36.459 --> 00:11:39.952
so those are things like
facts, figures, quotations,

00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:43.270
and how that influences
the author's claims

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.610
or arguments that they're making.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:50.551
So, there were was a lot of
information to take in up front,

00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:53.980
but let's now apply what
we've discussed so far

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.884
on the Rephrase &amp; Predict strategy,

00:11:55.884 --> 00:11:57.717
Words in Context questions

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.317
and the Command of Evidence questions,

00:11:59.317 --> 00:12:01.336
within a real SAT passage.

00:12:01.336 --> 00:12:02.758
So let's get some practice together

00:12:02.758 --> 00:12:06.925
before you head off to Khan
Academy to practice yourself.

00:12:09.134 --> 00:12:11.818
Oop, let me zoom out a little bit here.

00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:13.401
So, before I start,

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:17.209
before we start going
through this passage,

00:12:17.209 --> 00:12:20.523
I just wanna share that how we
go through the passage today

00:12:20.523 --> 00:12:21.927
might be a little bit different

00:12:21.927 --> 00:12:24.998
from how you would do this if
you were by yourself at home

00:12:24.998 --> 00:12:28.248
and it's just because I'm on a computer

00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:32.461
and so it's harder,
it's just a little hard

00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:34.250
for me to show you all
of the passage at once

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.529
and so, just for today,
as we walk through it,

00:12:36.529 --> 00:12:38.544
we'll go through this a
few paragraphs at a time

00:12:38.544 --> 00:12:40.550
and bounce back and forth
between the questions

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.445
but how you would do this at home,

00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:44.943
might look a little bit different, okay?

00:12:44.943 --> 00:12:47.244
So let's take a look, let's
go ahead and read the passage

00:12:47.244 --> 00:12:50.747
just up to this point
here and then we'll pause.

00:12:50.747 --> 00:12:53.037
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:12:53.037 --> 00:12:55.998
This passage is excerpted
from Kasley Killam,

00:12:55.998 --> 00:12:59.658
A Hug A Day Keeps the Doctor Away, okay.

00:12:59.658 --> 00:13:02.736
Scientific American, okay,
so looks like a study.

00:13:02.736 --> 00:13:06.274
So, during my final semester
of undergrad, I made two signs

00:13:06.274 --> 00:13:09.537
that read, feeling stressed
about exams, have a free hug!

00:13:09.537 --> 00:13:11.732
Then I recruited a friend and we stood

00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:13.582
in the entrance of the campus library,

00:13:13.582 --> 00:13:15.851
held up the signs, and waited.

00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:18.031
Passersby had one of two reactions,

00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:20.523
either they quickly looked
down at their phones

00:13:20.523 --> 00:13:21.716
and awkwardly shuffled by,

00:13:21.716 --> 00:13:24.751
or their faces lit up as they embraced us.

00:13:24.751 --> 00:13:26.786
Most people were enthusiastic.

00:13:26.786 --> 00:13:27.913
Some exclaimed, "You made my day!"

00:13:27.913 --> 00:13:30.266
Or "thank you, I needed this."

00:13:30.266 --> 00:13:33.886
One leapt into my arms,
nearly toppling me over.

00:13:33.886 --> 00:13:35.716
After two hours of warm interactions,

00:13:35.716 --> 00:13:37.037
my friend and I couldn't believe

00:13:37.037 --> 00:13:39.686
how energized and happy we felt.

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:43.391
Okay, so let me go through that again

00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:45.967
and just mark up a few important things,

00:13:45.967 --> 00:13:50.851
so, feeling stressed about
exams, have a free hug,

00:13:50.851 --> 00:13:52.847
and they had warm interactions

00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:53.947
and then, at the end,

00:13:53.947 --> 00:13:56.212
they were feeling pretty
energized and happy,

00:13:56.212 --> 00:14:00.707
so then this seems like
just a story about how,

00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:04.181
at the end of this person's
undergrad career, okay.

00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:05.982
So let's read the next paragraph now.

00:14:05.982 --> 00:14:07.683
A study published earlier this month

00:14:07.683 --> 00:14:09.507
suggests that, in addition to making us

00:14:09.507 --> 00:14:11.590
feel connected to others,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.937
all those hugs may have
prevented us from getting sick,

00:14:15.937 --> 00:14:18.278
okay, so that seems important

00:14:18.278 --> 00:14:20.625
and this is the topic
sentence of the paragraph

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:23.122
so worth paying a little
more attention to.

00:14:23.122 --> 00:14:26.086
At first, this finding probably
seems counterintuitive,

00:14:26.086 --> 00:14:28.229
not to mention bizarre.

00:14:28.229 --> 00:14:29.572
You might think, like I did,

00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:30.953
that hugging hundreds of strangers,

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:33.907
hugging strangers would
increase your exposure to germs

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:37.333
and therefore the likelihood
of falling ill, okay.

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:40.996
But, we've got a but here,
so but words, contrast words

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:44.964
are very important, and often
signal a shift in the passage

00:14:44.964 --> 00:14:47.735
so, but, the new research
out of Carnegie Mellon

00:14:47.735 --> 00:14:50.211
indicates that feeling connected

00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:52.422
especially through physical touch,

00:14:52.422 --> 00:14:55.839
protects us from stress-induced sickness.

00:14:56.755 --> 00:14:59.907
Okay, so this research adds
to a large amount of evidence

00:14:59.907 --> 00:15:02.577
for the positive influence
of social support on health.

00:15:02.577 --> 00:15:06.290
Okay, so just to confirm that
I understand this passage,

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.753
we've got a topic sentence
that said feeling connected

00:15:09.753 --> 00:15:12.413
to others seems to have
these health benefits

00:15:12.413 --> 00:15:14.888
and hugging a lot of people,

00:15:14.888 --> 00:15:17.499
rather than exposing
you to germs, actually,

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:21.066
according to the Carnegie
Mellon study offers

00:15:21.066 --> 00:15:24.502
some protection against
stress-induced sickness, okay.

00:15:24.502 --> 00:15:26.281
Okay, so I think I understand that,

00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:29.083
and what you'll notice, as
I was reading the passage,

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:32.463
was that I was pretty actively writing

00:15:32.463 --> 00:15:36.603
and underlining and making
sure that I understood

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.373
what I was reading as I went

00:15:38.373 --> 00:15:41.368
and so there's an active reading article

00:15:41.368 --> 00:15:42.478
that we have on Khan Academy

00:15:42.478 --> 00:15:44.206
that would be great to check out

00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:46.931
but that's how you can read

00:15:46.931 --> 00:15:48.855
and make sure you
understand along the way,

00:15:48.855 --> 00:15:52.047
to save yourself time,
so you aren't re-reading

00:15:52.047 --> 00:15:53.987
as much as you go along.

00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:55.556
So, we have the passage,

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:57.149
now let's look at the first question.

00:15:57.149 --> 00:16:00.001
So here we're gonna use the
Rephrase &amp; Predict strategy

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.986
that we mentioned, so again,

00:16:01.986 --> 00:16:04.242
take your left hand or your right hand,

00:16:04.242 --> 00:16:05.646
whichever non-dominant hand you have,

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:08.619
and go ahead and cover up A through D

00:16:08.619 --> 00:16:10.762
and now we're gonna look at the questions.

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:13.675
So the first paragraph serves mainly to,

00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:16.110
so we're just looking up until this part,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:20.277
everything above this part,
and if I rephrase this,

00:16:21.206 --> 00:16:25.803
this is just what is the
purpose of the first paragraph.

00:16:25.803 --> 00:16:27.455
Okay, so I don't need to write that down

00:16:27.455 --> 00:16:28.693
since it'll take me some time.

00:16:28.693 --> 00:16:31.264
So what is the purpose
of the first paragraph?

00:16:31.264 --> 00:16:34.081
Well, let's take a look
at the first paragraph

00:16:34.081 --> 00:16:36.685
and probably a little bit of
context from the second as well

00:16:36.685 --> 00:16:39.107
and that will inform my prediction

00:16:39.107 --> 00:16:40.553
for what I think the answer is.

00:16:40.553 --> 00:16:43.964
So, when I was reading
this passage earlier,

00:16:43.964 --> 00:16:46.881
this seemed like the author's story

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.434
about something he did in
undergrad, about making signs

00:16:52.434 --> 00:16:56.601
and mentioned how positive
this hugging experience was

00:16:57.754 --> 00:16:59.646
and then, in the next paragraph,

00:16:59.646 --> 00:17:03.527
we've got the study and the impact of hugs

00:17:03.527 --> 00:17:05.404
and we get a little more scientific here

00:17:05.404 --> 00:17:08.687
and so the first paragraph
serves mainly to,

00:17:08.687 --> 00:17:10.070
or the purpose of the first paragraph,

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.820
my prediction here is going to be

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:18.377
that it was a story and then if we look

00:17:18.377 --> 00:17:22.488
at the structure here,
we have the story here

00:17:22.488 --> 00:17:24.845
and then we have the study here,

00:17:24.845 --> 00:17:26.597
so that's kind of how
I'm thinking about it,

00:17:26.597 --> 00:17:29.419
story that leads into the study

00:17:29.419 --> 00:17:32.393
and so that's my prediction
and, as you can see,

00:17:32.393 --> 00:17:36.664
it doesn't have to be super
sophisticated and complex,

00:17:36.664 --> 00:17:39.577
in fact, if you have a good
understanding of the passage

00:17:39.577 --> 00:17:41.750
the prediction is often pretty simple

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.154
and a few words is all that you need.

00:17:44.154 --> 00:17:47.176
And so now, I can uncover the
answer choices A through D

00:17:47.176 --> 00:17:49.769
and take a look at which
one matches my prediction

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:53.561
of the author used the
first paragraph as a story,

00:17:53.561 --> 00:17:57.391
as a way of introducing and
giving background for the study.

00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:59.680
So, let's take a look at the first one,

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.594
provide background information necessary

00:18:01.594 --> 00:18:04.511
to understand the scientific study,

00:18:06.307 --> 00:18:10.474
so that is not completely
off from what I mentioned

00:18:12.306 --> 00:18:16.473
but not exactly what I said
either, so I'll leave that in

00:18:17.657 --> 00:18:19.482
and then introduce the scientific study

00:18:19.482 --> 00:18:20.660
through a personal anecdote.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.679
Okay, so that's actually
very close to my prediction

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:26.403
since an anecdote is a story

00:18:26.403 --> 00:18:28.438
and I mentioned this introduce piece

00:18:28.438 --> 00:18:31.519
so that seems like the
top candidate so far.

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:32.870
But let's take a look at these other ones,

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.878
so show that not all
scientific experiments

00:18:34.878 --> 00:18:36.825
need to be conducted in a laboratory.

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:40.361
Well, we're not talking, in the passage,

00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:41.949
about all scientific experiments

00:18:41.949 --> 00:18:45.797
and there's no mention of
a laboratory in the passage

00:18:45.797 --> 00:18:47.488
so I can go ahead and cross that one out.

00:18:47.488 --> 00:18:50.074
And then last one, describe
the author's experience

00:18:50.074 --> 00:18:52.648
as the subject of the scientific study.

00:18:52.648 --> 00:18:56.921
So, the first paragraph is more of a story

00:18:56.921 --> 00:18:58.511
and the author actually doesn't mention

00:18:58.511 --> 00:19:00.851
that it was a scientific study,

00:19:00.851 --> 00:19:02.668
it was just more of
something that they did

00:19:02.668 --> 00:19:05.243
in the last semester,
so this scientific study

00:19:05.243 --> 00:19:09.831
will eliminate this, and so
B is really the best choice

00:19:09.831 --> 00:19:12.065
that matches my
prediction, which was based

00:19:12.065 --> 00:19:15.601
on the information that
I had in the passage.

00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:19.018
So that's an example of
how Rephrase &amp; Predict

00:19:19.018 --> 00:19:22.160
is used in practice, it can
take some getting used to

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.319
but once you practice a little bit more,

00:19:24.319 --> 00:19:26.423
you'll get faster and faster at that

00:19:26.423 --> 00:19:28.088
and once you have the prediction,

00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:31.185
going through the answer
choices will be a lot faster.

00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:32.620
Now, the other thing I'll point out

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.649
is that as I was going
through the answer choices,

00:19:34.649 --> 00:19:36.995
you might have seen me cross off

00:19:36.995 --> 00:19:38.518
certain parts of answer choices,

00:19:38.518 --> 00:19:41.178
and that was because the right answer

00:19:41.178 --> 00:19:45.017
will be completely right
and supported by the passage

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.917
and if there is a part of an answer choice

00:19:47.917 --> 00:19:50.647
that feels off or isn't
supported by the passage,

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:53.809
that's enough for me to cross it off

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:55.560
and so that just helps me eliminate

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.995
answer choices a little bit faster

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.661
and is another thing you can try.

00:19:58.661 --> 00:20:00.168
So let's take a look at
some of the other questions

00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:01.668
and keep on going.

00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:05.256
So let's take a look,
in the second paragraph

00:20:05.256 --> 00:20:08.546
the author implies that
the study shows hugs to be,

00:20:08.546 --> 00:20:12.215
so now we're talking about this paragraph,

00:20:12.215 --> 00:20:14.088
second paragraph, here.

00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:18.005
Author implies that the
study shows hugs to be,

00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:22.559
so this is, I can rephrase this to be

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.047
study shows hugs to be,

00:20:29.073 --> 00:20:31.156
hugs to be question mark.

00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:36.047
Okay, and again, I'm not looking
at the answer choices yet

00:20:36.047 --> 00:20:40.214
since that will automatically
influence my thinking

00:20:43.663 --> 00:20:45.872
and I'll start thinking well
maybe it's A, maybe it's D,

00:20:45.872 --> 00:20:49.737
but before I have formed my own opinion,

00:20:49.737 --> 00:20:50.915
I don't wanna do that

00:20:50.915 --> 00:20:53.570
so let's take a look back
at the second paragraph

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.403
and look for the study

00:20:56.821 --> 00:21:00.257
and what the author is
implying about that.

00:21:00.257 --> 00:21:03.326
So, study published
earlier suggests that hugs

00:21:03.326 --> 00:21:06.957
make us feel connected and
prevent us from getting sick,

00:21:06.957 --> 00:21:09.411
and prevent us from getting sick

00:21:09.411 --> 00:21:11.010
and then here's the study, here,

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.844
so new research out of Carnegie Mellon,

00:21:12.844 --> 00:21:14.411
shows that feeling connected,

00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:16.301
especially through physical touch,

00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:19.063
protects us from stress-induced sickness.

00:21:19.063 --> 00:21:22.480
So that is pretty positive, so hugs good,

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:28.745
is kind of the takeaway there

00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:33.398
and so then my prediction
for what the author is saying

00:21:33.398 --> 00:21:35.393
implies that the study shows about hugs,

00:21:35.393 --> 00:21:38.143
is that hugs are good for health,

00:21:41.088 --> 00:21:45.506
good for health and have
these health benefits

00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:48.705
or have these protection,
will help protect us

00:21:48.705 --> 00:21:52.038
from sickness, or protect from sickness.

00:21:56.388 --> 00:21:58.025
And now, with that prediction

00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:01.260
I can go ahead and
uncover the answer choices

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.879
and look through A through
D, so let's take a look.

00:22:03.879 --> 00:22:07.352
A says that hugs are
the only proven method

00:22:07.352 --> 00:22:11.914
of preventing sickness,
so only proven method,

00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:15.414
makes that not correct, cos the study says

00:22:17.122 --> 00:22:18.751
that there's some benefits of hugs

00:22:18.751 --> 00:22:19.988
but certainly doesn't claim

00:22:19.988 --> 00:22:21.484
that it's the only proven method,

00:22:21.484 --> 00:22:25.651
and doesn't match my prediction
either, so let's keep going.

00:22:27.332 --> 00:22:29.521
Less successful than social support

00:22:29.521 --> 00:22:33.546
at protecting people from
colds and other illnesses.

00:22:33.546 --> 00:22:36.129
So in this case, they're making

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:38.697
an interesting comparison here

00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:41.006
about less successful than social support

00:22:41.006 --> 00:22:43.519
and that's really not
something that's mentioned

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:45.577
in the second paragraph, and again,

00:22:45.577 --> 00:22:47.433
doesn't match my prediction
based on the paragraph,

00:22:47.433 --> 00:22:49.493
so this less successful
than social support,

00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:51.863
there's no comparison that's
being made in that paragraph,

00:22:51.863 --> 00:22:54.381
so we can go ahead and cross that out.

00:22:54.381 --> 00:22:56.877
And then we have not
conclusively effective

00:22:56.877 --> 00:22:59.002
at helping people maintain good health.

00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:01.306
So this actually, the tone of this

00:23:01.306 --> 00:23:05.056
is hugs are so-so, we're
not sure about hugs,

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:09.230
but this was, we have hugs good here,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:13.641
we know hugs are good, even
if we didn't read the passage

00:23:13.641 --> 00:23:16.572
so that not conclusively effective

00:23:16.572 --> 00:23:19.002
is the opposite of what the
author's actually implying

00:23:19.002 --> 00:23:22.406
and so D then, one of several ways

00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:24.142
to guard against some illnesses.

00:23:24.142 --> 00:23:26.927
Well, here's that part of my prediction,

00:23:26.927 --> 00:23:30.214
so protect from illness, good for health,

00:23:30.214 --> 00:23:32.964
and so therefore, my answer is D.

00:23:34.336 --> 00:23:38.503
So, this was now an example of
a Command of Evidence problem

00:23:40.595 --> 00:23:42.665
and how the Rephrase &amp; Predict strategy

00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:44.217
can be used in that context.

00:23:44.217 --> 00:23:46.838
But, this is a two-parter,
so we're not done yet.

00:23:46.838 --> 00:23:49.645
Let's head back in and
pinpoint the evidence

00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:52.728
that matches and supports our answer.

00:23:55.718 --> 00:23:57.747
So, which choice provides
the best evidence

00:23:57.747 --> 00:24:00.845
for the answer to the previous question?

00:24:00.845 --> 00:24:02.706
So, in this case, let's take a look,

00:24:02.706 --> 00:24:05.539
we've got, again, so we're looking

00:24:06.835 --> 00:24:08.210
for the best evidence here,

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:12.127
and let's go back and
look at the passage here,

00:24:13.344 --> 00:24:16.482
and again, we're not looking
at the answer choices

00:24:16.482 --> 00:24:18.962
and so, why did I choose D,

00:24:18.962 --> 00:24:21.776
is essentially what the passage is saying

00:24:21.776 --> 00:24:24.516
and what evidence from
the passage supports that

00:24:24.516 --> 00:24:27.695
and so, this is about
the study showing hugs

00:24:27.695 --> 00:24:32.280
and so, you can hone in here
on this hugs good section

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.281
and the study is mentioned here,

00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:36.789
about Carnegie Mellon,

00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:39.535
the Carnegie Mellon study about
physical touch protecting us

00:24:39.535 --> 00:24:42.365
from stress-induced illness,
so that's a great thing,

00:24:42.365 --> 00:24:45.166
and so I think that's really where,

00:24:45.166 --> 00:24:47.527
where I made my decision there

00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:51.660
and so then I can uncover
the answer choices

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.118
and, looks like answer
choice C is that answer.

00:24:55.118 --> 00:24:57.405
And so, just for completion's sake,

00:24:57.405 --> 00:24:58.997
I'll make sure to look through

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.109
some of these other ones
just to walk through,

00:25:01.109 --> 00:25:03.292
but that matches exactly
what I was thinking

00:25:03.292 --> 00:25:07.507
and my prediction about
the Carnegie Mellon study.

00:25:07.507 --> 00:25:10.336
So, line 12 through 14, a study, sickness,

00:25:10.336 --> 00:25:11.476
so a study published earlier

00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:14.905
suggests that in addition
to making us feel connected

00:25:14.905 --> 00:25:16.773
all these hugs may have
prevented us from getting sick,

00:25:16.773 --> 00:25:19.543
so that one feels more like commentary

00:25:19.543 --> 00:25:22.665
and oh, actually forgot
I posted this down here

00:25:22.665 --> 00:25:23.724
so we can look down here too,

00:25:23.724 --> 00:25:26.694
so that one is more of
commentary, so that one's out

00:25:26.694 --> 00:25:29.572
and then 16 to 18, you
might think like I did

00:25:29.572 --> 00:25:30.892
that hugging hundreds of strangers

00:25:30.892 --> 00:25:35.177
would increase your exposure,
that again is more commentary

00:25:35.177 --> 00:25:37.629
and isn't providing evidence and then D

00:25:37.629 --> 00:25:40.745
is 21 to 23, this research adds

00:25:40.745 --> 00:25:43.140
to a large amount of evidence here,

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.807
and again, that is not as strong

00:25:46.657 --> 00:25:49.593
as the evidence presented here

00:25:49.593 --> 00:25:51.356
that we're citing from Carnegie Mellon

00:25:51.356 --> 00:25:54.057
so that one is out as well.

00:25:54.057 --> 00:25:56.935
Okay, so now we've done
some Command of Evidence,

00:25:56.935 --> 00:25:59.720
now let's take a look at a
Words in Context question

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.127
and that'll be the last
practice problem we do together

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:05.460
before we move on to a few other things.

00:26:09.273 --> 00:26:12.131
Let's take a look at
the next paragraph here,

00:26:12.131 --> 00:26:15.464
so it looks like we're looking here now,

00:26:16.617 --> 00:26:20.124
from here to here, so social
support can broadly be defined

00:26:20.124 --> 00:26:22.744
as the perception of
meaningful relationships

00:26:22.744 --> 00:26:26.295
that serve as a psychological
resource during tough times.

00:26:26.295 --> 00:26:29.287
More specifically, this
means emotional support,

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:31.211
such as expressions of compassion,

00:26:31.211 --> 00:26:34.732
and may include access to
information or other assistance.

00:26:34.732 --> 00:26:36.834
The researchers measured social support

00:26:36.834 --> 00:26:38.334
by giving out a questionnaire

00:26:38.334 --> 00:26:42.643
in which participants
rated different statements.

00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:45.842
Then, they conducted interviews
every night for two weeks

00:26:45.842 --> 00:26:48.719
to find out how often
participants experienced conflict

00:26:48.719 --> 00:26:51.315
with others and how
often they received hugs.

00:26:51.315 --> 00:26:53.683
Finally, the researchers
infected participants

00:26:53.683 --> 00:26:57.320
with a common cold virus
and observed what happened.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.648
So that part seems questionable,

00:26:58.648 --> 00:27:02.912
I don't know about the ethics
of doing that last part

00:27:02.912 --> 00:27:07.495
but this paragraph then
is saying social support,

00:27:07.495 --> 00:27:10.725
what that means, and it looks
like it's emotional support

00:27:10.725 --> 00:27:14.338
and expressions of compassion,
information and assistance

00:27:14.338 --> 00:27:16.957
and then this was how they conducted

00:27:16.957 --> 00:27:18.332
the rest of the experiment.

00:27:18.332 --> 00:27:21.939
Okay, so then in line 27,
expressions most nearly means,

00:27:21.939 --> 00:27:25.765
so what does expressions mean,
and so, more specifically,

00:27:25.765 --> 00:27:28.481
this means emotional
support such as expressions

00:27:28.481 --> 00:27:32.746
of compassion and may
include access to information

00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:34.913
or other assistance, okay.

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:38.238
So I've taken into
consideration the context

00:27:38.238 --> 00:27:40.433
and it seems like in this context,

00:27:40.433 --> 00:27:42.034
it's expressions of compassion,

00:27:42.034 --> 00:27:46.201
could also be stated as acts
of compassion or kindness

00:27:47.529 --> 00:27:51.391
and so these are kind of
more physical behaviors

00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:54.381
is gonna be my prediction
so then let's take a look

00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:57.257
at what matches my prediction.

00:27:57.257 --> 00:27:59.709
So, demonstrations, yep, that could be,

00:27:59.709 --> 00:28:02.620
demonstrations are an acts of
kindness, seems pretty close.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.370
Declarations of compassion,
that's more words

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.525
but I've got acts here,

00:28:09.525 --> 00:28:12.423
so I don't think that one fits as well.

00:28:12.423 --> 00:28:14.808
We've got revelations, so that's more,

00:28:14.808 --> 00:28:16.602
that means something like discoveries

00:28:16.602 --> 00:28:20.444
and we're not discovering
kindness here so that's out

00:28:20.444 --> 00:28:24.934
and then looks of compassion,
also doesn't quite fit

00:28:24.934 --> 00:28:26.985
since I am all about acts of compassion

00:28:26.985 --> 00:28:29.678
and so demonstrations of compassion

00:28:29.678 --> 00:28:31.761
really is what fits best.

00:28:32.847 --> 00:28:37.364
So this was the last practice
problem that we'll do together

00:28:37.364 --> 00:28:41.256
and if you wanna re-watch any
of what we've gone through,

00:28:41.256 --> 00:28:42.873
we'll send out the recording again

00:28:42.873 --> 00:28:45.373
but now, it's time to do some,

00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:49.333
I'm gonna answer a few student questions

00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:51.823
and so, if you have any questions,

00:28:51.823 --> 00:28:55.769
go ahead and put them into
the YouTube comments now

00:28:55.769 --> 00:28:57.468
and then I'll answer as many as I can

00:28:57.468 --> 00:29:00.944
before we head over to Khan Academy

00:29:00.944 --> 00:29:02.317
to practice what we've learned.

00:29:02.317 --> 00:29:04.720
So, take a minute to do
that as I get set up here.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.964
Okay, so we've got a few questions

00:29:07.964 --> 00:29:09.822
from students here so let me take a look.

00:29:09.822 --> 00:29:12.280
First question, are there deducted points

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.127
for incorrect answers on the SAT?

00:29:15.127 --> 00:29:17.489
So, answer to that is no,

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:20.077
so there is no guessing penalty on the SAT

00:29:20.077 --> 00:29:22.519
on any of the sections and so that means

00:29:22.519 --> 00:29:26.355
if you're not sure of the right answer

00:29:26.355 --> 00:29:28.130
for a question, you should always guess

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.929
and so that goes for multiple choice,

00:29:30.929 --> 00:29:32.869
for free response in the Math section,

00:29:32.869 --> 00:29:34.076
and so you should always guess

00:29:34.076 --> 00:29:37.273
since there is no guessing penalty.

00:29:37.273 --> 00:29:39.258
Let's see, another question we got

00:29:39.258 --> 00:29:43.653
is are the SAT practice tests
on par with the real tests?

00:29:43.653 --> 00:29:45.969
Like if I score a 1300
on the practice test,

00:29:45.969 --> 00:29:48.601
would I expect to score that on the SAT?

00:29:48.601 --> 00:29:50.867
Well, assuming you're talking
about the practice tests

00:29:50.867 --> 00:29:54.624
on official SAT practice, on Khan Academy,

00:29:54.624 --> 00:29:58.714
those practice tests
are official SAT tests

00:29:58.714 --> 00:30:01.903
released by College Board and
are an accurate reflection

00:30:01.903 --> 00:30:04.123
of what you can expect on the real SAT.

00:30:04.123 --> 00:30:06.546
So if you find yourself
consistently scoring,

00:30:06.546 --> 00:30:09.157
say, in the 1250 to 1300 range,

00:30:09.157 --> 00:30:12.358
that is a pretty good
indication of what you'll get

00:30:12.358 --> 00:30:14.939
and what you might find
on the real test day

00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:17.651
but the only thing I would say is there,

00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:21.178
on the real test day, there
might be a few factors

00:30:21.178 --> 00:30:23.914
that aren't at play during practice tests

00:30:23.914 --> 00:30:25.999
like nerves, or how well you slept,

00:30:25.999 --> 00:30:28.882
or what you ate that day, so
it is a pretty good indication

00:30:28.882 --> 00:30:31.882
but it might not be exactly perfect.

00:30:34.284 --> 00:30:35.938
We got a question about general advice

00:30:35.938 --> 00:30:38.271
on how to manage time, well,

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.628
the resource I'd direct you to there

00:30:42.628 --> 00:30:45.823
is there are a handful of
articles on the Khan Academy

00:30:45.823 --> 00:30:48.056
in our tips and strategies section,

00:30:48.056 --> 00:30:50.810
that have tips for how
you can manage your time

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.299
on Math, Reading and Writing

00:30:53.299 --> 00:30:56.613
and so I'd really give that
a thorough read through

00:30:56.613 --> 00:30:58.548
and it really has everything

00:30:58.548 --> 00:31:00.706
that I would tell you to do anyway

00:31:00.706 --> 00:31:03.167
and I think we'll try and post that link

00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:05.914
in the comments as well

00:31:05.914 --> 00:31:08.668
but there are things like working through

00:31:08.668 --> 00:31:11.081
some of the simpler problems first,

00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:13.816
since all SAT questions are
worth the same number of points,

00:31:13.816 --> 00:31:16.605
going through the easier
and medium questions

00:31:16.605 --> 00:31:19.102
so that you have ample time for those

00:31:19.102 --> 00:31:20.766
before you go to the harder questions,

00:31:20.766 --> 00:31:24.364
is one way you can do it but
really check out those articles

00:31:24.364 --> 00:31:27.346
for the best advice that we have on that.

00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:29.309
We had a question, if your prediction

00:31:29.309 --> 00:31:32.672
doesn't match the answers, does
that mean you read it wrong?

00:31:32.672 --> 00:31:35.813
So that's a great question,
so say you had a prediction

00:31:35.813 --> 00:31:38.146
that the word vent meant gap

00:31:38.983 --> 00:31:42.289
and then it didn't match
anything in the answer choices,

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:44.643
what I would encourage you to do then,

00:31:44.643 --> 00:31:46.670
is yes, to go back into the passage

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.643
and make sure you've considered

00:31:48.643 --> 00:31:51.101
all of the context around the passage

00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:55.359
and make sure you understand
that paragraph well enough

00:31:55.359 --> 00:31:58.385
that you can restate
what the author is saying

00:31:58.385 --> 00:32:01.626
and what the purpose of that
paragraph is in your own words

00:32:01.626 --> 00:32:03.523
and if you can state it in your own words,

00:32:03.523 --> 00:32:05.860
that is really a good check

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.220
to see if you understood
the author's point

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.557
and the argument or statement
that they were making

00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:15.982
and so if your prediction doesn't match,

00:32:15.982 --> 00:32:18.444
in that case yeah, I would
go back to the passage

00:32:18.444 --> 00:32:20.759
and make sure you understood
what the author was saying

00:32:20.759 --> 00:32:23.294
and then give that prediction another go.

00:32:23.294 --> 00:32:26.277
Another way you could
approach it is to just look

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:28.524
at what the passage says
and the evidence there.

00:32:28.524 --> 00:32:31.301
So the right answer in
SAT Reading questions

00:32:31.301 --> 00:32:33.997
will have textual evidence to support it

00:32:33.997 --> 00:32:37.906
and so you can work backwards a little bit

00:32:37.906 --> 00:32:41.491
to look at the passage and
see, okay, what evidence

00:32:41.491 --> 00:32:45.574
do I have to support one
of these answer choices?

00:32:46.624 --> 00:32:48.672
Another question, should
I read the passage first

00:32:48.672 --> 00:32:50.183
or read the questions first?

00:32:50.183 --> 00:32:53.706
So that one, there are a lot
of different opinions on this

00:32:53.706 --> 00:32:57.096
and I would say, it really comes down

00:32:57.096 --> 00:33:00.205
to how you've practiced and
what you've found works well.

00:33:00.205 --> 00:33:03.086
So some people will read
through and scan the questions

00:33:03.086 --> 00:33:05.186
just so that they can
mark out in the passage

00:33:05.186 --> 00:33:07.737
okay, I've got a question at line seven,

00:33:07.737 --> 00:33:10.044
a question at line 53, and then I need

00:33:10.044 --> 00:33:12.257
to notice a shift in tone somewhere

00:33:12.257 --> 00:33:15.870
and so that, for some
students, they like to look

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:18.291
at what they're gonna be
asked so that they know

00:33:18.291 --> 00:33:20.314
where to pay more attention
to in the passage.

00:33:20.314 --> 00:33:22.868
Other students, they wanna just focus,

00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:24.362
for other students a different approach

00:33:24.362 --> 00:33:26.799
of reading the whole
passage, really understanding

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:29.473
and understanding each paragraph

00:33:29.473 --> 00:33:31.080
and the author's argument and claims

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.857
and then looking at the
questions is easier,

00:33:33.857 --> 00:33:35.976
so that they're just
focusing on understanding

00:33:35.976 --> 00:33:38.414
and then going into the questions.

00:33:38.414 --> 00:33:40.890
So I would really say practice, try both,

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.970
see which one works best
for you and go with that.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:47.169
I just wouldn't, if you're
close to your test date,

00:33:47.169 --> 00:33:49.793
don't change things up at the last minute.

00:33:49.793 --> 00:33:51.771
Okay, so we have another good question,

00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:53.335
if you're forced to skip
a question or guess,

00:33:53.335 --> 00:33:56.535
and have enough time to go
back, should you go back to it

00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:58.434
at the end of the passage problem set

00:33:58.434 --> 00:34:00.459
or at the end of the reading portion?

00:34:00.459 --> 00:34:02.345
So I would definitely say

00:34:02.345 --> 00:34:04.730
at the end of the passage problem set,

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:06.577
so say you have questions one through 11

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:10.028
on a reading passage
and you skip number nine

00:34:10.028 --> 00:34:11.235
cos you're like oh, I don't know,

00:34:11.235 --> 00:34:14.117
it could be either of these,
once you get to question 11,

00:34:14.117 --> 00:34:16.001
and you've finished all the
questions on that passage,

00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:18.472
revisit question nine at that point

00:34:18.472 --> 00:34:20.336
because it'll be easier for your brain

00:34:20.336 --> 00:34:22.333
to stay within the mode of that passage

00:34:22.333 --> 00:34:24.909
whereas if you wait til
the end of the passage,

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:27.543
you then have to remind yourself, okay,

00:34:27.543 --> 00:34:28.899
what was this passage about?

00:34:28.899 --> 00:34:30.237
And what was question nine asking?

00:34:30.237 --> 00:34:33.592
So it'll just take you longer to do that.

00:34:33.592 --> 00:34:35.380
So, we're coming up a
little bit on time now

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:39.379
and so, unfortunately all the
questions I can cover for now

00:34:39.379 --> 00:34:41.681
but I'll cover more questions next time

00:34:41.681 --> 00:34:45.387
and for now, I wanna
show you a few pointers

00:34:45.387 --> 00:34:48.760
about practicing for
the SAT on Khan Academy,

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.489
the badge, one-on-one chat,
and all of that good stuff,

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.763
so let's take a look.

00:34:53.763 --> 00:34:57.603
So, like I mentioned at the beginning,

00:34:57.603 --> 00:35:00.436
we have people waiting to help you

00:35:02.024 --> 00:35:05.969
if you run into any questions
and chat with you one-on-one

00:35:05.969 --> 00:35:08.596
but a common question we
get, is what if I don't see

00:35:08.596 --> 00:35:10.371
the one-on-one chat box on Khan Academy?

00:35:10.371 --> 00:35:11.774
Well, one thing I want to point out

00:35:11.774 --> 00:35:14.136
is that the one-on-one
chat is only available

00:35:14.136 --> 00:35:17.012
on the SAT part, so make
sure your web address

00:35:17.012 --> 00:35:21.179
looks something like
KhanAcademy.org/mission/SAT

00:35:22.473 --> 00:35:26.380
and if you're not on a
URL that looks like that

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:31.380
then that's why the one-on-one
chat is not showing up.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.136
The other thing you can try

00:35:33.136 --> 00:35:36.298
is to try and refresh the page as well.

00:35:36.298 --> 00:35:39.136
Now, when you head over to Khan Academy,

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:40.923
the first thing I'd recommend you do

00:35:40.923 --> 00:35:45.854
is to explore a bit and then
do some practice problems.

00:35:45.854 --> 00:35:47.929
So while we have those wonderful folks

00:35:47.929 --> 00:35:50.650
who are volunteering their time to help,

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:54.116
the best thing you can do is start

00:35:54.116 --> 00:35:55.702
by doing some practice problems yourself

00:35:55.702 --> 00:35:59.258
and then if you get stuck, reach out.

00:35:59.258 --> 00:36:02.365
In just a bit we're also
going to share the badge link

00:36:02.365 --> 00:36:03.758
and so that'll show up in the comments

00:36:03.758 --> 00:36:06.923
and for that you will sign
into your Khan Academy account

00:36:06.923 --> 00:36:09.361
and then your badge will show
up in the top right corner,

00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:11.337
oh, this is no longer right,

00:36:11.337 --> 00:36:14.833
but there will be a notification
icon that you'll see there

00:36:14.833 --> 00:36:16.410
and so we'll post the badge there

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.522
and so now, if you're familiar
with official SAT practice

00:36:20.522 --> 00:36:23.579
on Khan Academy, go ahead
and head over there now

00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:25.274
and sign into your Khan Academy account,

00:36:25.274 --> 00:36:28.524
start practicing, and if you get stuck,

00:36:29.469 --> 00:36:31.636
reach out to one of our amazing people

00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:33.940
who are here to help you today.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.491
If you're brand new to
official SAT practice,

00:36:36.491 --> 00:36:38.370
I'm gonna do a quick walkthrough

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:42.137
of some of the key parts
just to get you started.

00:36:42.137 --> 00:36:46.445
So, this is official SAT
practice on Khan Academy

00:36:46.445 --> 00:36:48.384
and so you'll see this is the homepage,

00:36:48.384 --> 00:36:50.579
and if I wanted to practice,
I'd just head over here

00:36:50.579 --> 00:36:53.543
and click practice and
you'll see that I have Math,

00:36:53.543 --> 00:36:57.210
Reading &amp; Writing and
Essay portions as well

00:36:58.798 --> 00:37:01.991
and for today, you'll
see that you can practice

00:37:01.991 --> 00:37:05.204
any reading topic here, or if you wanted

00:37:05.204 --> 00:37:06.866
to go to Writing &amp; Language,

00:37:06.866 --> 00:37:09.311
you can practice anything here as well.

00:37:09.311 --> 00:37:11.460
Now, if you want a refresher

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.256
on a topic that you don't see here,

00:37:13.256 --> 00:37:16.261
I'd really recommend you go
up here to the search bar

00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:20.428
and type up a search, for say
quadratic equations, right?

00:37:21.275 --> 00:37:22.712
So that's one thing you can do

00:37:22.712 --> 00:37:25.513
and then if you have general
questions about the SAT,

00:37:25.513 --> 00:37:27.754
the format, strategies you can use,

00:37:27.754 --> 00:37:30.335
so time management, for example,

00:37:30.335 --> 00:37:33.789
these are two great articles
that I mentioned before,

00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:36.596
I would head here to go through

00:37:36.596 --> 00:37:40.174
and get answers to those questions.

00:37:40.174 --> 00:37:41.806
Let's take a look,

00:37:41.806 --> 00:37:44.680
and I think that's most of
what I was going to cover,

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.541
so go ahead and head over, and then,

00:37:46.541 --> 00:37:47.662
oh, the last thing I'll call out,

00:37:47.662 --> 00:37:49.873
is this is where you'll see that chat box

00:37:49.873 --> 00:37:51.201
and so you can just type in here,

00:37:51.201 --> 00:37:56.063
ask a question, and we'll
get back to you as soon as,

00:37:56.063 --> 00:37:58.302
reply as quickly as we can.

00:37:58.302 --> 00:38:02.596
So, that's all I have
for you today on YouTube

00:38:02.596 --> 00:38:06.000
and so now it's time to
head over to Khan Academy,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.928
practice what you've
learned, if you get stuck

00:38:08.928 --> 00:38:11.388
or have any questions, we're here to help.

00:38:11.388 --> 00:38:15.258
For now, that's all we have for today

00:38:15.258 --> 00:38:19.425
but I hope to see you next
Thursday at 7pm Eastern,

00:38:21.709 --> 00:38:25.233
4pm Pacific, for our last and
final class on SAT Writing.

00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:28.106
Thanks so much, and I
hope to see you next time.
