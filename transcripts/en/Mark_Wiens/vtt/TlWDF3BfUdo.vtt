00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.690
- Hey, everyone, hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.840
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.780
This is a city I have wanted
to visit my entire life.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.500
I still can hardly believe that I'm here.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.110
I'm thrilled and locally,
they actually say,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.050
Hio de Janeiro, which is the
real way to say the name.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.620
Today, we are gonna go on an ultimate

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.630
Brazilian street food tour of Rio.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.210
We are gonna eat some incredible food.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.010
We're gonna go to some of
the most famous attractions,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.020
see some of the iconic sites of Rio.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.560
It's gonna be an incredible,
unbelievable day.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.450
And I'm gonna share all the
food, all the attractions,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.273
everything with you in this video.

00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:41.634
(upbeat music)

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.750
- How you doin' here?

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:52.805
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.538
- We called, good morning,

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:01.317
Champion's breakfast again.

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:03.092
- [Mark] (laughing) Champion's breakfast.

00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:04.956
(laughing)

00:01:04.956 --> 00:01:07.520
- [Guilherme] Oh, we
have like a, a champion,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.600
- Thank you, thank you.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.481
- [Guilherme] Well, we
call him as Mineiro.

00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:11.314
- [Mark] Mineiro.

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:12.850
- [Guilherme] Mineiro, it's
like when someone's born in the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.683
Minas Gerais state.

00:01:13.683 --> 00:01:15.519
- So he's from Minas
Gerais state which is the,

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:16.352
- He's from Minas Gerais.

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:17.890
- The state next to Rio de Janeiro.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.723
- Exactly.

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:23.030
- Actually, he has a bicycle
cart with an amazing, double,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.860
oh yes, he brought his chili sauce.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.312
- [Guilherme] He brought
his chili sauce for us.

00:01:27.312 --> 00:01:28.892
- [Mark] Muito obrigado.

00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:29.930
(laughing)

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.700
- But his double, his like bunk
bed grill design is amazing.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.980
The double layers, he has them grilling

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.130
on the charcoal on the bottom.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.110
And then on the top,
they're just kinda smoking

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.090
so they get the smoke, so they get like

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.520
slightly cooked until he
moves them to the next level.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.100
That's a fresh batch.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.527
- Yeah!

00:01:48.527 --> 00:01:50.020
(laughing)

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.060
- [Mark] It's so cool.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.630
He sets up in the morning,
starting at about 7:00 AM,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.018
like on the edge of
Copacabana, just corner,

00:01:56.018 --> 00:01:58.570
it's like an intersection
where's there's like

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.600
three or four roads coming together.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.350
You can smell the smoke just
like protruding off the grill,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.470
like rising into the hills,
and it smells incredible.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.780
His sausage, he makes
this sausage sandwich,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.383
grabs a loaf of bread, adds in a duo,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.250
a twin of sausage to the bun.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.410
He squeezes in some of his homemade sauces

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.510
which he keeps on ice so
they're fresh all day long.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.390
Then adds in some cheese, a
double sprinkle of cheese,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.850
finally followed by salad, this is what

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.290
you wanna be eating for
breakfast in Rio de Janeiro.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.537
- Yes, (laughing) oh yeah.

00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:38.454
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:41.891
- [Mark] Double.

00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:49.785
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.473
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:01.723
(laughing)

00:03:02.727 --> 00:03:06.040
- Muito obrigado, and what's
so cool is that it's like

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.050
he's on the street food
corner, and he's like

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.870
part of the community,
everybody knows him.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.510
Like, everybody that
goes from all directions,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.790
they just yell, Mineiro,
what a sausage specialist.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.470
- I like this aroma here, the perfume.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.070
- [Mark] You want that
to soak into your clothes

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.020
for the rest of the day.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.036
- I want the Mineiro's perfume.

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:22.869
- [Mark] Yes.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.120
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.114
- [Mark] Mineiro's perfume.

00:03:26.114 --> 00:03:30.663
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:31.502
- [Guilherme] Okay.

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:32.702
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:32.702 --> 00:03:33.869
- [Mark] Okay.

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.960
- Cool. (laughing)

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.270
Beautiful.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.440
- [Mark] We're ready to go, man, let's go.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.653
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.033
- Oh, wow.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.220
Oh, as you keep on chewing,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.640
the garlicky-ness of the sauce,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.350
the garlicky-ness of the sausage.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.570
- We got addicted.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.550
- That is like,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.383
- That is addicting.

00:03:57.383 --> 00:03:59.820
- That is like immediate addiction.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.700
And another thing you
can tell is how he just

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.120
slow grills the sausages
so they have this like

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.120
really smoky but also this
like grilled caramelized

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.810
fatty layer skin around the sausage

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.901
that's just like, that just
snaps as you bite into it.

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:17.510
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.578
- The atmosphere here, the
friendliness of Mineiro.

00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:24.053
That salty sausage with
that sauce and those chilis,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.580
that is truly an outstanding breakfast.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.770
We gotta move in for a
little more chili and oil.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.120
This takes it to a
whole new level as well.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.953
Oh yes, that is gonna be a bite.

00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:35.870
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:44.652
- Oh, man, there's literally nothing else

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.869
you would wanna have for
breakfast when you're

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:50.913
in Rio de Janeiro, when you are here.

00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:53.794
The sausage smells amazing.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.160
- With the chili.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.440
- On my last bite, I got a little bit

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.660
of the sauce on my shoe.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.093
I think I'm just gonna keep
it there for a souvenir.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.591
- Would like it one more.

00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:15.424
(laughing)

00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:17.174
- Obrigado, obrigado.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.674
- [Guilherme] Oh, yeah.

00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:21.340
(laughing)

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.370
- It's a double-decker.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.250
- This is one of those
snacks, one of those sausages

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.233
that's too good to stop at one.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.460
- That like Minas Gerais
herb sauce that he makes

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.090
goes so well with that sausage,

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.690
with that bun, with that
lettuce, with those chilis.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.713
I think I got a little paper on that bite.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.193
- Obrigado.

00:05:48.193 --> 00:05:49.504
- Muito obrigado.

00:05:49.504 --> 00:05:50.337
- Muito bueno, muito bueno.

00:05:50.337 --> 00:05:51.180
- Muito bueno.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.360
- Ciao.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.410
- Man, what a man of the community,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.020
what a special man,
what a man representing

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.110
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, oh man, that was

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.340
a superb way to start the day.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.430
We are now heading to what is

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.020
easily is one of the most iconic,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.720
one of the most unbelievable,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.163
one of the representing sites of the city.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.330
Can you see it, right up there?

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.762
That's where we're heading next.

00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:26.345
(upbeat music)

00:06:30.302 --> 00:06:34.150
One of the things that's so
incredible about just driving,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.850
even being in Rio de Janeiro is the,

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.750
the hills, the nature, the jungle.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.690
It's like a city like
literally that could be

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.853
overtaken by jungle, the
hanging vines, the green cliffs.

00:06:44.853 --> 00:06:49.100
It's a spectacular, spectacular landscape.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.880
The beaches, which we'll
be seeing later today.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.803
But the city is just
unbelievably gorgeous.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.160
This is the Trem do Corcovado.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.650
And Corcovado is like a
hump, like a camel's hump

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.720
because the rock, the cliff, the mountain,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.100
that Christ the Redeemer is
built upon looks like a hump.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.370
So I actually pre-booked
tickets online at 65 Reais

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.020
per person, we got our
tickets now here at the booth.

00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:21.840
The cable cars, is it a,
it's like a cable car,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.033
well kind of a tram,
yeah, it's more of a tram.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.773
Oh, we get the next empty car.

00:07:25.773 --> 00:07:27.040
- You will get the better view, it's okay?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.968
- Okay, cool.

00:07:27.968 --> 00:07:28.801
It's gonna be a 20-minute ride,

00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:33.150
and we are literally just
going up right there.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.420
We're going straight up
the side of the mountain.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.180
Oh, man, we're going into the mist,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.093
into the clouds, it's gorgeous.

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:47.260
Just to think that we're
in the middle of the city,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.090
in the middle of Rio de
Janeiro, the massive city.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.117
And this urban rainforest, thick jungle,

00:07:53.117 --> 00:07:57.063
on steep, up the camel's
back, up the camel hump.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.873
We're,

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.643
we're even starting to get into

00:08:02.643 --> 00:08:03.973
some of the clouds now.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.240
(upbeat music)

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.250
The tram went up 700 meters onto the,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.840
the rock, onto the hump.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.303
And now, some flights of
steps to get to the Christ.

00:08:25.297 --> 00:08:28.490
I think we just ran up those stairs.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.053
That is a beautiful morning workout.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.593
Wow, oh man,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.213
wow, that's my first time to gaze up.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.083
That's surreal, man.

00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:51.540
And then get to the end of the walk way

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.040
and just that view over Rio.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.040
You can see the beaches,
the unbelievable landscape.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.530
Some of the city is
still covered in clouds.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.917
We're above the clouds on
this massive pillar of rock.

00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:07.463
You can't even, I can't even describe it.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.440
Just to say a few words,
like I've wanted to visit

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.870
Rio de Janeiro, I wanted to visit Brazil

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.960
since I learned about it
way back when I was a kid.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.610
And this was one of the landmarks,

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.620
one of the icons that I had seen.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.910
I said, "I have to go there in my life."

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.610
And so to be here, this is a
hugely special moment for me.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.610
It's way more spectacular
in person than in photos.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.820
And just looking over the city,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.030
Jesus Christ is 30 meters high,

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.580
made from a combination
of sandstone and concrete,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.680
sitting on a massive pedestal on top

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.680
of a 700-meter just like
literal pillar of stone

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.110
that just comes into the
sky, blanketed in jungle,

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.906
overlooking the bays,
overlooking Rio de Janeiro.

00:10:01.906 --> 00:10:05.840
It's like a speechless site to see.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.400
And it is one of the new
seven wonders of the world.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.760
Okay, final quick view,
but we gotta move on.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.610
We have a lot more
Brazilian food to eat today.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.920
But it is, it's beyond words.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.520
From here, we're gonna
visit the Selaron Steps,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.420
which is another icon of Rio de Janeiro.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.580
Colorful ceramic tiles
going up a staircase.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.370
It's a place I've wanted to visit as well.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.220
We're on our way there now very soon.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.550
I think Guilherme just jumped

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.150
out of the car to go buy coffee.

00:10:33.993 --> 00:10:38.011
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:41.928
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.083
- Thank you.

00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:46.500
- You're welcome.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.120
- That is much better, now
we're really on our way.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.953
Good stuff, man.

00:10:51.953 --> 00:10:53.975
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:10:53.975 --> 00:10:54.944
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:10:54.944 --> 00:10:59.620
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.210
- Love it, oh that's good coffee.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.350
One thing, as we're driving,
I really wanna ask you is

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.580
how do you explain the word valeu?

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.540
- Valeu could be many ways like right on,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.310
thank you, no problem,
how are you, I'm fine.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.260
- Guilherme was explaining to us,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.380
if you give a thumbs up and say, "valeu,"

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.290
like you're good to go.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.668
- That means like thank you, no problem.

00:11:20.668 --> 00:11:21.501
- Like you'll get smiles.

00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:22.461
- Excuse me.

00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:25.150
- You'll get smiles, you'll
immediately have a connection.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.750
That's like one word that you

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.960
have to know when you're in Rio.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.103
- By the way, it's like a slang from Rio.

00:11:34.533 --> 00:11:37.450
(fast-paced music)

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.800
- Yeah, here, I bought this one at

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.830
LAX Airport in Los Angeles.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.953
This one at Honolulu.

00:11:45.953 --> 00:11:47.313
- Hawaii, yes.

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:50.247
- This one's from Hollywood
and one from Hawaii.

00:11:50.247 --> 00:11:51.530
- You gave them to him 12 years ago?

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.363
- 12 years ago.

00:11:52.363 --> 00:11:54.187
- So you met the artist,
you knew the artist.

00:11:54.187 --> 00:11:55.270
That's just awesome.
- Since 2005.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.850
- This is one of the most
iconic, one of the most colorful,

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.920
one of the most beautiful
staircases in the world,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.620
featured in so many videos and
depictions of Rio de Janeiro.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.420
And just the colorful tiles,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.020
the yellow tiles, the blue tiles, the red,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.700
red was the artist's favorite color.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.190
The artist, Selaron, he
was Chilean, from Chile.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.020
But he loved Rio de Janeiro,
he loved this community.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.450
He started building these steps.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.600
Just 20 years ago, the steps were empty.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.573
But he turned it into this
just gorgeous, gorgeous space.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.080
Snoop Dogg's favorite tile?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.820
- Snoop Dogg's favorite tile, Alcatraz.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.670
- It's so bright, so
vibrant, so colorful, so like

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:45.670
such a, uh, like rejuvenating,
happy staircase steps.

00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:57.340
So we are at Café Rex, or
locally, it's called "Café Hex,"

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.130
cause R is normally almost
pronounced like an H.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.450
But this place is known
for all sorts of food,

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.990
especially for their frango assado,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.640
which is roasted chicken
which just roast over charcoal

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.030
on a continuous rotation rotisserie spit.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.640
This is an amazing open-air
environment they have,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.680
kind of a bar counter seating.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.210
You can sit right at the bar
and they have some tables

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.473
along the sidewalk on the outside.

00:13:25.565 --> 00:13:27.290
What's amazing about this place is that

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.340
they still use charcoal over fire.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.540
That makes all the difference,
they're pretty high,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.230
like a foot above the charcoal,
so it's this very slow

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.360
rotisserie roast over the charcoal.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.390
And you can just hear the hissing away

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.260
as the juices, as the fat drips down

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.603
from those rotating
chickens, wooh that's hot.

00:13:46.804 --> 00:13:49.111
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:51.640
- I was just asking
what's in these coconuts.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.730
And without like, I just
wanted to know what's in them.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.240
Immediately, he grabs one of them,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.590
opens the cork and then
just starts pouring.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.280
It's cachaca, which is the famous

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.830
Brazilian cane sugar liquor.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.643
So I'm just gonna have a
very small sip just to taste.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:14.267
Wow, that's actually like,
it's really, it's sweet.

00:14:14.267 --> 00:14:16.220
You really taste the coconut.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.290
So what he does when
you order the chicken,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.730
he takes it off the rotisserie,

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.450
and then he gives it like a final scorch.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.630
So he puts it into a metal grill.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.510
He puts it like right above the charcoal

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.260
to give it that final smoky, crispy edge.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.790
And he chops it up, and he does
an amazing job at plating it

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.900
He's done it many, many
times so it's just like,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.439
the drumsticks are on either end.

00:14:47.439 --> 00:14:50.033
It's like repositioning a chicken.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.980
So we decided to have a bit of
a meat feast for lunch today.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:58.820
Oh, whoa, there's so much meat.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.730
This is a whole plate of oxtail.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.360
We got an entire chicken, some sausage,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.350
and he just brought out an
entire piece of juicy beef.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.550
That's like meat as
far as the eye can see.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.143
- What a meal.
- So much meat.

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:11.950
- Obrigado.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.070
- Rex is the place to be.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.590
- Rex is the place to be.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.750
Gotta start with that
chicken and just that skin,

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.840
it literally, because he
gave it that final roast,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.050
that skin is just so perfectly
golden, so perfectly crispy.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.680
Like it doesn't even get that
good when you deep fry it.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.773
That's like only the work of fire.

00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:35.062
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:37.253 --> 00:15:41.210
- That's chicken, oh, wow,
the skin is so crispy,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:45.033
and the meat inside is so
tender and so oily perfect.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280
- Let me assist you.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.830
- Some lime, an impressive
bottle of chili sauce,

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.930
which Brazil, they just like absolutely

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.490
understand the importance of chili sauce

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.483
in any meal, in every meal that you eat.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.363
Drizzle the chili oil,
and I pick this guy up.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.830
That is a sausage, man, it's almost like

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.513
what we had earlier this
morning, but it's fatter.

00:16:34.872 --> 00:16:37.810
Cause every bite, the
entire sausage is like

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.057
juices in your mouth, that
skin just kinda snaps.

00:16:41.057 --> 00:16:43.670
It's a beautiful sensation, meatiness.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.650
He's opening it up.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.060
- The boss is opening it up,

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.410
- Taking the screw out
for real chilis in there.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.243
- I like, look,

00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:51.990
- Nice, what an amazing man, he dumped out

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.903
some of those chilis with
that oil, the actual chilis.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.110
I'm gonna break up my bite
here with some of the farofa,

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:03.110
which is, it's all over Brazil,
it's cassava powder starch,

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.644
like a part of a staple
that you can eat with meat,

00:17:06.644 --> 00:17:08.811
you can eat with anything.

00:17:10.893 --> 00:17:12.380
It's really good because it's kinda,

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.890
it's heavy but it's
light at the same time,

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.840
and it has this kinda crispiness to it.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.080
So rich and then it has
that smoky, like bubbly

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.710
texture from being roasted over the fire.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.920
That's like eating a
whole block of cheese.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.620
With that chili, it's really nice.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.280
Now we gotta move on to the oxtail.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.239
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:41.239 --> 00:17:43.513
- One of the best in Rio.

00:17:55.614 --> 00:17:58.760
- This whole oxtail is so tender.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.720
Like butter, huh.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.880
You're gonna wanna lick
everything, it's tasty.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.743
Just add a little chili oil to that.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:17.400
It's just like ultra tender
melting in your mouth.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.933
That's stunning, follow that
with some of the vegetable.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.880
I believe that's watercress.

00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:29.630
It has that crispness to
it, has that green flavor.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.630
I love it, that breaks the
richness of the oxtail.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.650
And it's also served with some
potato on the side as well.

00:18:46.328 --> 00:18:49.411
And then finally the steak, the meat.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.770
Oh, wow, it almost tastes dry aged.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.220
It has like almost that complexity, cheesy

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.950
flavorful, real quality meat.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.233
Add a little chili, chili to this.

00:19:09.377 --> 00:19:11.606
That meat is tender, really flavorful.

00:19:11.606 --> 00:19:13.590
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.943
- Valeu, man, these guys are so cool.

00:19:17.229 --> 00:19:18.390
Muito obrigado.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.820
Man, he saw that we, I mean
the food was outstanding,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.800
but he saw we love the chili sauce.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.330
He gave us this entire bottle.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.120
Oh man, that is, that's from the heart.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.060
That is awesome, one of
the coolest souvenirs ever.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.370
And like this is like the type of bottle

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.110
that you'd wanna eat,
but I'd want this to like

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.970
sit next to my computer at my
office while I edit videos.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.213
This is a trophy.

00:19:42.838 --> 00:19:44.680
Muito obrigado, man, muito obrigado.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.980
From here, we are going to Ipanema

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.020
and Copacabana Beaches, two of the most

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.597
famous beaches in Rio,
probably in the world.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.550
We made it to world-famous Ipanema beach.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.510
This is just down the
beach from Copacabana,

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.330
which is we're gonna go afterwards.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.180
But the beach, it's such a long sandbake.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.570
It's so sunny, it's so iconic.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.430
This is also known as a very
high-end neighborhood of Rio.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.920
And so there's a lot of trendy shops.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.000
There's a lot of condos,
very high-end condos.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.493
The beach, the beach is beautiful.

00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:34.340
And we're meeting your
friend on the beach.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.210
What does he serve?

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.210
- He serve kinda like iced tea.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:38.043
- Awesome.

00:20:38.043 --> 00:20:40.510
- And in one keg it's just iced tea.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.660
The other ones, kinda like
lime juice, lemon juice.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.493
- Awesome.

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:45.326
- And you can mix.

00:20:45.326 --> 00:20:46.159
- And he just walks the beach.

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:48.773
- He walks, there he is
right there, Marcelo.

00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:53.383
- Marcelo.

00:20:53.383 --> 00:20:54.500
- He takes credit cards.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.672
- Ha ha, he takes credit cards.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.440
- Credit card and debit card.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.357
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:16.447 --> 00:21:20.364
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:21.328 --> 00:21:22.245
- Obrigado.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.730
This is iconic Rio drink,

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.222
half tea, half lemonade,
I love his set up.

00:21:29.222 --> 00:21:31.060
He takes credit card in the middle.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.220
What an awesome guy, he just like walks

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.350
up and down the beach,
there's nothing like

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.673
a refreshing beverage.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.760
Oh yeah, wow, very good, muito bueno.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.480
That's so like refreshing, it is cold.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.700
You taste the tea, you
taste the lemon freshness.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.213
It's sweet, this is a beach beverage.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.630
The beach is stunning,
the sand is stunning,

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.630
the water is clear and
blue, the sand bank is huge.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.310
And just that view of the mountains,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.270
of the clouds, of the green
jungle in the background,

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.290
it's spectacular, like
the beach is stunning.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.453
The, Rio is stunning.

00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:26.380
(speaking in foreign language)

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.015
- So this is also something
you have to eat on the beach.

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:29.848
- You have to eat it.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.453
- It's iconic Rio, a beach snack.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.135
Globo, it's called Globo, right?

00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:35.080
- Globo, yeah.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.297
- Globo, and it's a cassava, tapioca,

00:22:37.297 --> 00:22:38.130
- Starch.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.700
- Starch, crunch, kinda like puffs.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.040
Yeah, you can feel they're like puffs.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.700
They're almost like onion ring puffs.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.533
- Cheers.

00:22:48.468 --> 00:22:51.380
- I like, but I like.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.020
- Oh yeah, you can taste the, the cassava,

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.390
kind of has that sour taste to it.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.340
It's very, very airy, it's
like one of those things

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.570
where you bite down, and
once it hits your saliva,

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.170
it just kinda like collapses and like

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.610
turns to nothing in your mouth.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.423
- That is good to eat with,
while you're having the tea.

00:23:09.043 --> 00:23:11.543
- Those are kind of addictive.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.313
Let's see if I can fit a
whole one these in my mouth.

00:23:35.137 --> 00:23:39.054
(speaking in foreign language)

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.630
- The next step, one of the
most iconic drinks to drink

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.350
on the beach or throughout
Rio is a caipirinha.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.260
A caipirinha, first he takes a lime.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.110
He like sliced up an entire lime,

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.360
put it into a little bucket
with some sugar, mash it,

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.160
and he's mashing that up right now

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.743
and then definitely some
cachaca is gonna be involved.

00:24:08.639 --> 00:24:09.472
Just a couple of ice as well

00:24:09.472 --> 00:24:11.728
and mashes that in with the lime as well.

00:24:11.728 --> 00:24:15.645
(speaking in foreign language)

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.530
- He puts like literally an
entire cup of cachaca in there,

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:45.280
shakes it in that Tupperware
until it's like fully frothy.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.520
Brazil on the beach, that
frothiness, those shaking skills.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.190
So it's just straight lime sugar cachaca.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.300
That is a beach drink right there.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.230
That's sour, that's frothy, that's strong,

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.873
that's icy, refreshing citrus-y.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.000
That is really strong,
I'm just gonna take a,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.380
a couple sips, I just wanted
to taste it because it's

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.570
such an iconic Brazilian
drink, a Rio drink.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.870
But that is really strong.

00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:28.686
Ciao, obrigado.

00:25:28.686 --> 00:25:30.515
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:30.515 --> 00:25:32.236
- Obrigado.

00:25:32.236 --> 00:25:33.069
- Obrigado.

00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:34.860
- From here, we are just
going down the beach

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.040
to the next beach, which is Copacabana.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.790
And this is such a long
beach, it's so amazing how,

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.160
I mean Rio de Janeiro, it's
a massive, it's a huge city,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.670
but there're so many beaches
and not just the coastline

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.440
but yeah, the actual sand beaches

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.053
that are clean and
swimmable, it's impressive.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.180
Oh yeah, that is very
refreshing, very cool.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.260
Just, there's nothing more pure.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.260
I say this every time I drink a coconut.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.260
Copacabana Beach, it's a
four-kilometer stretch of sand.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.120
And behind, although it's like
kind of blocked by buildings,

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.720
you can just see the,
the tip of it over there,

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.600
is Sugar Loaf Mountain
in Portuguese it's called

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.083
Pao de Acucar, and it's called Sugar Loaf,

00:26:34.708 --> 00:26:36.720
whoa, take a few steps back.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.820
It is called Sugar Loaf
because it resembles

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.593
the sugar loaves, how they
molded the sugar from Brazil.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.480
And on Copacabana Beach, Sugar
Loaf was a little bit far

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.890
so we just took a drive,
this is called the Red Beach

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.420
in an area called Urca, and
this is another beautiful beach,

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.170
just a small beach, a bay with rocks,

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.800
massive rock pillars on either side.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.180
This is another stunning,
another stunning beach

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.661
right in the heart of Rio.

00:27:04.661 --> 00:27:07.244
(upbeat music)

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.330
We're stopping real fast
at a place called Bar Urca,

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:17.123
which is a legendary corner
restaurant since 1939.

00:27:17.123 --> 00:27:19.260
It's just kinda like a counter takeaway.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.850
You can stop in there,
you can eat a snack,

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.220
you can have a drink, but
then a lot of people buy

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.020
and then go across the
street where they have a

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.450
ledge overlooking the
sea and sit on the wall.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.380
- The empanada de camarao.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.700
- Empanada de camarao which is a little,

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.830
it's a little cake, little pie
pastry stuffed with camarao,

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.750
which are shrimp, almost like crumbles

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.620
in your fingers as you pick it up

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.450
and then it looks more crunchy on the top

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.100
and then more soft on the bottom.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.940
That's just like the
type of pastry that just

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.890
sticks to your lips like
lipstick when you take a bite.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.240
Oh, chilis, thank you, man.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:04.023
Yes, so unbelievably crumbly and buttery.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.120
If you're not careful, it's
like you'll take a bite,

00:28:10.011 --> 00:28:12.830
and the entire thing will just
like collapse in your finger

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.360
because it's so soft,
so incredibly crumbly.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.910
You got a little bit of
shrimp in there, the olive.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:20.100
We're gonna go to another restaurant,

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.110
kind of a buteco style,
it is a buteco which is a,

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.300
it's a bar but a restaurant
with lots of food.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.410
It has very good food,
and then we have more

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.910
street food to cover as
well, so we're on our way.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.030
I think I was saying buteco before,

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.563
but it's actually boteco, and it is, yeah,

00:28:40.563 --> 00:28:43.410
it's a bar, it's a
neighborhood restaurant.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.340
They have, they specialize
in all sorts of food.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.500
- Oh, we have sambiquira here.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.333
- What is that?

00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:54.130
- Look, sambiquira crackling,
can I, it's the chicken butt.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.673
- Yes.
- Look.

00:28:55.673 --> 00:28:56.877
(speaking in foreign language)

00:28:56.877 --> 00:28:58.720
- Boteco is the type of place you can find

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.390
all sorts of dishes, specially
a lot of meaty dishes,

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:06.600
a lot of like french fries, fried meat,

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.343
and then typically with drinks as well.

00:29:12.474 --> 00:29:14.425
Okay, we're starting
with bolinho de feijoada.

00:29:14.425 --> 00:29:15.907
And bolinho is, it's like a little snack

00:29:15.907 --> 00:29:20.743
but feijoada are the beans so
there should be beans in here.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.760
Oh, that's like an entire
feijoada experience,

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.070
like wrapped into a little,
a little, a little thing

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.920
and then deep fried, oh that's awesome,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.490
there's kale in the
middle, you can definitely

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.370
taste the pork in it too
and then that crispy edge.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.520
I'm gonna hot sauce it.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.537
How long has he had this place?

00:29:46.537 --> 00:29:49.000
- [Guilherme] 60 years, not
this bar, but other bar.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.058
- Doing bars.

00:29:50.058 --> 00:29:51.308
- [Guilherme] But he runs boteco 60 years.

00:29:51.308 --> 00:29:52.952
- He's been running botecos for 60 years.

00:29:52.952 --> 00:29:55.943
He's 75 years now, so
starting when he was 15 years.

00:29:58.309 --> 00:30:02.226
(speaking in foreign language)

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.860
It's pork leg, but it looks like ham.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.210
It looks like it's been cured,
looks like it's been salted

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.410
and smoked, um, and then
you squeeze on some lime

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.370
and serve with onions and olives on top,

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.220
and then you eat it with the mustard.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.040
Oh, wow, slices of ham with onions,

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.500
that mustard is wonderful.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.070
Like the boteco culture, is it,

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.700
is it for dinner or is it before dinner?

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.140
- No, it's actually for the
entire day, usually after lunch.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.393
But it's like entire day, usually
on the weekends, holidays.

00:30:37.393 --> 00:30:38.535
- But it's like snack.

00:30:38.535 --> 00:30:39.368
- Yeah, kinda like tapa snacks.

00:30:39.368 --> 00:30:40.230
- Snacks or like a home meal?

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.460
- No, no, not a home meal.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.970
It's just more snacks and drinks.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.410
- Like snacks with drinks.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.193
- But during lunch, some
botecos, they serve meal.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.860
- And then next for this
lick like fried fritter

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.620
kind of vegetable with
onions on top as well.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.423
It almost looks like a
fluffy batter omelette.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.492
Oh, not like an omelette at
all, more like a pancake,

00:31:06.492 --> 00:31:09.550
like a fluffy batter,
okay we got one more dish.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.810
Some fried pork with the skin,

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.160
so it's kinda like
crackling and pork together.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.888
And then the fried chicken butts.

00:31:16.888 --> 00:31:17.721
- Sambiquira.

00:31:17.721 --> 00:31:22.600
- And kind of is like the
entire chicken tail flap,

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.697
fatty material fully
deep fried to a crisp.

00:31:26.697 --> 00:31:29.140
But it's golden brown, that looks tasty.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.360
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.688
That is delicious, it is fried to a crisp.

00:31:41.688 --> 00:31:45.540
It's crunchy, kinda
leathery something in there

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.130
and kind of fatty and
juicy and here's the pork.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.480
I'm gonna add a little
bit of that sauce to it.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:32:00.510
Oh, that pork is just like
completely fried to a crisp,

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.770
meaty, leathery deliciousness to it.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.880
Yeah, that's a dangerously
tasty porky snack.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.450
Okay, he just brought his little sampling

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.773
bowl of fried eggplant.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.610
That's awesome as well, that is just like

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:19.280
dangerously crunchy, like you could just

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.900
crunch on that all afternoon-long.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:21.957
Okay, we're on our way out,

00:32:21.957 --> 00:32:23.680
but the owner really wanted us to stay

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.720
to try his fried scarlet eggplant.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.200
Looks like it's battered and
then covered in some garlic.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.033
Ooh, that's hot.

00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:36.056
Oh, that's amazing, oh that's,

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.040
that is delicious, I love
this scarlet eggplant,

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.260
it has this bitterness to it,
and then it just kinda like

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.903
melts in your mouth
with the crunchy batter.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.973
- I name him (speaking
in foreign language)

00:32:49.973 --> 00:32:53.450
- Bueno obrigado.
- Bueno obrigado.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.643
- Muito obrigado.

00:32:55.643 --> 00:32:56.630
(speaking in foreign language)

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.020
- Such a nice man, such an amazing man.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.460
He wanted us to stay, like he just,

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.807
he wanted us to stay, he says,

00:33:03.807 --> 00:33:06.090
"More food, more food, more food."

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:09.403
Awesome, awesome guy, wow, what a legend.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.280
From here, we're driving back
towards the center of town

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.840
towards Copacabana where we're gonna

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.270
finish with one last street food snack.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.019
It's another thing that you
have to eat when you're in Rio.

00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:23.936
(speaking in foreign language)

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:28.503
- Chicken butt.

00:33:28.503 --> 00:33:30.123
- The chicken butt kebab.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.864
- Chicken hearts, we're
gonna have chicken hearts.

00:33:35.864 --> 00:33:39.781
(speaking in foreign language)

00:33:54.237 --> 00:33:58.154
(speaking in foreign language)

00:34:02.026 --> 00:34:02.922
- Yes.

00:34:02.922 --> 00:34:06.620
(speaking in foreign language)

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.520
- We are actually like
literally in the same spot

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.240
as we began this morning,
which was right there.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.970
Oh, I think we can see some of
the drippings of the sausage

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:16.680
down below here, but literally

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.010
right next door 12 hours later.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.810
This is literally 12 hours later.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.300
He serves all sorts of different kebabs.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.410
There's meat kebabs,
there's chicken butts.

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:29.320
There's chicken, there's,
there's a variety of many things.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.390
They're just like, oh,
cool, they're kofta.

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:34.500
Kofta kebabs, oh, I love how he kinda like

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.560
triple stacks them so even
the ones that are fully cooked

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.910
get smoked until they're
purchased, until they're bought.

00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.680
- His wife, Valeria,
she cooks amazing food,

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.230
so she's gonna serve some
side dishes on the side.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.163
- Yes, awesome.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.377
(speaking in foreign language)

00:35:05.471 --> 00:35:09.462
(speaking in foreign language)

00:35:09.462 --> 00:35:10.295
- Obrigado.

00:35:10.295 --> 00:35:11.128
(speaking in foreign language)

00:35:11.128 --> 00:35:11.968
- Obrigado.

00:35:11.968 --> 00:35:14.610
It's pretty cool to make it a
full complete meal on a stick

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:16.720
is they take that kebab of meat,

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.090
and then she dips it into a bucket

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.400
a Tupperware of cassava powder.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.420
That way, you have your meat
like coated in cassava powder

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.500
so it's kind of like
a, you got your starch.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.220
It's like the equivalent of a
bun having some extra starch

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.430
to go with your meat even
though it's still mostly meat.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.573
Add some sauce, sweet.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:38.990
Oh and these are the chicken butts, right,

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.960
an entire skewer of chicken butts.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.833
That is a lot of fattiness on a skewer.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.190
Oh, that one is amazing,
oh that's so crunchy,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.970
so crispy, so fatty, you got that

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:01.000
dry cassava powder on there,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.730
which gives it some body, some starch,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:07.730
some fillingness, and then with
that vinegary, spicy sauce.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.545
Good, that is good, that is good.

00:36:13.545 --> 00:36:14.378
- Sambiquira, man.

00:36:14.378 --> 00:36:15.580
- Man, that's awesome.

00:36:21.194 --> 00:36:22.730
- Sambiquira right here.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.020
- It smells awesome.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.910
- Dude, and the tapioca's
such a cool move.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.367
- You gotta sauce it, that
one will just do it, man.

00:36:34.251 --> 00:36:38.613
(speaking in foreign language)

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:39.853
- Just onto the street.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:51.063
Oh yeah, crunchy actually, nicely fatty.

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:56.393
(speaking in foreign language)

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.493
This is the kofta kebab,
there's cheese inside as well.

00:37:03.493 --> 00:37:05.570
Man, he is a character, he just told me

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:08.050
to turn off the camera and eat, so I will

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.750
keep the camera on but I will eat.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.600
Oh man, uh-huh.

00:37:19.104 --> 00:37:22.520
That is way too hot to eat in one bite,

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.363
but that is extraordinarily tasty.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.043
Oh, sauce it.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:43.730
Oh man, kofta kebabs are wonderful.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:50.787
(speaking in foreign language)

00:37:51.727 --> 00:37:54.312
- Let's have a take a photo
of him, he's gonna do the,

00:37:54.312 --> 00:37:56.256
(speaking in foreign language)

00:37:56.256 --> 00:37:57.870
- Obrigado.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.220
And he gets a lot of business
because of this intersection

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:06.220
and then right behind me,
that's like a motorcycle,

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.503
motorcycle taxi station,
so people wait in line

00:38:08.503 --> 00:38:11.560
to take a motorcycle up the hill.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.660
And so it's just too
tempting for most people.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.180
They cannot resist the smell.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.250
The aroma just lures people in.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.090
And like they, you see lots of people

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:23.250
just falling here in line, we
are moving to her buffet line

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.080
which is amazing home cooked food

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.080
literally brought from
their house down the road.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.940
Is there any meat in
there or it's just beans?

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.864
- Uh, yeah, sausage.

00:38:31.864 --> 00:38:32.781
- Oh, okay.

00:38:36.038 --> 00:38:39.955
(speaking in foreign language)

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.480
- Kinda like Brazilian chicken salad?

00:38:47.237 --> 00:38:48.472
- You got it.

00:38:48.472 --> 00:38:52.410
(speaking in foreign language)

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.860
- She adds some rice, she adds some pasta,

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.950
she adds some of the feijao tropeiro,

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.557
which is some of the beans with sausage.

00:38:58.557 --> 00:39:01.193
- Yeah, add in chicken
hearts, chicken hearts.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.100
- And he put on chicken heart skewer kebab

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.882
on top of that plus some
more of the cassava powder.

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:13.227
- Put the heart.

00:39:13.227 --> 00:39:17.213
(speaking in foreign language)

00:39:17.213 --> 00:39:19.963
- Alright, Guilherme this is
the final dish of the day.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.430
Oh, wow, those hearts are amazing.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:31.810
Fresh off the grill, salty, bouncy,

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:33.820
with those onions with that salad.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.007
That's like a to-go Rio
styrofoam box of deliciousness.

00:39:38.007 --> 00:39:38.840
- Amazing.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.470
- I love it with those
onions with that mix

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.880
with the cassava with the
chili sauce with those carrots,

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.310
like the whole package, everything like,

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.950
oh some of the feijao
I got, feijao tropeiro.

00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:56.140
And it just tastes so good
when you like mix everything.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.590
You might not even know
what you get on your fork

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.123
but it's amazing, home-cooked
food on the streets of Rio.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.210
Loving it, loving the people,

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.540
loving the food, loving the atmosphere.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.570
And what a perfect way
to end this ultimate

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.503
Brazilian street food tour of Rio.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.910
Okay, so we've come to the end of this

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:21.340
incredible, ultimate Brazilian
street food tour of Rio.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.170

You're not gonna want to miss

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.970
But Rio, what a city, it's
unbelievably gorgeous,

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.460
like one of the most beautiful landscape,

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.940
beaches, mountains, and
jungle scenery you will see.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.960
The people we met have
been incredibly friendly

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.290
and hospitable and welcoming.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.580
I won't, like I mean, it is a city

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.730
where you do need to be careful.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.300
You can't just walk around with a camera.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:31.300
You need to use, you need
to be careful with things.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.350
You need to be careful.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.150
But then the people
that you do come across

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.860
are so welcoming, they're
so awesome, they're so cool.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.950

wanted to visit this city

for as long as I can
remember, since I'm a kid,

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.940
so I am just overly excited,
ecstatic to be here.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.830
And today just sums it all up.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:52.380
