00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.820
To build applications that
use Google Play services,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.640
you need a development environment.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.410
And to install the development
environment there's two

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.109
main things that you'd need.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.850
First, is Android studio.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.300
You can download Android studio
from the developer.google.com site.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.180
When you install Android studio,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.360
you get the ability to use the Android
SDK Manager, that you can see here.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.510
And using the Android SDK Manager,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.120
you should install
the Google Play Services SDK.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.500
You'll see it as an item on the list,
under extras,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.820
near the bottom of the screen.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.560
Make sure that you install
the most recent version of this.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.800
I would also recommend that you take a
look at the Android Fundamentals courses

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.450
offered by Udacity.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.890
There are two of them at the moment, and

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.540
I strongly recommend that
you at least take the first.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.010
And it's really not a bad idea
to take the second as well.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.363
These will give you a head start
in Android development and

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:47.208
teach you many of the concepts that
we'll be covering in this course.
