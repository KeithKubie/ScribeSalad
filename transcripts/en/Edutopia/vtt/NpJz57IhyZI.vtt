00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:13.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This short documentary

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:17.766
by a San Fernando Valley High School
student portrays the stark reality

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:20.756
of growing up in his
neighborhood north of Los Angeles.

00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:22.516
&gt;&gt;Student: This one right
here, this is my house.

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:24.346
About two years ago
there was a drive-by.

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:25.686
I was playing out with
my little brother

00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:28.036
and they were shooting the
bullets from this point

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:30.916
out to the building over there.

00:00:32.036 --> 00:00:34.206
You can still see the
bullet hole by the window.

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:38.516
&gt;&gt;Student: See if you could
get a little bit of the tree.

00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:41.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But these days, thanks
to a unique video-production class,

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:45.436
the shooting at San Fernando High
School involves video cameras,

00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:48.466
and when students hang on the
street corner after school,

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:50.746
they're often outside
their teacher's house,

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:54.256
tapping into his wireless
Web connection on his laptop.

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:54.866
&gt;&gt;Student: That's cool.

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.046
You actually get a signal.

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The program that has made
a dramatic difference in the lives

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:02.626
of hundreds of San Fernando
High School students is housed

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:06.316
in Room 307, the Computer
Inspiration Studio.

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:08.676
&gt;&gt;Student: So I'm going to save it,
and now let's just say I'm going

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:09.726
to make some more pages here.

00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:13.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Here, students can take
fifth- and sixth-period classes

00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:16.656
in everything from Web site
design to video editing.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:20.606
They also spend time here after
school and on weekends working

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:24.926
on digital projects for core classes
like social studies and economics.

00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:25.726
&gt;&gt;Student: We're going

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:28.456
to have extracurricular going
up, and that can be blurred.

00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:32.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The program, which
now includes some 100 members

00:01:32.156 --> 00:01:36.896
of the San Fernando education
technology team, started in 1999

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:40.766
in a janitorial closet with
three students, one laptop

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.756
and a social studies
teacher named Marco Torres.

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:44.796
&gt;&gt;Marco: In fact, we
have a camera now.

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:46.406
You guys can go out and shoot.

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:51.416
&gt;&gt;If I look back at my own education,
I remember the projects I made.

00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:53.886
I remember the hand I
made in kindergarten,

00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:55.716
you know, in the plaster.

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.716
I remember the volcano
I made in third grade.

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:01.126
I remember the games I
won as a baseball player,

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:02.546
because they were projects.

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:05.146
They were things that had an
end to them, something tangible,

00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:08.536
something that I can say
to my mom, "Mommy, look.

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:09.506
Look what I did."

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:09.946
&gt;&gt;Student: The main page.

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:12.246
&gt;&gt;Student: The main
page colors and...

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:16.026
&gt;&gt;Marco: And I know it's important,
so when I do projects for kids,

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.546
I try to give them some
insight that has meaning.

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:20.836
It's not just disconnected
information.

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:23.876
I mean, for me as a teacher
it's my moral obligation

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.826
to make information
real and connected,

00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:28.216
and if I'm not doing that,
then I'm not teaching.

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:29.626
&gt;&gt;What's our plan?

00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:34.276
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Torres' students have
already produced some 200 digital

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:40.006
movies, which stream over the Web
site the technology team created.

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:43.866
Team members also volunteer to
teach other students, teachers

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:48.056
and community members in free
Saturday-morning computer classes.

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:52.326
"Mi Barrio" Producer Cesar
Larios, who graduated last year,

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:54.486
volunteers at the school, passing

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:56.786
out to others the knowledge
he gained here.

00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:02.606
&gt;&gt;Cesar: We all have to work
together in order to get ahead,

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:06.396
so when I learned something, it's
my duty to go and help somebody else

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:09.006
to learn it, and then that
person will pass that knowledge

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.796
to another person, and we'll
continue until everybody knows it.

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:13.926
So, that's really critical,
working together.

00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:15.896
&gt;&gt;Student: This will record, right?

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:16.996
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, just like...

00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:18.526
&gt;&gt;Student: [screams] kind of thing?

00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:19.126
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:19.786
&gt;&gt;Student: All right.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.186
&gt;&gt;Student: You'll have to
sacrifice yourself for the team.

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:22.786
&gt;&gt;Student: All right.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:23.986
Just like...

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:26.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to
picking up technical skills,

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:29.676
students learn lifelong skills
in the collaborative process,

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:33.186
working in small teams to help
complete each other's video.

00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:34.376
&gt;&gt;Student: That's better.

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:35.696
I got to see your face there.

00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:37.806
&gt;&gt;Student: And obviously in the
future if you get a job you're going

00:03:37.806 --> 00:03:40.146
to have to learn to work with
people, and this is a place

00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:43.126
where you can actually get to learn
to work with people, because you get

00:03:43.126 --> 00:03:45.086
in groups and you know you
have to push each other

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:46.696
to get that done in time.

00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:49.926
&gt;&gt;I've been working on all year long.

00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:52.446
&gt;&gt;Rubin: This part, I'm working
on this project, I received a lot

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:55.326
of leadership skills being in
charge of all the deadlines

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:58.086
and making sure everybody did
their work, put in the committees

00:03:58.086 --> 00:04:00.496
and just tell them what
parts to do of the movie,

00:04:01.656 --> 00:04:03.076
and also just by working

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.396
on this program you learn
mathematical skills,

00:04:06.256 --> 00:04:09.416
like you have to know all the
rotation of all the different axes,

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:13.926
just in case you want to
move the snowman 90 degrees.

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:17.046
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: Since we all took parts
in doing little things, I did a sled

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:22.436
and carpet and stuff like that, and
it actually takes a lot of time,

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:30.426
but since there's a lot of
us it goes pretty quick.

00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:33.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While the projects
range from comical animated shorts

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:37.226
to serious documentaries,
they all conform to a set

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:39.906
of production standards
and assessment rubrics

00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:42.446
that Torres calls the "four P's."

00:04:43.226 --> 00:04:47.416
&gt;&gt;Marco: The first P is planning,
most critical part, and the planning,

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:51.056
that's where kids write things
like the script, a timeline,

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:53.616
storyboards, very, very important.

00:04:53.976 --> 00:04:58.806
I must be able, as a teacher, to
sit down and visualize what it is

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:01.376
that they're trying to do
before I hand them a camera.

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:03.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Every time I shot the
shot that I wanted in my storyboard,

00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:06.276
I would cross it out,
and I had a storyboard

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:10.596
that this was 20 pages long,
and then I'd go crossing out

00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:12.116
and you'd see progress going on.

00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:14.206
&gt;&gt;Marco: The second P is production.

00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:17.166
That's when the kids go out
and either shoot or start

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.586
to collect the information
needed to do the project.

00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:22.506
&gt;&gt;Student: We could actually
get a far shot of it.

00:05:22.616 --> 00:05:23.796
That way we get the
[inaudible] and the trees.

00:05:23.796 --> 00:05:25.926
&gt;&gt;Student: The shadow and we get the
whole trees and we get the whole...

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.496
&gt;&gt;Marco: The third part
is the presentation.

00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:29.956
This is when they actually
present the information.

00:05:30.236 --> 00:05:31.346
&gt;&gt;Student: The style
is very important.

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:33.326
&gt;&gt;Marco: And then the
final P is assessment.

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:36.486
I call it "assessing with
a silent P," and assessing

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:40.076
with a silent P involves
the kids to develop rubrics.

00:05:40.286 --> 00:05:45.636
What does it mean to
have a good project?

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:46.286
&gt;&gt;Student: Good evening.

00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:50.796
This is Carmen [speaking
Spanish] Cruz-Diaz,

00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:55.956
and I'm reporting live
from Channel 307.

00:05:56.086 --> 00:05:57.376
&gt;&gt;I think it's the movie
that I'm most proud of,

00:05:57.376 --> 00:06:00.406
because it's my first movie that
I got to direct and film and edit

00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:05.376
and use a green screen in, so
that's the best movie, I think.

00:06:05.556 --> 00:06:08.866
&gt;&gt;Student: Where have
I seen this before?

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:10.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Obviously I'm
learning, because I look back at,

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:15.426
"I could've used a different shot for
that," or, "I could've done this,"

00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:18.166
but the best thing is, you know,
go on and make another movie

00:06:18.606 --> 00:06:20.616
and then just, you
know, make it better.

00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:27.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Of the videos
students have done to date,

00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:28.756
none has had a greater impact

00:06:29.036 --> 00:06:31.566
than the documentary
Consuelo Molina produced

00:06:31.716 --> 00:06:33.776
as a project for an economics class.

00:06:36.436 --> 00:06:38.896
&gt;&gt;Marco: She wanted to talk
about some of the consequences

00:06:38.896 --> 00:06:42.226
of the world economy and the protests
that were happening in Washington,

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:44.476
Seattle, around the
World Trade Organization,

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:46.996
so she decided to focus
on sweatshops.

00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:50.396
She knew that if she had done
this project traditionally,

00:06:50.396 --> 00:06:53.376
in front of a class, the information
would've died there in the class.

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:57.526
And she took this documentary
and posted it on the Web,

00:06:57.526 --> 00:07:00.386
and several people have found it.

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:04.016
The Women's Human Rights
Conference in Paris saw it

00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:05.766
and asked her permission to show it.

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:09.826
And other places like in India,
there was a teacher who asked

00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:11.546
if he could show it at
this national conference.

00:07:11.716 --> 00:07:12.336
&gt;&gt;Consuelo: It's a
big issue, but, yeah,

00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:16.556
at the same time it's a high
school project, so I don't think --

00:07:16.956 --> 00:07:18.636
I wouldn't have thought
that people from Australia

00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:22.386
or different people would've
reacted to it the way they did.

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:29.876
I guess a little voice
can make a big impact.

00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:31.976
&gt;&gt;Marco: This is a connection
that I'm looking for.

00:07:32.716 --> 00:07:34.966
This is that bridge,
the digital divide.

00:07:35.546 --> 00:07:37.216
&gt;&gt;Click on that for me.

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:37.806
&gt;&gt;Student: This one?

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:37.926
&gt;&gt;Marco: Yeah.

00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:42.376
&gt;&gt;And the more I can create
opportunities for relevancy,

00:07:42.876 --> 00:07:45.976
the more connections are made, the
brighter our hope light shines.

00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:52.686
