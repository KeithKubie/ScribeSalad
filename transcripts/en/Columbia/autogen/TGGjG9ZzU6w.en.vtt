flow we took very high-speed camera

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
flow we took very high-speed camera
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.339
flow we took very high-speed camera
images of the blood vessels on the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
images of the blood vessels on the
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.020
images of the blood vessels on the
surface of the brain and when we did a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
surface of the brain and when we did a
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.880
surface of the brain and when we did a
stimulus we were able to actually watch

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
stimulus we were able to actually watch
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.310
stimulus we were able to actually watch
the blood vessels dilate really really

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
the blood vessels dilate really really
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619
the blood vessels dilate really really
high speeds and when we did that we saw

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
high speeds and when we did that we saw
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020
high speeds and when we did that we saw
this sort of spreading of the dilation

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
this sort of spreading of the dilation
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150
this sort of spreading of the dilation
of those vessels and that's something

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
of those vessels and that's something
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.619
of those vessels and that's something
that people hadn't really seen before

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
that people hadn't really seen before
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.330
that people hadn't really seen before
because no one had imaged as fast as we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
because no one had imaged as fast as we
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190
because no one had imaged as fast as we
managed to image what we found is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
managed to image what we found is
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.170
managed to image what we found is
basically that there's this layer of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
basically that there's this layer of
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.910
basically that there's this layer of
cells on the inside of blood vessels

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
cells on the inside of blood vessels
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.490
cells on the inside of blood vessels
called the endothelium which nobody had

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
called the endothelium which nobody had
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.200
called the endothelium which nobody had
really looked at in great detail in the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
really looked at in great detail in the
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.670
really looked at in great detail in the
brain before but we found that it's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
brain before but we found that it's
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830
brain before but we found that it's
capable of actually sending signals

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
capable of actually sending signals
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.479
capable of actually sending signals
propagating signals and that this

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
propagating signals and that this
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.160
propagating signals and that this
propagation of signals is a really

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
propagation of signals is a really
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.679
propagation of signals is a really
important component of increasing blood

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
important component of increasing blood
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899
important component of increasing blood
flow in the brain so this gives us new

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
flow in the brain so this gives us new
 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700
flow in the brain so this gives us new
insight into how this blood flow

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
insight into how this blood flow
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.030
insight into how this blood flow
regulation is is working at a sort of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
regulation is is working at a sort of
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490
regulation is is working at a sort of
mechanistic level it's also really

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
mechanistic level it's also really
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440
mechanistic level it's also really
important because nobody thought that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
important because nobody thought that
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780
important because nobody thought that
this process was taking place in the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
this process was taking place in the
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.249
this process was taking place in the
brain even though it's known to take

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
brain even though it's known to take
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780
brain even though it's known to take
place everywhere else in the body and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
place everywhere else in the body and
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.880
place everywhere else in the body and
this provides a new link to other

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
this provides a new link to other
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770
this provides a new link to other
diseases in the rest of the body that we

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
diseases in the rest of the body that we
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.230
diseases in the rest of the body that we
know affect these endothelial cells but

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
know affect these endothelial cells but
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.850
know affect these endothelial cells but
nobody's really thought about the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
nobody's really thought about the
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.890
nobody's really thought about the
possibility that they tie into the brain

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
possibility that they tie into the brain
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.929
possibility that they tie into the brain
the reason why so many people are

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
the reason why so many people are
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.280
the reason why so many people are
interested in this blood flow response

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
interested in this blood flow response
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.469
interested in this blood flow response
is because it's the basis of the signal

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
is because it's the basis of the signal
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060
is because it's the basis of the signal
that you measure there in functional MRI

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
that you measure there in functional MRI
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730
that you measure there in functional MRI
and so functional MRI is this technique

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
and so functional MRI is this technique
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.219
and so functional MRI is this technique
that you can use to image the brains of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
that you can use to image the brains of
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719
that you can use to image the brains of
humans and we'll give you these

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
humans and we'll give you these
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.280
humans and we'll give you these
beautiful maps where you see this big

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
beautiful maps where you see this big
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.350
beautiful maps where you see this big
bright red blob that says right this is

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
bright red blob that says right this is
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.240
bright red blob that says right this is
where the activation is happening what

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
where the activation is happening what
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550
where the activation is happening what
that MRI machine is actually measuring a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
that MRI machine is actually measuring a
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.130
that MRI machine is actually measuring a
change in the amount of deoxyhemoglobin

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
change in the amount of deoxyhemoglobin
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.630
change in the amount of deoxyhemoglobin
the brain so it actually measures a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
the brain so it actually measures a
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.149
the brain so it actually measures a
change in the blood not in the neurons

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
change in the blood not in the neurons
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.070
change in the blood not in the neurons
and people have been struggling for

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080
and people have been struggling for
 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.540
and people have been struggling for
years to understand well what does it

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550
years to understand well what does it
 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.090
years to understand well what does it
mean when that region is is bigger or

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100
mean when that region is is bigger or
 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.690
mean when that region is is bigger or
smaller or faster or slower and we

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
smaller or faster or slower and we
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400
smaller or faster or slower and we
haven't had any way to really understand

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
haven't had any way to really understand
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.960
haven't had any way to really understand
what that means in terms of the neurons

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
what that means in terms of the neurons
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.949
what that means in terms of the neurons
and so our new finding can allow us to

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
and so our new finding can allow us to
 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.440
and so our new finding can allow us to
explain better why the blood flow

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
explain better why the blood flow
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.880
explain better why the blood flow
responses look the way that they do

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
responses look the way that they do
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.970
responses look the way that they do
just from the sake of brain health it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
just from the sake of brain health it
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.890
just from the sake of brain health it
has to be important that the brain

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
has to be important that the brain
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.780
has to be important that the brain
regulates its blood flow properly you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
regulates its blood flow properly you
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.180
regulates its blood flow properly you
know if it doesn't do that even in the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
know if it doesn't do that even in the
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.830
know if it doesn't do that even in the
short term you might not be able to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
short term you might not be able to
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.900
short term you might not be able to
respond as quickly you might not be able

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910
respond as quickly you might not be able
 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.150
respond as quickly you might not be able
to think straight effectively right when

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
to think straight effectively right when
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.410
to think straight effectively right when
you're really hungry you can't think

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420
you're really hungry you can't think
 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.920
you're really hungry you can't think
straight right but longer-term if your

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
straight right but longer-term if your
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.240
straight right but longer-term if your
neurons aren't getting what they need

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
neurons aren't getting what they need
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.650
neurons aren't getting what they need
every time they need it you're going to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
every time they need it you're going to
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.750
every time they need it you're going to
start to get neuro degeneration and and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760
start to get neuro degeneration and and
 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.210
start to get neuro degeneration and and
you know we have a population of elderly

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
you know we have a population of elderly
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.190
you know we have a population of elderly
people who are getting dementia and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200
people who are getting dementia and
 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.900
people who are getting dementia and
Alzheimer's and a lot of diseases which

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
Alzheimer's and a lot of diseases which
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.640
Alzheimer's and a lot of diseases which
now people are realizing more and more

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
now people are realizing more and more
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.350
now people are realizing more and more
might involve the vasculature and I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
might involve the vasculature and I
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.290
might involve the vasculature and I
think it's just an oversight not to look

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300
think it's just an oversight not to look
 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.330
think it's just an oversight not to look
at it and think of it as a really

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
at it and think of it as a really
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.270
at it and think of it as a really
important part of the way the brain

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
important part of the way the brain
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.460
important part of the way the brain
works so really the main theme of my

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470
works so really the main theme of my
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.310
works so really the main theme of my
work right now is that blood flow

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320
work right now is that blood flow
 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.470
work right now is that blood flow
regulation in the brain is really

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480
regulation in the brain is really
 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.150
regulation in the brain is really
important for brain health and it might

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160
important for brain health and it might
 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.060
important for brain health and it might
be more common than we think that this

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070
be more common than we think that this
 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.759
be more common than we think that this
regulation gets damaged in some way so

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769
regulation gets damaged in some way so
 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.350
regulation gets damaged in some way so
we think this is a way to better

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360
we think this is a way to better
 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.569
we think this is a way to better
understand the sort of neural

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579
understand the sort of neural
 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.180
understand the sort of neural
consequences of systemic diseases things

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
consequences of systemic diseases things
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.120
