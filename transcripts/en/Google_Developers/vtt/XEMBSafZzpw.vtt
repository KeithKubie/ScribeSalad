00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.760
ANDREW WALES: Hey everyone.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.347
Welcome to "Behind the Code."

00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:13.680
Today, we're going to be
talking all about the Universal

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.380
Analytics Upgrade.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.040
And to do that, we're going
to go right to the source.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.690
We have Nick Mihailovski
joining us in the studio.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.880
He's the product manager who's
been working on the Universal

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.050
Analytics Upgrade tool,
working tirelessly

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.349
to bring this upgrade
to all of our users.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.640
So thanks for joining us, Nick.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.723
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Yeah,
thanks for having me here.

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:33.890
ANDREW WALES: Cool.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.670
Let's take a look at the agenda.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.253
So Nick's going to
give us an overview

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:38.566
of what Universal Analytics is.

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.940
Second thing we'll
do is we'll go

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.350
through an overview
of the upgrade itself.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.990
So what is it, why
we're doing it,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.800
and just generally
what the steps are,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.250
so you know a little
bit more about that.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.270
Next, we'll cover
some common questions.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.811
We've been getting
a lot of questions

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:55.330
from developers about how to
use our upgrade tool, what

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.260
that process looks like.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.355
Also questions about
implementation and code,

00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:00.730
so we'll go through
that as well.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.940
And Nick will give us some
tips and great context

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.227
along the way.

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:07.310
And then at the end, we'll
give you some resources

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.010
that you can go to
after the video.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.334
So if you have questions
or want to find out more

00:01:11.334 --> 00:01:13.000
about a particular
topic of the upgrade,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.110
you can check out the
resources and learn more.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.772
Let's start at a
super high level.

00:01:18.772 --> 00:01:20.480
For those who haven't
heard of it before,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.896
what is Universal
Analytics, Nick?

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:23.130
Can you give us an overview?

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.380
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
That's a great question.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.065
Universal Analytics
is huge, right?

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:26.827
It's universal.

00:01:26.827 --> 00:01:27.660
ANDREW WALES: Right.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.840
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: So let
me try to contain it down

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.770
into something really basic.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.200
So in the past,
Google Analytics has

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.610
been about tracking
websites and web pages.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.390
So over the past 15
years, we've seen

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.960
a huge increase in mobile
content consumption,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.370
consumption across tablets, and
even content being distributed

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.840
across many other factors,
like kiosk, game consoles.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.020
And so what we saw is the need
to create new infrastructure

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.950
within Google
Analytics that allows

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.820
us to track user behavior
across all of these devices.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.830
So we launched last
year Universal Analytics

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.380
as a set of features
and libraries,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.700
as well as infrastructure,
to allow us to now enable

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.520
businesses to measure how users
interact with their business

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.332
across all these
different devices.

00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:12.790
ANDREW WALES: So
it's a collection.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.430
You'd say it's some
infrastructure changes.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.580
It's also new reports and
new features, and also

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.107
new libraries, all
bundled together.

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:20.190
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.240
All bundled together.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.400
And what really it is
is a platform for us

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.930
to add additional functionality
and features to really help

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.914
users better understand
how-- or help customers,

00:02:30.914 --> 00:02:32.830
help them understand how
users are interacting

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.920
with their business across all
these different environments.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.506
ANDREW WALES: Cool.

00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:36.159
OK.

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.700
So let's talk about
the upgrade then.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.120
So why are we doing an upgrade?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.620
What is it?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.328
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
That's a good question.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.890
When we launched
Universal Analytics,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.790
we required users
to create brand

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.900
new properties,
or tracking units.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.570
And so all of the historical
data that they had

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.034
was still being processed
by classic Analytics,

00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:55.450
and only new
properties were being

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.550
processed by
Universal Analytics.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.610
So what the upgrade
allows people to do

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.490
is to actually upgrade their
classic Analytics accounts

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.580
into Universal
Analytics accounts.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.980
And the features are
fantastic, because now you

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.540
have the ability to get all
the power of the new Universal

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.740
Analytics while maintaining
all your historical data.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.570
So you can still do
year over year trends,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.387
month over month trends,
pre and post the upgrade.

00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:20.970
But you can also take advantage
of all the brand new features.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.340
ANDREW WALES: So it's going to
be seamless, then, in Reports,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.580
right?

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.340
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Exactly.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.430
ANDREW WALES: Awesome.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.020
Awesome.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.027
How would one upgrade?

00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:28.610
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
Well, we try to make

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.960
it as simple as possible.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.950
And we boil it down
into two easy steps.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.710
The first step is you actually
have to transfer processing

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.070
from your classic Analytics
to Universal Analytics.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.930
And that's done through a tool.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.545
The second step is to
actually retag or reimplement

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:48.530
the tracking code to go from
the classic tracking library

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.050
to the new Universal
Analytics library.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.154
Now the second step is optional,
but it's highly recommended.

00:03:54.154 --> 00:03:56.320
ANDREW WALES: So you don't
have to change your code,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.529
but we recommend that you do.

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.445
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: You
don't have to change it,

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:00.680
but we recommend you do.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.630
ANDREW WALES: And maybe
we'll talk a little bit more

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.810
about that later
when we talk more

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.860
about the
implementation of code.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.818
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Sure.

00:04:04.818 --> 00:04:05.840
Yeah.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.490
ANDREW WALES: Now one other
thing that I wanted to ask you,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.573
because I've gotten a bunch
of questions on this--

00:04:09.573 --> 00:04:11.824
is there anybody who shouldn't
be upgrading right now?

00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:14.406
Because a lot of people watching
this might have the question,

00:04:14.406 --> 00:04:15.830
should I upgrade
or should I wait?

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.209
Is there anything
people should know?

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.899
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
It's a great question.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:24.154
So today there's many
features in Google Analytics--

00:04:24.154 --> 00:04:26.640
the DoubleClick
integration features,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.640
the deal with Remarketing,
DoubleClick for Advertisers.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.820
The features that uses
the dc.js tracking code,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.450
these features we're
still working on

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.700
to support them in
Universal Analytics.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.920
So if you are using
any of these features,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.700
you should wait just
a little bit longer

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.725
until we have full support
for all the features.

00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:47.350
So if you're using
those, you shouldn't

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.990
use the upgrade today.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.860
The other set of users who
shouldn't do this upgrade

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.860
is if you're not familiar
with how you've implemented

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.940
to the tracking code, make sure
you go to somebody who is more

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.080
familiar-- and make
sure that there's

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.800
no issues with your
implementation that will break.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.180
So you want to make sure
you spend the time learning

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.110
about what this upgrade is and
the implications it could have.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.735
Again, there's many people
using Google Analytics.

00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:14.215
And a lot of them use it
in very creative ways.

00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:16.090
And so if you are using
it in a creative way,

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.590
you want to make sure that you
know all the caveats involved

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.620
to make sure that your upgrade
is as seamless as possible,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.487
and there's no risk of
data quality issues.

00:05:23.487 --> 00:05:25.820
ANDREW WALES: So for example,
if you did a really custom

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.540
implementation with
ga.js on your website,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.040
you're definitely one of the
people who we would suggest

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.134
would spend a little time
upfront to figure out

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:36.050
if anything is going to
break when you update.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.258
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Absolutely.

00:05:40.885 --> 00:05:43.010
ANDREW WALES: So let's talk
about the upgrade tool.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.450
Because you mentioned there
were two steps, right?

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.647
You're going to transfer
your property using a tool.

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.480
And then you can
optionally update the code.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.890
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Yeah.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.970
ANDREW WALES: So this
would be step one,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:50.990
using the upgrade tool.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.260
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.010
ANDREW WALES: What
is the update tool?

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.724
What do you do?

00:05:55.724 --> 00:05:57.390
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
Well, the upgrade tool

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.524
starts with an Admin
UI in Google Analytics.

00:05:59.524 --> 00:06:01.190
ANDREW WALES: I think
I have screenshot.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.939
So let me show it.

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:03.160
And then you can give us a--

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.355
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Yeah.

00:06:03.355 --> 00:06:04.490
Fantastic.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.840
So the upgrade tool allows
you to come into the Admin UI.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.050
There's a new section for
upgrading Universe Analytics

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.567
Upgrade under each property.

00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:15.150
So this happens at
the property level.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.780
So if you look at
a property column,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.680
you'll see a new
tab for the upgrade.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.480
And when you click
on that, you'll

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.690
actually be able to go and
get to a page that takes you

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.480
through a series of steps
to transfer processing

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.960
from classic to
Universal Analytics.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.910
So what you do is you
come into the tool.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.380
You accept it.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.650
You look through
the information.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.970
Read all the documentation.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.310
When you're ready, you
click to next stage.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.640
You get a dialog sharing kind
of all the little caveats

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.730
and details.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.690
And once you've agreed
and you confirm,

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.980
we actually schedule your
property to be transferred.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.560
Now the transfer actually
takes between 24 and 48 hours.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.650
And so you can
actually come back--

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.150
you'll see a little
state changed.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.606
This says transfer in progress.

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:02.105
And actually, under the tab for
Universal Analytics Upgrade,

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:03.560
it'll say transfer in progress.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.560
So you could always revisit
to see where you are

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.000
and what stage you're at.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.280
Once we've finally
transferred after that time,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.240
then it'll be saying
transfer complete.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.410
And so that means once
the transfer is done,

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.181
you've completed step one
of the upgrade process.

00:07:18.181 --> 00:07:19.930
ANDREW WALES: I click
the Transfer button.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.110
I'm going to wait
24 to 48 hours.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.870
Check my account.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.930
And it's going to
give me a notice that

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.730
says it's done, right?

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.260
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
It's that easy.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.720
ANDREW WALES: That easy.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.220
Cool.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.070
So during that time,
can I still send data?

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.070
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: You can
continue to send data.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.050
But during the
time, you should not

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.660
retag to the new tracking code.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.240
You need to make sure that
you complete step one, which

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.670
is the transfer
processing, before you move

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.110
to step two, which
is the actually

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.050
reimplementation
of tracking code.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.050
ANDREW WALES: Otherwise?

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.674
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: If
you don't do that,

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.740
it could lead to
data quality issues.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.037
ANDREW WALES: So transfer,
wait until we confirm

00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:51.870
it's been done in your
account, and then you

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.010
can change your code if
you want to in step two.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.520
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Exactly.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.620
ANDREW WALES: So I've
gotten this question

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.630
from a number of users
who don't actually

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.242
see the upgrade tool
in their account.

00:08:01.242 --> 00:08:02.950
Is there any reason
why someone out there

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.750
today would not see
the upgrade tool?

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.452
And how do they get
to see it, I guess.

00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:08.660
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: It's great.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.410
So we whitelisted or
enabled this upgrade tool

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.610
for pretty much all of
the different accounts

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.090
and the properties within.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.500
The only properties and accounts
we haven't enabled it for

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.420
is for properties
or profiles that

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.810
are using any of our DoubleClick
integration features.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.120
For example, Remarketing or
DoubleClick for Advertisers.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.840
If anybody's enabled
these features,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.220
we've explicitly not
enabled this tool

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.490
for any of the profiles
within their account.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.049
And the reason why
is that we want

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.890
to be extra careful because
we don't have full feature

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.184
support for these features
in Universal Analytics.

00:08:44.184 --> 00:08:45.350
We're still working on them.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.190
ANDREW WALES: Like Remarketing
and DoubleClick stuff.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.130
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Exactly.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:47.550
Right.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.360
Because we don't have the
full feature support for that.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.970
We don't want to have
somebody accidentally upgrade

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.730
their account to something
that they can't use.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.190
So for those properties, if
you don't see this today,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.992
don't worry.

00:08:58.992 --> 00:09:00.450
We're just ensuring
that there will

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.450
be no issues when we actually
do enable it for them.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.450
ANDREW WALES: Got it.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.960
And for accounts that
have a lot of users,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.100
how do you know if somebody
else may have already upgraded

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:10.684
your property?

00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:12.058
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
What you can do

00:09:12.058 --> 00:09:14.010
is always come into
the Property column.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.240
And you'll look at the
Universal Analytics Upgrade tab.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.310
And you'll always get
the status of where

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.810
you are, whether the transfer
is in progress, or if it hasn't

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.820
been done, or if it's complete.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.860
ANDREW WALES: So it's
in the Admin section.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.920
Look at the Property column,
Universal Analytics Upgrade

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.100
tab.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.448
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Exactly.

00:09:29.448 --> 00:09:30.030
Yeah.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.946
ANDREW WALES: So now
let's talk about step two

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.386
of the upgrade process, which
is actually updating your code.

00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:37.010
So you mentioned that
updating the code

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.386
is actually optional, right?

00:09:38.386 --> 00:09:39.760
Step one, transfer
your property.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.820
But step two is optional.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:41.820
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.070
ANDREW WALES: Why wouldn't
you update your code?

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.100
Or what do you get from
updating your code?

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.550
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.844
In Universal Analytics, when
we launched that, we also

00:09:49.844 --> 00:09:51.260
announced a new
tracking code that

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.090
works with Universal
Analytics, analytics.js.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.019
ANDREW WALES: For web.

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:56.310
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: For web, yes.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.010
And so the analytics.js
library is a lot more flexible

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.860
for developers.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.310
So if you are
customizing the code,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.360
it's a lot easier to customize.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.590
And there's a lot more
functionality built

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.380
to simplify the customization.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.230
So customization is a big thing.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.980
The second part of it
is for large websites.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.040
For example, with the
new tracking code,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.470
we only use one cookie.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.550
The old tracking code,
we used five cookies.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.310
And so because cookies are sent
with all the different requests

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.130
on the page, you actually can
reduce a significant amount

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.540
of bandwidth for
large sites as well.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.510
And finally, I think the
most important reason

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.285
is that we have a
bunch of new features

00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:36.420
we're working on with
Universal Analytics.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.230
We've announced
some, like User-ID.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.010
These type of features will
only work with the new tracking

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.770
code.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.610
And increasingly, we've
kind of have a team mandate

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.990
that all new features are built
only using Universal Analytics.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.420
So increasingly, we can't
talk about them here,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.830
but we are working on many
new features that will only

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.962
be supported by the new
Analytics.js tracking library.

00:10:55.962 --> 00:10:57.420
ANDREW WALES: So
if you want access

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.420
to the latest and
greatest stuff,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.410
use Analytics.js and
upgrade your code.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.849
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:11:02.849 --> 00:11:05.390
ANDREW WALES: Can you give us
just an overview of the changes

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.611
that you would need
to make as a developer

00:11:07.611 --> 00:11:10.110
if you kind of had a simple
site and a simple implementation

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.859
of ga.js.

00:11:10.859 --> 00:11:12.900
What would you need to do
to get to Analytics.js?

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.900
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Well,
the basic implementation

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.560
for Google Analytics
on a website

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.140
is to put a piece of JavaScript
on all the pages of your site.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.276
So that piece of JavaScript
has changed with Analytics.js.

00:11:24.276 --> 00:11:26.900
So at minimum, you'd have to go
through all the different pages

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.980
of your site and implement
the new tracking code.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.382
Replace the old
one with the new.

00:11:32.382 --> 00:11:34.340
Now for people who are
doing more sophisticated

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.440
integrations-- they have event
tracking, social interactions,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.980
e-commerce-- the actual tracking
interface, the actual methods

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.610
that you use on the
tracking code, have changed.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.340
So what you'll need to do
is update all the places

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.340
where you're calling the old
library with the new methods

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.110
that are corresponding
to the new library.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.970
ANDREW WALES: Got it.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.430
So for some people
with big sites,

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.764
this is actually a pretty
sizable amount of work, right?

00:11:58.764 --> 00:11:59.721
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Yeah.

00:11:59.721 --> 00:12:02.510
ANDREW WALES: Do they need to
update everything all at once?

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.250
Could you have on a
page some old ga.js code

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.180
and some new analytics.js code?

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.370
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Well,
that's a great question.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.494
So we've designed these
libraries to work together,

00:12:12.494 --> 00:12:13.790
but there are some caveats.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.810
So for a given
page, the tracking

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.690
works at a property ID.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:25.850
So this UA number, UAXXX-Y. And
so for one of those properties,

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.800
you can only use one tracking
mechanism on a given page.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.010
So either using analytics.js
or ga.js for a given page.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.500
Now across different pages, we
have made these libraries work

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.170
together.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.580
So you can have the
old tracking ga.js

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.280
code on 50% of pages
for one property.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.400
And for the other 50%, you could
have the new one, analytics.js,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.000
for the same property.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.530
So the problem
really arises when

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.460
you actually, for the same
property, on the same page,

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.746
use different libraries.

00:12:55.746 --> 00:12:58.120
ANDREW WALES: So for those
who are planning on retagging,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.450
you could plan to kind of
break it up into chunks.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.312
I'm going to retag
25% of my pages

00:13:02.312 --> 00:13:04.020
with analytics.js and
so forth and so on.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:04.320
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Exactly.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.190
Right.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.690
ANDREW WALES: The
problem comes when

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.320
you try to get down
on the page level

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.569
and say, some of the stuff
is going to be analytics.js

00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:12.065
on this page, the rest is ga.js.

00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:12.400
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.050
ANDREW WALES: That's not good.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.390
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.177
Exactly, yeah.

00:13:14.177 --> 00:13:15.510
And that's for a given property.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.320
Now of course, there's always
the sophisticated users

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.140
who are using
multiple properties

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.210
on the same page for rollup
reporting or something

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.890
like this.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.600
So if you have multiple
properties on the same page,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.400
you can use ga.js for one of
the properties and analytics.js

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.180
for the other property.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.530
The problem arises when it's the
same property on the same page

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.160
with two different
tracking codes.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.530
ANDREW WALES: Is there
any reason to dual tag

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.250
at this point?

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.333
We have the upgrade tools.

00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:44.970
So is there any reason
that you'd want to dual tag

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.246
your site completely with the
old code and the new code?

00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:50.120
Or is it just time to
switch over completely?

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.411
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: So dual
tagging, what a lot of people

00:13:52.411 --> 00:13:55.510
do is they'll have the old
legacy ga.js across their site.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.400
And then they'll create a new
Universal Analytics property.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.092
And then they'll
implement analytics.js

00:14:00.092 --> 00:14:01.550
with the new one
across their site.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.560
So you're tagging
with two properties

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.030
because we didn't have this
upgrade tool in the past.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.224
Now when people compare
the data between the two,

00:14:08.224 --> 00:14:09.890
they're always going
to see a difference

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:14.150
because the actual sequence of
when the actual requests are

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.720
sent, the hits are sent to
Google Analytics, differ.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.290
So we'll always never
see a difference.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.280
So what we recommend for all
users, now we have the upgrade,

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.930
is to actually go
through the upgrade.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.845
Don't dual tag.

00:14:24.845 --> 00:14:27.340
Don't create a new Universe
Analytics property.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.790
Rather, convert your existing
one to Universal Analytics.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.690
And that ensures that the
data is the most consistent.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.140
You have the historical data.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.270
And then make sure that you
don't have these kind of deltas

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.300
between the two tracking
codes because they're

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.510
firing at a different
rate in the browser.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.596
ANDREW WALES: That makes sense.

00:14:44.596 --> 00:14:46.970
So for those people who are
going to put this off-- which

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.440
I don't hold it against
them for putting it off.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.190
What happens if they
do nothing right now?

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.120
So you have ga.js
on your website.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.150
It's been working fine.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.130
Let's say you transfer
your property over,

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.550
but you don't actually
upgrade your code.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.470
What happens then?

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.303
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: So
once you've transferred

00:15:03.303 --> 00:15:04.890
to Universe Analytics,
you could still

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.170
send the data from the
old tracking library.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.660
That will continue to work.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.830
Over time, you'll see
that more features are

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.539
added to the
analytics.js library,

00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:14.330
so you won't get to
take advantage of them.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.390
But we'll still collect the
old data and process that.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.760
And we can look a little bit
into the timeline, kind of talk

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.439
about how this will work
out in the long term.

00:15:24.439 --> 00:15:25.480
ANDREW WALES: Let's move.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.931
So we just talked about websites
and code implementation issues

00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:29.430
there.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.060
Let's move to mobile apps.

00:15:35.972 --> 00:15:38.180
I think the users out there
who are using SDK version

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.514
1.0, that's really the library
that we're talking about.

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:41.930
Those are the
people who are going

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.030
to be upgrading, because
version 2.0 or higher

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.760
are already sending hits
to Universal Analytics.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.300
So for those users
using version 1.0,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.660
what does the upgrade
process look like for them?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.620
Is it kind of the
same thing as web?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.740
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: It's
similar, but it's different.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.380
So it's important for mobile
users to pay attention.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.390
Step one of transferring from
classic to Universal Analytics

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.830
continues to work.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.510
When you do the
transfer, you might

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.780
see some small
differences in the way

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.420
the sessions are calculated.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.719
You might have a lower
number of visits to the site.

00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:13.010
But there's no way around this.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.050
This is just the way
that we're changing

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.140
on how sessions are calculated
between the old classic

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.105
and then to the new
Universal Analytics.

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.720
So you might see
a slight decrease

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.450
in the number of visits
in your reporting profile.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.690
And that's for
transferring on step one.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.270
Once you complete
step one, you'll

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.280
continue to actually
view your data

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.840
in Google Analytics
as a web profile.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.610
Now when we introduced
app tracking last year,

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.210
we introduced a
brand new data model.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.800
New app tracking
Google Analytics.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.020
It was actually really based
on Universal Analytics,

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.760
but it also came with a new
app tracking data model.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.270
Now it's all around
screen views.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.540
And in metrics, that made
sense for applications.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.460
We also created a whole new set
of UI reports specific to apps.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.575
Now those work with
SDK 2.0 plus versions,

00:16:59.575 --> 00:17:01.260
but they don't work with v1.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.770
It's still using the
old page view tracking.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:08.500
So if you are using v1, you
have a couple of options.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.960
One is to continue
using the v1 SDK

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.710
and viewing your
reports in web profiles.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.339
It's the standard web profile.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.980
The second option you have is
you can actually upgrade to v2,

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.129
change all your code from
page tracking to app tracking.

00:17:22.129 --> 00:17:24.260
But today, if you view
that in Analytics,

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.859
you'll actually have to
create a new app profile.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.960
And all your data will
be in the app profile.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.380
So the issue it becomes is
that now all the new data

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.590
is in an app profile,
whereas all the old data is

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.720
in a web profile.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.330
And so the challenge with
that is that you actually

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.079
can't trend data over
time because they're

00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:39.380
in different profiles.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.305
So it leads to some
reporting challenges.

00:17:42.305 --> 00:17:43.180
ANDREW WALES: Got it.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.990
So if you want continuity
between the data,

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.940
you would complete step
one, transfer your property.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.950
Don't upgrade your code.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.022
Still use SDK v1, and keep
sending your hits there.

00:17:53.022 --> 00:17:55.480
And that will work fine, and
everything will be continuous,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.330
just like you'd expect.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.413
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:17:57.413 --> 00:18:00.340
ANDREW WALES: If you wanted to
get access to the new reporting

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.852
features for apps,
all the new stuff

00:18:01.852 --> 00:18:03.310
that we've launched
for apps, you'd

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.511
actually have to create a new
app profile or a new app view.

00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:08.760
And then upgrade your code
and send your data to that.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.610
And that causes the
break in continuity.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.370
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.110
ANDREW WALES: So it's
a bit of a trade-off.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.410
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: It's a bit
of a trade-off right now.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.300
This is something
that we're working on.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.490
So by all means, there's
no rush to actually retag

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.800
to version 2.0.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.950
But we do recommend at
least looking at step

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.822
one to transfer from classic to
Universal Analytics processing.

00:18:26.822 --> 00:18:28.780
ANDREW WALES: So step
one, everybody can do it.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.380
It's no problem.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:29.830
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Everybody
can do that today.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.205
It's the retagging where
there's a couple considerations.

00:18:37.641 --> 00:18:39.640
ANDREW WALES: So we've
covered step one and step

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.074
two of the upgrade process.

00:18:41.074 --> 00:18:43.365
I definitely wanted to ask
you more about the timeline,

00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:45.823
because I'm sure people are
going to be wondering when they

00:18:45.823 --> 00:18:48.590
need to actually do this stuff,
and what we're doing on our end

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.840
as well.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.690
So we've got four
phases in this timeline.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.590
This is actually unique because
we published our timeline.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.956
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:18:54.956 --> 00:18:55.975
Usually, we never
publish timelines.

00:18:55.975 --> 00:18:56.960
So this something--

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.160
ANDREW WALES: Being transparent.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.320
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
Pretty excited that-- we

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.900
try to be as
transparent as possible.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.847
ANDREW WALES: So
we got four phases.

00:19:01.847 --> 00:19:03.180
We're in the first phase, right?

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:03.490
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.140
ANDREW WALES: Can you walk us
through where we are right now

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.452
and where we're going?

00:19:06.452 --> 00:19:08.160
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: So
phase one was really

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.159
the launch and announcement
that we can actually

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:12.060
do this upgrade.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.630
Our goal at the
end of the day is

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.140
to transfer 100% of properties
from classic to Universal

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.460
Analytics, as well
as get everybody

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.650
to upgrade and to start only
building features on Universal

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.920
Analytics.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.990
So we announced the
upgrade so people

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.090
can migrate from the
classic to Universal

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.750
Analytics a couple
of months ago.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.160
So that's where we are.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.210
Phase two is that we realized
many people won't actually

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.420
go through this step
one, transferring.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.610
So what we plan
to do is to start

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.270
auto-transferring
properties from classic

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.542
to Universal Analytics.

00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:46.590
So what that means
is instead of the end

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.920
users going into the
interface and Admin Tool

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.270
and transferring, we'll
manually go in and set

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.530
that bit for them.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.040
And then over time,
their stuff will

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.135
be transferred on
the processing side.

00:19:56.135 --> 00:19:57.760
ANDREW WALES: So when
does that happen?

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.176
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
So we've started

00:19:59.176 --> 00:20:01.680
with some test accounts.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.290
We'll start ramping up probably
within the next month or so.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.650
To start with small
accounts-- accounts

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.880
that have a much lower risk
of having data quality issues.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.650
And then over time, as we
get full feature parity,

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.240
we'll then start ramping
that up to account the larger

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.440
accounts, accounts
with integrations,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.140
with AdSense, AdWords,
the DoubleClick.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.190
And finally, the premium
clients will be last in that.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.450
Now phase three is once we
have full feature support.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.670
So again, we're missing
some DoubleClick features.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.540
Today, Universal Analytics
is still in beta.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.850
And it doesn't have some
of the premium SLAs.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.050
So our goal is to have one
large announcement that actually

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.220
takes the Universal Analytics
out of beta, has 100%

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.040
feature support, full
SLA, and the goal

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.560
is to do that early next year.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.510
So once we do that
phase three, we'll

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.780
be ramping up this
auto-transferring

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.110
of properties much more.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.240
We'll be doing more at a time.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.730
Our final end goal, once we've
reached 100% of properties

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.270
transferred to
Universal Analytics,

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.980
is to then enter phase four,
which Universal Analytics

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.590
becomes the default
of Google Analytics.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.560
They become the same thing.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.510
At that point, we will actually
announce the deprecation

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.725
of the old tracking code, ga.js,
as well some of the features

00:21:18.725 --> 00:21:20.800
and custom variables.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.830
And so the announcement
of the deprecation

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.500
really means we'll continue to
accept and process the data,

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.940
but we'll do so for a
minimum of two years.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.075
So after two years,
we'll revisit

00:21:32.075 --> 00:21:33.700
whether we want to
continue doing that,

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.660
or we want to make sure
that everybody upgrades

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.755
to the new tracking code.

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:37.870
ANDREW WALES: Got it.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.360
So auto-transferring.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.200
Nobody's going to be
auto-transferred who

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.490
is using a feature that we
don't yet support, right?

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.880
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.340
ANDREW WALES: We're waiting
until we have support,

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.770
and then we'll start
moving those accounts.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.000
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.060
A lot of people had
concern about that.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.330
We're completely taking
that into account.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.150
We're being very cautious
on who we transfer.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.010
And only once we have full
feature support and everything

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.450
works well, will we then
start doing it more broadly.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.200
ANDREW WALES: And it
sounds like from what

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.945
you were saying, when
we get to phase four

00:22:04.945 --> 00:22:07.590
and we announce the
deprecation of ga.js,

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.450
there's going to be
a minimum two years.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.533
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:22:10.533 --> 00:22:12.430
ANDREW WALES: So
from today, you've

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.275
got two years plus
of using ga.js.

00:22:14.275 --> 00:22:15.650
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
Of using ga.js.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.108
ANDREW WALES: And
we'll support it.

00:22:17.108 --> 00:22:19.740
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: We'll
continue to support it.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.280
There is kind of a nuance there.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.450
Some of the more
power users are using

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.580
a feature called
Custom Variables.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.297
Custom Variables was
available in ga.js.

00:22:28.297 --> 00:22:29.880
In analytics.js, we
have something new

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.420
called Custom Dimensions.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.060
And there is really no
migration between the two.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.580
That being said, if you are
sending Custom Variables

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.060
and you do transfer processing
to Universe Analytics,

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.830
we'll continue to process
the Custom Variables

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.692
in Universal Analytics
as a legacy feature.

00:22:46.692 --> 00:22:48.400
ANDREW WALES: But you
wouldn't get access

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.335
to Customer Dimensions unless
you upgraded your code.

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:52.293
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Unless
you upgraded the code.

00:22:55.315 --> 00:22:56.690
ANDREW WALES:
Well, we've covered

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.340
step one and two of the upgrade,
as well as the timeline.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.465
I just wanted to quick give
everyone some resources

00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:06.610
that you can go to after
watching this video.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.274
So if you want to learn
more about how to upgrade,

00:23:09.274 --> 00:23:11.440
we have this whole upgrade
center that we published.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.950
It's at
 developers.google.com/analytics/upgrade.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.670
You can go there, and it
covers migration paths

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.730
for whatever library
you're using.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.492
We've documented how
to upgrade from there.

00:23:23.492 --> 00:23:24.700
So definitely check that out.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.850
If you have any other
questions on top of that,

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.180
we have a UA upgrade forum
that you can check out.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.180
And the link is
here on this slide.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.680
And as I mentioned
at the beginning,

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.650
we're also going to be doing
a follow-up Q&amp;A session.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.520
So if you have any questions
that we didn't cover today,

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.010
and I'm sure there
are a bunch out there,

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.690
definitely post your questions
for our Google Moderator.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.980
And we should have a link
to that below this video.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.090
So definitely do that.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.160
And we'll be back in about
a month, give or take.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.590
And we'll answer those
questions and hopefully

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.864
some more as well.

00:23:57.864 --> 00:23:58.780
Thanks for joining us.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.113
This has been "Behind the
Code," all about the Universal

00:24:01.113 --> 00:24:02.670
Analytics Upgrade.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.260
Check us out on G+ as well.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.020
Feel free, as I said,
to check out our Upgrade

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.860
Center as well if you
want to learn more.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.720
We'll catch you next time.
