00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:01.563
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.563 --> 00:00:03.504
is give ourselves a little bit of a tour

00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:05.171
of eukaryotic cells.

00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:07.647
And the first place to start

00:00:07.647 --> 00:00:08.945
is just to remind ourselves

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:11.956
what it means for a cell to be eukaryotic.

00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:15.276
It means that inside the cell,

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:18.341
there are membrane-bound organelles.

00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:19.833
Now, what does that mean?

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:23.984
Well, you could view it as
sub-compartments within the cell.

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:26.151
Membrane-bound organelles.

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:29.401
And in this video in particular,

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:30.578
we're going to highlight

00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:32.839
some of these membrane-bound organelles

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.280
that make the cells eukaryotic.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.091
So let's just start with
some of the ingredients

00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:39.319
that we know is true of all cells.

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:42.871
So you'll have your
cellular membrane here.

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:44.820
I drew it big, so that
we have a lot of space

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.320
to draw things in.

00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:50.257
So this is our cellular membrane.

00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:52.135
I'll do some nice shading

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.413
so you appreciate that it'll
actually be three-dimensional.

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:56.143
We see so many slices of cells

00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:59.475
that sometimes we forget
that they are more spherical,

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:02.329
or that they have
three-dimensional shape to them.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.329
They're not all spherical.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.793
They can have different shapes.

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:07.126
Now all cells, and there
are some exceptions

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:08.936
that we've talked about
in previous videos.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.209
I should say, most cells

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:12.671
will have some genetic information in them

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.254
in the form of DNA.

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:19.524
So that is our DNA, right over there.

00:01:19.524 --> 00:01:22.962
Now, one of the key characteristics
of a eukaryotic cell

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:24.965
is that the genetic information

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:28.880
is going to be inside a
membrane-bound organelle.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.462
And that membrane-bound organelle,

00:01:30.462 --> 00:01:34.398
or the membrane that
surrounds the DNA here,

00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:36.815
that is the nuclear membrane.

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:41.167
So let me draw the nuclear
membrane right over here,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.534
and I'll put some shading
in to appreciate that that

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:48.232
also is going to be in three
dimensions, around the DNA.

00:01:48.232 --> 00:01:52.370
So that is the first
membrane-bound organelle

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.000
that we're gonna discuss, the nucleus.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.938
Now the nucleus, it turns out,

00:01:57.938 --> 00:02:01.506
is connected to another
membrane-bound organelle.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:04.026
And we're gonna study
this in future videos,

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:06.151
but right here I'm drawing holes or pores

00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:07.742
in the nuclear membrane.

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:10.280
And those pores connect to something,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.509
it's a very fancy word called
the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.214
And the endoplasmic reticulum

00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:19.886
is essentially these
layers of these membranes.

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:21.488
So I'm gonna do my best job

00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:24.492
at trying to draw an
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:27.583
Imagine extending from these pores,

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:32.018
going into a space that has
really these layered membranes

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.899
that have a lot of surface area.

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.860
And I'm not gonna go all
the way around this nucleus,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.742
but in many cells it will go around,

00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:40.106
all the way around the nucleus.

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:44.772
And this right over here, and
this is just a rough diagram.

00:02:44.772 --> 00:02:48.022
That is our endoplasmic, endoplasmic...

00:02:49.722 --> 00:02:51.972
Not blasmic, endoplasmic...

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.458
Endoplasmic reticulum,

00:02:56.423 --> 00:02:58.466
which I've mentioned in previous videos

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:00.844
would be an excellent name for a band.

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:03.238
And what goes on in the
endoplasmic reticulum

00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:05.687
is when you are in the process

00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:09.263
of taking that genetic
information from DNA,

00:03:09.263 --> 00:03:10.539
and as we talk about in other videos

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.039
it gets transcribed into mRNA.

00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:18.574
So that mRNA is now
containing that information.

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:22.278
That mRNA will make its way
out of that nuclear membrane

00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:23.857
through one of these pores,

00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:25.816
and then make its way to a ribosome

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:27.642
that is attached to the membrane

00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.975
of the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.193
And so that's a ribosome there.

00:03:32.193 --> 00:03:34.849
I'm gonna do a bunch of ribosomes.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.185
And so as we've talked
about in previous videos,

00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:39.530
ribosomes are really where you take

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.061
that genetic information from that mRNA,

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:45.252
and then you translate it into a protein.

00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:47.785
So the ribosomes are
the protein synthesis,

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:49.376
so let me label that.

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:52.543
So this right over here is a ribosome.

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:55.340
And some ribosomes

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.851
might be attached to the
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.406
Some of them might just be floating

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:01.016
out here in the cytoplasm,

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:04.225
so that would be a free ribosome.

00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:05.392
Free ribosome.

00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:07.986
And even from the point of view

00:04:07.986 --> 00:04:09.653
of the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:04:09.653 --> 00:04:11.489
the parts of the endoplasmic reticulum

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.012
where you have ribosomes attached,

00:04:14.012 --> 00:04:18.517
this is known as rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:20.972
It's the ribosomes that
are making them rough.

00:04:20.972 --> 00:04:22.673
It looks that way in a microscope.

00:04:22.673 --> 00:04:24.550
So I'll just say rough ER,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.712
for endoplasmic reticulum for short.

00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:28.803
And then you also have parts
of the endoplasmic reticulum

00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:31.621
where you do not have ribosomes attached.

00:04:31.621 --> 00:04:34.318
And because that looks smooth
through our microscope,

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:36.559
it has been called, you can imagine,

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.976
smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

00:04:43.763 --> 00:04:46.427
There are things known as golgi bodies.

00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:48.645
Once again, another fascinating name.

00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:50.440
You gotta love these names in biology.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.054
That look kind of like
an endoplasmic reticulum,

00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:56.679
but detached from the nuclear membrane.

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:58.896
So let's say it's something like that.

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:01.056
That's my best drawing there.

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:02.723
That's a golgi body.

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:07.464
And these are really good
at packaging molecules,

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:09.635
even proteins that might've
just been produced,

00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:11.981
and packaging them so
that they can be used

00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:14.485
outside of the cell, for example.

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.741
And we'll go into detail in other videos,

00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.633
where a protein might
go to the golgi body,

00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:20.358
get a little envelope around it,

00:05:20.358 --> 00:05:22.332
get some little processing going on,

00:05:22.332 --> 00:05:25.553
and then make its way outside of a cell.

00:05:25.553 --> 00:05:26.655
Now another,

00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:28.337
and this is maybe one of the most famous

00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:31.307
membrane-bound organelles
outside of the nucleus,

00:05:31.307 --> 00:05:33.992
is what's known as the
powerhouse of the cell,

00:05:33.992 --> 00:05:36.071
and that is the mitochondria.

00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:38.695
So I'll draw this mitochondria in magenta,

00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:41.261
because that's a nice powerful color.

00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:42.720
So mitochondria.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.032
And I love mitochondria

00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:46.101
because it's fascinating
how they even came to be.

00:05:46.101 --> 00:05:48.978
Mitochondria actually have their own DNA,

00:05:48.978 --> 00:05:51.660
and all of your mitochondrial
DNA comes from your mother.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.999
So that's actually very interesting

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:55.715
for tracing maternal lineage.

00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:58.246
But mitochondria, this is where your,

00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:00.102
I'm gonna say let's see what
we could see inside of this.

00:06:00.102 --> 00:06:02.171
This is where you ATP is produced.

00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:04.547
This is your mitochondria.

00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:06.745
It's really the powerhouse of the cell.

00:06:06.745 --> 00:06:08.057
What's interesting about mitochondria

00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:09.775
is evolutionary biologists believe

00:06:09.775 --> 00:06:12.190
that the ancestors of mitochondria,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.199
because mitochondria have their own DNA,

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.100
they might've been independent
organisms, independent cells.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.468
And at some point in
our evolutionary past,

00:06:20.468 --> 00:06:22.627
they started living in symbiosis

00:06:22.627 --> 00:06:26.794
inside of what would be
the ancestors of our cells.

00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:30.058
And over time, they became so codependent

00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:32.563
that they started to replicate together.

00:06:32.563 --> 00:06:33.970
And mitochondria, in fact,

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.523
became part of these eukaryotic cells.

00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:40.687
Now if this eukaryotic
cell was a plant cell

00:06:40.687 --> 00:06:43.328
or maybe an algae cell,

00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:46.323
you would have something
called chloroplasts there.

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:48.599
We don't have them because
we don't have photosynthesis,

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:50.351
but this is a chloroplast.

00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:51.455
And if you could see inside,

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:55.018
you could see the little
thylakoid stacks right over here.

00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:57.872
You could see the thylakoids
if you could see inside.

00:06:57.872 --> 00:07:00.889
And so this right over
here is a chloroplast.

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:01.889
Chloroplast.

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.418
And this would be plants and algae.

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.389
Animals do not have these.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.550
And these are where you have
your photosynthesis take place.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.800
Photosynthesis.

00:07:15.266 --> 00:07:17.724
Now there's also some
membrane-bound organelles

00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:20.524
that are maybe less famous
than the mitochondria

00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:23.691
or the chloroplast, or
for sure the nucleus,

00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.490
and that might be
something like a vacuole.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.090
And in plants, vacuoles
tend to be very big.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.486
I could draw it, this is three-dimensional

00:07:31.486 --> 00:07:34.142
so I'll draw it on top of
something that I've drawn before.

00:07:34.142 --> 00:07:37.721
So if a vacuole right
over here, this is a...

00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:38.777
And in a plant

00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:40.461
it could be a fairly
significant compartment inside.

00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.689
And in fact, it can even give
structure to the plant itself

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:45.009
because it is so big.

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:48.065
And it contains water and enzymes.

00:07:48.065 --> 00:07:51.127
It's viewed as kind of
a storage compartment.

00:07:51.127 --> 00:07:55.178
But it can also contain enzymes
that help digest things,

00:07:55.178 --> 00:07:57.025
that help break things down

00:07:57.025 --> 00:07:59.709
so that they can be used in some way.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:02.274
So that is a vacuole.

00:08:02.274 --> 00:08:03.700
And they don't just exist in plants.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.058
They can also exist in animal cells.

00:08:06.058 --> 00:08:10.214
But in plant cells, they can
be very, very, very visible.

00:08:10.214 --> 00:08:12.107
Now, something that is somewhat related

00:08:12.107 --> 00:08:14.392
to some of the function
that a vacuole plays,

00:08:14.392 --> 00:08:16.115
that are most associated with animal cells

00:08:16.115 --> 00:08:17.249
but now there's evidence

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:18.982
that they also exist in plant cells,

00:08:18.982 --> 00:08:20.956
is the idea of a lysosome.

00:08:20.956 --> 00:08:23.456
So a lysosome right over here,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.232
that also is a compartment.

00:08:27.232 --> 00:08:30.720
And it's going to contain a
whole series of enzymes in it

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.247
that is useful for lysing, you could say,

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.311
that is useful for breaking down

00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:39.171
either waste products as the cell lives,

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.589
or even foreign substances

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:42.771
that might not be helpful for the cells.

00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:45.031
So it's gonna contain a bunch of enzymes,

00:08:45.031 --> 00:08:47.346
and it helps break down things.

00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:48.971
Now, I'll leave you there.

00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:52.048
These aren't all of the
structures in eukaryotic cells,

00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:53.673
but these are enough of the structures

00:08:53.673 --> 00:08:54.962
so that you can appreciate

00:08:54.962 --> 00:08:58.509
that there are a lot of
membrane-bound organelles

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:00.860
in eukaryotic cells.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.538
And to be clear, even if I were to show

00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:04.236
all of the membrane-bound structures,

00:09:04.236 --> 00:09:06.359
that's not all the complexity of the cell.

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:07.579
The big thing to appreciate

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:09.486
is that cells are incredibly complex.

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:11.189
There's all sorts of structures in here

00:09:11.189 --> 00:09:14.234
that help transport things
and move things around.

00:09:14.234 --> 00:09:17.783
If you could shrink yourself
down and look inside of a cell,

00:09:17.783 --> 00:09:21.568
it would look more complex
than the most complex cities.

00:09:21.568 --> 00:09:23.449
There's all sorts of activities,

00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:25.659
things being moved
around, shuttled around.

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:29.200
The cell itself is replicating
and copying things.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.162
And so this is just the beginning.

00:09:31.162 --> 00:09:33.110
We're just starting to scratch the surface

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.193
of the complexity of the
most basic unit of life.
