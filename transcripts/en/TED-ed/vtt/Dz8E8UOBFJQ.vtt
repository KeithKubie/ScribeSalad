00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We all know the scene: Dorothy closes her eyes,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.631
and repeats the Good Witch's mantra,

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:22.431
"No coordinates exist like one's domicile,

00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:24.780
no coordinates exist like one's domicile,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.293
no coordinates exist like one's domicile."

00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:32.000
Only Dorothy doesn't say that. She says five one-syllable words,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
"There's no place like home."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Each a word you probably learned in your first year of speaking,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.109
each perfectly concise.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.458
It's not that L. Frank Baum didn't have a thesaurus,

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:47.674
it's that in most cases $10 words fail.

00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:49.427
Would Aerosmith have had a hit with

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:51.358
"Ambulate This Direction?"

00:00:51.358 --> 00:00:53.000
Probably not.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.362
Would Patrick Henry have ignited a revolution by saying,

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:59.000
"Provide me with liberty or bestow upon me fatality?"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.128
Unlikely.

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:04.367
When it comes to words, bigger isn't always better.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:08.000
Ten-dollar words are rendered worthless if they're not understood.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.545
That's not to say every piece of literature

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:12.927
should be written at a fourth-grade reading level,

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:15.794
but it is important to know your audience.

00:01:15.794 --> 00:01:18.562
If you're a novelist, your audience is probably expecting

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:21.214
300 pages of vivid descriptors.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.000
At the very least, they're expecting

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you won't use the same 50 words to fill those pages.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But most of us don't have the luxury of a captive audience.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We're competing against a whole world of distractions

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and we're fighting for space in an attention span

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that continues to shrink across generations.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.161
So get to the point already.

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:44.071
Variety may be the spice of life, but brevity is its bread and butter.

00:01:44.086 --> 00:01:45.924
So when it comes to $10 words,

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:49.873
save your money and buy a Scrabble board.
