00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.730
[techno sounds]

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.730
[clang]

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.730
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hello everyone.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.730
My name is Reto Meier and welcome to This
Week in Android Development for September

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.170
24, 2012.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.430
Last week on Android Developers Live, stop
watch and timer apps were the target of Android

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.330
Design in Action, hosted by Nick and Adam.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.789
Live from New York and London.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.080
What happens when you apply the holo theme
to the skeuomorphic classic hybrid stopwatch

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
and timer?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900
Check out the video to find out.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.289
Last Thursday the path of the space shuttle
Endeavor's final flight took it almost directly

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.039
above our Mountain View studio.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.349
While our colleagues were out experiencing
this unique moment in space exploration history,

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.190
Ian and I were here in the studio, broadcasting
a premier episode of Android Developers Strike

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.190
Back.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.219
Our stopwatch and timer app clinic patients
joined us via Hangout to tell us exactly what

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.850
we could do with our helpful feedback.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.410
Check out the video to learn how much of it
was anatomically possible.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.590
As usual we rounded off the week with our
review shows.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.280
On the Friday Games Review, viewers wept as
Koh Kim was absent once more and Dan Galpin's

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.450
headwear was joined by the inimitable Ian
Ni-Lewis, Esquire.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.420
For a review of the selection of games as
chosen by you.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.079
Then on the App Clinic, I slipped on my thrift
store skinny jeans to put camera and photography

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.810
apps to the test with Ian.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.960
Who, based on the number of shows he co-hosted
may or may not be living out of our studio.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.020
All of last week's broadcasts and all the
schedules for this week's shows are available

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.260
from Google Developers Live.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.980
That's developers.google.com/live/android.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.010
It's the end of quarter and our team has objectives
and key results to achieve.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.070
So there are eight shows scheduled this week,
including a full roster of Office Hours.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.410
Starting with ADL+, live from Hong Kong on
Tuesday afternoon.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.270
On Wednesday join Nick and Rich for their
weekly European Office Hours Live from London.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.500
Also on Wednesday, we've invited accessibility
guru T.V. Raman to join Trevor and Joe for

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.690
our U.S. Office Hours Q and A session.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.760
On Thursday Bruno will be hosting his bi-weekly
Portuguese language edition of Android Developers

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.760
Live.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.490
Bruno assures us he's talking about Android,
but for all I know he could be offering cooking

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.490
tips and marital advice.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.840
So if you speak Portuguese, tune in and let
us know exactly what Bruno's been broadcasting.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.850
Roman is back from his stay at the shore this
week and will be joining Nick and Adam for

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.400
Android Design in Action this Tuesday at 10:30
a.m.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.710
Eastern Time.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.240
Live from the style capitals of New York and
London.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.510
This week the guys are performing an extreme
makeover on Flickrview or Glimmer and classic

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.000
camera replacement app, Camera Zoom fx.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.060
Find out what the developers of these fine
apps think about their extreme makeovers on

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.640
Thursday when we invite them and the other
camera app clinic patients to join us for

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.300
Developers Strike Back.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.879
Join us live as these developers tell us a
little bit more about their apps, what they've

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.700
got planned, and what we can do with our feedback
in the future.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.130
I'm planning a holiday to Hawaii later this
year so we're holding a travel planning and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.170
booking app clinic at our new regular time
of 10:30 a.m.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.489
Pacific, this Friday.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.450
Use the Moderator page link here to nominate
the apps you'll be using to plan your winter

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.769
escape this holiday season.

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.019
Then at 12, join Dan's hat and whoever is
sitting underneath it for another episode

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.769
of the Friday Games Review.

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.330
Will Koh be able to pry Ian from the co-host's
chair?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.870
Will Dan's hat become self-aware and start
hosting the show itself?

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.269
Tune in this Friday to find out.

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.319
And hit up the Moderator page to nominate
the games you'd like to see us review.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.099
In other Android development news last week,
if you've used ADT to create a new Android

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.209
project, you've probably noticed the template
options available for deciding what type of

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.359
UI you'd like to start with.

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.170
If you ever wanted to build your own application
templates, we've now published formal documentations

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.420
on the template format and syntax alongside
the official templates.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.609
Right in the Android Opensource Project.

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.950
In new and updated apps, popular social productivity
app Do launched this week.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.360
As did Bloomburg Radio Plus, providing you
with 24 hour live streaming and on-demand

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.340
listening for your finance and economics reporting
needs.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.769
If you've got a tablet, the Glue Society presents
Watch With Mother, an app that includes six

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.390
episodes of horror comedy for your viewing
pleasure.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.499
In great news for news fans, the Times has
launched a tablet optimized layout of their

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:25.620
popular news apps.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.129
And finally, from my Aussie compatriots, if
you're banking with ANZ, the new app ANZgoMoney

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.290
gives you access to all your banking needs
direct from your mobile.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.859
That's all for this week in Android Development.

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:35.950
My name is Reto Meier.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.670
Thanks for watching.
