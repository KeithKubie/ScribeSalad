Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience with all this martial arts skill Gwadar yeah, but fatal is big fate or might have like a gut, but he's a thick motherfucker. Okay. Young fade or you ever see young fade or when he was in his prime, like back when he fought like Fujita like back when, uh, this is there's a picture of fate or standing around with a bunch of kettlebells ever see that picture? Nope. I was Fade Orleans lifting days, I suspect. And this is coming from, that's, that's one when fader was fairly young up there, but that's a, that's not the one I'm talking about. You know the one with the kettlebells is that picture up? See we found that picture never a six pack in sight. No, no six pack. But um, I suspect fade or might have been on some performance enhancing substances during his prime. You mean like hard training?

Speaker 1:          00:55          Lots of drilling technique. Uh, set of steroids. Steroids. How dare you sir. Dude, he was in pride. Everybody was on steroids. Yeah, that's him. Look at him. That's him in his prime. That's a big mother fucker. Now, I do not know if he was on anything, but everybody else was, I mean, literally everybody, if they had it in their contract that you, we will not test for steroids. You know, Ensign Nua told me that they like essentially encouraged people to take steroids. Yeah. The pride days. That's right. Yeah. And it's not like Russians don't have a long history of using performance enhancing substances. You, I'm sure you saw that movie. Um, ICARUS. Did you see it? Yup. Fascinating. Right. It's, it's a, it's fascinating. I mean, I don't, uh, steroids often feel to me like a bit of a witch hunt. Uh, oftentimes you assume people are on steroids.

Speaker 1:          01:48          I'm a bit of a, maybe I'm naive or an optimist, but I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise. But it, Chris obviously proves, yeah, that everybody kind of throws a monkey wrench of those gears. But you know, with a, with fatal, the technique and that technique, the execution at the timing that brilliant civil government, no doubt the heart. Now he's phenomenal. Yeah. I just want to, if not the greatest heavyweight of all time, he certainly one of them. And I don't think steroids would help that. Yes, they do. To help. Okay. Yeah. They held that guy particular yeah. They help everything. They help your training, they help you build your ability to recover. They help your explosive power, they help your speed, they help everything that, but they also, it's not just steroids, like a lot of them on EPO, Epo, radically in enhances your endurance. Um, and they're starting to catch people need they just a stripped Tj Dillashaw the UFC bantamweight champion for star for a EPO or other, it's tragic. Yes, it is tragic. Especially Tj, you mean he's a, just a phenomenal fighter. If not, I mean certainly top 10 pound for pound and then this is one of those things that comes up and you go, Oh man,

Speaker 2:          03:00          so legacy killer and this world, we have to kind of reconsider what kind of a, what should be allowed or not. Yeah, no, I agree with that. That there, there is an idea of where you should make stair was legal right? Or not legal. Sorry. Ah, a lot or some kind of supplementation. Like where's the line? When you, when you start to talk about the future of martial arts, the future sport, if you can control the levels so that they're healthy. I mean, isn't that the reason that they're not allowed is because if abused, they become unhealthy. Uh, they damaged longterm wellbeing of the person.

Speaker 1:          03:35          There's, look, if that was the case, we wouldn't allow fighting because fighting is more damaging than steroids for sure. For sure. Getting punched and kicked and fucking need in the face and elbowed into consciousness that is way worse for you than steroids. They're there. The concern is not for the athlete, the concerns for the opponent. Um, the idea is that you will be able to inflict punishment that you would not ordinarily be able to inflict. You will have more endurance. You have more power. You will hurt someone potentially even. Look, there's going to be a time where someone dies in a mixed martial arts in that, and if that's someone who was the victor who did not die, it was on steroids. It is going to be a huge national tragedy and a massive disaster for the sport, for everything. If that ever does happen, we can only hope it never does, but for sure you know, it's a, it's a very, very dangerous game you're playing and when you are, martial arts is a very dangerous game and when you were enhancing your body with chemicals that are illegal while you're doing that game, the real question is though, here's my take on it and this is, it's one of the most human subjects and B being meaning, meaning that it's messy.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Humans are messy, like there's good and there's bad. You know, look like abortion is a messy subject. It's messy. You know, whether you have the, whether you agree with someone's right to have it or not, it is. What you're doing is, especially as the fetus gets older, it's messy. You know, when it's a complicated discussion, it's not a clear, it's not like you should drink water. You know what I mean? It's like, it's a very complicated discussion. Steroids are a very complicated discussion. You're not allowed to do them, but they exist for a reason. The reason why they exist is there really effective, they're really effective at enhancing your body. But how much of that will we allow? We allow creatine, we allow supplements in terms of, you know, there's uh, there's certain things that can slightly elevate your testosterone slightly elevate your growth hormone. We allow sauna and ice baths and all these things that have shown to enhance recovery. But that's, that's too much. It's too good there too effective. But it's weird. It's weird that this thing that we found that makes you better,

Speaker 2:          05:58          you can't use. Yeah. And so I have to go back a little bit and disagree with you on something. So in terms of fighting being dangerous, and that's if we wanted to forbid things that are dangerous for you would forbid fighting. I think the main thing you're doing can be dangerous, right? The main thing that we're talking about, the sport, the combat event, that can be dangerous because that is what we watch two people at the height of their skill, ability, heart, passion, putting their life at risk. That can be dangerous, but the supplementation around it, the way to make it, uh, to make their training better, more effective, that can be dangerous. And I thought that can't be named, can't be dangerous. So I thought steroids were considered what sort of band? Because abuses lead to longterm damage to health. Now we see steroids as cheating, but it was banned initially because it has detrimental effects. Your that's true.

Speaker 1:          06:59          No, because there's no real evidence that it's detrimental. It's not as detrimental as alcohol when you allow people to drink bit, even a bit even when abused where the bodies, like there's, there's not a lot of like there's a great documentary on it called bigger, stronger, faster. And uh, it's by my friend Chris Bell. And when you watched that documentary and you realize like, oh, well the real negative consequences of taking steroids or that it shuts down your endocrine system, so it stops your body's natural production of testosterone and growth hormone and hormones. That's the real problem. And for young people that can be very devastating and it can lead to depression and suicidal thoughts and all, all, all sorts of really bad things when your testosterone shuts down. But as far as like death boy, I mean there's, people are prescribed pain pills every day of the week and fighters that are on injuries, uh, that have been, you know, that have gotten surgery, they, they're prescribed pain pills everyday of the week and those pain pills kill people left and right. That's just a fact. People die of those things all the time, much more so than die of steroids. So I'm not advocating for the use of steroids. Right? I'm just, um, I'm, I'm being pretty objective and neutral about this, but I'm just looking at it like it is a, it's a very messy

Speaker 2:          08:18          the subject. Yeah, that's very eloquently put. But so, so you're a problem in terms of damaging the opponent is if one side takes Taro, isn't that does exactly what happens if both the problem you require

Speaker 1:          08:29          someone to do that maybe someone's a holistic person. They don't want to introduce any unnatural exogenous steroids into their body. And hormones in their body. They want, they want everything to be produced by the human body. They want to, they want to eat healthy food, train hard, sleep well, and compete naturally. Yeah. At CT Fletcher here yesterday, right? Yes. Is natural bodybuilder or not bodybuilders and power lifters. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's not required, right? This is, you're not requiring people, you're giving them the choice. So, you know, it's an interesting possibility where in moderation you'll be able to last steroids and future of athletics because with an argument that if him and done in moderation, you can actually create healthier athletes. Yeah. That's, I mean that's a real argument for the Tour de France, the Tour de France, they say that you actually are better off in healthier taking steroids.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Yeah. And Epo. Then you are doing it without it. Cause it's so unbelievable. You're ruling on the body. Yeah. I mean those athletes are basically some of the best people in the world at suffering. Yeah. Longterm suffering. It's incredible. Yeah. Ultra marathon runners, all those guys. It's incredibly different sort of thing. You know? And you know the thing about ultra marathon runners is didn't even test him cause they're like, good luck. Good luck. Those people have iron. Will's like Courtney do. Walter's a woman who, you know, she is. Yeah, she's been in here. She eats candy. Just drinks, beer, eat candy and pizza. Makes Sense. Yeah. I mean she just got fucking iron will or her will is indomitable and you could take all the steroids you want when you're running for three days. That chick is going to beat you. She just doesn't know how to quit. Yeah. Just has no quit in. Did you see the podcast with her where she talked about how she fell? She couldn't see. She was in experiencing, uh, I think it was inner ocular hemorrhaging. Yeah. So her, her eyeballs were bleeding internally, something like that where it was impeding her vision. She couldn't see, I would stop. I would stop running. No, she fell because you couldn't see, busted her head open, bleeding all down. Her face keeps running. Barely, barely can see her feet as she's running, keeps running. I'm glad those people are out there.
