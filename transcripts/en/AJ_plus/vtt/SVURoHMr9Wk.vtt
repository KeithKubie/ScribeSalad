00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Getting to the end of Project Runway,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.332
they start to eliminate people.

00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:05.165
[Clip]: "Auf Wiedersehen."

00:00:05.173 --> 00:00:07.220
Margarita got eliminated,
so it's three left:

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.630
Kentaro, Me, and Brandon.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.960
Brandon is like the
sweetheart, the whole season.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.347
And so, Brandon gets eliminated.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:17.056
Holy crap... Are they gonna give it to me?

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.470
I grew up in a very small, tight knit

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.950
Muslim community in upstate New York.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.290
I'm number eight of eleven children.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.240
We were poor, so all of my
clothing was hand-me-downs

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.900
from my older sisters, so I
would put my own spin on things.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.530
Cut hem lines, add
ruffles, or what have you.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.380
I actually sold my first garment
when I was ten years old.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.720
I was definitely a little
kid fashion designer.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.060
And being a quiet child, I
just found that to be a way

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.363
that I could scream really, really loudly.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.660
I guess I was like, Muslim,
and so I had to get married.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.090
I was 19 when I met him,
20 when I married him,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.610
he had just gotten a new job,
and I ended up leaving school

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.563
and I moved to Tennessee.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.510
I was scared, I was sad,
and I was not fulfilled

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.550
because I wasn't doing
something that I loved.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.060
I had a gift and, you know,
I wasn't in the driver's seat

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.368
of my life and it was
really tough when I...

00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:23.030
I know it's just sewing, but
honestly, it's the one thing

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.610
that I do that know what
the outcome will be.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.555
I'm sorry!

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.200
(Ayana cries)

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.463
I didn't plan to cry, sorry!

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.500
And so, my husband and I
weren't on the same page

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.083
and we eventually got divorced.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.140
I was supposed to be studying
anatomy and physiology,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.090
but I was actually watching
YouTube videos, and I came

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.560
across a designer named Rabia
Z and her work was so good.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.210
I decided, actually at that
moment, that I was gonna get

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.300
in the driver's seat,
pursue my design degree,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.717
and I was gonna take control.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480
Project Runway was the biggest

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.063
emotional roller coaster of my life.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.860
One second, you're super excited,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.570
and the next second, you're so scared.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.130
Like, I need Tim Gunn to love
me, that's very important.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.830
These are the people that
you want to critique you,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.870
because what they say
goes, in the fashion world.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.670
When Project Runway shared
our pictures of the cast,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.864
one comment was like, "Oh,
if she puts that symbol"

00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:29.561
"of male oppression on the
girls, then I'm not watching!"

00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:31.686
"This is not Project
Runway International,"

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:32.935
"what is going on?"

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:35.360
I thought to myself, like,
"that's what they're saying now,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.438
but when they see how well
I've kicked butt on the season,

00:02:38.438 --> 00:02:40.863
it's going to shut them
all up", and it did.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.740
The very first challenge, I
wanted it to be very, very

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.420
apparent who was in the building.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.646
And just seeing her, you
know, walking down the runway,

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:52.132
she's wearing her hijab,
it's trailing behind her,

00:02:52.132 --> 00:02:55.480
she's got that Project
Runway sign behind her,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.600
moments like these are so meaningful.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.250
[Clip]: "Ayana you are the
winner of this challenge!"

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.160
I learned so much during that time,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.700
you know, to step out and to just be free.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.310
Making some really outlandish things,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.940
to follow a certain guideline of dress,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.240
but at the same time, be fashion forward,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.120
and be trendy and feel
young and feel beautiful.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.173
The judges loved it.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.470
I had, you know, older
women, young women, coming up

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.940
to me and saying, you know,
"Thank you, we love this!",

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.600
or "Just please keep pushing
forward, we really need this!"

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.520
I was just doing me, I
was having a great time,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.592
and it just so happened
that I was a Muslim girl.

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:32.810
[Clip]: (cheering)

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.951
Fast forward to New York Fashion Week

00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:36.267
New York Fashion Week!

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.600
Tim Gunn and me, watching
my work on the screen.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.776
My models are all dressed,
they look really great,

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:45.600
and the finale hijab was
so great, it was amazing.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.277
And I was like, bawling.

00:03:47.277 --> 00:03:48.313
[Tim Gunn]: "It's spectacular."

00:03:48.313 --> 00:03:51.440
After coming from not
having much of anything

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.337
growing up, you just never
know how far you can go.

00:03:54.337 --> 00:03:57.762
You can build, and,
like, you can make more.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.523
I didn't win, but with being on this show,

00:04:06.523 --> 00:04:09.930
I was able to get my name
out there, so to speak.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.230
My plan, eventually, is
to be a household name.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.563
It's scary, but I like a challenge.
