Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.100
So most women get pregnancy photos then a couple of months later look at them and say what the heck

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.160
was I thinking, but I've decided to bring my wife here to a

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.340
(wife) spooky abandoned warehouse.
Yeah it is a spooky abandoned warehouse.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.530
And, there's a guy named Wes Whaley, and he is a light painter, one of the best ones I've

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.710
ever seen. Anyway, he lives close to me so I contacted him and said hey can you do some pregnancy photos

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.890
for me. Anyway, so today on Smarter Every Day we're gonna teach you about

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.570
light painting. Are you excited?
-yes.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.230
Behold the sexiest pregnancy photo ever made.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.790
[laughing]

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.360
[music]

00:00:45.380 --> 00:01:57.230
                

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.800
OK so this is your camera shutter, and the camera shutter

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.980
opens to reveal an image sensor. And this image sensor is made up of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.160
several pixels. Now any time photonic energy hits the image sensor

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.190
the sensor converts this light energy into

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.370
electrical energy. So we're gonna illustrate that by blasting me with photons

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.580
So can you blast me with some red photos?
Woo! Alright, there you go. Keep

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.630
blasting away. So as she's blasting, I'm gonna take these

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.800
You got em in my shirt. This red and green photon energy

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.990
and, go ahead, good job. I'm going to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.170
slowly deposit this yellow light, which is red and green mixed,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.360
into the top left corner here. So basically, all the energy that goes

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.430
into the image sensor, as long as it gets there before I close

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.550
the shutter, then that's what your image is gonna look like. So you can see we have

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.700
some red and blue, but up here we have yellow, which is a mixture of green

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.890
and red. So, that's how light painting works. You expose

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.070
the sensor. You add light, as if it's paint on a canvas, and then you close

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.250
the shutter. Now, the one flaw in my metaphor here is, a real

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.280
shutter doesn't open like this. Last week with the Phantom high speed camera I showed you

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.320
that the shutter opens from one side, and then it closes

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.500
from the same side. The reason it does that is you want a uniform exposure

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.690
on all the pixels. So, talk about the sensor now.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.870
So there's two main types of image sensor. The first one is a charge coupled device or

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.060
CCD. Now CCDs are uniform, and all they do is they take..

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.240
Are you done with the particle waveform analogy there? Can I have one?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.420
-That's done.
Oh that's a good one. This is blue? Alright, so

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.620
light is a particle and a wave. So as the light comes in here

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.760
and hits the sensor you get an output voltage. That's how a CCD works. However,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.940
a CMOS sensor, which is a complimentary metal oxide semiconductor is a little bit more

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.130
complicated. It has on-board circuitry that processes each individual

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.310
pixel as it's being exposed. So the problems with this

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.340
is that you end up having a little bit more noise, and it's a little bit more expensive to make these

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.380
chips, however they're getting really good at factoring all this stuff out. So

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.440
CCDs are typically used for really low noise applications

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.620
really low cost. CMOS chips are usually used in things that

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.800
need to have a very tight form factor, so a lot of the stuff is done on the chip itself

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.990
and you don't have to have auxillary circuit boards. So as you look at the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.180
rest of Wes's work here just think about this. As the sensor is exposed

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.360
it doesn't matter when the light gets there. If you have a 3 watt laser over here

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.530
that blasts for a nanosecond it might be equivalent to a really low power

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.720
LED dimly shining over here. That's why you can light paint without

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.480
actually showing up in the image.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.070
[music]

00:04:47.090 --> 00:06:05.130
                 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.720
If you want to learn more about Wes and what he does, just go to the video

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.840
description down below, and click on the link going to his Flickr page. He's got a lot

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.020
of cool stuff on there and, I chose not to video some of the stuff he does, cause he's

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.190
a little mysterious and I don't want to give up his secret sauce. But if you want to try to figure it out

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.370
go check him out and contact him.
Get Smarter Every Day. Have a good one.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.670
Hey all the songs that have been used in Smarter Every Day videos so far are all together in one album. I'll put

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.860
the info in the video description.
Hear you. Go ahead.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.640
Catch a photon!

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.200
If you can get a laser then tie LEDs to your dog

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.380
and then you can shine a laser and make your dog

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.260
chase the laser, and get a good image that way. There's all kinds of good stuff you could do.
