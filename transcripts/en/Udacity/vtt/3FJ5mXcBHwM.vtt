00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.165
So our design process for many projects is very customer led.

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:13.304
So what we've created is a development kit where you can buy

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.489
our actuator modules on assemblies that you can kind

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:19.979
of snap together with as many actuators as you need,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.109
as many actuators sizes as you need,

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.609
in whatever orientation that you want at your facility with your product.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.250
And your engineering team can start to explore what is the exact configuration

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.130
of the system that best satisfies what you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.250
need to do because ultimately you understand your product best.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.015
You know how your product works.

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:41.910
You know how it's presented to the robot.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.979
You know what the packaging looks like.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.429
And so when they're done doing

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.509
their development process they can then contact us and say,

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.089
you know, this is the design that we came up with.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.390
And we'll take that design and we'll convert it into

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.020
a version that is very very robust for an industrial environment.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.924
We also do our own internal gripper development

00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:09.509
for projects and problems that we're incredibly excited about.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.250
And often the way that development process works is you go to the store,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.739
so you go to a supermarket or you go to

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:20.280
a toy store or you go to an e-commerce fulfillment site,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.984
start buying piles of objects.

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:23.804
So you take the things that you just bought,

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:27.120
you start building a gazillion different grippers trying to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.447
see what are the grasp parameters that drive quality of the grasp.

00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:35.790
You also start playing around with the control systems that we build.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.835
You know the pneumatic control system to figure out what sort of

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:44.280
pneumatic profiles deliver the best quality in an application and you kind of build up,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.579
build up, build up from there until you have the finalized concept.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.564
So my day at soft robotics typically focuses on the actuators themselves.

00:01:53.564 --> 00:01:56.409
You know since this is a brand new field of science and

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.709
engineering there's a lot of things that need to be worked out.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.059
So even building an actuator, a sophisticated actuator,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.540
requires inventing the prototyping methods that then create

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.080
the thing that you want to even test in the first place. So that's a piece of it.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.935
Understanding how to simulate elastomers for example

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:20.025
is an ever increasingly sophisticated science.

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:22.390
And new software is coming out all the time

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.384
that's driving the quality of the simulations.

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:27.090
But that's the thing.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.620
And once you've done the prototyping and the simulation and you're building, you know,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.569
a couple of parts that generate the sort of

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.379
physical behaviors you're trying to create for a customer,

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.159
you then need to do the process of starting to scale up to manufacturing.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.025
Starting to build out what would be

00:02:45.025 --> 00:02:47.555
the bulk manufacturing processes that

00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:50.230
can create the thing that you just prototyped up in lab,

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.869
and making sure that they meet all the sorts of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.175
functional and functional performance tests that you want it to have hit.

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:00.520
So, you know, does it last long enough?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.905
Is it easily abraded?

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:05.289
Is it easy to make?

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.924
Because, ultimately, unlike the stuff that people typically build in lab,

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:12.169
you need to pump out thousands, ten thousands,

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:13.525
hundred thousands, you know,

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.635
millions of these actuators.

00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:17.919
So you need to be able to drive it through

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.269
that whole process and so that's what I focus heavily on.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.270
But in order to build soft robotic systems that are

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.380
sophisticated and truly satisfy a customer's needs where,

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.519
in our case, that typically means being able to manipulate complex objects

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.240
very quickly in a way that is extremely reproducible.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.240
So the standards in industrial automation is essentially that you get it right all day,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.530
every day, all year.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.300
Because otherwise you shut down a factory line which is an incredible cost.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.570
So being able to go from hobbyist work

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.500
to systems that deliver that level of precision and

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.340
accuracy requires not just soft robotic actuators but a whole marriage of systems.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.560
You know, the pneumatics,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.284
the pneumatic control system,

00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:10.465
the AI software, you name it.

00:04:10.465 --> 00:04:13.936
If it's in a conventional robot, it's in what we do,

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:20.019
plus having to also understand all the different new aspects of soft actuators.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.919
Simulations are never perfect.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.860
Anyone who's run the simulation knows that.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.410
And when you run experiments,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.225
even if the experiment works,

00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:36.460
you never always completely glean everything that was relevant about what just happened.

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:41.079
You can actually miss a lot of insights if you don't have simulation.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:43.805
So, doing fast iteration through simulation,

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:45.985
followed by fast iteration through experiment,

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:49.430
and marching forward like that's always best,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.670
you know, personally in all the work that I do.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.405
Now, as far as simulating the industrial environments,

00:04:55.404 --> 00:04:58.164
it's very common in industry to have

00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:02.290
battery workflow simulation software where you have your conveyor,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.504
or you have your robot,

00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:07.509
you have whatever is the process you're trying to mock up.

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.920
So that you can understand all the things that are creating choke points

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.345
for rates on in order to create a very very streamlined factory.

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:17.770
And, you know, we build gripping solutions but

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:21.879
factories are a whole myriad of different kinds of technologies.

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.694
So that's the simulation that they do.

00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:27.574
As far as the simulation that we do, for the most part,

00:05:27.574 --> 00:05:31.654
the simulation focus heavily on the actuators themselves.

00:05:31.654 --> 00:05:34.839
So there are a lot of things that you can learn

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.734
computationally about how different patternings of plastics and

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:43.215
elastomers or multiple different kinds of elastomers where you have

00:05:43.214 --> 00:05:48.384
variable stiffness all over the body and other mechanical properties materials.

00:05:48.384 --> 00:05:52.180
It's a lot easier often or a lot more efficient to

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.079
kind of get a first pass at what that actuator is going to do and you know,

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:59.319
in FAA style simulation space.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:05.062
And then iterate from there with physical versions of the actuator moving, you know,

00:06:05.062 --> 00:06:07.660
in increasing sophistication and how you build

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.200
the actuator and how you run the simulation model.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:17.069
And so that creates deep insights that we work really hard to build here.

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.000
And it creates a very very rapid development process.
