00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.040
So after years and years of build up all the hype has finally come to this

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.220
The Avengers there has never been a movie quite like this done before.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.120
Six previous films staring individual superheros were all coming together for one event

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.020
that was planed from the very beginning.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.880
Though you could look them as individual stories they were all leading up to one grand event.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.060
This was the event.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.080
Now don't get me wrong there were crossovers before but nothing like this and nothing this well thought out.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.320
So there was a little bit of a concern

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.840
would it pay off? This would definitely have a good opening weekend no matter what it's been built up so much.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.040
But would it be the gigantic hit everybody wanted? Would it be as good as the other Marvel movies?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.660
Or as promised even better 10x better something specularly huge?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.240
Well the short answer is yes.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.860
Not only was this film a mega mega mega mega hit but both critics and audiences alike agree it was a ton of fun and worth the wait.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.360
The movie centers around the return of the sinister Loki

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.680
He apparently is in cahoots with an evil force in space who wants to, what else takeover the world. Of course.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.280
He plans to do so by using a magic scepter to hypnotize people

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.380
and a gigantic alien army to open up a dimension and bring him into our world enslaving mankind.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.360
Who can stop him The Avengers of course.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.560
Most of them just coming off of hit movies.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.060
Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and even The Hulk played this time by Mark Ruffalo.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.440
But also included are characters we haven't seen that much of Black Widow and Hawkeye.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.000
And the film literally from this point on is nothing but one liners and action.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.820
And I know it sounds strange but it's actually kind of perfect.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.040
When you see these characters together a lot of them with big personalities just having coming off of big movies what do you wanna see?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.540
You wanna see them interact.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.700
That includes working off of each other, talking to each other, getting in fights, throwing insults.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.020
And because these actors and characters are so strong and so defined it really works.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.660
The whole movie can be all of them just stuck in a room shooting the shit and you know what it'd be ok.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.020
Their that interesting and that much fun to watch.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.940
But of course thats not what people are paying to see. Their paying to see action

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.440
and when the action gets going it's some of the most fun I've seen an audience have in a movie theater.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.680
Every superhero has a unique way of fighting a villain.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.300
And each one has a different personality trait to make it interesting.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.760
Well for the most part we really don't know Hawkeye yet but eh were not at Avengers 2 yet give it time.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.040
A lot of these movies as I mentioned before deliver a lot of character but sometimes skimp a little bit on the action particularly in the climax.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.120
The great thing about this movie is it makes you think it's about to end.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.860
They do the team shoot you think alright well their just gonna punch out a few more and then were gonna stop.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.040
But nope it's just beginning.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.940
They spend a lot of time fighting creatures in the city and unlike Transformers you don't get tired of it.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.860
It gives you the exact amount you want to see.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.460
Every superhero does what you want to see the superheros do.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.580
The Hulk jumps around and smashes things. He punches this giant whale I don't know what is

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.420
Captain America throwing his shield, Iron Man flying around shooting stuff

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.940
even Black Widow who we didn't see much before this movie suddenly becomes this really cool character.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.960
She actually might be my favorite out of all of them.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.180
And yeah I'm waiting for that damn movie too.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.520
The one element of the film that is kinda lazy is the story but to it's credit story is not what you wanna focus on here.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.660
This is the first time you've seen all these characters come together and you just want to see them be those characters and beat shit up.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.840
So the story the story is very minimal. Hell it doesn't even really make that much sense.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.940
Loki wants to get all The Avengers together knowing they won't get along and that

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.500
would somehow destroy them.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.020
Ok?

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.840
Well as Tony Stark himself said not a great plan.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.220
The who story is kinda like that there's all these weird little convinces that don't really add up

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.980
and are kinda confusing but really you don't care.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.480
You're there to see The Avengers fly around and be The Avengers and this movie gives you that in bucket loads.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.480
They have been hyping this thing up forever. One of the biggest Marvel teams of all time actually comes to the big screen and it delivers.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.720
Does it have that much drama? No.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.760
Is there that much thinking in it? Absolutely not.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.580
But it's just an incredibly fun dumb summer film.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.460
This is the kind of movie you kind of want to see kind of mindless.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.140
You want to want to see a lot of dumb explosions.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.300
But it's done with so much wit and humor that you find yourself enjoying even the silliest moments.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.360
It's nice to see a cinematic gamble like this pay off and for the right reasons.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.080
If we just stated off with this movie before Iron Man, Captain America and all the other films

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.540
it wouldn't be as good. It'd be impressive but

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.120
it'd just be to jumble because you wouldn't have all the characters to find.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.280
Well now that we do know all these characters and we enjoy them

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.580
and they've certainly proven themselves to be entertaining.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.400
They come together beautifully.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.560
I even kinda find myself enjoying Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.200
I'll admit I like Edward Norton just a little bit more because I think he's such an engaging actor

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.800
but I like the take he does.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.140
He plays it as a guy whose been spending years trying to achieve inner calm

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.900
so he kind of looks half awake sometimes.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.460
But its actually intentional .

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.500
It doesn't seem lazy at all it seems like a guy trying to keep his rage under control

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.460
because he knows what will happen with it.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.480
And so sacrifices some of his stronger emotions to keep everything balanced.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.340
It would have been cool to see Norton but this guy is a good replacement.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.940
What else can I say it's The Avengers one of the highest grossing films of all time

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.340
one of the most hyped up films of all time

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.400
and it gave you exactly what you wanted.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.700
It's silly, it's funny, it's over the top. It's a comic book movie.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.580
At no part in it can you say it's not a comic book movie it just drenches itself in it.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.420
And after years and years these were seen as embarrassing films to make

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.520
Now they completely won us over.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.760
And everybody is trying to do exactly what The Avengers have did.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.880
Create a movie universe, something that can continue

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.440
and all these other characters can interact with each other

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.880
and come in and different ideas.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.380
They can all try it and some even succeed

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.880
but none of us will forget who did it first.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.020
Why? Because it was just so damn fun.
