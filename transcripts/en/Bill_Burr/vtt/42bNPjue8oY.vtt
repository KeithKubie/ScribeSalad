00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.560
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burn?

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.900
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:10.850
April 1st April 1st wait a minute.

4
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:15.560
Isn't this when everybody fools everybody look at all these fucking wires all

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.770
jammed around together.
How the fuck does this happen every week?
Well Bill,

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.610
cause you just,
you just throw it around.
Can you throw out,

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.820
you throw around your equipment,
it gets all fucking
lock together.

8
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.850
I'm happy.
April fool's day,
everybody,

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.450
we're into month four and all Billie,

10
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:37.130
no booze is fucking cruising along.
Four months into this fucking thing.

11
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.930
Uh,
November 24th.
So I don't know.
That's 120 some 27 days.

12
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:44.000
28 days as of today,

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.020
which is the longest I think I've gone since that time.
I took a year off.

14
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:53.021
So my record is 367 days since I first started boozing around 17 years old.

15
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.170
So the first 17 years of my life,
I cruised other than you,

16
00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:58.910
I snuck a beer here or there,
you know,

17
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.230
when I was in my teens because I didn't want my first beer that I ever had to be

18
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:07.690
in front of other fucking people.
I remember my dad had strose,

19
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.680
that's what he used to drink.
He had strokes.

20
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.930
I don't know if they still make that shit.

21
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.400
He edited in the refrigerator and I would fucking,
yeah.

22
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.543
<v 0>You know,</v>

23
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.120
<v 1>sneak one,
not realize that you had no idea how fucked up am I going to get.</v>

24
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.160
And I would,
I would only drink like a third of it.
And then I would,
uh,

25
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.310
I would pour the thing out,
the rest of it down the fucking sink.

26
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:33.610
That was my big foray into everything.
Everything I've ever done.

27
00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:36.120
I always stuck my toe into it like,
Ooh,
ah,

28
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.500
ee what bad things gonna happen.
Um,

29
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.410
so,
which is probably better for you,
you know,
longterm.
But,

30
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.240
um,
I will tell you one thing,
you know,

31
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.590
going to bed sober really makes you kind of force a face.
You're a,

32
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.660
you're fucking Damon's man.
I was really thinking like,
ah yeah,
no,

33
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:02.260
I drank to take the edge of little stress,
you know,
it's nice.

34
00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:05.020
It's nice to just have one and just fucking relax,

35
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.240
which it is hoes kid.
No,
it's fucking delicious.

36
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.300
Ah,
oh my God.
I gotta.
Oh Jesus Christ.
I,
you know,

37
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.960
the amount of times I've gone and it's starting to fade,
but you know,

38
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:21.880
these first few fucking months,
man,

39
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.200
it's been a couple of bars that I've seen and I just think like,

40
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:27.340
especially during the day,

41
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.670
I just think like what would happen if I just went in there right fucking now

42
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.970
marched right in there and got a beer and a shot.

43
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.300
It just did that for the next four hours,

44
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.070
<v 0>came home.</v>

45
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.660
<v 1>Then I come over to my wife and kid at four 30 in the afternoon,</v>

46
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:44.800
hammered and then what?

47
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.783
<v 0>You know,</v>

48
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.730
<v 1>then you'd be looking at me like,
what?
What,
what,
what?</v>

49
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.710
What do you mean fucking Angela's ashes?

50
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.600
Kind of an asshole in 2019 with a wife and kid at home goes out and gets fucking

51
00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:59.890
hammered at a bar.
But I'll tell you

52
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.160
as much as I know not to do that,
the thought is definitely there.
But,
uh,
yeah,

53
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.040
so as I've mentioned a thousand fucking times,

54
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.560
and I know you guys are getting sick of this,
but I just say to you,

55
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.340
say it to you,
so I'll do it.
I'm taking this year off.

56
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.530
I'm not talking to you guys right now.
I'm talking to me yet.

57
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.180
We take a year off.
So,
um,

58
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.120
which I think I'll be able to do.
No problem.

59
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:33.121
The only fucking tough day that I see between me and let's see,

60
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.990
I would break my record.
I went a year and two days,
November 24th,
25th,
26th.

61
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.310
November 22nd seventh is when I would break my record,
right?

62
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.860
My own personal best.
The willpower is,
I'm going to the,

63
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.430
I'm going to be going to the Clemson,
Florida state football game,

64
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.190
um,
in October,
and I'm going to be,
uh,
you know,
we already,
like,

65
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.320
we have the lodging,
we're going to be out there for a couple of days.
Um,

66
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.150
I'm actually trying to get a gig at Clemson,
everybody,

67
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.320
which is probably career suicide now with everybody with their hashtags,

68
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.740
flipping the fuck out and all of that shit.
Um,

69
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.630
I would love to do a Gig at like sort of a pre football rally for the Florida

70
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:23.560
state game and uh,
I'm so fucking excited for that game,

71
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:27.520
but I'm going to be there with,
you know,
my best friends in the world and uh,

72
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.020
I know I'm going to smoke half a box of cigars.
Um,

73
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.670
I just gotta I just can't do the fucking the,
Oh my God.
Is that going to be hard

74
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.880
sitting on a fucking lake?
Drinking fucking clubs,

75
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.390
sodas in lime,
lime.
Oh my God.

76
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.200
I mean,
you know,
certain times in this country you get fucking deported for that,

77
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.800
but whatever.
I'm going to do it.
I'll do it.
The one thing I do like about,

78
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.970
not booze,
those,
it's really easy to keep the fucking,
the old pasty belly at a,

79
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.900
at a,
uh,
a decent fucking level.
Um,

80
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.760
although I've noticed I've started to eat a little bad lately just because just

81
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:12.550
coming home you want to catch some sort of a something.

82
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:15.460
I'm just so used to something at the end of the fucking day that I've literally,

83
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:19.570
I started drinking root beer.
Like I'm fucking like I still have a paper route,

84
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.830
like I'm still nine years old.

85
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.390
Um,
so I got to watch that,
you know,

86
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.090
cause that's like hitting the crack pipe or fucking sugar,
you know,
it's a,

87
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.300
it's a motherfucker man.
Like the people who are like straight edge.

88
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.350
Like I would love to sit down with somebody who's just totally straight edge and

89
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:41.710
just talk to them
about like,

90
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:45.040
can you imagine you didn't drink,
you didn't smoke.

91
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.590
And then on top of that you actually ate.
Like,
what do they call that?

92
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.220
Die The probiotic die.
What are the fucker was member.

93
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.420
Those people actually read up on nutrition.

94
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.230
They barely work out and they got fucking abs and shit.
You know,

95
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.850
those people who truly,
they,
they treat,

96
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:09.470
they treat their body like a fucking classic car.
You know what I mean?

97
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.840
Like,
you know,
the ones that it's just like,
dude,

98
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.400
do you even drive that fucking thing?

99
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:17.750
Like every fucking nut and bolt has been chromed.
Um,

100
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.750
it's kind of,
I've just been thinking about that going like,
wow,

101
00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:25.760
that's really what if I treated my body like that because I know I have,

102
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.653
I've treated my,

103
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.813
<v 0>you know,</v>

104
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.410
<v 1>I've treated my body in the last 15 years.
Like a station wagon,
you know,</v>

105
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:34.670
the family station wagon,

106
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.310
the fake wood paneling on the side.
That's kind of how I've done it.
So I mean,

107
00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:45.550
it's not like I've been,
you know,
you know,

108
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:48.290
back in the day when all eight went to high school in the 80s and I remember my

109
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:51.610
buddies of mine where they go out and go buy like the used fucking trans am that

110
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.900
went from the late seventies with the fucking screaming flaming chicken on the

111
00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:58.030
hood.
6.6 liter.

112
00:06:58.031 --> 00:07:02.260
You don't say it on this side and they don't think it was always just like car

113
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.640
look cool.
It sounded cool,
but it,

114
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.950
it was driven the way it was meant to be driven for fucking eight years,

115
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:13.870
nine years.
And now you got it.
Um,
and those things wouldn't be,
yeah,

116
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.460
would always end up fucking shit in the bed.

117
00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:18.100
My buddies would buy him in the fucking thing would die like three months later

118
00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:21.580
would need some major goddamn work.
Um,

119
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.110
so anyway,
um,
I've been just sort of a

120
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.880
trying to think like that,
like try to go more in that direction.
Like all right,

121
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:34.790
what if I quit cigars or at least reign it in?

122
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.430
What if I read a little more on nutrition?
You know,

123
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.530
what if I kept reading,

124
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.343
<v 0>you know,</v>

125
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.070
<v 1>and I just said to me,</v>

126
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.510
what if I kept reading and every other word out of my mouth is,
you know,

127
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.790
I'm too fucking stupid.
Right.
Um,

128
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.640
I've gotten back in into like learning French and uh,

129
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.750
I'm doing really well with it now.

130
00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:03.010
I actually got a friend of mine that speaks French and this person will text me

131
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:08.011
only in French and I can actually translate a lot of it now kind of psyched and

132
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.270
a,
I'm just going to keep doing that.
I told you I went to that,

133
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:15.520
that that private school you're trying to find cause a fucking all the schools

134
00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:19.460
out here is public schools suck.
So now we're going to try to find a,

135
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.130
a private school to go to.
And we went to this one,
um,

136
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.020
that I really loved.
Still love it.
But the lady there,
you know,

137
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:33.760
they teach the kids how to speak French,
right?
Some real fucking aristocratic.

138
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.360
Fucking a private school shit.
And I said,
hey,
can the parents learn it with them?

139
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:40.240
And they're just like,
she's like,
no,
it's too late for you.

140
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.590
And I want to thank her for saying that because it really motivated me.

141
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.920
I'm just like,
you know what?
All right,
well I'll show you fucking show you.

142
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:51.820
I'll come out of nowhere.
It's going on.
They're taught simple.

143
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.530
Say it all in fucking French.
I'm speaking of which I took my,

144
00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.180
the love of my life,
my beautiful daughter to her first movie this week.

145
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.700
I was so excited.
You know,

146
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.540
she's all about going to the park and all of that's,

147
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.600
I bought a pitch back whenever the pitch backs used to have as a kid,
you know,

148
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.180
you could adjust them at three if we couldn't even adjust them at three

149
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:14.940
different angles.
The one I had was like sort of concave shape.

150
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.500
So if you threw it at the top,

151
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:19.350
it would give your ground or you through at the bottom,
you get a pop up.

152
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.390
If you threw it straight in,
they'd be like,

153
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:24.690
you had a friend that you were playing catch with.
So,
um,

154
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.380
I bought a killer one of those and uh,

155
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.440
I was trying to show her how to use it and she didn't get it,

156
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:35.240
so she would just run up with the ball and she hit it off the net and then turn

157
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.160
around and then throw it at me.
And uh,

158
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.300
I kind of just kind of getting her to figure out how to do that stuff.
And um,

159
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.191
you know,
I don't know.
It's still,

160
00:09:45.191 --> 00:09:48.610
it's the toys beyond it because it's going to come back and hit and hit her.

161
00:09:48.611 --> 00:09:51.310
That's what I'm worried about.
But,
uh,
I got to run the right path.

162
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.290
I already get my,
my,
uh,

163
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.920
one of my relatives got assist these little hockey nets and she actually goes

164
00:09:56.921 --> 00:10:00.280
watch hockey.
And then like while we're watching hockey,

165
00:10:00.281 --> 00:10:04.300
like she's running around with the stick and the ball,
you know,

166
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.540
I'm fucking with my old knees is on the floor trying to play goal and shit.

167
00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:11.650
So it's,
it's,
it's all coming together.
It's all coming together.

168
00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:13.870
I just needed to get her a little bit taller and then I'm going to start

169
00:10:13.871 --> 00:10:17.260
teaching her how to drive my fucking truck.
Um,

170
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.660
but anyways,
so I,
I,

171
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.850
I was driving around La and I saw all these billboards that said Dumbo March

172
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.020
29th.
And I'm like,
Oh my God,
I'm going to take my kid to a movie.

173
00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:30.130
She's big enough now.

174
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.220
We're going to go there and we'll get some popcorn and candy,

175
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.680
some fucking drinks.
The whole thing's going to be great.

176
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.120
So we went over there,
you know,

177
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.980
my wife was going to come with me and then at the last second she,

178
00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:45.850
she got something she had to go do and she goes,
you just go,
you go,

179
00:10:45.851 --> 00:10:50.520
this would be good,
you know,
bonding time daughter with the dad.
So we go there.

180
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:51.960
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

181
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.230
<v 1>And I,
you know,
and first of all,
I couldn't find the fucking movie,</v>

182
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.930
which theater we were supposed to go in.
They were all numbered,
you know,

183
00:10:57.931 --> 00:10:59.310
when you can't find your gate at the airport.

184
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:02.600
And I fucked that whole thing up somehow.
And like where the fuck is this?

185
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.290
He know and I went to therapy by my anger,

186
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:07.830
so I'm really trying to keep it cool and I'm just like,

187
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:11.820
who came up with the numbering system here that I can't find,
you know,

188
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.420
theater number nine or whatever.
Right.
So it turns out,

189
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:19.800
because it was like the Imax Dolby surround sound fucking,

190
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.640
and I was just like,
wow,
they're going all out.
So you know,

191
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:27.060
it's hilarious subset now carrying all her stuff,
carrying the popcorn.

192
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.540
I'm leaving this trail of popcorn and stuff,
but I'm loving every second.

193
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:32.170
And we get in there and we,

194
00:11:32.171 --> 00:11:35.070
we have like these individuals seats that like recline.

195
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.970
So I sat her in the seat next to me.
This is all dude,
sit next to me.

196
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.800
Couple of other people in our row.

197
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.990
We went to like the 10 30 in the morning showing,
right?

198
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.270
And I sit her down and I put the big box up,

199
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.970
a bag of popcorn.
Right.
You know,
she's sitting there,
you know,

200
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:52.140
a little cute little legs,
right?

201
00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:54.010
Put it right between the legs to just sit sitting there.

202
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.830
And she was just eating it and she just looking over at me like,

203
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.890
I don't know what this is,
but I,
I'm in,
I love this.
Right.

204
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.130
And keeping away from the candy though,
you know,
the sugar or whatever.
Right?

205
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.650
So just the salt,
right?
I mean,
what am I gonna do?
Um,

206
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.610
I have this weird thing where I'm feeding her healthy food,
but like,

207
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:12.010
also I think a kid should have McDonald's.
Like,

208
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:14.770
I'm not going to take it to that fucking level.
You know,

209
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.400
gluten free fucking pizza.
I mean,
at some point,
you know,
I don't know,

210
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:21.460
it's probably a bad thing,
but,
um,
whatever,

211
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.590
everybody raises their kid the way they want to.
And like,

212
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:27.580
I think you got to have a balance of like a little more progressive shit with

213
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:31.090
also,
you know,
they fall down,
you say rub some dirt on it.
You know what I mean?

214
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.300
You don't want an animal,
but you don't want to pussy either.

215
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.490
You've got to have that fucking that you've gotta have,

216
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:40.590
you gotta raise somebody that's going to be able to go out in the world and,
uh,

217
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.140
be able to stick up for themselves.
And I think that starts at Mcdonald's.
No.

218
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.030
Anyway,
so we're sitting there and the coming attractions are happening,
you know,

219
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:53.470
and everything's fine or whatever,
and she's just eating the popcorn.

220
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.160
Like she's just like,
like fish to water.
Like,
Oh,
I get this,

221
00:12:57.161 --> 00:13:00.130
I watched this and I eat this popcorn.
I sit in this great chair.
This is,

222
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.870
she's not even looking at me.
Right.
Um,
and then the movie starts

223
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.920
and it didn't even dawn,
I thought it was a cartoon.
I thought it was an,

224
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.240
an animated thing.
Right.

225
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.220
I didn't fucking realize that it was live action.

226
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.450
And Tim Burton made this was not a kids movie and it was like Pg or whatever,

227
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:26.140
which is,
you know,
PG is a joke,
but when you've got like a two year old yeah,

228
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.440
let's fucking guys like yelling at the elephants and being all mean,
you know,

229
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:33.160
Hollywood's whole,
you know,
zoos are bad circuses or bad kind of theme,
you know.

230
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.900
And uh,

231
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:39.580
we got about fucking three minutes into it and she looked over at me and she put

232
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:43.570
her arms up,
which means,
you know,
pick me up.
And I was like,
Oh shit.

233
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:47.170
And it was loud.
So I picked her up.

234
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.681
Um,
no,

235
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:53.440
she had talked a little bit and the guy next to me kind of looked over at me

236
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:57.010
like,
what the fuck?
And I'm thinking like,
really,
dude,
we're in Dumbo.

237
00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.890
I got a little kid to kids talking and then all of a sudden put together.
Oh,

238
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:00.641
he's looking at me like,

239
00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:05.540
what the fuck did you bring your kid to a Tim Burton movie for?
So now I put,

240
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.790
she's in my arms with their head buried into my neck,

241
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.500
which she does when she shy,

242
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:13.930
when there's too many people around or she's uncomfortable.

243
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.400
And so now I'm sitting there trying to be like,
oh,
hey honey,

244
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.060
you look at the elephants,
the elephants.

245
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.320
And she just sort of looking back at the screen and then,
you know,

246
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.270
going back and then after,
like,
I swear to God,

247
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:30.271
we made maybe 15 minutes and I just whispered in her ear and I just go,

248
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.680
uh,
you want to go home to mommy?
And she just goes,
yeah.
It's like,

249
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.573
all right,
we're out of here.

250
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.500
So I only saw the first 1520 minutes of it.
Uh,

251
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.270
all I can tell you is Danny Devito as always crushing it.
I was loving him.

252
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.390
Collin Farrell was in it.
I mean,
I was in,

253
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.760
I was enjoys Tim Burton is having a good time.
You know,

254
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.920
it was funny when before I went over there,
you know,

255
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:57.200
somebody was trying to say and all that thing didn't do too well on,

256
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.800
on fucking rotten tomatoes and I'm like,
well what the fuck?

257
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.500
Kind of fucking what do you got five year olds going on rotten tomatoes would be

258
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:07.100
like,
Eh,
could have a rip off of Pinocchio.

259
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.750
And once I got there and I look,
you know,
I dunno,

260
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.480
I I think when I got home was when somebody told me it was a Tim Burton movie.

261
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.940
But as I was walking out I,
and I just was,
the whole thing felt bad.

262
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.750
Like there was a fucking,

263
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.350
there was a fight and this guy was punching this guy in the face and I was like,

264
00:15:23.351 --> 00:15:25.840
guys,
just fuck it.
And like,
what's is just shit I've always watched.

265
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.080
But now I've got a kid that I'm like,
what the fuck?
This is kind of a

266
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.170
[inaudible] going to get going pretty hard here for a kid's movie.

267
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.040
I'm such an idiot.

268
00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:37.140
It wasn't until I left and I looked around and I realized that I was the all

269
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.170
like everybody there was like my age almost,
well not my age,
I'm fucking,

270
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.650
well the guy next to me was like,
he had like 10 years on me,
but um,

271
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.820
it was all adults.

272
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:51.750
So a big swing and a miss for me.
And uh,

273
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.990
we still had a good time.
She loved the popcorn,
you know,
um,

274
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.920
she still says that she's walk around go movie movie popcorn,
popcorn or Yup,

275
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.870
yup.
I go loud.
Right.
She goes loud,
loud.

276
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:13.070
So anyways,
uh,
I did at least get to experience that,

277
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.570
which is,
um,
which is pretty amazing considering,
you know,

278
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.260
this is my first kid.
Um,
I've ever had,

279
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.450
so I've never gotten to,
you know,

280
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.500
I've never had a kid at this age before,

281
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:31.090
so I never got to go take them to do something like that.
Um,

282
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.790
which opened up this whole world of like,
Oh my God,
I'm looking at you.

283
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.060
Maybe she gets into sports.
I get to go to her games,
I get to,

284
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.490
to take her to games,
driver friends,
do the games.

285
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.500
And go to movies and find out what the hell she's into and you know,

286
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.890
hang out before they become a teenager,
at which point they need their space,

287
00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:50.650
which I,
I get,
you know,

288
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.380
it Kinda gave me like,
like,
oh,

289
00:16:53.381 --> 00:16:57.670
this is a whole new chapter of this part of this ride that's going to be really

290
00:16:57.671 --> 00:17:02.350
cool because she's already stopped doing some stuff that I loved,
you know,

291
00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:04.780
but then they,
you know,
they learn how to talk better,
you know what I mean,

292
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.640
as opposed to me.
But uh,
yeah,
she used to say no when you be like,

293
00:17:09.641 --> 00:17:12.880
hey sweetie,
do you want a,
you,
you want some more cereal?

294
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.530
And she'd put her hand out and kind of look to put her eyebrows down,

295
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.373
look the floor and be like,
yeah,

296
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.200
<v 4>no,
no,
no.
Yo,
yeah,</v>

297
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.940
<v 1>me and he used to laugh and just sort of joke like lowly only need to say at</v>

298
00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:28.010
once and every time was always,
yeah,

299
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.450
<v 4>Nah,
Yo Yo yo yo.</v>

300
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.620
<v 1>I felt like I was like trying to hang a picture on the wall and she was like</v>

301
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:38.060
some super rich person across the room.
Like,
that's not it.
No,
no,

302
00:17:38.061 --> 00:17:41.060
totally wrong.
So she doesn't do that anymore,

303
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:44.770
but she does a of this stuff,
you know.
Um,

304
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.780
I've gotten to do like more like interactive,
you know,

305
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:50.670
and they're just like a baby just fucking carrying them around for like this.

306
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.710
It's like you have the hope diamond.
You're like terrified.
Now she runs around,

307
00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:56.910
she falls down,
she's fine.

308
00:17:56.911 --> 00:18:00.510
I've gone swimming and shit with her and all of that stuff.
So it's,

309
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:04.980
it's really cool watching her become like a little person.
So,
um,
anyways,

310
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.000
any way you guys are telling me,
uh,
F one,

311
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:11.970
the second race of the year in Bahrain.

312
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.810
I watched that today and you know,

313
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.640
I'm rooting for Ferrari just because,
you know,
whenever I take on a new sport,

314
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.230
I can't root for the Patriots team or the,
the,
uh,

315
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.660
the Golden State Warriors,
whoever the dominant team is,

316
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.520
you can't just like pile on and be like,
oh,
I liked the best team.
So Ferrari,

317
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:34.890
obviously they're no slouches,
but they've just been,

318
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.990
they've been in a Rut since I've been watching.

319
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.640
I think this is my third or fourth season watching.
And,
um,

320
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.180
it's,
let's see.
Well,
let's see.

321
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.370
Louis won it then Nico Rosberg wanted and then Louis wanted,

322
00:18:49.371 --> 00:18:51.690
so this is my fourth season watching,
I believe,

323
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.580
or Lewis won the last two years and Nico was Nico One the first year I watched.

324
00:18:56.581 --> 00:19:00.780
But I think I'm in my fourth season of watching this stuff and I have to be,

325
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.910
I got to tell you this right now.
I swear to God,

326
00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:07.400
watch rooting for the Ferrari team is feeling like it's,

327
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.790
it's like rooting for the Kansas City chiefs or the Toronto Maple leafs.

328
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:16.080
The fucking,
who else?
San Jose Sharks.

329
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.860
The San Diego chargers,
those fucking teams that they're,
they're right there.

330
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:24.300
They're right there and then,
fuck you
G.

331
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:26.430
I'm watching this fucking race.
And you know,

332
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.370
Lewis Hamilton did not have a good race the first time.
And you know that guy.

333
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.090
I really like him.
I like what he does,
but he,
you know,

334
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.230
he acts like a fucking baby though.
When he's not winning.
He's always at,
Oh,

335
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:44.010
what's,
what's botox do and how come he's not helping me out?
It's like,
well,

336
00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:48.480
when you're leading the race,
you're not thinking about helping him out.
You know,

337
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.030
I'd never been able to like think like,

338
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:56.040
is that like how you have to be to be as good as him?
You got to be that selfish.

339
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.550
It's just really off putting as a fan to be watching that.

340
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.820
So I'm watching the race.

341
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.890
The Ferrari's have won the poll and second place and then the Mercedes or in

342
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:11.850
third and fourth.
All right.
I think this Charles Look Clark,

343
00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:14.940
is that how you say his name?
He was on pole.
Um,

344
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.140
Vettel had a better start and uh,

345
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.170
I think Le Clercq as somebody who was having a problem with their grip around

346
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:23.004
the first three turns,

347
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.780
turns didn't warm up their tires enough and a botox was breathing down and

348
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.590
breathing down his fucking neck,
you know?
And uh,
but then the one,

349
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.020
let's say straightened out after a couple of fucking lapse,

350
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.110
the Ferrari's for like in control,

351
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.010
it was a really interesting race.

352
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.530
Then Louis went in early and he got some soft tires and all of a sudden he

353
00:20:43.531 --> 00:20:47.380
started fucking catching up,
which made vatal have to fucking pit.

354
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.680
But like the Ferrari's,
we're just stronger.

355
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:54.160
They would just better cars and just we're better today and then they just think

356
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:56.140
this place,
fuck the whole fucking thing up.

357
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.140
You know it was also punching up a fucking episode of a F is for family is I'm

358
00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:04.950
always fucking multitasking.

359
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.220
I Dunno what happened at that'll his front wing but he fucking spins out.

360
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.560
But Charles law clerk,
it has like a fucking,

361
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:16.680
like a 25 second lead on Lewis Hamilton and he's this like 12 laps to go.

362
00:21:16.681 --> 00:21:21.570
The fucking race is over and I'm like,
this is great.
Okay,

363
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:25.530
Hamilton's going to go all for two as far as winning races and you know he's

364
00:21:25.531 --> 00:21:27.420
coming,
you know he's going to win as racist.

365
00:21:27.421 --> 00:21:31.050
Maybe there'll be nice and close for the rest of the fucking year

366
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.770
and no 12 labs to go.
All of a sudden,

367
00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.940
Charles are something wrong with my car on the fuck the fucking turbo shits the

368
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:40.774
bed.

369
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.190
And then you just got to watch fucking Hamilton run him down and then fucking

370
00:21:47.191 --> 00:21:48.750
botox passes him.

371
00:21:48.751 --> 00:21:53.300
And now the Mercedes or in first and second they have fucking Ferrari team.

372
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.420
They just fucking screwed the pooch.
And then at least,
you know,

373
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.170
Renault was in,
was nice enough to have both their cars,
shit the bed.

374
00:22:01.171 --> 00:22:05.140
So then they,
they finished under a caution flag.
So,
um,

375
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.100
well Clark was,
I think,
did he,

376
00:22:08.101 --> 00:22:12.150
I think he might've stayed on the podium and fitting then Vettel was kind of

377
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.850
even in fifth place.
What do we got here?
Let me see what,
let me see the,
uh,

378
00:22:14.851 --> 00:22:17.520
the positions here.
I looked it up here.

379
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.400
F One standings I have and that's not what I want.

380
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.670
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

381
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.230
<v 1>it was Lewis Hamilton,
botox,
law clerk,
and then uh,</v>

382
00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.610
oh max for staffing and then vital.
So he came in fifth place

383
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.180
and then here are the standings for the year.

384
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.700
Botox has 44 points points for Mercedes and then Hamilton has 43.

385
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:45.070
Max Verstappen is a 27,
and then the Ferrari team there are 26 and 22,

386
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.450
like not now right now.

387
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.480
So now you know what it is now.

388
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.680
Like all I'm going to do is route for botox because I did like the racing

389
00:22:56.681 --> 00:23:01.300
between the two teammates,
botox and Hamilton.
Like,
fuck you dude.

390
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:05.260
Like I botox is done being the fucking,
you know,

391
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.870
the bridesmaid or the Goddamn gimp of that team.

392
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.250
And that could be really fun because that first year with Nico Rosberg and a,

393
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:14.140
I hope I'm saying his name right and Lewis Hamilton,

394
00:23:14.141 --> 00:23:18.820
that was just like watching days of thunder the way they didn't get along.

395
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:22.480
So,
um,
let me get a drink of water here.
Hang on.

396
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.100
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

397
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.800
<v 1>But anyways,
when,
uh,
you know,
it was fucking hilarious when,
um,</v>

398
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.120
when the Hamilton passed a law clerk,

399
00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.800
I literally gave the finger to the TV,
both fingers.
And I'm just like,

400
00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.110
why?
Why am I mad at Lewis Hamilton?
What?
Cause he's good,
you know,

401
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.800
he reminds me of,
he's like death.

402
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:47.300
Remember that smart kid at school had the great and always fucking,
you know,

403
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.800
did everything that you knew you should have been doing,
but you weren't.

404
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.730
You know,
it's like,
why?
Why am I going to hate the guy because he's fucking good.

405
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.790
Just drives me fucking nuts.
It's like,
it just,

406
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:03.791
it takes me back to being a Boston sports fan before we started winning.

407
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.110
And it was just,
there was just like,

408
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:09.080
how many fucking times can these cops get the call?

409
00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:13.760
How many times can just the ball just fucking bouncing to this guy's hand?
Like,

410
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:18.680
just getting the breaks.
Like Mercedes got really fucking lucky today,
or what?

411
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:20.420
I think they just a better team.

412
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.200
I Dunno what the fucking deal is with Ferrari.

413
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:27.560
They make some of the greatest cars in history that just,

414
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.710
I don't know.
It was frustrating.
I was really hoping,
you know,
the first five,

415
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:34.550
they get five,

416
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:39.551
six races in and Ferrari had like a nice decent lead and then to watch Mercedes

417
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:44.870
play catch up for once,
it's just,
you know,
it's just not,
it's not their time.

418
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.490
So we shall see.
We shall see what happens.
Um,
anyways,

419
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:50.630
let me see where we got here.

420
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.590
Andrew was asking me if I wanted to answer anymore of these fucking,

421
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.993
<v 5>uh,</v>

422
00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.750
<v 1>tax questions,
which I'll,
I'll,
you know,
I'll do it.</v>

423
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.600
I'll answer another one.
I don't know.
Um,

424
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.840
I just have no fucking idea.

425
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.320
How are you going to convince me that you should basically punish honest

426
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:19.190
Americans who happen to be making over $10 million a year?
Um,

427
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.590
and the fact that you would coast sign on that

428
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:28.150
as a fellow American to punish those fucking people and make them pay for all

429
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:30.950
these people who don't pay any money,
any taxes,

430
00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:33.140
all these corporations that don't pay any taxes.

431
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:38.330
All these corporations that fucking drag us into these never ending fucking
wars.

432
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:43.160
Never ending fucking wars and make a fucking fortune.

433
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.270
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

434
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.740
<v 1>North of death and destruction.</v>

435
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:52.410
And that's all a separate issue.
It's all the fucking separate issue.

436
00:25:52.411 --> 00:25:53.940
And you know what?
You know what?

437
00:25:53.941 --> 00:25:57.120
We can fucking tax these people because they actually report their fucking

438
00:25:57.121 --> 00:26:01.320
income.
So God damn it,
I'm not making 10 million a year,
so fuck them.

439
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.160
Well,
I'm not making 10 million a year either.
And I don't say fuck them.

440
00:26:05.161 --> 00:26:09.720
I don't leave them the fuck alone.
Um,
and go after the fucking problem.

441
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.441
All right.

442
00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:14.730
Don't paint a house that has a broken foundation or that needs a new foundation,

443
00:26:14.731 --> 00:26:16.890
I should say.
All right.
Um,
oh by the way,

444
00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:20.880
I'm going to be in New York City Tuesday,
flying in Tuesday morning,

445
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.690
getting off the plane,
going right over to Msg,
uh,

446
00:26:24.691 --> 00:26:28.620
for the garden of dreams.
And you know,
if they're saying dreams,
okay,

447
00:26:28.621 --> 00:26:32.310
it ain't fucking the main room with the Knicks and the fucking rangers play

448
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.020
cause that's the garden and nightmares.

449
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.610
I'm talking about the theater at Madison Square Garden where Eddie Murphy

450
00:26:38.611 --> 00:26:39.600

451
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.800
legendary place the garden dreams and aim on this show.

452
00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:46.680
Unbelievable show that has,

453
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:51.570
let me read the lineup here because Brian Regan was tweeting about it.
Uh,

454
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.850

461
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.650
Jesus fucking Christ.
Tiffany Haddish,

462
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:30.830
Michael J.
Brian Regan.
Jerry Seinfeld,
Jon Stewart,
Jon Stewart,

463
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.650
uh,
John Malaney.
I thought Eliza Schlesinger was on it.

464
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.630
I Dunno.
And Yours truly.
Oh,

465
00:27:41.631 --> 00:27:46.580
and also Steve [inaudible] is going to be hosting it.
Um,

466
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.760
typical me.
I don't even know what the fuck this is for.

467
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.430
And you will start benefit that has raised nearly $5 million so far for what

468
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.450
God Foundation is a nonprofit with 30 partnering organizations throughout the

469
00:28:02.451 --> 00:28:06.530
Tristate area,
including hospitals.
Wish organizations in Q.
Okay.

470
00:28:06.531 --> 00:28:09.410
All gardener dreams.
Make a wish.
Okay.
It's like a make a wish thing.
Okay,
cool.

471
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:14.360
So I'll be doing that.
Oh,
Billy new jokes come into town.

472
00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:20.360
Woo.
Did I fucking eat my fucking freckle dick the other night?
Jesus Christ.

473
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.360
I took a nice fat one at the fucking belly room.

474
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.080
Went up there with some new jokes.
Oh my God.

475
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.110
Terrible fucking terrible.

476
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.560
I had this great fucking thing on people who are watching that Michael Jackson

477
00:28:33.561 --> 00:28:38.120
fucking documentary.
It absolutely fucking destroyed.

478
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:44.190
Destroyed.
And then the very next night,

479
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:47.850
two nights later I go to do it.
I never take myself cause I just,
I I,
you know,

480
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.140
cause I know I'm not going to listen to it.

481
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.950
I wish I take that night cause I went and tried to do the same thing and all I

482
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:57.450
got was groans.
So that might just be one of those things where,

483
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.780
you know,
one night it worked and it just never worked again.

484
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.400
Then I just sit there,
you know,
like somebody who had loved and then lost it.

485
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.410
<v 2>MMM.</v>

486
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.780
<v 1>Speaking of having love of having lost it,</v>

487
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:16.090
let's read a little bit of the advertising here.
Um,

488
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.740
the fuck did I do with it?
M N P content.
All right,
here we go.

489
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:27.660
Live raids.
The raids that are live.
Oh wait,
did I,
did I attach them?

490
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.550
Oh I did.
Oh look who it is.
Hi.

491
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.000
<v 2>Hey,</v>

492
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.640
<v 1>you ever buy something online?
Only to find out later.
You missed a discount.</v>

493
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.750
I don't know.
Did I fuck what I find that out?

494
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.980
What am I an old lady or they have coupons on the Internet.
I had no idea.

495
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:49.270
I didn't know about this shit.
Anyways.
Uh,
don't overspend any more.

496
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.730
Go to honey.
Oh,

497
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:56.190

498
00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:59.610
Add on that finds you the best deals online.

499
00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.380
The APP magically auto applies the best deal to your cart and checkout.

500
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.233
Honey.

501

Amazon?
So for a best buy,

503
00:30:14.701 --> 00:30:18.390
Nordstrom and more honey is saved.
It's $10 million.

504
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.890
10 million members in average of $28 and 61 cents

505
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.810
white per purchase.

506
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.340
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

507
00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.290
<v 1>Well it depends on what you buy.
That's a little vague.</v>

508
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.920
Members have already saved more than $800 million.

509
00:30:36.921 --> 00:30:40.940
Jesus Christ.
Not Bad for sub.
I guess that means per purchase,

510
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.490
10 million turns into 800 billion.

511
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:48.170
Not Bad for something that's completely free and takes just two clicks to

Policy genius.

525
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:35.950
<v 3>Okay.</v>

526
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.130
<v 1>Hey,
can you have fog and believe it's April already?</v>

527
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

528
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:41.740
<v 1>Um,</v>

529
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.190
do you know who says that people who don't live in towns that have fucking the

530
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.020
winter or part of the world?
Do you know what I mean?

531
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:49.150
I remember Massachusetts January,

532
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:53.020
February and the horrific hope of March

533
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.970
in like a lamb.
I'll like a lot.
I know it just sucked.

534
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.670
31 fucking days of it

535
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.550
before I had to fucking pay,
you know,
rent and everything for February.

536
00:32:06.551 --> 00:32:08.950
Always fucking dragged.
Even though it was only 28 days,

537
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.170
it was still the middle of fucking,
oh wait,

538
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:12.730
you got your February vacation though?

539
00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:14.560
That was kind of cool when I was in school anyways.

540
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.040
Can you believe it's already April time has a habit of getting away,

541
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.100
but if you have a mortgage,
kids already,
what?
Depending on your income,

542
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.120
you're going to have to spend some of that precious time to get life insurance.

543
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:26.800
If you need life insurance,

544
00:32:26.801 --> 00:32:29.230
but you don't want to spend a lot of time comparing it,

545
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.410
you should give policy genius a try.

546
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.790
Policy Genius is the easy way to buy life insurance online.

547
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.250
It's just two minutes.
You can compare in just two minutes.

548
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:43.460
You can compare quotes from the top insurers and find out the best price.

549
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.680
Once you apply the policy genius team will handle all of the paperwork and the

550
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:53.060
red tape,
no commissions,
no hidden fees,
just more time saved for you.

551
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.690
So if you need life insurance but you're not,
but you're short on time,

552
00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.040
head to policy genius.com and compare quotes.
Policy Genius is easy.

553
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:05.940
It saves you money and not to Belabor the point,
but it's fast.

554
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:12.360
What policy?
Genes is easy.
It saves you money and not to Belabor the point,
it's,

555
00:33:12.361 --> 00:33:16.730
it should just say it's fast,
not buds.
It's fast.
I don't know.

556
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.160
Policy Genius to spend less time comparing life insurance and more time doing

557
00:33:20.161 --> 00:33:24.900
literally anything else.
All right,
let's get back to the podcast here.

558
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.450
Um,
alright.
Moto GP had the second race of the year.

559
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.780
I know Mac Mac has won it.
I didn't get a chance to watch it yet.

560
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.090
I'm going to try to do that.

561
00:33:36.091 --> 00:33:39.930
I'm going to finish this podcast and hang out with my little beautiful kid here

562
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:45.090
and uh,
and then I might check that out tonight because I ain't doing shit.

563
00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.320
I'm not doing shit tonight.

564
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.930
Hanging out with the wife can get a little quality time in there.
Um,

565
00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:56.030
I did a benefit Saturday night at the palace theater here in downtown La.

566
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.340
I got to play drums.
Um,

567
00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.460
the portion of the show that I was on was a,

568
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:07.050
it's an ms benefit rock against ms and um,

569
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.260
just a great event.
I've done it twice.

570
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:15.300
Ansi B sale puts the thing together and it's always this great mix of incredible

571
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.670
musicians that I,
I grew up watching and I get it,
you know,

572
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.090
when I get to sit in with all these fucking great people and I,

573
00:34:22.091 --> 00:34:26.430
I played highway to hell,
which I think I played live at this time,

574
00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:29.670
like a half a dozen times.
But this is the first time I played it where I,

575
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.600
I felt like I had the least amount of,
uh,
fuck ups.

576
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:37.450
You know what's funny in the middle?
That's such an easy song to fuck up a,

577
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.540
at least at my level,
because you know,
in the middle where he's going down,

578
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:46.320
stop man,
Bandana,
Bandana,
you know,
it's sort of a,

579
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.860
it's like a three against four thing.

580
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:53.920
So you're supposed to count of one and two and three and four.
One,
two,
three,

581
00:34:53.921 --> 00:34:57.880
four,
one and two and three and four and one and two and three,

582
00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:03.100
four really simple.
But in my head,
whenever I'm playing the song,

583
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.700
cause I played that song a million fucking times and never thought about it,

584
00:35:06.701 --> 00:35:09.520
I could just feel it.
But all of a sudden I'm playing it.

585
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.150
I'm not playing along the track and I got fucking people I grew up watching on

586
00:35:13.151 --> 00:35:17.620
MTV turning around looking at me.
I get,
fuck,
it fucks me up.

587
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:21.240
Right?
So that one is basically a,

588
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.800
I always hear it is one and a two and a three and that is like,

589
00:35:25.801 --> 00:35:26.990
oh no,
where am I?

590
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.470
And I was playing along to ACDC and I just started thinking about it and all of

591
00:35:32.471 --> 00:35:34.750
a sudden I was fucking it up playing along the highway.

592
00:35:34.751 --> 00:35:38.430
I played along in that song if 30 for 30 fucking never thought about it.

593
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:40.740
All right.
The day of the Gig,

594
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:43.180
I'm playing along to it and I'm thinking about this part going,

595
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.290
I know at least I got to know how to count this out,
figure out what this is.

596
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:49.860
After all these years of playing it.
And I started fucking it up.

597
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.290
So I'm backstage just going,

598
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:58.010
I'm going one and two and three and four one and two and three and four and one

599
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.860
and two and three for like I'm going to do that.
So,

600
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:05.250
of course when the time comes.
So the song fucking comes,
you know,

601
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:07.780
we've started playing the fucking song.
We get to that point.
Uh,

602
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.270
Michael Devin from Whitesnake is second.
And um,

603
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:17.110
immediately I still,
you know,
Pata Pata that bond,
I had no idea.

604
00:36:17.111 --> 00:36:19.600
So I just fucking went real hard with the high hat.
So my,

605
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.600
my one would be there one,
one dude.
Well,
and then,
you know,

606
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.130
ended up getting out of it.
And um,

607
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.440
I had a great fucking time.
I don't like drum sounded awesome and I,
I got to uh,

608
00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:36.520
watch all these guys,
Stephen Perkins who was just on my podcast.

609
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:41.500
I got to watch him play my favorite van Halen Song of all time,
main streets.

610
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:46.970
And um,
what does it mean street?
This is home,

611
00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:49.550
this is main street.
It's main street,
the movies mean streets.

612
00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.350
I got to watch him play that.

613
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.130
<v 5>And um,</v>

614
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.930
<v 1>just an incredible fucking drummer man.
You know,</v>

615
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.970
some people look like they're working when they're playing.

616
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.710
That guy looks up there like he's just having the time of his fucking life and I

617
00:37:03.711 --> 00:37:05.660
got to go on like right after him.

618
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.670
<v 5>And um,</v>

619
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.220
<v 1>he's just,
he's the best fucking dude ever.
Uh,</v>

620
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.200
so I'm hoping he's actually going to be

621
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:18.090
playing out live here where I can watch them do a full set.

622
00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:19.740
That's what the fuck I would really like.

623
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.870
<v 5>MMM.</v>

624
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.980
<v 1>Something,
oh,
what am I talking about?</v>

625
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:24.510
He promoted that thing in the beginning of April.

626
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:28.490
Am I going to be around for that?
I think I am.
Hopefully I am.

627
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.223
<v 5>MMM.</v>

628
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.070
<v 1>That thing in downtown La.
Now I'm literally just talking to myself.</v>

629
00:37:34.071 --> 00:37:36.290
I'm not even doing a fucking podcast anymore.
All right.

630
00:37:36.291 --> 00:37:39.230
Let's get to some of the questions here for the week.

631
00:37:39.231 --> 00:37:42.440
I know the red sox have won one and lost two.

632
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:44.960
Um,

633
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.860
I love when they said the red sox have given up 18 runs of their past two games.

634
00:37:48.861 --> 00:37:50.720
And I was like,
Jesus Christ,
we're getting lit up.

635
00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:54.290
And then I see we only let up six the other night and saying,
all right,

636
00:37:54.291 --> 00:37:58.940
so we let at 12 one night.
That fucking happens.
Um,
all right,
let's get to,

637
00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.860
uh,
let's get to some of the questions here for the week.
See what I got here.

638
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.820
Um,
I'm hoping I'm not going to get trashed too much for my fucking,

639
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.730
if he was here on taxes.
All right.
Athletes getting paid.
Hey Bill,

640
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.811
receipt on your podcast.

641
00:38:15.811 --> 00:38:19.260
You talked a little bit about why college athletes athletes should get paid.

642
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.980
Yeah.
But I also think that it should be like a flat fee,

643
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.770
so you don't have to bring in agents or anything like that.

644
00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:29.430
They do a straight across the fucking board socialism thing here.

645
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.530
Um,
so you don't have high school holdouts and all of that or maybe that is the

646
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:38.230
wrong thing.
I have no idea.
Um,
I was just saying starters,

647
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:42.580
get this amount of money and if you have a Jersey that sells a lot,

648
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:47.581
you get a percentage of it and then everybody else who isn't a starter gets a

649
00:38:47.681 --> 00:38:50.560
certain amount of fucking money.
Um,
and then that's it.

650
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:54.190
Straight across the fucking board.
Bing,
Bang,
boom.
Done.
All right.
Hey Bill.
Okay.

651
00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.090
And I wanted to chime in on why it's harder than it seems not just because of

652
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:01.450
the greedy corporate comps.
Oh No,
it's fucking,
there'll be a fucking nightmare.

653
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:06.451
That's why I'm proposing a one sort of,

654
00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.073
<v 5>you know,</v>

655
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.580
<v 1>I guess,
I dunno.
It's just fucked up that somebody is like</v>

656
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:19.050
selling a zillion jerseys with their name on the back.

657
00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.420
Just coming from show business.

658
00:39:21.421 --> 00:39:24.540
I just know if I sold out a football fucking stadium,

659
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.330
um,
that I would get paid for it.

660
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.570
I would never do that show for free unless I guess it was a benefit.

661
00:39:32.571 --> 00:39:35.210
But I can't see a football stadium worth of people.

662
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:39.320
This is weird thing where it's like you're coming in as a,
as a,

663
00:39:39.321 --> 00:39:42.350
as a blue chip draft pick out of,
um,

664
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.960
recruit I should say out of high school.

665
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:46.853
<v 5>And then</v>

666
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.740
<v 1>you're going to Michigan or USC or Alabama,</v>

667
00:39:51.741 --> 00:39:55.430
like these places they're going to sell out anyways because of the history.

668
00:39:55.431 --> 00:39:59.120
So it's almost like you're joining a supergroup.
Right.

669
00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:04.190
But it's kind of like the original members leave and now you have to carry on

670
00:40:04.191 --> 00:40:06.380
the name.
So at first they're doing you a favor,

671
00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:08.660
but once you establish yourself as the star,

672
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.100
then you're the one that's continuing.
You're the,
the,

673
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.810
the draw that people are going to at that point,

674
00:40:14.811 --> 00:40:17.960
they know your fucking name and that's gotta be some sort of money,

675
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.980
I would think,
you know.
Anyways.
Um,

676
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.430
I'll also try to use simple language because I know you can't read out loud

677
00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.080
worth the shit and neither can I.
Well,

678
00:40:27.081 --> 00:40:30.160
I like the fact that yourself drip McCree deprecating too.
All right.

679
00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:34.790
Paying athletes is all about who gets the larger and smaller pieces of the Pie.

680
00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:38.840
Do football players get more than basketball players and soccer players?

681
00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.880
Do Physical sports or activities get more than mentally exhausting sports or

682
00:40:43.881 --> 00:40:47.480
activities?
And what counts as a sport or an athlete?

683
00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:49.970
<v 5>Uh,</v>

684
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:54.440
<v 1>should the chess club or racketball players also get their share of money now?</v>

685
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:55.820
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

686
00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.350
<v 1>You know what I mean?
I'm talking fucking,
you're,
you're already famous.</v>

687
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.810
You're such a big time fucking college player.
You're already famous.

688
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:08.290
That's what I mean.
Listen,
listen.
All right.

689
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:15.470
I would limit it to the sports at the school that have actually built the dorms.

690
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.093
You know what I mean?

691
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:21.300
Built a new fucking swimming pool for the fucking swim team.
I mean,

692
00:41:21.301 --> 00:41:24.060
give me a fucking break here.
All right.

693
00:41:24.061 --> 00:41:28.320
The amount of money that college football and college basketball brings in.

694
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.140
That's what the fuck I'm talking about.
All right.

695
00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:36.141
And then lesser than that is a handful of hockey programs at least here in

696
00:41:36.441 --> 00:41:40.520
America and uh,
and baseball.
But they don't bring in the money,

697
00:41:40.521 --> 00:41:44.030
the TV march madness,
the bowl games,

698
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:46.610
the fucking playoff system.
They now have football.
I mean,

699
00:41:46.611 --> 00:41:51.290
that's a whole other fucking level.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

700
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.500
<v 3>yeah.</v>

701
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.610
<v 1>Basically the universities are pieces of shit because they take the federal</v>

702
00:41:56.611 --> 00:42:01.611
student aid money and then take a broadcasting and they then take broadcasting

703
00:42:02.041 --> 00:42:06.450
companies money and pay fucking nobody in return.
It's smart,

704
00:42:06.451 --> 00:42:09.090
but it's also a total dick move.
Okay.
We're all in this one.

705
00:42:09.091 --> 00:42:09.960
We're on the same page here.

706
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:14.610
My thoughts are that schools who are getting money from any source of an event

707
00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.490
like the Ncaa Tournament,
College Football playoff,

708
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.760
or the president's Cup chess championships,
well,

709
00:42:20.761 --> 00:42:24.900
how much fucking money is that should be contributing to the players in some
way?

710
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.820
Medical travel shoes,
chessboards and so on.
Uh,
Musky.

711
00:42:29.821 --> 00:42:31.290
You sound like a chess player to me,
man.

712
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:36.180
You bring it up chess way too much and is a for the slices of Pie,

713
00:42:36.181 --> 00:42:40.130
the amount kickback to the athletes should be proportional.
Sorry,

714
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.590
had to use one big word.
Jesus.
Guys,

715
00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.120
am I this bad fucking talking to me?
Like I have brain damage to k two,

716
00:42:48.121 --> 00:42:51.450
the amount of the universe to the amount,
the,
uh,
the universe.

717
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.880
And then I stumbled over the next five words.
All right.
Point taken.

718
00:42:53.881 --> 00:42:57.690
You guys are right.
The university receives some of the event.
It's fucked up.

719
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.630
It's fucked up.
How to solve the paying athletes problem,

720
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.050
but something is better than nothing.
Anyways,
I'm a longtime listener.

721
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:07.640
Saw you in Portland,
Oregon last summer.

722
00:43:07.641 --> 00:43:11.930
Keep being great and stay safe on your upcoming travels.

723
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.760
Sincerely,
nobody,
no name left to go fuck yourself.
Um,

724
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.670
yeah,
they should probably do.
Cy would think that they,

725
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:23.930
it doesn't make any see amount of money that they're,
you know,
generating.

726
00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:27.850
And then I love that argument.
Dig Getting of free education.
It's like,
yeah.

727
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:31.260
You know,
it's like they,

728
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.940
they're going there to play football and try to make it into the NFL and their

729
00:43:35.941 --> 00:43:38.430
body and their brain is never going to be the same.

730
00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:42.660
They're going to do damage to their body that they're going to feel for the rest

731
00:43:42.661 --> 00:43:44.400
of their fucking life.
Okay.

732
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:48.540
They don't have time to fucking go to class and do all of that shit.

733
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.340
Especially during the football season.

734
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.630
Can you imagine getting ready to play for Alabama and making sure you're turning

735
00:43:55.631 --> 00:43:58.750
your paper in and at the same time they get a free education,

736
00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.700
not only they got an education on,
on a,

737
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:06.120
I feel like the music business is almost,
it's,
it's that much of a fuck over.

738
00:44:06.121 --> 00:44:08.280
Even the music business.
Jesus Christ,
they back in the day,

739
00:44:08.281 --> 00:44:11.850
they let you keep your fucking tore money and your t shirt,
your merchant money.

740
00:44:11.851 --> 00:44:16.730
Right.
Um,
I dunno.
All right.

741
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.060
The number 70.
Hey Bill.
Simply put,

742
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:25.090
I think the interesting thing about the 70% tax rate argument is that most of

743
00:44:25.251 --> 00:44:28.730
the people arguing for it don't even know why 70

744
00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.173
uh,
I would be one of those.

745
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.440
The green deal doesn't really just justify 70 or make it any more important than

746
00:44:36.601 --> 00:44:41.210
say 65.
The team behind AOC,
I don't even know what that is,

747
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:45.330
gave her that number.
Her team is essentially socialists.

748
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.340
They're trying to make a capitalist argument in support of a socialist idea and

749
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:53.580
socialism,
there is no end game and like fascism,

750
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.570
it's a small group of people making decisions for everyone.
Uh,

751
00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.380
it's the capitalism is that way too.

752
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:03.150
We really got to start like acting like capitalism.
You know,

753
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:06.480
anybody can just pull themselves up by the bootstraps.

754
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.070
Lulich there's things aren't like lockdown.
You know,
if that was true,

755
00:45:11.071 --> 00:45:14.640
we would not have the gas combustion engine for as long as we have.

756
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.900
If that was true,
we would deal with global warming head on.

757
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:24.090
Um,
yeah.
Oh,
all forms of government,

758
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.530
socialism,
fascism,
capitalism,
whatever the fuck you want to call them.

759
00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:33.330
They're all inherently flawed because they're run by human beings who are

760
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:38.250
inherently flood yours truly one of the great cases of all time anyways.

761
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:42.840
Unless we wipe out all the congress and replace the millionaires with average

762
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.530
Joes who care about the earth and people and being fair,

763
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:50.790
they'll just use that power to spend all our money on selfless,
selfish causes.

764
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.520
It's human nature.
It absolutely is.
And that's a,

765
00:45:53.521 --> 00:45:55.560
that's another part of my argument.
It's like,
okay,

766
00:45:55.561 --> 00:46:00.450
so these are the tax dollars that are,
they're actually going to use,
you know,

767
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:04.110
so public schools are better at get healthcare,
fixed the roads,

768
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.940
help out the people in Flint,
Michigan,
you know,
help out veterans.

769
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.990
This,
these are the tax store tellers.

770
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.850
They're actually going to get to them that they're not,
they're not,

771
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.610
it is a broken system.
I'm just hoping the fine folks at Blackwater,

772
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.980
um,
you know,
they have the weaponry to,
to,
to have a full on fucking revolution.

773
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:29.880
Hopefully their hearts are in the right place.
Who knows?

774
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.010
We shall see,
um,

775
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.380
friend is a flat earth or

776
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.190
what?
I don't understand how this,
this made a comeback.

777
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.600
I really feel like this is just people trolling.

778
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:48.720
I just can't imagine that this is,
this is an actual thing.
I mean,

779
00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:51.570
God knows I'm not a fucking smart guy.
Okay.
What the fuck,

780
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:56.130
what people are going to sit here and act as though this is actually a thing.
Um,

781
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.710
how did this start?
Friend is a flat earth or hey Billy global tits

782
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:09.360
that,
you know,
it's the best one in awhile.
I'm a 28 year old living in New York.

783
00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.490
One of my best friends is a flat earthers.

784
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.240
Not only him but his girlfriend as well.
Well,
you know,

785
00:47:15.241 --> 00:47:19.440
they fuck missionary style or do they call it earth style?
Uh,

786
00:47:19.441 --> 00:47:21.660
I know I've known them for over five years.

787
00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:24.720
So recently I sent him a cool video of two space.

788
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.800
Is that extra 10 rockets vertically landing?

789
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:33.000
I would expect his normal reaction like,
oh,
that's so cool.

790
00:47:33.001 --> 00:47:36.810
It's amazing what people can do nowadays.
But instead of that,

791
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:41.460
he started talking about how we've been lied to the whole time that all the

792
00:47:41.461 --> 00:47:42.600
space program,

793
00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:47.040
Isis and all of that is a global hoax.

794
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.980
Oh Man.
He went way down the rabbit hole.

795
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.340
I hon.
I started down that road and I headed back,

796
00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:00.650
so I thought he was joking and I asked him,
are you a flat error?

797
00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.190
Arthur?
And he responded,
do research,
Bro.

798
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:10.150
<v 5>Okay,
wait a second.</v>

799
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.970
You know something.
I'm going to take this guy's advice

800
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.680
<v 1>and I'm,
I'm going to do a little research here.</v>

801
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:20.320
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

802
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.610
<v 1>Flat Earth</v>

803
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:23.623
<v 5>evidence.</v>

804
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.300
<v 1>I can't imagine where the advertising I'm going to get now.</v>

805
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.160
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

806
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:34.030
<v 1>Science,
tell me a hazmat suit and a fucking shelter.
Frequent flat.</v>

807
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.920
Our frequently asked questions.
What evidence do you have?
Content.

808
00:48:37.921 --> 00:48:41.190
Easiest way you can tell for yourself.
The earth is not flat.

809
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.990
This is evidence.
What Pr.
This is what proves the evident.

810
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.120
Like all these smarmy people taking all this time.
Like,

811
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.240
can you imagine like if you know the world's fucking round,
right?

812
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:57.610
You've been in a plane,
you'll looked at it,
you've seen it,
um,
flat.

813
00:48:57.611 --> 00:48:59.680
Or maybe they're just fucking near sighted people.

814
00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:04.681
They can't see the roundness of the earth when they get up at 37,000 feet a flat

815
00:49:04.781 --> 00:49:07.270
earth.
The flat earth model isn't an architect concept.

816
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:13.500
The flat earth explained.
Okay.

817
00:49:13.501 --> 00:49:16.500
And the weirdest part isn't just that he believes the earth is flat.

818
00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:18.630
I can't find anybody that says,

819
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:19.780
<v 3>yeah,</v>

820
00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.200
<v 1>seven ways approved.
The earth is round.
You know what,
cause I'm on page one.</v>

821
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:24.270
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

822
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.760
<v 1>why the earth is actually a hundred percent flat.</v>

823
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:32.490
Okay.
Hang on a second.
Is this the one?

824
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:44.150
Um,
you know,
I gotta hit plus cause I want to read these six hold on.
Okay,

825
00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:44.984
I'm back.

826
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:53.710
I just found a guy,
he goes,
you know,
[inaudible] you guys say I'm a moron.
I uh,

827
00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:58.330
did a,
uh,
I was on the math team and I a want a jury trial,

828
00:49:58.331 --> 00:50:00.010
which are very difficult to win.
And uh,

829
00:50:00.011 --> 00:50:04.120
I used to think that the world is round until I met my Lord and Savior Jesus

830
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.560
Christ 40 years ago.
And it's like,
okay,

831
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.820
<v 5>all right.
All right.
I'm out.</v>

832
00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.830
<v 1>Tap it out to at God bless you.
God bless you.</v>

833
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.350
God bless all the flat earthers.

834
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.110
So what do they think?
They think the earth is round but of slap,

835
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:25.130
but the moon is round.
How does the water not run off the eds?

836
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.770
I mean,
I've flown around the world.
I've done it.

837
00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:37.240
I did a Gig,
I flew from La to Australia,

838
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:41.350
then I did Australia to fucking New Zealand,

839
00:50:41.351 --> 00:50:44.650
and then I went to Singapore that I went to China.
Then I went to India,

840
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.860
then I went to New York.
I connected in Dubai.

841
00:50:47.861 --> 00:50:52.210
We kept flying that fucking other way.
Granted,
I didn't have a compass.

842
00:50:52.211 --> 00:50:55.130
He could have done a big slow fuck and all the pilots in on it.

843
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:02.870
Uh,
you know,
I mean,
who the,
I don't know where the fuck I'm going,
you know?

844
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:06.230
That'd be great.
That'd be really easy to fake you,
fake you out in a plane,

845
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.281
you know,

846
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:11.530
just for a few times when I tried to do a little bit of instrument training in

847
00:51:11.531 --> 00:51:14.230
the helicopter and they have you close your eyes and they just start doing shit

848
00:51:14.231 --> 00:51:18.070
and you can just,
you have no fucking idea what's going on.
And I go,
you know,

849
00:51:18.071 --> 00:51:20.670
if you sit in the back of a plane,
you just looking out the side of you,

850
00:51:20.671 --> 00:51:25.390
you don't know what's going on.
Hey Man,
you know what?
Maybe it is flat,
man.

851
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.830
Um,
I dunno,
I just go,
Jesus Christ,

852
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:35.330
this guy found Jesus in the result of it was he thinks the fucking world is
flat.

853
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.220
Okay.
Anyways,
I've known them for over five years.

854
00:51:39.221 --> 00:51:42.430
Let's just get back to this fucking thing.
Okay.
Uh,
so he said,

855
00:51:42.431 --> 00:51:43.990
do your research bro.
The Same Bay.

856
00:51:43.991 --> 00:51:47.980
I called him and his girlfriend over to over to my house.

857
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.733
All right,

858
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:56.020
well I just looked at a guy who said he was a mathlete and he believes the world

859
00:51:57.111 --> 00:51:59.780
is flat.
You believe it's round and you just wrote a fragment.

860
00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.770
So right now the flat earthers are winning the same day I called him and his

861
00:52:03.771 --> 00:52:08.480
girlfriend over to my house,
period.
Anyways,
I'm going to tell you all freckles.

862
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.020
I had much fun arguing with them,
but his response was,

863
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:16.660
I knew you were going to make fun of us,
not take us seriously.
Um,

864
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:21.080
I didn't,
I didn't mean to tell you,
it just slipped out of my mouth.
Next time.

865
00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:25.100
I'll be cautious though.
This is very unusual behavior for him.

866
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.440
He never had been so sensitive and cautious on any level is biggest argument is

867
00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:34.040
that it's written in the Quran,
the Bible and the Torah,

868
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:35.660
that the earth is flat.

869
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.220
God laid the earth beneath our feet like a carpet for us to walk on.

870
00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:47.130
Well,
he could still do that and it could be round
seal gravity thing,
right?

871
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.680
I respect religion,
but like,
but like a comedy,

872
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:59.210
I can not take it literally.
It's all written in poetic manner,
right?

873
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.440
It's been almost a weekend.
I'm arguing with him only about this topic.

874
00:53:03.441 --> 00:53:06.410
My question is,
is flat earth or the new gay,

875
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:12.800
should I close this topic and accept his new enlightened perspectives or should

876
00:53:13.351 --> 00:53:17.220
I be worried about continuing to throw scientific facts at them?

877
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:20.580
Is that what you do with gay people?

878
00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:28.260
Lucky you.
You both have vaginas.
Okay,

879
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.330
then you can't penetrate one another.

880
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.730
How much more scientific facty you need that the two of you lesbians should ever

881
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.500
trace him with me anyways.

882
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:40.920
I don't want to escalate this thing to the breaking point,

883
00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:45.780
but it feels like they're in some cult and since they are my friends,
I care.

884
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.980
I listen to regularly teeth to your Po podcast.

885
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:54.240
Always from Casco Stan.
Oh,
all right.
All right.

886
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:57.450
So I'll forgive the fragments here.
And this is my first time riding.

887
00:53:57.451 --> 00:54:01.870
Sorry for my English hearings.
There was great thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,

888
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.230
I don't know how things work in caskets,
Stan,

889
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:07.110
but over here in the good old United States of America,
uh,

890
00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:12.111
your friendship with them is hit a serious snag in the road.

891
00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:14.773
<v 5>So</v>

892
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:16.101
<v 1>I mean,</v>

893
00:54:16.101 --> 00:54:21.101
you can continue to be friends with somebody that thinks the world is flat.

894
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:26.970
Just don't bring it up.
It's like religion,

895
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:31.090
you know,
there's a bunch,
I mean I'm,
I'm not into it,

896
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:36.720
but I don't know if people,
I mean I hung out with people.

897
00:54:36.721 --> 00:54:39.810
Scientologists seemed to be like the only people around my age that still

898
00:54:39.811 --> 00:54:43.230
fucking practice their religion.
I don't,
they don't fucking bugged me.

899
00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.360
I just don't bring up religion.

900
00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:47.940
I'm not going to fucking bombard them with my stupid opinions,

901
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.980
my unresearched opinions.
Who gives a fuck?

902
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.860
You know what the funny thing is is the only reason why you and I know that the

903
00:54:52.861 --> 00:54:56.760
earth is fucking round is because of other human beings that had the balls to

904
00:54:56.761 --> 00:54:59.520
fucking get in a goddamn boat and start sailing off into it.

905
00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:02.730
So I can only make fun of these people so much.
Okay.

906
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:07.731
You're talking about somebody who took his daughter a two year old to a fucking

907
00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:11.500
Tim Burton movie.
So I mean,
how much,

908
00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:15.760
how far away am I from someone who thinks the fucking world is flat?
Um,

909
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.930
but having said that,

910
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.233
<v 5>mmm.</v>

911
00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:24.520
<v 1>I feel like you're eventually going to slowly back away from these two people if</v>

912
00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:25.660
they continue down that road.

913
00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:28.563
<v 5>MMM.</v>

914
00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.420
<v 1>Yeah.
I want to get nervous that,
you know,</v>

915
00:55:32.421 --> 00:55:35.870
people were gonna make fun of them to the point that they become angry people

916
00:55:35.871 --> 00:55:39.140
and then all of a sudden you're the person that they take their anger out on.

917
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.960
These are just concerns that I have.
Uh,
all right.

918
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:44.090
Boyfriend wants to become a comedian,
by the way.

919
00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.070
Thanks for listening to the podcast.
Way over there.

920
00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.520
Don't you guys have a race over there?
One of the f one races over there.

921
00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:54.890
And one of those key countries,
uh,
boyfriend wants to become a comedian.
Hey,

922
00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:56.923
Billy Bald Eagle,

923
00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:02.020
my boyfriend of almost two years told me when we started dating that he's been

924
00:56:02.061 --> 00:56:05.240
torn between being a comedian or being a doctor.

925
00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:06.900
<v 5>MMM.</v>

926
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.670
<v 1>Yes,
I knew a guy that,
uh,</v>

927
00:56:08.671 --> 00:56:12.960
actually quit being a comedian to go back to med school.
Uh,
he's ridiculous,

928
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:16.830
ridiculously smart.
And I know he can do anything he puts his mind to.

929
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.730
So are you already in here?

930
00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.860
But I personally feel like he'd make a bigger difference in the world being a

931
00:56:23.861 --> 00:56:24.341
doctor.

932
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:29.341
And if anything could be easier to transition from being a doctor to a comedian

933
00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:30.750
than the other way around.

934
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:35.020
<v 5>MMM.</v>

935
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.870
<v 1>Well,
first of all,
it's not your life and it's not your dream.</v>

936
00:56:37.871 --> 00:56:41.680
And I can tell you that,
uh,
this is a young man and woman's business.

937
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:46.050
So all those years of studying to be a doctor and then become a comedian,
that's,

938
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:49.000
that could be a difficult thing.
Um,

939
00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:52.330
I love him and I've told them that I'll support him no matter what he chooses.

940
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:56.410
But I perceive that,
I personally think Dr is the way to go.

941
00:56:56.550 --> 00:57:01.020
I is it the underlining thing that you don't think he's funny because then I get

942
00:57:01.021 --> 00:57:04.620
this anyways.
Yes.
I realized that it sounds like a fucking gold digger,

943
00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:08.250
but that's not why I want him to go for it.

944
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.550
I couldn't give a fuck about what he brings home.
That's bullshit.

945
00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:15.840
That's complete bullshit.
Why?
Why,

946
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:20.700
why wouldn't you give a fuck?
That's the first thing women ask.
What do you do?

947
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.620
That's the guy's job.

948
00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:26.940
The guy's job is to provide the woman's job is to stay home in the kitchen,

949
00:57:26.941 --> 00:57:31.530
making babies.
Um,
but that seriously,

950
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.820
I mean that,
that is the thing.

951
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:37.570
As much as women want to put on pants and go out down the street wearing a

952
00:57:37.571 --> 00:57:39.340
fucking hard hat,
you know,

953
00:57:39.341 --> 00:57:41.940
you're always going to be working with guys because I mean,
what?

954
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:45.970
We can't make a baby,
you know,
we can,
you know,

955
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:50.050
we can start the fucking process,
but we're in the pit crew.

956
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:51.460
You're driving around the fucking track.

957
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.610
You're the ones going to have the fucking kid.
So,
uh,
you know,

958
00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:02.050
all right,
my fucking record of fucking crap down for some reason.

959
00:58:02.051 --> 00:58:06.820
It's still in the left fucking channel.
Why is it doing this shit?

960
00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:12.460
Why does it do this now?
What about this?
Does this make it better?

961
00:58:12.461 --> 00:58:15.610
Does this,
is this both sides now it isn't.
No,
it isn't.

962
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:17.591
You know what?

963
00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:19.630
I'm going to have to buy a new recorder cause I don't know how to make,

964
00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.670
make this fucking thing mark.
I was saying,
yeah,

965
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:26.500
there's nothing wrong ladies with what's asking what a guy does for a living.

966
00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.630
That's what you should be asking because you want to,

967
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:33.000
you want to get with a smart guy,
okay.

968
00:58:33.001 --> 00:58:35.380
Where it becomes gold digging is if you,

969
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.060
you've just tell a guy that you love them when you don't because of what he's

970
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:39.870
making.

971
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:42.870
And then you marry him and then eventually you can't live the line he morning

972
00:58:42.871 --> 00:58:46.290
and take him for everything he's got and his fucking house.
Okay?

973
00:58:46.291 --> 00:58:49.120
But if you just try it cause you don't wanna marry a fucking dope man,

974
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:53.520
it's good for the human race.
You're smart enough,
you're smart enough

975
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:57.060
to not marry a dope,

976
00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:02.460
then you're going to make smart people who hopefully do good things.

977
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:07.260
So by all means,
ladies keep asking,
what do you do for a living?
You know,

978
00:59:07.261 --> 00:59:09.600
there's questions that need to be asked.
You know,

979
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.990
that's basically the female look,

980
00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:16.200
females should ask that the same way guys should be like,
are those things real?

981
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:19.230
Okay?
We're both doing our research.
Um,

982
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:22.460
anyways,
um,

983
00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:23.950
<v 8>yeah,</v>

984
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:27.970
<v 1>I think that that guy,
uh,
like I said,
you know,
is,
is he,</v>

985
00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:32.240
I think he wants to be a comedian and his parents don't support them.

986
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:36.920
So that's always great for the comedy and a,
he sounds like a really smart guy.

987
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:39.230
If he's smart enough to be torn between the two of them,

988
00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.100
I've made that both great jobs,
you know,
and they both really help people.

989
00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:45.530
Um,
all right.
What can I end with?

990
00:59:45.531 --> 00:59:49.490
Let me end with this on this one fucking speaker.
Why is it doing this?

991
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.280
I have everything set the way I normally set.

992
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:56.920
It's gotta be something on the mixer.
I'm never going to figure this out.

993
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:59.170
Stereo existing,
is this what I needed to do?

994
00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.970
Did that fix any something just happened.
Hello?
Hello?

995
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.800
I liked the way that sounds.
This does this work.
And then this,
and then this.

996
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:13.400
I'm just a,
this is how I play video games.
I just start pushing the buttons.

997
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:16.970
Nothing happens.
It's how I do stand up too.
I just push buttons.

998
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:19.280
A congratulations to Ronnie Chang,

999
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:23.660
a comic I saw a long time ago on a fucking plane.
And I was like,

1000
01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:24.680
this guy's funny as hell.

1001
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:28.850
And then he opened for me in Australia and then he got on the daily show and now

1002
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.950
he just booked an acting role in this Sitcom,

1003
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:37.940
um,
asset,
I guess to now an African American woman also boasts a congratulation,

1004
01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:42.140
boasted them.
But unfortunately the stars are white.

1005
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.370
So now people are saying,
I'm not gonna Watch the,
you know,

1006
01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:49.190
15 people on the Internet are saying they're not going to fucking watch it.

1007
01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:53.480
It's just,
you know,
I don't know.
I'm too white to understand all of that.

1008
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.231
It's just like,
all right,

1009
01:00:54.231 --> 01:00:56.660
so you're not going to watch a show because of somebody's skin.

1010
01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:00.870
It's just a trope were thick of this.
Alright,

1011
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.850
like all right.
Okay.
So if I do that,
I'm racist.

1012
01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:08.600
But if you do it because if you add oppression to it and the fact that white

1013
01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:11.840
people created this situation,
you're,
you're,
I'm not gonna use,

1014
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:16.820
I hate that expression woke.
It's just been overused.
So I don't know.

1015
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:19.310
I don't know what the fucking math is on it.

1016
01:01:19.311 --> 01:01:22.370
I just hope People Watch it cause I love Ronny Chieng all right there.

1017
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.160
Can everybody just fucking relax.

1018
01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.240
The world is going to a heck to hell and I fucking hand basket the first mammal

1019
01:01:32.241 --> 01:01:36.770
is extinct from fucking global warming.
Sorry.
Climate Change.

1020
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:40.340
Am I in trouble with transgendered people that I used the wrong fucking

1021
01:01:40.341 --> 01:01:45.341
terminology there and we're running around freaking out about fucking sitcoms at

1022
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:50.120
fucking gender neutral.
Bathrooms are way,
way,

1023
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:53.660
way more up on the list of priority then the idea that there's not going to be

1024
01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:57.380
any shit for us to fucking argue about.
Maybe that is the end game.

1025
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.390
I have no idea.
Um,
I like when people go,

1026
01:02:02.391 --> 01:02:06.500
I don't think that there's a god,
why could there be a god if he would just,

1027
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:10.070
if you just look at the fucking world and it's just like,
well,
look,
you know,

1028
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:13.510
they made absolute masterpiece

1029
01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:19.920
masterpieces of automobiles and people bought them and then they just sat in a

1030
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:24.030
barn.
Does that mean the people that made them all of a sudden it's not a fucking

1031
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:25.590
masterpiece?
Well,

1032
01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:29.350
I guess that's not a good thing because the car would act like how human beings

1033
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.570
to,
I dunno.
Maybe God is like,

1034
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:37.590
you know,
like a crazy artist.
You know what I mean?
And just like,

1035
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:40.080
our world is just something,
he just,
you know,
those people that don't,

1036
01:02:40.081 --> 01:02:40.861
they don't really paint,

1037
01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:45.120
they just throw fucking paint at a canvas and they get naked and they roll

1038
01:02:45.121 --> 01:02:45.954
around on it.

1039
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:49.650
They have to put Turpentine in their pubes afterwards and somehow after they
die,

1040
01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:52.860
it's like worth like fucking 10 million bucks.
Maybe that's what he did.

1041
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:58.050
I have no idea.
Um,
but anyway,
I'm gonna Watch it

1042
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:04.920
Coz Ronnie Chang's in it.
And as a white person,
I love,
I love a white lead.

1043
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:13.500
I'm not racist.
I'm just a proud white podcast.
I'm fucking around.
I don't,

1044
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:14.880
I don't watch sitcoms.
I watch,

1045
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:19.200
I watch sports and I'm going to go watch the Moto GP,
but,
um,

1046
01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.540
I guess that's it,
right?
I'm going to do with the gardener dreams on April 2nd.

1047
01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:28.210
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
And I'm fully a,

1048
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:31.650
I can have somebody fix this fucking recorder.
I don't know what the problem is.

1049
01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.610
You know what the problem is?
It's me,
so I apologize.
All right,
I'll see ya.
