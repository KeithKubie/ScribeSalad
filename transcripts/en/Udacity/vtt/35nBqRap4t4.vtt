00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And of course the answers is 0, if p=0, the coin comes up tail all the time

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and as a result it won't vary, therefore there is no variance.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The same as to for p=1. Once again we know the variance is 0.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So if we were to draw the variance as a function of p, we already know it's 0.25

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
when the count is most random, and it goes down in someway all the way to 0.
