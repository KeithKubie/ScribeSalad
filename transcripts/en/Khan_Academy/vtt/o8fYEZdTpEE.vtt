00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.767
- [voiceover] Point O is the center

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:05.167
of both circles in the figure above.

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:08.566
If the circumference of
the larger circle is 36,

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:12.640
so the circumference of the
larger circle there is 36,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.900
and the radius of the small
circle is half the radius

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.834
of the larger circle, what is the length

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:22.233
of the darkened arc?

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:23.900
If you have half the radius,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.703
you're going to have
half the circumference.

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:28.566
We could even solve for
what that radius is.

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.033
You want to know what the
radius of the larger circle is?

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:36.033
The larger circle, we could
say, two pi times its radius

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:41.048
is equal to 36, and so its radius,

00:00:41.048 --> 00:00:43.700
if you divide both sides by two pi,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
it's radius is going to be equal to,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.966
36 divided by two is 18 over pi.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.766
That's the larger circle.

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.100
The smaller circle has a radius

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.633
half of the radius of the larger circle.

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:59.500
The smaller circle's radius is, so radius,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.633
and I'll write a little
sub S there for the radius

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:04.033
of the smaller circle is
going to be half this.

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.233
It's going to be nine over pi.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.700
The circumference of the smaller circle,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.433
the circumference of the
smaller circle is going to be

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:16.100
its radius, nine over pi times two pi.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.366
Pi divided by pi.

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:23.100
You're going to have nine
times two is equal to 18.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.233
The circumference here is 18.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:28.033
It might have already jumped out at you

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:31.234
because circumference is
directly proportional to,

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:33.566
because circumference for any circle

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.233
is directly proportional to a radius,

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:39.034
if you have half the
radius, you're going to have

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:40.633
half the circumference and you would not

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.833
have to go through all of this.

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:43.968
You could've said, "Hey,
okay, if I have a radius here

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:47.033
"of 36 and if I have a
circumference here of 36

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:48.966
"and if I have a circle
with half the radius,

00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.100
"its circumference is going to half that."

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.033
It's going to be 18.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.166
That's not what they're asking us.

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.166
They're not asking us
just the circumference

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.900
of the smaller circle.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.433
They're asking us what is the arc length.

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:03.300
What is the arc length of
this part right over here?

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.966
This 80 degrees.

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.833
80 degrees, remember,
to go all the way around

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:09.766
the circle is 360 degrees.

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:14.766
This is 80/360 of the entire
circle right over here,

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:17.567
or the entire circumference.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:19.366
If you want that arc
length, it's going to be

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:24.366
the circumference times
80/360, times 80 over 360.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:29.567
That's the same thing as, let's see,

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:31.034
then divide both of them by 10.

00:02:31.034 --> 00:02:32.966
That's the same thing as 8/36.

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:33.700
Let's see.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.967
You can divide eight
divided by four is two,

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:39.633
and then 36 divided by four is nine.

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:41.633
Then you are left with, let's see,

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:45.300
18 divided by nine is
two, so you're left with

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.200
two times two is equal
to four, and you're done.
