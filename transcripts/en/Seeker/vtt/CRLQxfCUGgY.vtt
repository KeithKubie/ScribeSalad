00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.139
Ladies, getting your groove back might not
require a trip to Jamaica!

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.350
A Female sex drive pill might be here very
soon.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.329
Hello everyone!

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:13.459
Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.800
Sildenafil - sold under the trade name “Viagra”
- might be the most well-known pill on the

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.430
market, and while almost everyone knows that
it’s used to treat sexual disorders like

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.250
erectile disfunction, not everyone knows how
it works.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.180
Viagra does not cause sexual arousal in men.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
It only works if the man is aroused, and in
that case it helps that arousal along by managing

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.120
the chemistry that causes a man to get an
erection.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.660
Specifically, it maintains the levels of messenger
cyclic guanosine monophosphate that stimulates

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.840
erectile tissue.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.360
But sexual disfunction works a little differently
for women.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.300
Though some are physical, many female sexual
disorders come down to mental and emotional

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.470
factors leading to disinterest in sex and
an overall low sex drive, properly called

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.380
hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.059
Arousal and disinterest in sex are still somewhat
unknown to scientists, although they do know

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.989
that the brain’s circuitry is involved.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.559
One theory is that low sex drive results from
an inability to switch off the frontal parts

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.380
of the brain that manage everyday tasks, mundane
things like remembering to go to the post

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.280
office or resolve a problem at work.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.030
With these frontal parts switched on, the
reward circuitry that managed motivation and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.530
pleasure is left inhibited.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.020
And this means women can’t really get into
sex.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.920
But there’s a weird silver lining.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.370
Like erectile disfunction in men, low sex
drive is chemical, and that is something treatable.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.030
The female version of the little blue pill
is called Flibanserin and it’s currently

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.260
pending approval by the FDA (there’s a meeting
to decide its fate early next month).

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.060
Flibanserin was initially developed as an
antidepressant, but while women in a clinical

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.260
trial didn’t notice a change in mood, they
did find themselves more interested in sex.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.330
It was dropped as an antidepressant and refocused
to treat women’s waning libido.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.150
This drug, it seems, tweaks the balance of
key neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.240
and serotonin, either normalising levels or
compensating for imbalances to bring these

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.600
circuits back to optimal levels, disengage
the frontal circuits that inhibit sex drive.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.920
And while the women who tried it didn’t
see a massive result, they still noticed a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.930
positive trend.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.450
Of course, measuring an improvement is pretty
hard.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.299
It seems women don’t have a lot of sex on
average, just three times per month.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.170
During the trial, women on Flibanserin had
about 2.5 sexual events in four weeks while

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.310
women not on the drug with low sex drive had
just one and a half sexual event per month.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.930
Of course, there are other factors that affect
a woman’s sex drive, like self-esteem issues

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.260
and disinterest in a relationship, and these
aren’t necessarily things that should be

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.470
dealt with medically.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.310
And sex drive does wane with age, though this
does vary between individuals.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.140
Some women experience a marked drop in sex
drive after menopause while others may experience

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.420
a renewed sexual awakening.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.930
But if a younger woman is in an otherwise
loving relationship, Flibanserin, if it passes

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.860
by the FDA, could be the boon for women that
Viagra has been for men.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.950
And if you do have more sex, maybe it could
lead to more money.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.989
