00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.370
Let's get started with the project.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.870
Inside the GitHub repo linked
in the instructor notes,

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.420
you'll find some simple HTML for a
website that looks something like this.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.520
You can see a form at the top where
a user will type in their street address

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.050
and city for where they want to move.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.480
And then below, the information
they're looking for will show up.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.190
Inside the repository you'll find
Index.HTML which is the code for

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.610
the page we were just looking at.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.450
And you'll find script.js.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.500
Which is where you'll be
writing out your Ajax requests.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.370
And there's also this j query file.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.960
Inside the libs directory.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.509
Let's talk a little bit about j query.
