00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.250
 

00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.310
In this problem, we will be
helping Romeo and Juliet meet

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.420
up for a date.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.450
And in the process, also we'll
review some concepts in basic

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.950
probability theory, including
sample spaces

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.840
and probability laws.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.550
This problem, the basic setup
is that Romeo and Juliet are

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.040
trying to meet up for a date.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.510
And let's say they're trying
to meet up for

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.910
lunch tomorrow at noon.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.610
But they're not necessarily
punctual.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.840
So they may arrive on time with
a delay of 0, or they may

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.860
actually be up to 1 hour late
and arrive at 1:00 PM.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.800
So the other thing that we
assume in this problem is that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.380
all pairs of arrival times-- so
the time that Romeo arrives

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.290
paired with the time they
Juliet arrives--

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.090
all of these pairs are
equally likely.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.090
And I've put this in quotes,
because we haven't really

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.710
specify exactly what
this means.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.450
And we'll come back to
that in a little bit.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.320
The last important thing is that
each person will wait for

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.730
15 minutes for the other
person to arrive.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.780
If within that 15-minute
window the other person

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.660
doesn't arrive, then they'll
give up and they'll end up not

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.480
meeting up for lunch.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.630
So to solve this problem, let's
first try to set up a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.550
sample space and come up with a
probability law to describe

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.370
this scenario.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.350
And let's actually start
with a simpler

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.520
version of this problem.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.330
And instead of assuming that
they can arrive at any delay

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.510
between 0 and 1 hour, let's
pretend instead that Romeo and

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.000
Juliet can only arrive in
15-minute increments.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.420
So Romeo can arrive on time
with a delay 0, or be 15

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630
minutes late, 30 minutes
late, 45 minutes

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.870
late, or one hour late.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.630
But none of the other
times are possible.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.880
And the same thing for Juliet.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.720
 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.020
Let's start out with just the
simple case first, because it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.220
helps us get the intuition for
the problem, and it's an

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.470
easier case to analyze.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.250
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.530
So it's actually easy
to visualize this.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.760
It's a nice visual tool
to group this sample

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.420
space into a grid.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.400
So the horizontal axis here
represents the arrival time of

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.670
Romeo, and the vertical
axis represents the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.870
arrival time of Juliet.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:17.680
And so, for example, this point
here would represent

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.690
Romeo arriving 15 minutes
late and Juliet

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.320
arriving 30 minutes late.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.950
So this is our sample
space now.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.270
This is our omega.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.180
And now let's try to assign
a probability law.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.170
And we'll continue to assume
that all pairs of arrival

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.620
times are equally likely.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.180
And now we can actually
specifically specify what this

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.380
term means.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.540
And in particular, we'll be
invoking the discrete uniform

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.390
law, which basically says that
all of these points, which are

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.790
just outcomes in our
probabilistic experiment--

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.670
all of these outcomes
are equally likely.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.060
And so since there are 25 of
them, each one of these

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.860
outcomes has a probability
of 1 over 25.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.250
So now we've specified our
sample space and our

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.440
probability law.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.840
So now let's try to answer
the question, what is the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.650
probability that Romeo
and Juliet will meet

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.730
up for their date?

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.520
So all that amounts to now is
just identifying which of

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.820
these 25 outcomes results in
Romeo and Juliet arriving

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.860
within 15 minutes
of each other.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.080
So let's start with this one
that I've picked out.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.470
If Romeo arrives 15 minutes
late and Juliet arrives 30

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.640
minutes late, then they will
arrive within 15 minutes of

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.090
each other.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.370
So this outcome does result in
the two of them meeting.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.840
And so we can actually highlight
all of these.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:55.170
And it turns out that these
outcomes that I'm highlighting

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.630
result in the two them arriving
within 15 minutes of

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.560
each other.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.230
So because each one has a
probability of 1 over 25, all

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.210
we really need to do now
is just count how many

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.340
outcomes there are.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.230
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.640
So the probability in the end
is for the discrete case.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.580
The discrete case--

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.600
I'm referring to the case where
we simplified it and

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.880
considered only arrival times
with increments of 15 minutes.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.300
In this case, the probability
is 13 over 25.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.200
So now we have an idea of how
to solve this problem.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.340
It amounts to basically coming
up with a sample space, a

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.010
probability law, and then
identifying the events of

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.820
interest in calculating the
probability of that event.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.590
So now let's actually solve the
problem that we really are

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.420
interested in, which is that
instead of confining Romeo and

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.830
Juliet to arrive in only
15-minute minute increments,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.860
really, time is continuous,
and Romeo and Juliet can

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.940
arrive at any time.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.900
So they don't necessarily have
to arrive 15 minutes late.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.470
Romeo could arrive 15 minutes
and 37 seconds late

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.830
if he wanted to.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.350
So now our new sample space is
actually just, instead of only

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.610
these 25 points in the grid,
it's this entire square.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.700
So any point within the square
could be a possible pair of

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.710
meeting times between
Romeo and Juliet.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.740
So that is our new sample
space, our new omega.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.280
And now let's assign a
new probability law.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.840
And now, instead of being in the
discrete world, we're in

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.050
the continuous world.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.740
And the analogy here
is to consider

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.910
probabilities as areas.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.970
So the area of this entire
square is one.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.950
And that also corresponds to the
probability of omega, the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.170
sample space.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.370
And imagine just spreading
probability evenly across this

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.230
square so that the probability
of any event--

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.440
which in this case
would just be any

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.190
shape within this square--

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.760
is exactly equal to the
area of that shape.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.090
So now that is our new
sample space and our

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.460
new probability law.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.850
So what we have to do now is
just to identify the event of

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.160
interest, which is still the
event that Romeo and Juliet

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.810
arrive within 15 minutes
of each other.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.130
So let's do that.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.840
If Romeo and Juliet arrive both
on time, then obviously

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.790
they'll meet.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.130
And if Romeo's on time and
Juliet is 15 minutes late,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.520
then they will still meet.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.110
And in fact, any pairs of
meeting times between these

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.190
would still work, because now
Romeo can be on time, and

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.790
Juliet can arrive at any time
between 0 and 15 minutes late.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.870
But you notice that if Juliet is
even a tiny bit later than

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.460
15 minutes, then they won't
end up meeting.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.970
So this segment here is part
of the event of interest.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.720
And similarly, this
segment here is

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.560
also part of the event.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.230
And if you take this exercise
and extend it, you can

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:07.040
actually verify that the event
of interest is this strip

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.640
shape in the middle
of the square.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.180
Which, if you think about it,
makes sense, because you want

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.470
the arrival times between Romeo
and Juliet to be close

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.050
to each other, so you would be
expect it to be somewhere

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.080
close to a diagonal
in this square.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.190
So now we have our event
of interest.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.980
We have our sample space and
our probability law.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.550
So all we have to do now is
just calculate what this

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.010
probability is.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.110
And we've already said that
the probability in this

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.930
probability law is just areas.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.980
So now it actually just boils
down to not a probability

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.390
problem, but a problem
in geometry.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.740
So to calculate this area, you
can do it in lots of ways.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.110
One way is to calculate the area
of the square, which is

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.520
1, and subtract the areas
of these two triangles.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.600
So let's do that.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.980
So in the continuous case, the
probability of meeting is

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.620
going to be 1 minus the
area of this triangle.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:10.320
The base here is 3/4 and
3/4, so it's 1/2

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.810
times 3/4 times 3/4.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.340
That's the area of one
of these triangles.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.830
There's two of them, so
we'll multiply by two.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:26.200
And we end up with 1
minus 9/16, or 7/16

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.250
as our final answer.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.490
So in this problem, we've
reviewed some basic concepts

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.360
of probability, and that's
also helped us solve this

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.100
problem of helping Romeo and
Juliet meet up for a date.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.320
And if you wanted to, you could
even extend this problem

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.130
even further and turn
it on its head.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.090
And instead of calculating given
that they arrive within

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.070
15 minutes of each other, what
is the probability that

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.730
they'll meet, let's say that
Romeo really wants to meet up

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.895
with Juliet, and he wants to
assure himself a least, say, a

00:08:56.895 --> 00:08:58.800
90% chance of meeting Juliet.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.550
Then you can ask, if he wants to
have at least a 90% chance

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.630
of meeting her, how long should
he be willing to wait?

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.990
And so that's the flip
side of the problem.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.860
And you can see that with just
some basic concepts of

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.800
probability, you can answer
some already pretty

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.060
interesting problems.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.310
So I hope this problem was
interesting, and we'll

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.560
see you next time.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.747
