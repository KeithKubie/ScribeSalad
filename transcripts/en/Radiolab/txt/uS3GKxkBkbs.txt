Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from [inaudible] W N Y s e n n p. R. Alright. For the money for all the glory for the Gold Robert Jad take four. Hey, I'm Jen. I have them Rod. I remember killing that actually. I'm a jab boom rod. I remembered Krulwich this is radio lab, the podcast, the podcast. So we've been talking about animals for the last few podcasts. Um, particularly how difficult it is to find something like a shared space. We're building to the podcast that follows this one where we've got this enormous and wonderful story. But this one, uh, the podcast you're about to hear is um, an elegant and kind of momentary communion between us and them. Hi, this is Michigan radio. I have your guest. Hi, this is Barb. Hi, this is Robert [inaudible] and how do you say your last name? Smart Smiths and that splits.

Speaker 1:          01:03          But Smith's, Barbara Smith is a professor at the University of Michigan where I teach courses on animal behavior. And back in the 70s, she moved to Kenya in Africa to a remote area. We out on the plains fairly open grassland and she tried to get friendly and then get access to a troop of baboons. No. How, what was the deal like you would wake up, drive some Leer, get out of your van or whatever, walk him. I get the break of day before the break of day and then follow them around all day for how many days? A week? Seven for for weeks at a time or a month at a time or two years. Two years. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:45          Um,

Speaker 1:          01:47          this trip hadn't been studied before, so they were afraid of people, but because the

Speaker 3:          01:53          area was very open, it was possible to approach them from a distance.

Speaker 1:          01:57          She positioned herself, you know, like about a hundred feet away. And then, yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:01          and day by day I would kind of inch closer,

Speaker 1:          02:05          80 feet away, 50 feet.

Speaker 3:          02:08          And then as soon as they started running, I would stop moving

Speaker 1:          02:14          towards them. She says sometimes they would flash their teeth at her long, sharp canine teeth and then she'd edge off pretty scary. And then slowly she'd try again. I can get a little bit closer.

Speaker 4:          02:28          Mm.

Speaker 1:          02:30          30 feet,

Speaker 3:          02:33          20 feet

Speaker 1:          02:35          until finally after a couple of months I got close enough so that I could see their faces. I could record and begin to recognize them as individuals and they could recognize me. That's when things started to shift.

Speaker 1:          02:53          It was like they realized that I was a social animal like them and that we could negotiate the distance between us. How does that work? I started by just talking to them, telling them that I wasn't a threat in English or in gratefulness. Yet all mammals recognize that a, um, fairly high pitched voice is someone who's not threatening as opposed to a very deep voice, which scares them. So I would talk to them in a light tone of voice to reassure them. Finally, I got to the point where I could be just a few feet from them and nobody would even glance at me. And what if one comes up to you and goes or whatever they do. Then I would think it was a warthog at Boone grunt sound like, Huh, Huh, Huh, Huh, okay. They smack their lips in between grunts the fee if they do that to you.

Speaker 1:          03:58          And they're getting closer. What do you do? You would respond in kind or what do you do? Yes. Sometimes I would respond in kind with it. With the grant. It's not polite. If someone says something to you to just act like a rock leaves that, would that be an insult? Yes. Say hello when I say hello, it's excellence, but isn't this one of these rules of field biology? Aren't you supposed to act like you're not there and they'll act like you're not? Yeah, but it doesn't really work that way. They're social animals and they know that you are, so your solution was to become, as I figured it's you're like you be try to become even very shy. Baboo yeah, shy and pretty boring. And did that work? Did you pick 10 I found myself very naturally sitting the way that many baboons do, which is they stick their legs out in front of them and they hold their toes.

Speaker 1:          04:53          The longer I was with them, the more, well completely automatic it became for me to be shy by Boone. I didn't have to think about it. I just was, as this progressed as are you beginning to feel like you're a shy bubble? Yeah, I felt increasingly, uh, aware of my animal self. I mean the scientist is doing the things the scientists needs to do, but I think I was kind of in this a sub universe. Me and the baboons I was going where they went and resting when they rested and walking when they want. And one day she says she saw a beautiful baby gazelle prancing by and the baboons pouched on the animal rifted apart to eat it. And watching Barbara admits that she salivated. Yeah, I did. I couldn't help it. And I am a vegetarian, but she says the real transforming moment was she was out on the plains one day and [inaudible] I got caught in this pouring rain and lost the baboons. So I headed downhill to toward the lake because that was the way home. And when I got to the beach it was still boring. So I [inaudible] did to this hut. There were these little, um, fishermen's huts on the beach that were empty, completely dark inside. And after I was in there for a minute or two, my eyes started adjusting to the dark and first thing I noticed were these sort of lumpy shapes. And then I realized that there were bad balloons in there. And as my vision got better, I I could see about 15 or 20 members of my troop who had gone into the hut probably just before me. I had the same idea that I had.

Speaker 5:          07:09          And um, I,

Speaker 1:          07:13          I was quite touched that they were silent when I moved in there and that nobody, you know, nobody said, are you doing in here? This is our hot, they were just silent. I think someone even shifted over slightly to make room for me. And we just sat there for about 15 minutes,

Speaker 1:          07:34          started to kind of steam up, you know, from their breath and they smell it kinda like grass and leaves cause that's what they've been eating. It's a nice smell. Did you ever think for even that at all a while, maybe in that hut was the moment. Do you ever think that you had done something close to some kind of trespass or, ah, did you steal something here? I, no, no, no, no. That was just in a weird, we are so loose used to this dividing line. There's humans on one side and then there's all the other animals on the other side and we don't meet up. But if you go back in evolutionary time, I mean, that line wasn't there. So rather than feeling like I was stealing something, I felt like I was retrieving something that was my heritage. Hmm. It felt so completely natural to just be with them, to not be doing anything, to just be [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          09:03          Barbara Smiths now spends her days in Ann Arbor, Michigan, cheesy teachers here at the beak university, and her African days are well there now a couple of decades old.
