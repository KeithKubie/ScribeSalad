Speaker 1:          00:01          So you remember pastor was very fond of, of, uh, received making tartaric acid. So when he'd travel around, he would look for samples of tartaric acid. They're very, uh, detailed accounts that he published to these travels. I haven't found this one, so I'm not sure it's true. It may be apocryphal, but it was told me by the guy who taught me organic chemistry. So I pass it on to you for what it's worth because it makes a good point. He said that posture was in Alsace, that wine producing region in northeast France and in the town of Tom, he found in a pharmacy a bottle of receiving weak acid that was moldy. So remember receiving acids, the 50, 50 mixture. So since he liked receive mic acid, and in fact it was becoming rare. It's not a very common product. Mostly you get the handed stuff. So we took it back and cleaned it up, got rid of the, the, uh, mold that was growing on it. And what he found was that after he had purified it, it was the unnatural. The left hand did not the one you normally get. Can you see an explanation for that? Why did had the apothecary mislabeled it? Because he thought he could get a higher price for receiving me confer tartaric acid or might have been innocent. Zack, what? What would, what did the mold do?

Speaker 1:          01:33          Didn't convert the mold. Eight. The natural stuff converted it into something completely different. Leaving the unnatural one. Okay. Remember the smell of the car owns natural things, enzymes and so on can distinguish between the two hands and naturally the stuff that normally eats tartaric acid is going to eat normal tartaric acid, not the unusual ones. So it left the unusual one. The penicillium glaucoma had eaten the Rr. Okay. So that's one way of doing ras, of doing resolution to get rid of wanting antitumor from a receiving mixture, leaving the other one. Uh, because Daya Steri Americ reactions have different rates. It's a right hand shaking or right hand versus the right hand shaking the lefthand. They're just different. So one will go faster than the other. So if you react Uracil Rasamayi with some chiral reagent, of course you have to use only one hand of that other thing you add in there, but then you'll react with one more than the other.

Speaker 1:          02:34          It could be even a catalyst so that it doesn't get consumed for an enzyme, for example. But that's not nature's way because it's very inefficient to make both and then destroy one. What nature does is prepare only wanting a a tumor. And you can do that. Prepare only won by starting with something that's already a single lien, a Auntie Maria and building on that. Or you can use a reagent which is resolved that will that because Daya Steri Americ rates are different. We'll pretend to produce one, uh, one of the two enantiomers. So here's an example of this molecule we've been talking about Asi seven, three, eight, nine, with its 19 asymmetric centers that's made artificially commercially. Uh, and this is where those 19 centers came from. Five of them came from starting materials that they bought as a single hand, but the rest were all made.

Speaker 1:          03:28          One of them was done by chromatography. They have chromatography columns about this big around and this high with Cairo stuff inside. So you pass your thing through one hand to goes through a little faster than the other because it's Di Diet, dietary Americ interaction with the packing one comes through quicker and they actually do that for one of the centers. But the others are all done by reactions that preferentially give one center rather than the other three of them are ones that everybody knew which one they would give the other ones. They just had to hope and and fiddle around with different reactions until they found one that would do the trick. So anyhow, they were able to generate these 19 stereo centers. Now we're left with a problem that that incidentally is all we're going to have for the exam on Friday. Okay. So now we're on to other stuff that will be covered on the final exam and in particular return to this question about the tartaric acid. Remember there's d plus and l minus cause you have l plus and d minus

Speaker 2:          04:32          of a different compound.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Why not? What does D or l mean in this context?

Speaker 2:          04:40          That's Andrew.

Speaker 1:          04:47          It means which way it rotates the light. Right? And the plus means the same thing as d. So it's redundant, this particular nomenclature. But there's a question mark because when fee Fisher just guest remember, and it could easily have been the opposite. So which way is it? Right? So if we knew, if we knew how optical activity worked, then by measuring the Abdel activity, we'd know which of those structures is right. Okay. But we don't know that at least, I don't know that. Now there's a lot of knowledge about this, but it's a very, very tough problem. Fortunately. Uh, there's a book by Lawrence Baron called molecular light scattering and optical activity, which goes into this stuff. And I see professor of a care, oh, so we have a copy of the book. That's great. But even better than that, we have Lawrence baron or a copy of, or a coffee of Lawrence Baron. Perhaps it's the mirror image of Lawrence Baron. So he's going to tell us how this works.

Speaker 2:          05:56          So we've got the stuff on your

Speaker 3:          05:58          collar and there is your clicker. Okay, well, good morning everybody. I was both from delighted and dismayed at the same time when professor McBride asked me to try and, uh, uh, thinks well to address you this morning, delighted to have the opportunity to talk science to some of America's brightest budding young scientists, but also dismayed that he asked me to try and explain the molecular origin of optical rotation optical activity. It's a very subtle, difficult, delicate problem that's exercise some of the finest minds in physics and chemistry for the last hundred years. But anyway, let's see how it goes towards the end. I think I may be presenting some stuff that's sort of beyond the boundaries of your current knowledge, but anyway, it can at least pass in front of your eyes. So can I run a t then beans as you well know, right or left hand Ignis it pervades much of modern science from the physics of elementary particles through organic stereochemistry to the structure and behavior of the molecules of life with a lot more besides that comes up in what's called nonlinear optics involving intense lasers, nano technology materials, electrical engineering, pharmaceuticals, astrobiology and origin of life.

Speaker 3:          07:32          So it's, it's, it's a very important theme in modern science. Now, first of all though, I'll, I'll tell you a little bit about Lord Calvin. He was the first person to introduce the word [inaudible] Allity into science. He was professor of natural philosophy and Glasgow, which is my home university, um, through, um, most of his career. He will all of his career. He was one of the giants of physics of the, of the 19th century. Um, he's best known for inventing the absolute, uh, Kelvin temperature scale. Now, he was originally, his original name was William Thompson, but then he became famous and became, so William Thompson. Then he became even more famous. So they made him a lord. And when you're made a law in the UK, you choose your title from some place that's dear to your heart, may be your home area. He took his title from the, the name of the river, Calvin, which runs through the university park in Glasgow.

Speaker 3:          08:36          So whenever you use the absolute temperature scale now in the future, you can picture this idyllic scene. Anyway. So he was the first to introduce the word Chi reality into science. And here's his definition, which you'll be familiar with. I call any geometrical figure or group of points chiral and say, but it has chi Rolla, if it's image in the Plain Mirror, ideally realized cannot be brought into coincidence with itself. That was in his Baltimore lectures. So he's just emphasizing the non super imposed the ability of the mirror image, the team as of a or a molecule. But of course the whole subject started uh, earlier with the wonderful work of Louie pastor who showed, um, mirror image chiral molecule show optical rotation of equal magnitude but opposite sign, which was an epoch making discovery. So you've come across then this a the fundamental manifestation of optical activity, which is natural optical rotation.

Speaker 3:          09:38          You put linearly polarized light beam into a sample, say sample of a nicer tropic collection of chiral molecules, like a sugar solution and it will come out the other side with the plane of polarization rotated through some angle. And if you put it in the mirror image version, you'll get an equal but opposite sense of optical rotation. Now it's not to be confused with something called magnetic optical rotation. The faraday effect, I've just mentioning this to you. You've probably haven't come across the faraday effect yet, but you may do later on in your studies or in your professional life. So I'll mentioned the faraday effect. Faraday discovered in 1846 that a chiral samples, not, not no, no optical out, no natural uptick in activity there. If you apply a static magnetic field parallel to the light beam, that will induce an optical rotation. And if you put in, if you reverse the direction of the magnetic field relative to the light beam, you'll get an equal and opposite sense of optical rotation.

Speaker 3:          10:45          Um, you know, it would even work say for a sample of water, for instance, any material we'll show a faraday effect. But this has been a source of much confusion. In fact, um, uh, to scientists. Now, Lord Kelvin was on the ball here. He knew all about it. He's, he made a statement here. He said the magnetic rotation has neither right handed or left handed quality. That is to say no Kyron city. It's got nothing to do with [inaudible]. This was perfectly understood by Faraday and made clear in his writings there. Even to the present day, we frequently find the chiral rotation of the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization class together in a manner against which Faraday's original description contains ample warning. Well, Lord Kelvin would be turning in his grave today, a hundred years later because you still see papers, um, which involve the faraday effect in some way or other.

Speaker 3:          11:44          And in the introduction they taught grandly of inducing Chi reality with a magnetic field that is completely wrong. Um, just uh, for the record, it probably, uh, beyond your knowledge at the moment. Chiral phenomenon like natural optical rotation, they're characterized by what's called tiny even pseudo scale observables. A pseudo scalar is a number that changes sign under reflection or inversion. We'll, we'll leave it at that. But so that, that's for the record. But w well, it turns out that the essential cemetery characteristics of natural and magnetic optical rotation a completely different and you need different sorts of, um, you know, quantum molecular quantum states, different characteristics to support them. But we won't pursue that right now. Back to natural optical rotation. Um, for now we bring in circularly polarized light. So in order to detect molecular [inaudible], you must have some sort of chiral prob well, what we're using here is right and left circularly polarized light beans.

Speaker 3:          13:01          They are actually mirror image chiral systems so they can be used as chiral probes. So here's a representation of a right circularly polarized lightbeam. Um, now you, you know, that light is involves, um, electromagnetic oscillations in space. And usually you, you just think of the oscillating electric vector of a lightweight, even if it's linearly polarized, it's oscillating in, in one plane. There's actually also an oscillating magnetic field vector that's oscillates perpendicular to the electric. We'll come back to that later. This is where just looking at the oscillating electric vector here, so if it's linearly polarized, it's plain polarized. It's just oscillating in a plane, but circularly polarized light as well as the oscillation in this direction. You also have an electric factor oscillating perpendicular, but I'm 90 degrees out of phase, and what happens is, um, you get this circular polarization. Now this picture here, this represents the instantaneous electric vectors at different points in space, in the direction of propagation along the z direction.

Speaker 3:          14:21          And so here we are. That's just a showing that just connected the ends of the instantaneous electric vectors. And there it is. The left circularly polarized. Anyway, you can see that at the very least, those are, those are Chiral, those are helix and those appear image colonel systems. Now Ah, here we go. This, this, this, an extra sciencey stuff that professor, but bride added to my, uh, my presentation. He doesn't like it was simple and static. Uh, anyway, so there we are. So, so now if you look at the wave, if you just look at the electric vector through in a fixed plane, as the light wave is propagating, there's the electric vector and it will rotate in the fixed plane. So rotating clockwise, that defines right circularly polarized light. And here we go.

Speaker 3:          15:21          Broke tasting counter clockwise. That's left circularly polarized light. Okay. So where we now have, um, a chiral optical probe circularly polarized light. Now chiral molecules respond slightly differently to right and left circularly polarized light. Um, you know, and I mean, an extreme example is say in the world of, of engineering, you, you know, you can't fit a lefthanded not onto a right handed bolt. That's an extreme example of different, uh, you know, uh, uh, chiral interactions. Well, it's obviously a much more delicate than that. Here point is right and left circularly polarized light interact just slightly differently with, with a molecule of a given try reality. Anyway, there's a differential absorption of right and left circularly polarized light that corresponds to a phenomenon called circular dichroic awesome, which is the basis of a widely used form of spectroscopy, used to study a chiral molecules. But now what gives rise to optical rotation is a difference in refractive index towards, um, uh, of right and left circularly polarized light beans.

Speaker 3:          16:42          Now linearly polarized light. You can describe it as a coherent superposition of right and left circularly polarized waves of equal amplitude. Coherent means they're in phase with each other rather than being, you know, random. They're oscillating in phase with some fixed phase relationship. So, for example, now here's a linearly polarized, um, um, light beam, but you can decompose it into a super position of a left circular and the right circular component. You see it when those are at the top, they're reinforcing and uh, you've got the maximum linearly polarized vector up here. As they come away, left and right, they will tend to increasingly cancel and that will decrease. And when they're this way and this way you'll have zero, um, electric field back to there. And as you come down, that will increase again. So you, so you can, you can decompose a lineage, linearly polarized light into a coherent superposition of, of left and right, um, waves.

Speaker 3:          17:50          Now, refractive index corresponds to a velocity through a medium. Um, so if there's a difference in refractive index for right and left circularly polarized light beams, that means there's a slight difference in the velocity of the right and left circularly polarized light beams going through the medium. So the phase relation between the two contra rotating electric factors will change. And you can easily see this will give you a, a rotation in the plane of polarization. You see if, if there's a difference in velocity, then it cements that this back to will this electric vectors of the left component will be here and the right component here. And if you take the results and you see it's, it's, it's no longer, um, where it was. So this is a simple picture of how optical rotation develops in terms of, um, different refractive indices of the right or left components.

Speaker 3:          18:52          Um, now there's, um, there's a, a picture in Atkins physical chemistry. He tries to illustrate this there. He's got the linearly polarized been coming through and you've got the, but he's broken it down into the left and right. And he's saying the two velocities are slightly different and that gives you the results. Optical rotation, um, you can easily develop an expression for the angle of rotation as a function of the difference in refractive indices for left and right circularly polarized light beams. And it's also, it's a function of the path length. Obviously the longer the path links, the, the, the more, uh, rotation we'll develop. And, um, it's, there's, there's the wavelength there in the denominator. In fact, I mean this is the secret. There's path length. That's the secret of how you get a measurable rotation. Cause this is an incredibly tiny effect. If it was just a single molecule event, you're looking at the polarization changes, you, you wouldn't see anything.

Speaker 3:          19:52          They're so tiny, but you can build up this rotation over long path link centimeters or even meters. Um, in fact, um, if, if you go to Google and Google images and just Google circularly polarized light, you'll find lots of sites there which, which described polarized light and they provide beautiful, um, simulations, animations of, of, of this effect here. I didn't want to download any and try and show them here, but I would encourage you to go to that. But go and look in particular at this site here, ends in dot u that's comes from, uh, an institute of enzymology and Buddha Pass. They've got some beautiful simulations of this optical rotation process and another more exotic a polarization effects as light propagates through latter. Now let's try and, uh, so that's, that's just, um, uh, what would you say? A phenomenal logical description. And in fact, that's where most physical chemistry textbooks stop.

Speaker 3:          21:02          And in fact, Atkins physical chemistry stops at that point. And then just, there's just sort of hand waving saying, okay, you know, right and left circularly polarized light interacts like knee differently with the chiral molecule and they leave it at that and they don't attempt to try and give you a picture and a molecular detail. But a professor McBride wanted me to try and attempt this. So just as a, as a start, as this is a simple, simple picture, a simple scattering picture of, of optical rotation. Now a circularly polarized and lightwave bouncing from one group to the other, um, as it scatters from a simple two group chiral structure, we'll sample the Chi [inaudible]. So here we have a simple two group chiral molecular structure. So we've got to a chiral groups held in a rigid twisted arrangement. I think that's, that's lefthanded I've got there.

Speaker 3:          21:59          Um, and you can break down, you look at most chiral molecules, just look at the bonds. You can often break them down. You can see these sorts of two groups structures, uh, um, throughout. Um, anyway, uh, so a [inaudible] model of optical rotation is that the lightwave it bounces from one group to the other before coming off and getting involved in the generating the optical rotation phenomenon. Um, but you can see it's, it's sampling the [inaudible] as it bounces from one to the other. So if the, if the light beam is right, circularly polarized, that bouncing process will have a slightly different amplitude as we say, from if it's left circularly polarized. So that gives you a simple picture. It's worth mentioning that this is the basis of something called the dynamic coupling model of optical activity that was developed by somebody called John Kirkwood, who was a chairman of this department in the 1950s.

Speaker 3:          23:04          Um, well now we really have to have to grasp the nettle at this point because you just, it's hopeless and messing around with these, these simple models. They, they, they don't get to anywhere as regards prediction, you know, uh, relating a structure to sign and magnitude of, of optical activity. You have to go to the quantum mechanics. So now this was the expression for the optical rotation in terms of the refractive index difference for less than rights that can be polarized light. Now you can develop this using something called quantum mechanical perturbation theory and you develop an expression for the rotation angle in terms of this incomprehensible looking stuff. But let me just try and give you a feel for what it, uh, what it's telling us that the heart of it is this so called rotational strength, which involves the so scale, a product of an electric dipole and a magnetic dipole transition moment.

Speaker 3:          24:23          So what we've got here is there's the ground state of the molecule. N J is some excited electronic state and mew is the electric dipole operator that's connecting the ground to the excited state. And the lightwave is, is, is interacting, is coupling with this electric dipole operator and it's driving the transition. And it's this, these electric dipole transitions like this, that's the behind conventional spectroscopy. You've done probably UV and infrared spectroscopy, but now what we have in addition is the same transition but now brought about through m, that's called a magnetic dipole operator. And that's activated by this oscillating magnetic components of the light wave. Um, and so you have this so called scale of products that, so myu dot m that would be mew, x Mx plus mew, y m y plus music. Then said, some of you have probably done vectors, maybe others haven't, but okay, so that, that's the heart of it.

Speaker 3:          25:34          But this is a very important feature here. We're summing over all excited states, Jay, all excited states. So the whole plethora of excited states of a car or molecule, um, come in here and some can can give you one particular excited state can give you a positive contribution to the optical rotation. Another one, a negative, you know, so it's a very, very subtle problem and um, and you have to consider them all carefully. So optical activity ultimately originates an interference between electric and magnetic dipole transitions during the light scattering process. That's the sort of the heart of it.

Speaker 3:          26:20          Now, let me just show you how this works out. I can now give you, uh, uh, a chemical, uh, an interpretation in terms of, um, of a real and highly important system in inorganic chemistry. The carbonyl Chroma fall, I believe you have come across the carbon are Kromer for a lot of important organic molecules contain this Carbonell chromophores. It gives rise to a transition in the near ultraviolet at about 290 nanometers and it's widely used in physical, organic chemistry and, um, it's called the end to Pi star transition. Now, the carbonyl group itself, there it is. That's not chiral. That's, that's got to play in a cemetery. So it by itself, it's not go, there's going to be no optical activity there. But you see in this particular molecule here, three Mikael cyclohexanone fat molecule overall, his car, or there's a chiral centered there. So that carbonyl group is experiencing a chiral perturbation or through space perturbation from the rest of the chiral molecule.

Speaker 3:          27:35          And that induces [inaudible] into the electronic transitions of the carbonyl group and in juices, optical rotation and circular Dyke Rosen. Well, let's look at this in a bit more detail. This a famous into to Pi star transition. So here we've got the, the sigma bonding or of the carbonyl group. There's the pie bonding orbitals made up of two, uh, uh, p Pi on carbon and oxygen. And, uh, here is a loan here, sorry. Here is a p y or before. So, so those are, those are px or bottles. That's, that's The p y or buffalo on the oxygen feed, electrons in. And so you've got to the ground state, you've got to there to there and you've got two electrons in the pee while, but also those are lone pair electrons, so the lowest order, but the lowest transition now is the, the p y to Pi staff often called the enterprise star transition.

Speaker 3:          28:41          You're promoting one electron from the Pyr bottle up to the Pi star or Bethel. And that's the, that's the origin of, of this, uh, transition. Well, let's, uh, now, okay, now this transition, it happens to be fully back detic dipole aloud, but completely electric dipole for bitten. What happens. This electric dipole character is induced by mixing, well, I'm giving the example of of a, of a higher oxygen, d y Zed orbital into the Pi Star or buckle. Now professor, but bride has been messing around with, by presentation here. Let's see what he's done. So here, so here's the, here's the, an orbital, uh, the, the pee while battle of the carbonyl group. There's the Pi Star. Oh No, here we go. So this is now and then, but yeah, so here you can see in that enterprise star transition, there's, there's a net rotation of, of charge, a rotation of charge. And that's, that's the essence of the magnetic dipole allowed character, magnetic dipole and transitions involve a rotation of charge for this change in the orientation. That way, right? So what's, ah, okay, now here we go again. Now here's a d y, zed or Bethel. Now one could consider a whole loads of other possible orbitals to big sin. But this is the simplest one to just to illustrate the, the idea here. So there's a d y, zed orbital.

Speaker 3:          30:41          Now going from you c and Two d y Zed. You, if you add those orbitals together, the, that, the, uh, you, you tend to get a displacement of charge in the, in the, um, in the zed direction. So now you'll see you have a combination of a rotation of charge with a displacement of charge and rotation plus translation. Gibbs, he listened. He, and here we go. Yeah. So by mixing in a little bit of the, um, this dx said orbital, um, you get this w which is electric dipole allowed you get this, um, this, he listed it in, in the transition.

Speaker 3:          31:36          No, in fact, um, the, the rotation of of charged generates a magnetic dipole perpendicular to the, to the, um, uh, plane of rotation and it's pointing that way. So you'll get a, an mz said components or components of the magnetic moment along the zed axis. Here you can see immediately you've got a component of the electric dipole along the zed axis. So that generates a music and zed component, uh, from this scale, a product of mew, and then in, in the rotational strength. So this is a sort of making a meal of it here now. So we're just putting down these so called quantum mechanical matrix elements. So here we've got end to Pi Star with little bit of that mixed in and that's fully magnetic dipole aloud. Then we have end to Pi Star, which is forbidden electric dipole. But mixing that in gives you a little bit of dipole character.

Speaker 3:          32:41          And so you now get a nonzero contribution to the rotational strength. However, you wouldn't want to go, go on and, and, and actually calculate the optical rotation of the carbon carbonyl chromophores in some situation from this because as I said, there's many other excited electronic states you could have also considered, which may be giving opposite, um, contributions to the rotational strength. You have to sum them all. And to do that you now have to go too modern, um, ab initio quantum chemistry, quantum chemical calculations. There's wonderful programs out now or from galcion and Delta and you can calculate all sorts of molecular properties with, with quite good, a very good accuracy in, in many cases. But this now turns it all into, into a black box procedure. You just feed in appropriate atomical befalls and press buttons. And turn handles whatever you do for these calculations and out we'll pop some, um, physical quantity.

Speaker 3:          33:51          So, so you can calculate this, this whole thing, ab initio and taking in a however many excited states in the, in the, some are necessary and you can, you can calculate that the size and magnitude of the optical rotation for a given absolute configuration. So you, you would feed into the calculation whether it's the s or the are absolute stereochemistry. So you'd put that in and that will determine the sign of the optical rotation that comes out. And so, um, I mean in this particular case, this small molecule, the s absolute configuration goes with the plus rotation and the Argos with the minus. Um, so from the calculation, then you can relate the sign of the optical rotation to the absolute stereo chemistry, but you wouldn't want to stake your life on it because it's not completely reliable. You, it's usually gives the right answer for smaller molecules, but not always.

Speaker 3:          34:53          And for example, if, if this was, um, uh, as, as you know, and I think you'll hear more after my talk here, um, many drugs now are our chiral and come drug companies, um, like to market now single in TM aversions of the drug. So it's a tremendously important problem for them to, to know with absolute certainty the absolute configuration of the particular enantiomer their marketing because they, if they make a mistake and specify the wrong absolute configuration in their pattern, they can literally lose billions of dollars. Um, anyway, there's the, there's the famous, the importance of, of Chi reality in, in drugs is, uh, exemplified by the famous thalidomide the case. But I won't elaborate that anymore. I think professor McBride is going to tell you some more of that in more detail. I should say that the, the, the, the corner stone, the definitive method for determining absolute configuration has for some years now been something called the by foot method of anomalous x ray scattering, which again, professor, have you told them about that?

Speaker 3:          36:12          Yeah, yeah. That's the definitive method. But it's sort of cheating because you're actually seeing, you're seeing it through through ex-ray eyes. Um, but even then they can, you can occasionally make mistakes, but I should just mention also there are some newer optical activity techniques involving something called vibration. A lot to collectivity. Here we've been looking at optical activity in electronic transitions using visible light, but in recent years, newer methods measuring up to connectivity in vibrational transitions have come along and these are actually comparable with ex-ray anomalous x ray scattering for reliability of absolute configuration. That's because the, these calculations are much more reliable for this, these vibration, a lot to collectivity phenomena than electronic months. Well, that's about it. That's all I would like to say now. So thank you for listening.

Speaker 2:          37:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          37:25          okay.

Speaker 2:          37:26          Oh, I'm just wondering if the magnitude of the faraday rotation can ever interfere with the measurement of optical rotation that the material that is to say there's one situation polarimeter and proximity to an Nmr spectrometer, for example. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          37:55          no, I know you wouldn't need to worry about that at all. Now you might need a reasonable strength of magnetic field just applied directly through the phone.

Speaker 2:          38:06          Yeah, Lucas. It's just in my understanding, uh, the end of high star is, uh, men are dying all loud electric deputy forbidding [inaudible] to lie. Then it goes too deep, uh, at z as well in order to get in there. That contribution. Yes. Uh, okay. Thanks. Good luck. Thank you. So, uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:01          this is just the plug, this apple doing. The reason professor Beran is here as he's the Tuttleman lecture and Jonathan Edwards College, so he's giving a talk for the history majors and so on. But it'll be very interesting for any, why didn't, I think since we're into Chi rally, you would enjoy this particularly this afternoon and Davies Auditorium at five o'clock. But there's the question, who cares? No offense, but who cares? Why do we care about ty rally? Well, the professor Beran hinted at it. Living thing is care because they're Tyrell, right? So which one they react with. Okay. The Food and Drug Administration cares for the same reason with respect to medications. You might be taking drug companies care a lot. And there are lawyers and the u s patent office care a lot, right? Which is generated the thing called a chiral switch. Most drugs that used to be developed were developed as Rasamayi.

Speaker 1:          40:00          It's cause it was difficult to separate the two hands. But if your patent runs out on the Rasamayi and you can resolve it and now sell just one of them, and if it's better and the FDA will approve it and you can convince people that that's the one they should buy, then you can go back to not having to compete with generic drug companies anymore in charge. $5 a pill instead of 50 cents a pill died. So this so-called called chiral switch to go from receiving mic to a single lane. And humor is a big movement nowadays. For example, consider this pain reliever. Let's figure out what it is. Do you remember what that group is? Four carbons in that sort of Mercedes structure. You know what that, what that group's called this the this. What we're doing for the rest of the lecture here, however it is, is actually review for the exam on Friday. You're not specifically responsible for it, but it's review. So we know that group

Speaker 2:          41:00          isobutyl. Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:03          And what acid is that with three carbons? Do you know

Speaker 2:          41:08          the first fatty acid? Propionic acid. And in the middle we have fennel group. Okay. So what's the name of the drug? Sherwin. Ibuprofen. Advil or

Speaker 1:          41:34          Motrin. Okay. Now in this case you have a chiral center there, right? Cause there's a hydrogen on there that we don't see. And the [inaudible] is the pain reliever it said to be. So anyhow. And the R is inactive. Right? But it's marketed as Uracil mate. Right. One might try doing a chiral switch and selling only the s but the trouble is that it very quickly rast summize is inside you. So it wouldn't be doing any good. Right? Cause you'd do all the work of selling the s and then it would become our immediately when you eat it. And here's another one. This is the one that professor Beran was referred to, which is a sedative Felita MyEd. And there's the chiral center in that one because there's an h on there. So the s form is a sedative, but the r form, at least it said is to ride engine, which means it makes monsters and it's not so funny because it was sold as Uracil mate from 1957 to 62 and never in the u s because the FDA didn't, they were lucky it never approved it.

Speaker 1:          42:35          But in Europe it caused 10,000 birth defects. Children born without arms out, legs, things like that. So it was a tragedy. Uh, but this one also undergoes in Vivo Rassam causation. Okay. These you can find rate constants for these. It's curious that the rate of ESCO into our and the rate of are going to s are not the same. It must, there must, there's got to be more to it than that, but one has to be more stable than the other of these mirror images. If that's true, it may be that the rates aren't exactly true, but if so, they must be bound to something that makes chiral that makes one of the more stable than the other. Anyhow, that's how fast they go back and forth. And this is how fast they get eliminated from the body. One gets eliminated much faster than the other.

Speaker 1:          43:20          And if you put these things together, you can see how the concentration should vary with time if it's going according to that rates. So the blue one, the one that's good for you quickly drops off the bad one. The Toronto region grows quickly, so you have maybe two hours of 24 hours where you've got a lot more of the good ones and the bad one. So essentially this drug is completely off limits, especially for any women that could conceivably under any circumstances be pregnant. Okay. So, uh, but it's a wonderful drug for things like leprosy and so on. Uh, uh, David here is a MD as well as the professor of chemistry and he'd probably know more about that, but it's a wonderful drug for certain things in that, right? That's right. That's right. It's still actually in common usage for anxiety. But there are all sorts of warnings and letters this big about if you're, if you have a chance of getting pregnant, stay away from this baby, right? If you're a male patient taking it and your wife is pregnant or likely to become pregnant, you're encouraged not to take it. Wow.

Speaker 1:          44:25          Wow. Okay, so now here's, here's a drug. We're going to look up the name of this one. It's a really cooperative a name, right? So let's just use this as a practice about nomenclature. Okay, so that thing there is called amid all, and the one h tells where, which one has a hydrogen on it, right? Okay. So that's the position one. And that is the benzene ring. So Ben, so it's bins of Midazolam. That group on the right and you number it. Remember it was one age, there's an h on the nitrogen one there, and you go around the ring a number in that conventional way. Okay? Now, but then you notice that there's something on the, on the number five and there's something on the number two carbons, have that ring on five. There's a meth oxy group, which appears first among all the things in this [inaudible] named here, not the thing that's on to why is the methoxy group first, do you remember what the rule is? How do you arrange the substituent groups?

Speaker 2:          45:29          Angela Alphabetically?

Speaker 1:          45:33          Amazon's going to be the first one. Okay. So five methoxy and then two is so final that s with an o audit is called soul final group. Okay. So it's two, so final, but now there are all sorts of curly brackets in square brackets and so on to tell what's attached to that. Okay. So attached to that is uh, uh, is methyl group, but the methyl is substituted. So its methyl, so final. Okay. That's the, that's the, uh, currently the square brackets. Okay. Now what's on the methyl, there's a purity in group that benzene with a nitrogen at this parody in and it's substituted on the methyl at its own to position. The two position to the purity in is what's attached to the methyl. So it's uh, so it's two para dental, the end, but now on that in the four position is methoxy and methoxy comes alphabetically before methyl, not before d but before methyl.

Speaker 1:          46:25          And you don't count the die, right? So there's the name of that compound and this stuff is a drug. It's a gastric proton pump inhibitor. So it treats acid reflux disease and it's the world's largest selling drug in the year 2006 point $2 billion. And it's called a MEP Rizal or [inaudible] Sec. And you've seen probably some of you at least have seen boxes of [inaudible] sac. I don't, you hope you don't have to take it like I do occasionally. This is called OTC. We're going to be talking about that on Monday. Okay. So there it is. Now get your glasses up because can you see this it, can you see any sort of three dimensions here? What's in front or what's behind? Can anybody tell?

Speaker 1:          47:17          Do you have any luck and see it in three dimensions? Some people can't see it, but most of you, like 95% of you shouldn't be able to see. It's not a really high quality three dimensions and the, because the computer, the projector doesn't do it exactly right for the colors. So one IC is only wanted one sees all of the other. Anybody see? Okay. Now what is chiral here? Can you see why this thing is chiral? There's no carbon with four different things on it, but what makes it hand it? Can you see? In fact there's no group that has four different things on it.

Speaker 1:          47:54          Any suggestions? Uh, Lucas sulfur sulfur has an unshared pair, an oxygen and two different art groups and which, which is pointed out toward you. Okay. Can you see it enough in three dimensions with the glasses to see that to see which is pointing out Paris? Yeah, it's the unshared pair that's pointing out. So if you use your thumbs and not recognize that the unshared pair has the lowest atomic number, zero, right, then you could do it and you'll find out that that particular when drawn there is the s e a n d A. Umer. Okay. So it's normally a map resolve. [inaudible] Prosecco, OTC are the Rasamayi. But this one that's drawn here is the s isomer and it's called what asset map? Rizal. That's the name of it. Right? And or Nexium. Right? And it's the s isomer, right? So this is the product of one of these chiral switches where for a long time the stuff was marketed as harassing rate and now they market it as a single antitumor Nexium.

Speaker 1:          49:00          And we tried this one last time, so we're not going to spend time on it right now. Uh, that's what the class looks like when they're doing this. It's fun for me to see you. Okay. But there are other ways of doing the stereo view and you can use Paris, a pair of periscopes like this, right? And the way that works, of course, the point is for each eye to see a different image. So if you want to try those and look at this after class, feel free or borrow them. A few wish. Right? So, so what, uh, what the eyes perceive as a super position in the middle. It's like this. There are two pictures, but, and if you can do it with the glasses, you can do it probably just by looking at this picture. If you have a little while, but we don't have the little while now the right, I will see that the left eye will see that. And you see in the middle there, see the something in the same position but in slightly different projections. So, so the image in the middle of the three seems seems to be in three d. Okay. Now, uh, we don't have time to go [inaudible] we're going to do a lot of a curved Arrow staff about how reactions happen in making a map resolve. And then even more interesting in the action of, of map resolve that stops the stomach acid. But we'll have to wait until after the exam for that. Okay. Thanks again to professor Beran.
