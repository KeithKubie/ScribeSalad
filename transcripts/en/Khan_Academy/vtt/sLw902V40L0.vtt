00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.860
Let's review a little bit of what we
learned in differential calculus.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.370
Let's say we have some function S that it
gives us as

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.220
a function of time the position of a
particle in one dimension.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.903
If we were to take the derivative with
respect to time.

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:16.500
So if we were to take the derivative with
respect to time

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.080
of this function S.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.911
What are we going to get?

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.135
Well we're going to get ds, dt or the

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:29.816
rate in which position changes with
respect to time.

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:34.159
And what's another word for that, position
changes with respect to time?

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.750
Well, that's just velocity.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.680
So that we can write as velocity as a
function of time.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.980
Now, what if we were to take the
derivative of that with respect to time.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.177
So we could either view this as the second
derivative, we're

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:50.809
taking the derivative not once, but twice
of our position function.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.625
Or you could say that we're taking the

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:55.473
derivative with respect to time of our
velocity function.

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:59.524
Well this is going to be, we can write
this as, we can write

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:05.420
this as dv, dt, the rate at which velocity
is changing with respect to time.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.490
And what's another word for that?

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.000
Well, that's also called acceleration.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.480
This is going to be our acceleration as a
function of time.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.560
So, you start with the position function,
take

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.590
it, the position as a function of time.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.310
Take its derivative with respected time,
you get velocity.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.800
Take that derivative with respected time,
you get acceleration.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.210
Well, you could go the other way around.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.290
If you started with acceleration, if you
started

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.160
with acceleration, and you were to take
the antiderivative.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.370
If you were to take the antiderivative of
it, the anti, anti, an antiderivative

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.860
of it is going to be, actually let me just
write it this way.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.230
So an antiderivative, I'll just use the
interval

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.290
symbol to show that I'm taking the
antiderivative.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.920
Is going to be the integral of the
anti-derivative of a of t.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.670
And this is going to give you some
expression with a plus c.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.240
And we could say, well, that's a general
form of our velocity function.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.380
This is going to be equal to our velocity
function.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.910
And to find the particular velocity
function, we would have

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.090
to know what the velocity is at a
particular time.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.390
And then, we could solve for our c.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.780
Whether then, if we're able to do that and
we were to take the anti-derivative again.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.173
Then, now we're taking the anti-derivative
of our velocity function,

00:02:24.173 --> 00:02:27.574
which would give us some expression as a
function of t.

00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:29.058
And then, some other constant.

00:02:29.058 --> 00:02:32.576
And, if we could solve for that constant,
then we know, then we know

00:02:32.576 --> 00:02:36.110
what the position is going to be, the
position is a function of time.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.890
Just like this, it would have some, plus c
here if we

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.920
know our position at a given time we could
solve for that c.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.430
So now that we've reviewed it a little
bit, but we've rewritten it in.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.890
I guess you could say, thinking of it not
just from

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.090
the differential point of view from the
derivative point of view.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.660
But thinking of it from the
anti-derivative point of view.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.290
Lets see if we can solve an interesting
problem.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.750
Lets say that we know that the
acceleration of a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.950
particle is a function of time is equal to
one.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.938
So it's always accelerating at one unit
per,

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.548
and you know, I'm not giving you time.

00:03:11.548 --> 00:03:14.950
Let, let's just say that we're thinking in
terms of meters and seconds.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.170
So this is one meter per second, one meter
per second-squared, right over here.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.380
That's our acceleration as a function of
time.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.155
And, let's say we don't know the velocity
expressions, but we know

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:29.318
the velocity at a particular time and we
don't know the position expressions.

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:32.212
But we know the position at a particular
time.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:35.250
So, let's say we know that the velocity,
at time three.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.420
Let's say three seconds is negative three
meters per second.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.770
And actually I wanna write the units here,
just to make it a little, a little bit.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.330
So this is meters per second squared,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.830
that's going to be our unit for
acceleration.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.500
This is our unit for velocity.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.120
And let's say that we know, let's say that
we know that the position at

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.760
time two, at two seconds is equal to
negative ten meters.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.490
So, if we're thinking in one dimension, of
if this is moving

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.140
along the number line, this is ten to the
left of the origin.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.508
So, given this information right over
here, and everything that I wrote up here.

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:14.568
Can we figure out the actual expressions
for velocity as a function of time?

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:18.890
So not just velocity at time three, but
velocity generally as a function of time.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.190
And position as a function of time.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.950
And I encourage you to pause this video
right now.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.730
And try to figure it out on your own.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.230
So let's just work through this.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.410
What is, we know that velocity, as a

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.250
function of time, is going to be the
anti-derivative.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.910
The anti-derivitive of our acceleration is
a function of time.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.250
Our acceleration is just one.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.900
So this is going to be the anti-derivitive
of this right over here

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.890
is going to be t and then we can't forget
our constant plus c.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.610
And now we can solve for c because we know
v of 3 is negative 3.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.220
So lets just write that down.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:05.385
So v of 3 is going to be equal to 3, 3
plus c.

00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:08.276
I just replaced where I saw the, the t or
every place where

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:11.580
I have the t I replaced it with this 3
right over here.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.855
Actually let me make it a little bit
clearer.

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:18.276
So v of 3, v of 3 is equal to 3 plus c,
and they

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:23.280
tell us that that's equal to negative 3.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.040
So that is equal to, that is equal to
negative 3.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.630
So what's c going to be?

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.260
So if we just look at this part of

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.480
the equation or just this equation right
over here.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:43.290
If you subtract 3 from both sides, you
get, you get c is equal to negative 6.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.660
And so now we know the exact, we know the

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.030
exact expression that defines velocity as
a function of time.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.349
V of t, v of t is equal to t, t plus

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.410
negative 6 or, t minus 6.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.380
And we can verify that.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.980
The derivative of this with respect to
time is just one.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.040
And when time is equal to 3, time minus 6
is indeed negative 3.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.730
So we've been able to figure out velocity
a s a function of time.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.460
So now let's do a similar thing to figure
out position as a function of time.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.080
We know that position is gonna be an
anti-derivative

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.830
of the velocity function, so let's write
that down.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.563
So, position, as a function of time, is
going to

00:06:30.563 --> 00:06:35.093
be equal to the anti-derivative of v of t,
dt.

00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:41.178
Which is equal to the anti-derivative of t
minus 6, dt which is

00:06:41.178 --> 00:06:47.615
equal to well the anti-derivative of t, is
t squared over 2.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:51.270
So, t squared over 2, we've seen that
before.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.139
The anti-derivative of negative 6 is
negative 6 t, and of

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.310
course, we can't forget our constant, so,
plus, plus, c.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.270
So this is what s of t is equal to, s

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.820
of t is equal to all of this business
right over here.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.480
And now we can try to solve, for our
constant.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.420
And we do that, using this information
right over here.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.780
At two seconds were at, our position is
negative two meters.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.000
So s of 2, or I could just write it this
way.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.830
Well, let me write it this way.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.530
S of 2, at 2 seconds, is going to be equal
to 2 squared over 2.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.700
That is, let's see, that's 4 over 2,
that's going to be 2.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.770
Minus 6 times 2.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:41.510
So, minus 12 + c is equal to negative 10,
is equal to negative 10.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.817
So, let's see, we get 2 minus 12 is

00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:50.320
negative, is negative 10 plus c equals
negative 10.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.270
So you add 10 to both sides you get c in
this case is equal to 0.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.630
So we figured out what our position
function is as well.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.730
The c right over here is just going to be
0.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:08.800
So our position as a function of time is
equal to t squared over 2 minus 6 t.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.320
And you can verify.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.250
When t is equal to 2, t squared over 2 is
2, minus 12 is negative 10.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.680
You take the derivative here, you get t
minus 6.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.140
And you can see and we already verified
that v of 3 is negative 3.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.060
And you take the derivative here, you get
a of t, just like that.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.150
Anyway, hopefully, you found this
enjoyable.
