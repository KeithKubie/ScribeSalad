00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:04.537
This experience will be
documented by

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.372
a mounted onboard camera.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.641
Total solitude.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.811
The terrible arrow injuries
I received to my left shoulder

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:13.679
are making it
more difficult to row,

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.215
but I'm not about to let that
ruin this relaxing sojourn

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.117
across a peaceful bay.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.586
I took a few extra painkillers

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.489
and I gotta try to limit
my range of motion.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:26.526
[chuckles]
[seagull caws]

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.327
Let's follow that bird.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.329
I don't know if
it's the cool breeze

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.498
or the sound of lapping water

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.500
or the double dose of OxyContin

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.537
or the crisp salt air,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.439
but I feel at peace in a way
that I haven't felt

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.642
in a long, long time.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:47.080
Think I'm just gonna lie back
and enjoy it.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.450
(Forrest voice-over)
But perhaps I had allowed myself
to feel too peaceful.

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:54.153
[snores]

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:57.156
[dramatic music]

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:01.027
â™ª â™ª

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.062
I've been asleep for six hours.

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:05.731
I think I must have drifted
out of the bay

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:07.500
and into the open ocean.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.036
All right, well, I guess I just
gotta row back to shore

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.671
as fast as--

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.606
Oh, no, no, no.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.441
Oh, where are the oars?!

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.643
Where are the oars?!

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:20.113
Oars!

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.681
Hello, here's my situation.

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.450
I have brought along
no food and no water

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:26.586
and no method
for signaling anyone,

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.488
and my cell phone here
doesn't get any service.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.357
I am considering using one of
my shoelaces here

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.226
as a fishing line

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.262
and pieces of my wallet as bait.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:39.132
And I only pray that
I am rescued

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:42.435
before that begins to seem like
a viable survival plan.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.641
Jesus Christ.

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.685
Fish don't eat wallets.

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.054
(Forrest voice-over)
My review of making a wish
come true

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:04.490
had left me metaphorically
lost at sea.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.660
Being literally lost at sea
was even worse.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.396
There is a flashing red light
on the camera now,

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.599
which I assume means that
the battery is running low.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:18.337
I would like to say something to
the love of my life,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.507
my--my ex-wife, Suzanne.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.144
Suzanne, I--

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.046
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna die out here.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.681
[static crackles]

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.284
[laughs]

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.219
Hello.

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:36.689
I do not know how many days
I have been at sea.

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:39.358
(Forrest voice-over)
I had been at sea for 96 days.

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.260
It is difficult to look at
this footage now,

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.496
but the mere fact of my survival

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.098
is a beautiful,
glorious miracle.

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:49.502
I've been swept into some kind
of a floating trash vortex

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:51.504
in the middle of the ocean.

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:54.173
I have been killing and eating
the sea birds

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:56.509
that perch on top of
the garbage.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.212
I've been strangling them
and snapping their necks

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.080
with my hands.

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:02.682
And it's not a bad diet.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.718
One of the things that I have
been blessed to find here

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:08.154
in this garbage island

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.289
is a battery that works
in this camera

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:12.158
so that I can continue
to talk to you

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.394
because I have had important
experiences

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:17.630
to share with you
about rowboats.

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.665
They are--
[static crackles]

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:22.235 align:start size:13% position:88%
Wow.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:24.770 align:end position:100%
You were lost at sea
for a long time.

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:26.639
Yep.
[laughs]

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.641 align:start position:0%
I want to thank anybody
who has ever contributed

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:31.344
to the great Mid-Pacific
trash flotilla.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.713
If you don't properly dispose
of your garbage,

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:34.946
you saved my life.
