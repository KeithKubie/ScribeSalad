NATHANIEL MANISTA: Welcome
to Google Developers Live.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.200
I'm Nathaniel Manista of
Google's Open Source programs

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.160
office, and I'd like to
introduce Drew Rodman.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.220
Drew is here to tell
us about his experience

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.510
with Google Summer of Code.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.464
Drew, first tell
us about yourself.

00:00:23.464 --> 00:00:25.630
DREW RODMAN: Hey Nathaniel,
thank you for having me.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.780
So my name is Drew.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.550
I'm currently a fourth
year university student,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.439
and I first participated
in Google Summer of Code

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.210
during my second
year at university,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.230
and I have had a phenomenal
experience thus far.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.730
NATHANIEL MANISTA:
How did you learn

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.584
about Google Summer
of Code, and then

00:00:40.584 --> 00:00:42.500
what made you decide
that it was the right way

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.047
to spend your summer?

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:45.630
DREW RODMAN: So I
first heard about it

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.320
through my college's
computer science department.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.730
There was a little
bit of buzz about it,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.382
apparently the chair
of my department

00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:54.840
had talked it up
a little bit, so I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.305
decided to investigate
a little bit.

00:00:58.305 --> 00:01:01.030
It ended up being a
great way for students

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.570
to get involved into open
source, who may not normally

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.994
either have the ability
or have the time.

00:01:05.994 --> 00:01:07.410
And Google Summer
of Code, I think

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.810
provides the opportunity
to really prioritize

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.030
getting involved like
that, so I happened

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.250
to pick a couple of
projects and went with it.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.975
NATHANIEL MANISTA: What was
the application process like?

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:21.725
DREW RODMAN: So the
particular application

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:25.390
I chose-- I'll speak more to
my most recent organization

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.130
--but the project I chose was
called Melange, which provides

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.330
a platform for running
open source contribution

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.700
workflows, mainly Google Summer
of Code and Google Code It.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.957
The way I happened
to pick that project,

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:41.540
I was just looking through-- it
could be a little overwhelming

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.940
for students who have never
participated in an open source

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.960
organization
before, particularly

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.620
when you have all these
topics and orgs and what not.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.540
So I picked-- I was looking for
keywords, things like Python,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.030
Django Web Development, things
I'm familiar with-- which

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.930
I recommend you do if
you're looking to apply

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.620
--and ended up selecting Melange
and coming up with a project.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.800
And through the span
of a couple of weeks

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.945
or so communicated
with the organization

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:11.320
and potential mentors and
built up requirements,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.704
and the project picked itself.

00:02:13.704 --> 00:02:15.870
NATHANIEL MANISTA: Tell us
about the particular work

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.220
that you did on this project.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.930
What did you build?

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.410
DREW RODMAN: So the
template for the project

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.030
itself revolved around the
existing system for connecting

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.607
organizations with mentors and
organization administrators.

00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:32.940
So the existing system had--
you know, it worked, but it

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.720
had a couple of flaws
and flexibility problems

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.420
that we were looking to address.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.810
So my initial project was to
go and fix all those problems

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.200
and come up with a
more reliable system.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.194
What I ended up doing-- which
is a good example of evolving

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:50.860
requirements --but
what I ended up doing

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.240
was actually rebuilding
that entire system

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.730
to produce a more robust and
flexible work flow for that.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.270
NATHANIEL MANISTA: That
sounds like a lot of work.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.410
Tell us about how
you did it, and what

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.210
was your average day
like over the summer?

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.810
DREW RODMAN: So was a project,
and I got myself into a little

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.940
bit of a trap where I was
actually working part time

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.450
as well as participating in a
Google Summer of Code program,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.660
which I will warn you is
a little bit difficult,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.750
but is doable .

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.530
So on a normal contribution
day, or something like that,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.747
I would usually have a current
task or design or something

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:28.080
like that that I was working on.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.489
So I would sit down with
my designs for the day,

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.030
plan out what I
wanted to do, or what

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.720
I wanted to have
accomplished, have

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.100
as close to a constant
stream of communication

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.460
to the mentors and other
contributors to the program

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.420
as I could, and just
try to code through

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.820
and design and ask questions
and all that kind of stuff

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.652
throughout the day.

00:03:47.652 --> 00:03:49.110
NATHANIEL MANISTA:
So you mentioned

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.151
speaking to your mentors.

00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:52.850
How many mentors did
you have, and how large

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.510
was the organization,
and how much did you

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.747
communicate with them through
the course of your project?

00:03:58.747 --> 00:04:00.830
DREW RODMAN: So initially
the projects technically

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.780
had one mentor.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.140
Really, I had two
that I more or less

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.090
communicated with
pretty consistently.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.680
When I first joined the project,
it was actually rather small

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.780
and has since kind
of grown, so I

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.920
got used to having new members
on throughout the summer.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.890
In terms of the
actual communication,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.649
we had several ways that we
would actually keep in touch.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.710
You have the requisite blog
posts for students every week,

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.010
which is a great way
to keep you on task.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.580
It's easier than you
think it is with updating

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.540
everybody and things like that.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.200
We also had weekly Hangouts,
so we would all get together

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.330
and discuss what we'd been
working on through the week,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.310
address any issues and
questions and things like that.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.400
We also have an incredibly
active mailing list

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.880
and are always pretty much
on Google Chat or IRC,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.915
and so I had a pretty easy way
to get in touch with everyone

00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:54.609
if I needed to ask something.

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:56.400
NATHANIEL MANISTA: How
did your work finish

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.450
and what happened to you after
the conclusion of the summer?

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.620
DREW RODMAN: So my project
requirements did rather kind of

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.410
evolve throughout the summer, it
step me back a couple of times.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.920
However, I was able to--
with the help of my mentors

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.310
and everyone --stay
on task and get

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.460
an almost perfectly--
or not perfectly,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.525
almost full implementation
of the project

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.114
by the end of the summer.

00:05:19.114 --> 00:05:21.030
It was not complete at
the time, so I actually

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.470
stayed on with the organization,
and I'm still working with them

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.780
in order to get that
project deployed.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.500
But we did get it up and
playing at a couple months or so

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.230
after the conclusion of
Google Summer of Code.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.500
NATHANIEL MANISTA: OK,
we've covered everything

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.450
that I wanted to ask.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.560
Do you have anything
you'd like to volunteer

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.660
for potential students and those
curious about summer of code?

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.940
DREW RODMAN: Sure.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.950
Sort of as I mentioned,
communication

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.470
is really, really important.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.000
That can virtually
make or break you.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.535
If you are in
constant communication

00:05:54.535 --> 00:05:56.800
with your mentors, they
always know where you are,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.870
you know what they
expect from them.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.560
That can really kind of
ease the process for you.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.630
It also helps you
lay out requirements,

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.220
which is very important at
the beginning of the program,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.260
as I kind of experienced,
since my project did

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.959
evolve rather drastically.

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:14.500
My final kind of
little bit of advice

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.769
is come up with-- even
if you don't share it

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:19.310
with anyone, which
probably you will.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.510
Even If you don't
share it, come up

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.100
with a plan or a timeline of
things that you want to do.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.677
It makes the whole
process way easier

00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:26.885
to manage, particularly if
you have other commitments

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:28.464
throughout the summer.

00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:30.130
NATHANIEL MANISTA:
All right, thank you.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.190
Thank you for your time and
thank you for joining us.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.480
DREW RODMAN: Thank
you for having me.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.963
NATHANIEL MANISTA:
All right, take care.

00:06:34.963 --> 00:06:35.862
DREW RODMAN: You too.

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:36.820
NATHANIEL MANISTA: Bye.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.190
Thank you for joining us.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.260
I'm Nathaniel Manista,
and we look forward

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.040
to your applications for
Google Summer of Code.
