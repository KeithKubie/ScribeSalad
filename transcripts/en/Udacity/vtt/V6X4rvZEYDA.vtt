00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.730
So, I'm pretty sure we showed this
before when we were talking about motion

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.620
and perceptual organization.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.760
And as it says here,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.940
even an impoverished motion
data can evoke a percept, and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.350
presumably, you all see these moving
dots as a person walking, right?

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.180
So, you're not recognizing this as a
person from the appearance of the dots.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.020
You're recognizing this as motion and
then you see that it's a person.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.900
And in fact, I can prove that to you
looking at some work that was done by

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.640
myself and
Jim Davis now professor at in Ohio.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.170
And so I'm going to show you here.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.790
So when you take a look at this picture,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.200
unless you've seen this demo before,
you probably don't know what that is.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.830
When I put this thing in motion,
what do you see?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.380
What you all probably saw,
was somebody sitting down.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.900
And what's interesting is, now when the
video is done, you can sort of see that,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.410
oh, this is a person standing
up right here, right?

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.331
In fact, there's some sort of
a blackboard behind them, and

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.533
then once they sit down, they're
head is here and the body is here,

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.050
because there's actually
a chair over here.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.780
But until that motion happens,
you can't actually recognize that.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.090
So we did a little bit of work on
some technology that would let you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.900
recognize this, and we created this
thing called motion energy images.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.140
So here you see a picture of a person,
this is a clear video,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.548
all right,
where the person is sitting down.

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:30.220
That's, by the way, Claudio Pinhanez,
who also got a PhD in Computer Vision,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.510
now doing great stuff down in Brazil.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.500
And what these are representing
are cumulative images of how,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.610
of where stuff has moved, okay?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.830
So the idea is, when you're all done,
this is area in which stuff has moved.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.557
And, you know, the question is,
that's somehow indicative,

00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:52.727
that something about that pattern and

00:01:52.727 --> 00:01:56.882
how it moved in there is indicative
of the actual motion pattern itself.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:00.040
So, can we recognize that explicitly?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.287
So we created this thing called
motion history images which

00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:08.720
becomes the motion energy images also.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.640
Which are a function of
the temporal volume, and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.135
what I mean by temporal volume is
that same thing, right, x, y, and t.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:18.285
So I've got a collection of video.

00:02:18.285 --> 00:02:21.374
And it's really a very simple
recursive computation.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.916
This is an MHI image,
motion history image, and

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:25.658
the way it works is quite simple.

00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:30.500
As each new frame comes in, in this
particular case you run some algorithm

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.872
to tell me,
which pixels are moving in that frame.

00:02:33.872 --> 00:02:36.942
Now, of course, this is under
the assumption of a static camera.

00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:40.102
And if you're not using a static camera,
you'd have to compensate for the motion

00:02:40.102 --> 00:02:44.092
of the camera, threshold out the motion
of the person, all the usual caveats.

00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:47.792
But then when you do that,
you get this very simple operation.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.290
If a pixel is moving,
set that location at time t,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.520
to some maximum value tau,
and you're going to pick tau.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.440
Maybe tau is 15.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.160
I'll tell you why 15 in a minute, right?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.760
And if it's not moving, that's the
otherwise, I'm just going to decrement,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.030
whoops, over here,
decrement the value, okay,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.070
from the previous time, but
I don't go any less than 0.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.300
So the image on the right is an example.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.870
The brighter pixels like over here,
they've moved more recently.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.570
So this is time t,
maybe they've moved at time t minus 1,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.890
they just moved before.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.720
So they started out as tau.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.602
So maybe tau is 15x, let's make it 30,
that example will work better.

00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:31.850
It was 30, so now it would be 29.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.910
But the pixels up here, they move, the
last time they moved is 15 frames ago.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.560
So its value would be now,
tau minus 15, so if tau were 15,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.180
it would be 0, so that would be black,
that's why it didn't work so well.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.820
But if tau were 30t minus 15,
it would be now down to 15, right?

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.930
It would have counted down to 15.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.070
So these areas are nice and
bright white because they just moved.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.560
These areas are darker gray because, it
was a longer time ago that they moved.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.460
And so the way you can think
about this motion history image,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.100
is that it both shows you
sort of where stuff is moved.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.480
And it also shows you sort
of how stuff is moved,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.690
because you can tell that the stuff
up here moved a long time ago, and

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.500
stuff down here is moving more recently.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.399
It's a recursive filter, that is,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:25.490
I only have to keep track of i of
tau of x, y, and t minus, of t.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.250
And I can create the new one
when the next frame comes in.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.300
So I don't have to
remember my old frames.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.370
The other thing is,
where did tau come from?

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.520
Well, the pixels go from tau down to 0.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.280
So, let's suppose I'm bringing
in 30 frames a second.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.580
So if I set tau to 30, then from 30
to 0 is the range over a second.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.760
And what that would mean it that

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.640
anything that happened longer than
a second ago, I'm not worrying about.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.510
So I'm recognizing action
that's length of a second.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.680
Suppose you wanted to check whether
something could happen slowly, right?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.370
Like, he sits down slowly,

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.400
it takes him a full second to sit
down because he's really slow.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.890
Or somebody sits down quickly,
right, because they go like this and

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.720
they, it's not Megan
playing with the video.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.900
Anyway so they can do it in a tenth
of second, so sorry, in a, in, in a,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.960
a third of a second, so
that'd be tau of ten, right, 10 frames.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.930
Well one of the kind of cool
things about motion history images

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.690
is if you give me the motion
history of image of tau, right?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.590
So everything goes
from let's say 30 to 0.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.800
I can just, if I wanted the motion
history image for tau equal to 20,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.780
I could just subtract 10 from it,
right, so 30 becomes 20.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.930
And anything that's less
than 10 just becomes 0.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.980
So it only looks back 20 frames.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.840
So it's trivial to compute I I of tau 20

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.530
from motion history tau 20
from motion history tau 30.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.070
So I only have to keep one around,
whichever one's the longest one, and

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.410
I can check all of those time
windows at the same time.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.100
And then also as should be clear,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.600
if this is the motion history image
that goes from white to dark.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.850
If I just wanted the motion energy
image where anything has changed,

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.740
all I can do is just threshold
that picture, right?

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.570
Anything greater than 0,
make a 1, otherwise it's a 0.
