00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.779
So what are Camel humps filled with?

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.329
It turns out, fat.

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.980
These fat humps can weigh as much as 80 pounds
and allow the Camel to comfortably go one

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.559
to two weeks without eating, if necessary.

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:27.050
Now, some of you out there might be saying
to yourselves, “Well, but 1 gram of fat

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.230
actually gets converted to more than 1 gram
of water during the metabolic process, so

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.479
it actually is a kind of water store.”

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:38.430
This is correct in principle, but ends up
not helping the Camel out any in terms of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.640
water supply.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.110
Even though more water is produced processing
the fat than there was fat, gram for gram,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.159
the metabolic process actually uses quite
a bit of water due to the arid conditions

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.159
Camels live in.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.189
Basically, they lose a lot of water through
their lungs getting the oxygen necessary to

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:55.479
process the fat.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.379
So the net effect of processing the fat actually
results in less water than there was before.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.689
So where do the Camels store extra water?

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:08.579
It turns out, mostly in their blood and other
places there are already fluids in their body.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.290
There really is no central water store anywhere
in a Camel.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.060
What allows a Camel to survive in desert environments
is mainly just that they are incredibly efficient

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.420
with their water usage.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.799
In fact, they are so efficient, that in milder
climates a Camel can get all the water they

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.340
need just from eating relatively green plant
life.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.789
Their bodies conserve water in just about
every way imaginable.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.159
For instance, when they pee, their urine contains
very little water, being more of a pasty substance

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.990
that has approximately the consistency of
syrup.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.399
On the other end of things, their feces comes
out almost completely dried out and can be

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.950
used right away by humans for making fires
or the like.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.119
For comparison, human fecal matter typically
is made up of about 75% water.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.240
A major area most animals lose water, particularly
in arid environments, is by breathing.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.229
Camels are no exception, but their breathing
system is much more efficient than most.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.740
Their nostrils have a mechanism for trapping
moisture in their breath before it is exhaled.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.740
This moisture is then returned to their bodily
fluids.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.099
The other major area most mammals lose water
in hot areas is through sweat.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:16.630
It turns out, Camels don’t need to sweat
very much to stay cool.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.090
There are a few things that go into this,
most impressive of which is that their body

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:30.810
temperatures can comfortably range from about
93 degrees Fahrenheit to 106 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.130
without any real negative side effects.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:41.660
Their bodies are also well equipped for keeping
heat out (for more on this see the Bonus Factoids

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.660
section below).

00:02:42.660 --> 00:03:02.230
After a cool desert night, their body temperature
will be around 93 degree Fahrenheit.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:26.099
Given their large size and their body’s
ability to keep heat out, it ends up taking

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:36.790
a while for their temperature to rise to closer
to the 106 degree Fahrenheit level.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.780
So in some cases, the Camel may not need to
sweat at all during a given day, depending

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.840
on the ambient temperature and how hard they
are working.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.189
However, if they do get close to that 106
degree Fahrenheit threshold, their sweat mechanism

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:50.189
will kick in.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.999
Like the rest of their body when it comes
to water usage, their sweat mechanism is as

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:58.430
efficient as sweating can be, with the sweat
evaporating at the skin surface level rather

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.620
than soaking into their hair and wasting some
of the cooling effect in evaporating off that

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.620
hair.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.879
Another interesting thing is how a Camel’s
body actually manages water internally.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.900
When they need water, their body will first
get the water from all fluid parts of their

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.840
body except the bloodstream.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.410
This allows their blood to continue to flow
normally, even when they are relatively dehydrated.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.550
They can withstand up to a 25% weight decrease
from water loss and it isn’t until they

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.620
start getting close to that level that their
main store of water in their blood starts

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.620
to get used.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.410
For comparison on how impressive that 25%
number is, most mammals will experience cardiac

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.060
failure around 12-15% weight decrease due
to water loss.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.980
This all adds up to a Camel that isn’t carrying
any extra weight being able to go around two

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.470
to three weeks in a desert environment without
needing to drink water.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.750
On the other hand, if the Camel is being used
as a pack Camel and is carrying a lot of weight,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.930
they can go three or four days in that environment
without needing to take in any water.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.180
A Camel’s blood cells also have some unique
properties among mammals.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.160
The blood cells are in the shape of elongated
ovals, instead of round, which allows them

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.961
to flow more freely when the Camel is dehydrated.

00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:07.240
The blood cells are also able to handle large
swings in water levels without rupturing,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.560
which is essential for the blood stream’s
ability to store extra water.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.590
Camels have three eyelids.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.410
Two of the eyelids have eye lashes which help
protect their eyes from sand.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.600
The third is a very thin lid which works as
a sort of “windshield wiper” to clean

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.600
off their eyes.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.700
It closes/opens from side to side rather than
up and down.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.810
It is also thin enough that the Camels can
see through it somewhat.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.480
So in a sandstorm or otherwise windy day where
sand is being stirred up, they can close that

00:05:34.480 --> 00:06:23.840
lid to protect their eyes from the sand, but
still see where they are going.
