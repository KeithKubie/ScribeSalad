00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:03.080
(upbeat music)

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.810
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.300
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Bangkok, Thailand,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.310
and one of the top questions I get asked

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.700
is what are my favorite Thai dishes.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.300
So today, we're going on a Thai food tour.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.983
I'm going to share with
you five of the best

00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:25.880
of my favorite ultimate Thai foods.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.499
I'm meeting up with my
friend Greg from Travizeo.

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.590
He's actually the one filming now.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.350
A huge thank you to Greg.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.430
We're gonna eat some incredibly good food

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.520
and yeah, we're gonna
share it all with you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.806
in this video right now.

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:39.889
(funky upbeat music)

00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:50.160
Alright, so we're gonna eat
our first dish right now

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.770
and actually before we
even get to the restaurant,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.370
the restaurant's around the corner,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.700
but I met the owner here.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.170
This is some of the behind the scenes.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.466
This is where they're
preparing the braised beef.

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.430
Oh, look at those giant pots of beef.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.020
She's slicing up the beef here.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.541
Oh, she's about to add
in all the cilantro,

00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:06.490
all the coriander.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.400
Oh, that smells so good.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.340
The aromas, you can
smell the Chinese spices,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.340
the star anise.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.760
Another thing that's very important

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.610
is the coriander roots.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.670
In Thai it's called raak phak chee.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.123
It gives so much flavor to the broth.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:21.690
I'm so hungry now.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.683
Yes, there it is.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.720
Awesome, there it is.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.720
That is the male organ.
(funky upbeat music)

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.629
Okay, we've moved over now.

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:43.200
So they're cooking the beef in the back

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840
but at the front of the restaurant here

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.860
is where the eternal cauldron,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.600
bubbling juicy pot of
braised beef is living.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.550
Okay, so she's fixing our fire pot.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.850
She adds in some pak boong

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.210
which is the morning glory,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.310
then I got it with everything

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.070
so that's gonna be mixed with the organs.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.160
There's some lung and
liver and tripe in there.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.660
This over here, Greg, is the (speaks Thai)

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.323
that is the braised beef.

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:10.943
Oh, and this is the tendon.

00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:14.730
Oh, those lumpy, beautiful, jiggly bits.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.133
This is the intestines.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.940
It smells so good. (laughs)

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.843
So she's going to fish out
a selection of the beef

00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:23.563
and put it into the fire pot.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.390
Oh, and then final step is that garlic.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.730
I'm extremely hungry now.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.283
My mouth juices are flowing.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.802
(Mark speaks Thai)

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.510
He's grabbing some of the charcoal

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.260
that's going to go in our fire pot.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.890
Oh, can you see the blower over there?

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.430
That's going to blow it from the bottom

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.880
so that it heats the charcoal even hotter

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.904
so flame comes out the top.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.880
Yes. (laughs)

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.680
Greg, you gotta get yourself
on camera saying that, man.

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.127
- It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:00.464
Look, I'm crying.

00:03:00.464 --> 00:03:01.668
(Mark laughs)

00:03:01.668 --> 00:03:05.418
(uplifting orchestral music)

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:16.871
(funky upbeat pop music)

00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.371
(speaks Thai)

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.380
- And here it is.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.583
This is one of my favorite
dishes in Bangkok.

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:27.710
(speaks Thai)

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.010
So that's the braised beef,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.720
but it is the (speaks Thai),

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.123
which is the fire pot of braised beef.

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:35.980
It's a beautiful thing,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.540
one of the most beautiful
things in the world.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.050
You can just see that garlic,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.270
whole cloves of garlic
floating around there.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.400
Here's the cilantro roots.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.200
I gotta just taste that broth first.

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:52.410
Oh wow.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.930
That is unbelievable.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.070
It's so fragrant.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.400
You can taste the garlic in there,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.210
you taste all those Chinese spices,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.595
the star anise, the cinnamon.

00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:03.180
Oh, that's ultimate umami.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.430
But now I gotta mix my sauce.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.493
Okay, so what you do for your sauce,

00:04:06.493 --> 00:04:08.780
(speaks Thai) which is dry chili flakes,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.410
go in,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.050
this is vinegar, chili vinegar.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.040
But I might hit that with just
a little bit of fish sauce

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.500
just to bump up the flavor.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.730
Let's try to get one of those good--

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.940
oh, for my first bite of beef

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.140
you can see everything is in here

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.460
from the tendon to the
tripe to the meatballs.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.940
I'm going to get one of
those pieces of braised beef

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.570
on this first bite, though.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.340
So fish that out,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.363
and actually I will dip it into the sauce,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.513
just let that kind of scoop up beef.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.953
Oh man.

00:04:48.953 --> 00:04:50.623
It's so soft and tender.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.943
Oh, it's so good.

00:04:52.943 --> 00:04:54.460
And then you chase that with rice.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:58.505
The owner just walked in

00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:00.523
and gave us a whole plate of tendon.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.827
Tendon, this is one of the prized pieces.

00:05:03.827 --> 00:05:06.050
It's not fat, this is all tendon,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.750
just jiggly chunks of beautifulness.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.430
I got to have a bite of that immediately.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.913
Just let that soak in there.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.483
Wow, tendon.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.720
Wow.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.650
Greg, you gotta taste that, man.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.640
- [Greg] I'm ready.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.280
- That melts in your mouth.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.460
It just slides down.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.860
You don't even need to chew.

00:05:39.718 --> 00:05:40.551
(Mark laughs)

00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:41.400
- [Mark] That tendon, man.

00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:46.846
- Have a slice.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:50.360
(Mark speaks Thai)

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.193
Right, right?

00:05:51.193 --> 00:05:52.043
It's so good.

00:05:52.043 --> 00:05:54.350
- This is one of my favorite
dishes to eat in Bangkok,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.030
one of my top Thai foods.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.560
But we have a lot more to eat today,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.260
so let's move on to the next dish.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.937
The next dish that we're
eating is called pad krapow

00:06:03.937 --> 00:06:06.610
and it's one of the best Thai dishes.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.720
It's a dish that everybody loves.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.460
It's one of those dishes

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.600
that you would be very happy to eat

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.070
every day of your life

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.160
and the spot that we're going to,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.010
it's right across the street.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.627
Let's go.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.710
(jazzy upbeat music)

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.900
And they have a seating section
right here on the corner,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.860
but we're going to go talk to Lun,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.598
who is the (speaks Thai) who's making it.

00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:48.098
(speaks Thai)

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.940
Oh, here goes in the minced pork.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.210
And that is a generous amount of oil,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.047
or lard, that goes in there.

00:07:16.047 --> 00:07:18.570
He actually shallow fries that

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.670
but I ordered a dish called (speaks Thai).

00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:25.385
So it is minced pork
stir-fried with holy basil.

00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:28.090
It's one of the top
comfort foods of Thailand.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.400
If you ask any Thai person
what they would like to eat

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.626
as like a good meal that they come back

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:36.900
to Thailand to eat,
this would be the dish.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.770
So he fries the minced
pork first in a lot of oil,

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.630
then drains it.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.780
Now he's tossing in
the chilies and garlic.

00:07:44.971 --> 00:07:47.090
Oh man, the fragrance of
that garlic immediately.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.830
A handful of chopped long beans

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.610
and then the final step,
the final ingredient

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.870
is that toss, that's the
holy basil right there.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.083
He adds in a little bit
of broth. (chuckles)

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.330
A little bit of dark
soy sauce goes in there,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.229
a little bit of sugar.

00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:06.062
Oh man.

00:08:06.062 --> 00:08:07.623
You see that sizzling away?

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.389
(laughs)

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:11.890
It smells so good.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.510
(speaks Thai)

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.490
You smell those chili
beans, Greg? (laughs)

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.773
And that goes right
onto your plate of rice.

00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:21.540
And this came out of the wok

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.080
literally about 10 seconds ago.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.290
She walks it over here, out of the wok,

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.200
onto the rice, walks it to your table.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.910
You can smell the peppery
aroma of that basil.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.150
I got the kai dow on
top which is mandatory.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.590
Well I mean, you could order
it without the fried egg

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.860
but believe me, you're
gonna want the fried egg.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.170
Yeah, it's mandatory, it's mandatory.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.450
You can smell the garlic.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.820
Okay, for my first bite here, yeah.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.940
I'm just going straight in.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.070
I'm just going straight in for that egg.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.130
And the egg, you can see,

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.706
it's kind of crispy on the
sides but look at that yolk.

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:52.320
Oh. (laughs)

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.050
That's also another food
sensation that never gets old,

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.240
breaking yolks.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.680
Okay, I'm gonna grab a bite,
get a little bit of everything.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.060
See how that yolk is just
melted in the mixed pork.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.323
You can even see the whole
chunky cloves of garlic.

00:09:11.037 --> 00:09:11.870
Oh yeah.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.653
Oh, it's so awesomely good.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.290
Yeah, the peppery basil.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.100
It's so garlicky.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.650
You've got that chili heat.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.830
And what you notice

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.600
is just how freshly stir
fried it is, you know?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.640
I mean, that's right out of the wok.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.880
It's still hot.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.600
And his unique touch is where

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.030
he actually deep fries the meat

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.290
and then drains it, so it
almost has a crunchy edge to it.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.123
Wow, that's good.

00:09:39.123 --> 00:09:40.060
Let me get another bite.

00:09:44.827 --> 00:09:46.400
Oh.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.950
It's perfect.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.214
You could not want anything else

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.273
on a single plate of food.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.730
One more thing I forgot,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.363
and it's essential when you eat this dish.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.140
And that is prik nam pla,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.250
which is fish sauce and chilies.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.163
I'm gonna make this bite count.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.330
A little bit of fish sauce on there,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.600
a good dollop of sliced chilies

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.793
with the egg, with the basil.

00:10:16.593 --> 00:10:19.551
(motorcycle thrums)

00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:20.384
Oh, oh.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.603
Oh wow.

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:27.192
That even bumps up the flavor.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.800
Yeah, (speaks Thai) knows what he's doing

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.430
when it comes to pad (speaks Thai).

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.513
He has just perfected his recipe.

00:10:36.404 --> 00:10:37.237
(women speaking Thai)

00:10:37.237 --> 00:10:39.130
Just walking down the
street and we stumbled

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.800
into a lady who's selling khanom bueang,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.160
which is a very popular and
very good Thai sweet snack.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.230
It's like a little crepe that
she fries on the hot plate

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.677
and then she adds in some meringue

00:10:48.677 --> 00:10:50.020
and you get your choice of topping.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.050
But the one we really
like is called foi thong,

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.240
which is the yellow egg yolk candy.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.200
So we got it here.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.000
That's candied egg yolk strands,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.833
the meringue in there,

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:00.950
and all wrapped up in
a little crispy wafer.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:08.150
It's great.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.353
It's crispy, it's sweet.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.190
It's got that egg white
kind of flavor to it.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.723
And then that sweet, rich egg yolk candy.

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.563
Great sweet snack.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.960
We're at the next stall now,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.560
and this is just a small little typical

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.330
Isaan stall serving Isaan food,

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.070
which is food from the
northeastern region of Thailand.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.200
This is a great little spot

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.500
and I'm about to order the dish.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.000
(speaks Thai)

00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:41.420
I ordered a dish that's
called (speaks Thai)

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.130
which is a green papaya salad

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.030
with fermented fish sauce, spicy.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.083
Oh look it, a whole handful of chilies.

00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:51.360
(speaks Thai)

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.650
She adds in a whole handful of chilies.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.650
A little bit of salt in
there to get it pounding,

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.583
and then she's gonna pound up
all those chilies right now.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.950
She adds in just a tiny
little bit of palm sugar,

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.783
and here it is.

00:12:09.783 --> 00:12:10.730
This is the (speaks Thai),

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.330
this is the fermented
fish sauce right here.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.170
This is the good stuff.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.133
That's the flavor.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.780
Oh yeah, and you can smell
that, that cheesiness.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.853
Oh it smells so good.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.850
This is a lao olive,

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:24.863
which also adds some crazy flavor.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.620
Chinese longbeans go in.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.940
She's squeezing the lime,

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.000
but also she puts in the entire lime too

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.220
and she's going to kind of pound that up

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.080
so it gets all mixed in and gushy.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.590
And here comes in the green papaya.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.497
That's shredded green papaya.

00:12:37.497 --> 00:12:38.790
And that's the crab.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.280
That's thebpu right
there, that's the crab,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.380
the little patty crab.

00:12:55.203 --> 00:12:58.510
(speaks Thai)

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.440
She's going to make
also some (speaks Thai)

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.773
which is an Isaan soup.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.530
So we got a few assorted dishes

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.170
because you can't come to a little stall

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.360
like this and just get one dish,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.230
but the main dish on this list,

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.063
one of my favorite dishes,

00:13:11.063 --> 00:13:12.100
which is tam bpu (speaks Thai),

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.490
which is green papaya salad.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.260
You can see that murky fish
sauce, that's the (speaks Thai).

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.343
You've got the crab in
here, that's the bpu.

00:13:20.504 --> 00:13:21.337
You've got tomatoes in here

00:13:21.337 --> 00:13:23.386
and something that also is cool.

00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:25.290
Something you got to notice is,

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.650
the shreds of green papaya,

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.120
she chops it up with a knife,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.190
just chops chops chops,

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.380
and then slices it off
rather than using a grater

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.930
so you can see how all
the shreds of papaya

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.140
are all in different sizes.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.090
Let me just get a good
bite of this real fast.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.563
Oh man, that looks and smells incredible.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.420
Oh.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.253
Oh, the dribble.

00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:49.337
Oh.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.823
It's so much flavor.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.340
It's such a depth of flavor.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.260
It's so complex.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.193
And then you've got that
crunch of the green papaya.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.360
It's sour, it's citrusy.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.360
It's spicy, it's fishy.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.990
It's everything.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.270
Then what you do is you take sticky rice

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.090
which is called (speaks Thai),

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.640
you can make a little ball,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.763
then what you do is you
then dip it into the juice.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.755
That completes it.

00:14:24.755 --> 00:14:26.180
Yeah, it's spectacular.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.470
That's the dressing.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.207
We've got some sub no mai,

00:14:30.085 --> 00:14:32.677
which is a bamboo shoot mixed salad

00:14:32.677 --> 00:14:33.983
and also some larb,

00:14:33.983 --> 00:14:36.900
which this is a minced pork version.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.800
There's some skin in here.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.680
There's some minced pork,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.513
there's some dried chili,

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:42.480
she adds in some lime.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.230
Yeah, this is just a good dish too.

00:14:47.343 --> 00:14:49.033
Mm, mm.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.720
The dried chilies in there.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.800
That just has a smoky taste.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.673
Grab a little ball of
sticky rice, dip that in.

00:15:02.814 --> 00:15:04.680
Fantastic.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.010
We've eaten three of my

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.350
absolute favorite Thai dishes in Bangkok.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.140
So good, and there's two more to go.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.940
Have some very, very exciting,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.710
very mouthwatering dishes to come

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.440
so let's go to the next spot.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.890
(quirky upbeat music)

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.240
I didn't even mention this to you,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.920
but we're eating all five
of these dishes in one day,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.970
so it's a packed day.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.650
We're moving from place to place.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.800
We drove over now to Bhangkapi

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.830
and this is where the next restaurant is.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.700
This is one of the

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.150
best southern Thai restaurants in Bangkok,

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.490
it's called Janhom,

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.560
and we're going to eat
a southern Thai dish

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.951
that's mind-blowingly flavorful.

00:15:38.951 --> 00:15:40.300
(upbeat jazzy music)

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.200
I'm always excited to come eat here,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.433
even after eating three meals already.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.193
We're going to grab this table

00:15:47.193 --> 00:15:49.440
all the way in the corner
here 'cause it looks cool.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.200
Look at these giant wooden booths.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.987
This is just a huge wooden table.

00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:54.878
(speaks Thai)

00:15:54.878 --> 00:15:56.860
- Hello. (laughs)

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.526
- Okay. This is not the main dish,

00:15:58.526 --> 00:16:00.480
but this is another delicious
dish that's rolling up,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.560
that's coming right now,
which is the fried fish.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.900
It's called pla tod kamin,

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.930
which is the fried fish with turmeric.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.240
And it comes with a sauce.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.232
This is delicious, check that out.

00:16:12.232 --> 00:16:15.010
(upbeat jazzy music)

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.071
We also got some melinjo
leaves stir fried with egg.

00:16:18.071 --> 00:16:21.220
This is another one of my absolute

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.180
favorite dishes in the entire world

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.410
called goong pad ped sataw,

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.720
which is shrimp stir
fried with stink beans

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.370
and you can see all that
shrimp paste in there,

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.370
a lot of shrimp paste in
there. You can smell the aroma.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.790
It's coming right now, the main dish,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.833
the main curry that we came here to eat.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.863
Oh yes.

00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:42.187
(speaks Thai)

00:16:42.187 --> 00:16:44.950
Oh, there it is.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.947
There is the gaeng tai pla.

00:16:46.947 --> 00:16:50.225
It is a curry, a southern Thai curry

00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:53.180
flavored with fish viscera,

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.470
like a fermented fish
entrails, the insides of a fish

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.920
and if you can take a good look at that.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.450
There's chunks of fish in there.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.520
There's that beautiful dark color.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.930
There's pumpkin in
there, there's eggplant.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.550
There's lots of kaffir lime used,

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.370
there's the pea eggplant,
pieces of grilled fish as well.

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.790
And that's just that intense,

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.040
intense curry liquid.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.640
Oh, I gotta put some of
this on my rice immediately.

00:17:19.882 --> 00:17:21.860
You stick this on your rice,

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.123
add a little bit more of that curry gravy.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.343
Oh, this is fresh right out of the pot.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.483
Oh, it's hot.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.610
No doubt one of my favorite
dishes in Thailand.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.150
It's such a potent flavor.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.540
It's so sharply salty.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.740
But you can also taste the
smokiness of the fish in there.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.990
You got the little pea eggplants

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:55.990
that sort of pop, explode in
your mouth with those seeds

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.150
and then you've got the creamy pumpkin.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.550
One of the greatest dishes of Thailand.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.383
Southern Thai.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.882
Oh, mm hmm.

00:18:07.882 --> 00:18:08.725
It's hot.

00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:10.483
(laughs) It's so hot.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.000
That was a big bite.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.520
Next dish is the stink
beans with the shrimp,

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.590
and you can see there's
some chilies in here

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.500
and you can see that pink color

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.320
which is all from the shrimp paste,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.163
which is like krill paste.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.240
That's a beauty and
actually I'm just going

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.653
straight in for this bite
without even going to the rice.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.087
Oh wow.

00:18:34.087 --> 00:18:37.680
That shrimp, it's perfectly cooked.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.453
It's so meaty and succulent.

00:18:40.405 --> 00:18:42.460
There's onions in there actually,

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.910
which give it some sweetness
and the stink beans.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.340
I love gaeng tai pla,

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.340
but as far as single ingredients go,

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.130
stink beans, sataw,

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.040
that is one of my favorite
ingredients of the entire world.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.290
Okay, the fish. And I think
this is called (speaks Thai),

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.163
which are sand fish, deep fried.

00:19:00.001 --> 00:19:00.950
You can see this is
all turmeric and garlic

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.450
and actually, fully deep fried.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.000
You can even eat the entire head.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.680
I'm just gonna eat this
like a fry. (laughs)

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.440
This sauce, by the way, is award-winning.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.670
There's garlic in there, there's chilies,

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.990
it's vinegary.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.590
Just kind of let that head soak.

00:19:21.223 --> 00:19:24.383
(laughs) Oh, that sauce.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.830
And you can eat the whole head,

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.920
it's crispy all the way through.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.633
The turmeric almost gives
it kind of a mustardy taste.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.733
It's awesome.

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:39.592
Awesome.

00:19:39.592 --> 00:19:41.060
And finish with the melinjo leaves.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.580
They have some of the best texture

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.910
of any leaf and have
a nutty taste to them.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.317
Okay, we're rolling.

00:19:56.317 --> 00:19:59.600
Greg and Pam behind the scenes.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.380
- [Greg] Get the sauce
inside the fish head.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.861
- [Mark] Yes, that's right. (laughs)

00:20:03.861 --> 00:20:05.837
- [Greg] Can I tell you I'm
gonna cheat a little bit.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:06.670
(Pam laughs)

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.503
- [Mark] Yup.

00:20:07.503 --> 00:20:10.423
You want to drown it. (Pam laughs)

00:20:16.752 --> 00:20:18.829
(Mark laughs) Yes.

00:20:18.829 --> 00:20:21.181
- Alright, I gotta say,

00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:23.890
to all those people that
think Mark's faking it

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.310
when he does his face,

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.507
it's 'cause you've never
eaten food like this.

00:20:27.507 --> 00:20:28.340
(Mark laughs)

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.800
You kind of like have a
little moment to yourself.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.633
- [Mark] It's emotional.

00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:34.943
- When you eat stuff like this.

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:38.443
(upbeat electronic music)

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.013
- We made it.

00:20:45.013 --> 00:20:46.450
This is the last restaurant.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.940
It was about an hour to get here,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.840
so I'm going to go ahead
and tell you straight.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.790
This restaurant is way
off the beaten path.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.920
It is only for the serious
food lovers, even Thais.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.500
Like it's really the guys

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.130
that are hardcore for
food come to this spot

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:02.963
and at the moment,

00:21:02.963 --> 00:21:04.570
this is one of my favorite
restaurants in Bangkok

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.070
and this is where we're
going to eat the final dish

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.530
on this list of five of
my favorite Thai dishes.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.440
Let's go inside and let's order this dish.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.442
I cannot wait.

00:21:14.442 --> 00:21:18.850
(chill drum and bass music)

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.973
Let's sit over on this side over here.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.240
You walk into this
restaurant and I like it,

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.850
it almost has like a barn feel to it,

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.380
it's like this really old
Thai house, wooden house.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.230
It's beautiful, actually.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.930
It's the perfect setting
to just have a feast.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.380
This is the restaurant,
it's called Pla Mae Nam.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.960
Which actually means river fish,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.420
so they specialize in river fish.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.883
Most of the dishes on
their menu are river fish,

00:21:44.814 --> 00:21:46.260
but the chilies are fiery,

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.447
the chili pastes just
explode in your mouth.

00:21:49.447 --> 00:21:52.930
(chill electronic music)

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.320
Sitting down for the final meal

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.920
and I could not be happier in
my life at this very moment.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.580
They're so cool back in the kitchen.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.490
The chef, he is a master
at spicy Thai dishes

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.920
and again, at this restaurant

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.450
you can't go wrong on the menu.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.989
Everything is incredibly delicious

00:22:12.989 --> 00:22:15.600
and although we're
focusing on the main dish

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.680
as the top five of my favorite dishes,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.940
there was no way we could not order

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.050
a whole table full of food,

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.320
so we did.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.370
But the main dish, it's
called gaeng pa in Thai,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.200
which directly translates to jungle curry.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.400
And so it is a curry,
it's a water-based curry,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.070
but it's called jungle
curry because it makes use

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.230
of lots of wild herbs and
just jungle ingredients

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.210
that you might find just foraging around.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.330
In order to make this, he boils some water

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.350
and then he put in not just a spoonful

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.380
but like a spatula dollop
full of chili paste,

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.220
which is literally like
just pure solid chilies

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.110
which he dissolves and a
mix of herbs and spices

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.130
which are pounded into a paste

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.800
so all the flavors are released.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.190
That's pounded in a mortar and pestle

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.020
so all the flavors are
just completely maximized,

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.610
even the chili oil is exposed

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.440
and he dissolves that into the water

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.770
and then in the meantime they have a plate

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:09.610
with all of the ingredients.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.470
The fish, the finger root,

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:13.770
which is also a very important ingredient

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.530
and kind of gingery.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.030
Some of the longbeans, some
of the different eggplants.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.530
He tosses that in into the cauldron

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.290
with the bubbling chili paste

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.280
and that just boils away for a little bit

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.480
and finally when everything is cooked,

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.640
when the fish is cooked,

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.350
he tosses in a handful of
kaphrao, which is holy basil,

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.290
which is what we ate earlier today.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.640
That finishes it off

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.710
and you don't want to cook that very long

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.730
so he just tosses it
and turns off the gas,

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.513
dishes it into the bowl and that is it.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.310
Okay, everything we've eaten today

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.120
is one of my favorite dishes in Thailand,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.310
but this.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.330
This is beyond spectacular.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.670
It's a life-changing dish.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.240
This is my ultimate
favorite dish in Thailand.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.120
I'm gonna grab a bite of the fish

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.023
and this is all freshwater fish.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.710
Actually in Thai it's
called (speaks Thai).

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.270
I'm not totally sure what
the English version is,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.699
but I'm going to get
everything on this bite.

00:24:13.699 --> 00:24:15.729
Yeah, and you know I do have rice,

00:24:15.729 --> 00:24:18.310
but I'm not even going to
touch the rice on this bite.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.750
You can just see the herbs just exploding

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.003
and chili seeds throughout
just folded through everything.

00:24:33.793 --> 00:24:34.626
Oh wow.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.433
That's just like, it's literally,

00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:43.193
it's liquid chili but infused with herbs

00:24:43.193 --> 00:24:45.990
and there's so much basil in there,

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.532
or the basil has such a wonderful pungency

00:24:48.532 --> 00:24:52.760
that you can almost feel your
tongue tingling a little bit.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.900
Okay, this one is the pad pet

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.090
which is basically just a chili stir fry.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:57.920
It's actually kind of
similar to the jungle curry,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.730
just in stir fried format,
a little less soup,

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.700
and there's green peppercorns in here too.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.210
This is another one of my
favorite dishes as well.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.063
I'm going to stick this onto the rice.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.190
It is beyond stunning.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.140
Okay, next dish here.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.210
This is deer which is stir
fried with black pepper.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.340
In Thai it's called
gwang pad phrik thai dom,

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.540
so we got some deer here, slices of deer.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.660
There's some onions in
here, there's some peppers,

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.233
and he literally tossed in,

00:25:31.286 --> 00:25:32.870
that was not just a tablespoon.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:37.123
That was like a mountain
tablespoon of black pepper

00:25:37.123 --> 00:25:38.960
into this single dish.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.843
There's a lot of pepper, okay.

00:25:44.445 --> 00:25:49.445
Oh wow, oh wow.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.370
You don't even need to
second guess yourself,

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.900
that is just pure pepper.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.810
Another dish that's famous
here is their tod mun,

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.920
which is the fried fish cakes.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.770
And these are literally like burger sized

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.780
and they are bouncy.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.180
You want to give this
a little bit of a dip.

00:26:13.982 --> 00:26:16.210
You gotta see the interiors of this.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.270
That is just like pure fish sponge

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.013
and it's all 100 percent
fish and chili paste.

00:26:22.904 --> 00:26:23.987
It's so good.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.080
We have completed five of my favorite,

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.320
five of the best Thai dishes.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.010
This has been one of the most amazing

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.951
Thai food days of my life.

00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:34.756
How was the day, Greg? (laughs)

00:26:34.756 --> 00:26:37.940
- (groans) Can't speak, no words.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.299
Too amazing, too good.

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:40.830
- (laughs) So we began
with the braised beef,

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.950
we moved on to the pad kra pao,

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.990
which is the holy basil stir fry.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.570
Then we had the (speaks Thai),

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.370
which is the green papaya salad
with fermented fish sauce,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.767
then we had the southern Thai food,

00:26:50.767 --> 00:26:52.480
the gaeng tai pla, which is that curry,

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.790
that whole southern Thai meal.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.623
- [Greg] And my favorite side dish--

00:26:54.623 --> 00:26:55.730
- [ Mark] Yes, melinja leaves.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.630
- [Greg] Melinja leaves, wow.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.100
- And then finishing
off with the gaeng pa,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.450
the jungle curry, one
of the greatest dishes.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.820
That's just straight up liquid fire

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.640
and what a meal to end with.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.940
But the entire day.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.350
I mean, for me I cannot
choose a favorite dish

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.690
because those are my favorite dishes

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.763
but that's just a sample.

00:27:14.763 --> 00:27:16.730
The best thing about Thai food in Thailand

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.760
is that there's so many dishes

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.344
and I gotta say my favorite
dish depends on the mood.

00:27:22.344 --> 00:27:23.177
- At the moment.

00:27:23.177 --> 00:27:24.010
- Yup.
- Yep.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:24.843
At the moment--

00:27:24.843 --> 00:27:25.676
- These are five of my favorite dishes.

00:27:25.676 --> 00:27:26.840
Greg, what was your
favorite dish of the day?

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.570
- Definitely I would say, oh,

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.010
the fried fish that we had,

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.550
the Southern Thai fried fish.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.383
- [Mark] Oh yes.

00:27:33.383 --> 00:27:34.634
- [Greg] That was amazing.

00:27:34.634 --> 00:27:36.389
The sauce that came with
it, that was incredible.

00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:37.222
- Oh yes.

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:40.491
- Plus the melinja leaves
with the fried egg, oh.

00:27:40.491 --> 00:27:42.157
(Mark laughs) Yeah, I'd
have to go with those.

00:27:42.157 --> 00:27:44.580
Those were the two things
there that for me just like

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.694
phew, amazing.
- Awesome.

00:27:45.694 --> 00:27:48.320
- This was pretty
incredible. (Mark laughs)

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.139
I still can't feel my mouth (Mark laughs)

00:27:51.139 --> 00:27:52.310
which is kind of cool, but yeah.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.600
So this was all really good.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.614
I can't, it's hard.

00:27:55.614 --> 00:27:56.447
You can't choose a favorite.

00:27:56.447 --> 00:27:58.113
- You're right.
- You can't choose a favorite,

00:27:58.113 --> 00:27:58.946
but thank you so much for letting me

00:27:58.946 --> 00:28:01.200
into your favorites of the time.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.695
I have such a different
understanding of Thai food now.

00:28:03.695 --> 00:28:04.528
- Cool.

00:28:04.528 --> 00:28:06.280
- Absolutely incredible. This
is a dream come true for me.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.490
Like, I've wanted to eat with you

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.550
for as long as I could
remember, like years, dude.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.200
I've been following you for years

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.220
and I always said, I want
to eat with Mark Wiens.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.820
So thank you so much, Mark.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.617
- Cool, thank you.
- I really appreciate it.

00:28:17.617 --> 00:28:18.450
- And I want to say a
huge thank you to Greg

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.550
and Pam from Travizeo.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.080

cinematic travel videos.

that was just so much fun to
eat with you all day today.

00:28:32.233 --> 00:28:33.223
- Thank you so much, man.

00:28:33.223 --> 00:28:34.056
That was great.

00:28:34.056 --> 00:28:37.730

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.580
(claps)

00:29:07.985 --> 00:29:12.985
- [Mark] Can you smell those
chili beans, Greg? (laughs)

00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:23.265
(air whooshing)

00:29:23.265 --> 00:29:24.146
(popping)

00:29:24.146 --> 00:29:26.479
(crunching)
