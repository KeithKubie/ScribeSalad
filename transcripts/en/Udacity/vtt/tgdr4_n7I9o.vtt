3.2 times 10 to the 5th is 320,000 in
standard notation written like this.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.920
We got this by multiplying
3.2 times 10 to the 5th

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.195
which is the same thing as
3.2 times ten times ten

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:21.835
times ten times ten times ten,
five tens.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:26.775
Which is the same thing
as 3.2 times 100,000.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:31.625
Notice again that there
are five zeros here,

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:35.400
and ten was raised to the fifth power.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.410
When we multiplied 3.2 x 100,000,
the decimal place

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.820
started between the 3 and the 2.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.510
Then we moved the decimal
place over five times.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.734
One times, two times, three times,

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:56.147
four times, five times to get 320,000.

00:00:56.147 --> 00:00:57.849
