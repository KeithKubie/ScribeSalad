sticking around the title reading the
city did you hear me ok said all right

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190
 
 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.570
 
ok so Josh us to respond to the theme of

ok so Josh us to respond to the theme of
reading the city which i think is quite

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620
reading the city which i think is quite
 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.000
reading the city which i think is quite
a provocative theme reading the city

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010
a provocative theme reading the city
 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.740
a provocative theme reading the city
suggested the city's a text that it can

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750
suggested the city's a text that it can
 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.540
suggested the city's a text that it can
be read that if you written that it

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
be read that if you written that it
 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.930
be read that if you written that it
could be misread so I'm going to do two

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940
could be misread so I'm going to do two
 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.029
could be misread so I'm going to do two
things I'm going to show you some I'm

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039
things I'm going to show you some I'm
 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.770
things I'm going to show you some I'm
going to show you some projects but I'm

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780
going to show you some projects but I'm
 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.650
going to show you some projects but I'm
also going to sort of frame them through

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660
also going to sort of frame them through
 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.670
also going to sort of frame them through
a series of images this image you may

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680
a series of images this image you may
 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.110
a series of images this image you may
recognize that it's from city of glass

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120
recognize that it's from city of glass
 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:20.309
recognize that it's from city of glass
and it's ok

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319
 
 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.990
 
so I mean the question about reading the

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000
so I mean the question about reading the
 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.670
so I mean the question about reading the
city raises a couple of different

city raises a couple of different
 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.059
city raises a couple of different
problems one the city you know

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069
problems one the city you know
 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.260
problems one the city you know
inevitably evokes the public realm and

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270
inevitably evokes the public realm and
 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.999
inevitably evokes the public realm and
the public realm and architecture seemed

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009
the public realm and architecture seemed
 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.029
the public realm and architecture seemed
to be sort of overlapping territories

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039
to be sort of overlapping territories
 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.520
to be sort of overlapping territories
how do we work on the public realm you

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530
how do we work on the public realm you
 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.399
how do we work on the public realm you

suspended so I'm going to show you some
 

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.490
suspended so I'm going to show you some
projects now that hopefully draw on some

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500
projects now that hopefully draw on some
 

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.710
projects now that hopefully draw on some
of these reference images this is a

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720
of these reference images this is a
 

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.200
of these reference images this is a
project we did early on in our practice

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:24.210
project we did early on in our practice
 

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.130
project we did early on in our practice
we were sort of my partner me genuine

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.140
we were sort of my partner me genuine
 

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.420

design what was called the defensible

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:29.430
design what was called the defensible
 

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:34.160
design what was called the defensible
dress and the idea is your personal

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.170
dress and the idea is your personal
 

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.860

space is is defined by different

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:36.870
space is is defined by different
 

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.570
space is is defined by different
parameters their cultural there there

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:38.580
parameters their cultural there there
 

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.190
parameters their cultural there there
may be urban and how do you produce a

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:42.200
may be urban and how do you produce a
 

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.360
may be urban and how do you produce a
garment that acts as a kind of

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:44.370
garment that acts as a kind of
 

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.100
garment that acts as a kind of
architecture that defines that sort of

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.110
architecture that defines that sort of
 

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.190
architecture that defines that sort of
territory around the body so this was

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200
territory around the body so this was
 

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.800
territory around the body so this was
one of our first sort of geek projects

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:51.810
one of our first sort of geek projects
 

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.900
one of our first sort of geek projects
where we actually took components

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:53.910
where we actually took components
 

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.340
where we actually took components
sensors to to create this dress it

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:58.350
sensors to to create this dress it
 

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.710

that project led to other projects this

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120
that project led to other projects this
 

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.059
that project led to other projects this
is one project that we did for the

00:13:56.059 --> 00:13:56.069
is one project that we did for the
 

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.889
is one project that we did for the
athens olympics it was called white

00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899
athens olympics it was called white
 

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:00.259
athens olympics it was called white
noise white light we've proposed it in a

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:00.269
noise white light we've proposed it in a
 

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:02.240
noise white light we've proposed it in a
competition to create a field of lights

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.250
competition to create a field of lights
 

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.860
competition to create a field of lights
that would respond to the to the viewer

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:03.870
that would respond to the to the viewer
 

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.870
that would respond to the to the viewer
we had no idea how to do this but we

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880
we had no idea how to do this but we
 

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.439
we had no idea how to do this but we
thought okay let's let's propose it and

00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:08.449
thought okay let's let's propose it and
 

00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:10.910
thought okay let's let's propose it and
they accepted it and then we had to

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920
they accepted it and then we had to
 

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.509
they accepted it and then we had to
figure out how to how to realize it but

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519
figure out how to how to realize it but
 

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:17.420
figure out how to how to realize it but
we had some ideas on so these are the

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:17.430
we had some ideas on so these are the
 

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.069
we had some ideas on so these are the
kind of concept images there's a field

00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079
kind of concept images there's a field
 

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:20.660
kind of concept images there's a field
you move through the field you trigger

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:20.670
you move through the field you trigger
 

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.559
you move through the field you trigger
the lights and not just white light but

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:24.569
the lights and not just white light but
 

00:14:24.569 --> 00:14:26.949
the lights and not just white light but
also white noise so it has a kind of

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959
also white noise so it has a kind of
 

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.420
also white noise so it has a kind of
kind of soundtrack to it i'm just going

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:29.430
kind of soundtrack to it i'm just going
 

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.950
kind of soundtrack to it i'm just going
to show you a quick video

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:33.960

trail in the city and this was installed
 

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.880
trail in the city and this was installed
in Athens during the Olympics basically

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:05.890
in Athens during the Olympics basically
 

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:17.060
in Athens during the Olympics basically
properly

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.460
 
city way the white noise actually

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:20.470
city way the white noise actually
 

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.310
city way the white noise actually
produces the kind of kind of different

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320
produces the kind of kind of different
 

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:33.610

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.900
 
but what we learned about this project

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:57.910
but what we learned about this project
 

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:12.100
but what we learned about this project
was it you could set up

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:12.110
 
 

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.690
 
ultimately used and we thought that was

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:14.700
ultimately used and we thought that was
 

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.790
ultimately used and we thought that was
actually kind of powerful powerful thing

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800
actually kind of powerful powerful thing
 

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.160
actually kind of powerful powerful thing
to set in motion a series of events that

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.170
to set in motion a series of events that
 

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.170
to set in motion a series of events that
people would sort of take over and sort

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:21.180
people would sort of take over and sort
 

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.800
people would sort of take over and sort
of take take possession of so the way

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:24.810
of take take possession of so the way
 

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.490
of take take possession of so the way
that was done here is a sort of drawing

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:27.500
that was done here is a sort of drawing
 

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.420
that was done here is a sort of drawing
there's a wooden deck there's the

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:29.430
there's a wooden deck there's the

a fiber optic stock and again we've did

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440
a fiber optic stock and again we've did
 

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.110
a fiber optic stock and again we've did
some custom electronics here with the

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120
some custom electronics here with the
 

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.270
some custom electronics here with the

worked with an electronics engineer to

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:39.960
worked with an electronics engineer to
 

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.870
worked with an electronics engineer to
sort of produce this and then we did all

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880
sort of produce this and then we did all
 

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.630
sort of produce this and then we did all

learning how to solder put them together

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:47.670
learning how to solder put them together
 

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.150
learning how to solder put them together
and then shipping them out there's an

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160
and then shipping them out there's an
 

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.440
and then shipping them out there's an
engineer prototype and this is on site

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:53.450
engineer prototype and this is on site
 

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.910

someday so at the beginning when we

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920
someday so at the beginning when we
 

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.620
someday so at the beginning when we
start our practice we realized that some

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:57.630
start our practice we realized that some
 

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.330
start our practice we realized that some
of these things they didn't really have

00:16:59.330 --> 00:16:59.340
of these things they didn't really have
 

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.510
of these things they didn't really have
a kind of normative sort of precedent

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:02.520
a kind of normative sort of precedent
 

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.100
a kind of normative sort of precedent
there were things that we thought Oh

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.110
there were things that we thought Oh
 

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.660
there were things that we thought Oh
wouldn't it be interesting if we could

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:05.670
wouldn't it be interesting if we could
 

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.300
wouldn't it be interesting if we could
make a space in the city where you could

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:08.310
make a space in the city where you could
 

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.130
make a space in the city where you could
lose yourself from the city where things

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140
lose yourself from the city where things
 

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.140
lose yourself from the city where things
responded to you and then we sort of set

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:12.150
responded to you and then we sort of set
 

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.220
responded to you and then we sort of set
out to figure out how these things

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:13.230
out to figure out how these things
 

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.550
out to figure out how these things
worked and and as architects try to

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:16.560
worked and and as architects try to
 

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.620
worked and and as architects try to
figure out the detailing the material

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:18.630
figure out the detailing the material
 

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.260
figure out the detailing the material
and the logistics of implementing

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:21.270
and the logistics of implementing
 

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.220
and the logistics of implementing
something like this we also noticed as

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:25.230
something like this we also noticed as
 

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.510
something like this we also noticed as
we became interested in the idea of

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520
we became interested in the idea of
 

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.330
we became interested in the idea of
publicness and publix but there was

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340
publicness and publix but there was
 

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.890
publicness and publix but there was
something going on in terms of the

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900
something going on in terms of the
 

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.870
something going on in terms of the
public realm and if you were in New York

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880
public realm and if you were in New York
 

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.660
public realm and if you were in New York
during 911 and right afterwards and even

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:35.670
during 911 and right afterwards and even
 

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.610
during 911 and right afterwards and even
today I think you feel a different sense

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620
today I think you feel a different sense
 

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.720
today I think you feel a different sense
of publicness when you're outside and

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:40.730
of publicness when you're outside and
 

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.730
of publicness when you're outside and
and I think what we've become interested

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:43.740
and I think what we've become interested
 

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.950
and I think what we've become interested
in is the idea that the public realm is

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960
in is the idea that the public realm is
 

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.440
in is the idea that the public realm is
not accidental it's actually it is a

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:48.450
not accidental it's actually it is a
 

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.070
not accidental it's actually it is a
political space that is something

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080
political space that is something
 

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.840
political space that is something
that is charged it's loaded and your

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:52.850
that is charged it's loaded and your
 

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.870
that is charged it's loaded and your
behavior within it it's not only it's

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880
behavior within it it's not only it's
 

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.700
behavior within it it's not only it's
none of these surveyed but is actually

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:57.710
none of these surveyed but is actually
 

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.450
none of these surveyed but is actually
scripted and I think social codes sort

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:01.460
scripted and I think social codes sort
 

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.070
scripted and I think social codes sort
of dictate how you behave in certain in

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080
of dictate how you behave in certain in
 

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.470
of dictate how you behave in certain in
certain situations so that something we

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480
certain situations so that something we
 

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.560
certain situations so that something we
became interested in this idea of

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:07.570
became interested in this idea of
 

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.400
became interested in this idea of
control within the public round

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:09.410
control within the public round
 

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.320
control within the public round
obviously there's sort of material

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:11.330
obviously there's sort of material
 

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.700
obviously there's sort of material
involved there's a lot of sort of

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:12.710
involved there's a lot of sort of
 

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.740
involved there's a lot of sort of
information and the material like in

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:14.750
information and the material like in
 

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.420
information and the material like in
this case of jersey barrier is then

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:16.430
this case of jersey barrier is then
 

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.160
this case of jersey barrier is then
overlaid with this kind of you know red

overlaid with this kind of you know red
 

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.110
overlaid with this kind of you know red
white and blue so it's sort of caught up

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.120
white and blue so it's sort of caught up
 

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.070
white and blue so it's sort of caught up
in the kind of political we became

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080
in the kind of political we became
 

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.390
in the kind of political we became
interested in these questions of

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400
interested in these questions of
 

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.170
interested in these questions of
visibility vision power control

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:28.180
visibility vision power control
 

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.760

case the idea of surveillance in
 

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.590
case the idea of surveillance in
paranoia sort of turned on its head the

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600
paranoia sort of turned on its head the
 

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.690
paranoia sort of turned on its head the
idea of calling attention to something

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:37.700
idea of calling attention to something
 

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.660

attenuated attention in the security

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:43.490
attenuated attention in the security

attenuated attention in the security
cameras so we noticed these things

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:45.710
cameras so we noticed these things
 

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.940
cameras so we noticed these things
happening in the city around us and we

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:48.950
happening in the city around us and we
 

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.530
happening in the city around us and we
sort of folded some of these ideas into

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:50.540
sort of folded some of these ideas into
 

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.720
sort of folded some of these ideas into
this project this is project we did in

developer said this is my site and you
 

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.130
developer said this is my site and you
make a public realm here and you sort of

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:12.140
make a public realm here and you sort of
 

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.160

animate the sidewalk and i said okay

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:15.170
animate the sidewalk and i said okay
 

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.800
animate the sidewalk and i said okay
maybe we should incorporate some sort of

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:17.810
maybe we should incorporate some sort of
 

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.900
maybe we should incorporate some sort of
public art piece news some signage maybe

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:19.910
public art piece news some signage maybe
 

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.110
public art piece news some signage maybe
some lighting maybe some interactive

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120
some lighting maybe some interactive
 

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.850
some lighting maybe some interactive
architecture so we did two things we did

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:24.860
architecture so we did two things we did
 

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.230
architecture so we did two things we did
this thing on the right which is a sort

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240
this thing on the right which is a sort
 

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.360
this thing on the right which is a sort
of what we call the sound grove which is

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:28.370
of what we call the sound grove which is
 

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.100

the kind of series of touch sensitive
musical instruments and on the on the

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:32.900
musical instruments and on the on the
 

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.330
musical instruments and on the on the
right this was a piece of building

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:34.340
right this was a piece of building

signage which doubles as a kind of

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:36.890
signage which doubles as a kind of
 

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.950
signage which doubles as a kind of
public art piece that's actually out in

we're thing about Vito and his project

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240
we're thing about Vito and his project
 

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.700
we're thing about Vito and his project
where he was shadowboxing with himself

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:45.710
where he was shadowboxing with himself
 

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.320
where he was shadowboxing with himself
and we thought it would be interesting

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:47.330
and we thought it would be interesting
 

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.990
and we thought it would be interesting
to get people to behave like this in the

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000
to get people to behave like this in the
 

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.630
to get people to behave like this in the
city you know in the street to sort of

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640
city you know in the street to sort of
 

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.690
city you know in the street to sort of
engage their own their own body gonna

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:54.700
engage their own their own body gonna
 

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.800
engage their own their own body gonna
kind of playful way so the LED net that

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:58.810
kind of playful way so the LED net that
 

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.710
kind of playful way so the LED net that
we design actually became a kind of

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720
we design actually became a kind of
 

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.600
we design actually became a kind of
digital shadow project we're not to sort

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:03.610
digital shadow project we're not to sort
 

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.250
digital shadow project we're not to sort
of you know we're not producing real

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:05.260
of you know we're not producing real
 

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.560
of you know we're not producing real
shadow were feeding surveillance footage

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:07.570
shadow were feeding surveillance footage
 

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.140
shadow were feeding surveillance footage
into the screen so the idea was that we

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.150
into the screen so the idea was that we
 

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.110
into the screen so the idea was that we
take the existing surveillance we put it

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120
take the existing surveillance we put it
 

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.670
take the existing surveillance we put it
into the screen and that would be

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:14.680
into the screen and that would be
 

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.760
into the screen and that would be
overlaid with the building address so in

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:17.770
overlaid with the building address so in
 

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.580
overlaid with the building address so in
this case address is 11 10 vermont

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:20.590
this case address is 11 10 vermont
 

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.220
this case address is 11 10 vermont
avenue the ones and zeros became a kind

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.230
avenue the ones and zeros became a kind
 

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.220
avenue the ones and zeros became a kind
of field condition and then the overlay

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:26.230
of field condition and then the overlay
 

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.860
of field condition and then the overlay
was the body sort of on top of that on

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:28.870
was the body sort of on top of that on
 

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:35.070
was the body sort of on top of that on
top of that graphic oops so we developed

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080
top of that graphic oops so we developed
 

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.400
top of that graphic oops so we developed
the pixel net it's not something that we

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:38.410
the pixel net it's not something that we
 

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.020
the pixel net it's not something that we
could buy off the shelf so again we sort

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.030
could buy off the shelf so again we sort
 

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.880
could buy off the shelf so again we sort
of went out and and worked with an

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:41.890
of went out and and worked with an
 

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.320
of went out and and worked with an
electronics engineer to custom

another video of this what it's like so

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:49.300
another video of this what it's like so
 

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.360
another video of this what it's like so
there's the building address there's a

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:51.370
there's the building address there's a
 

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:57.360
there's the building address there's a
shadow there's me startled maybe I can

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:57.370

address and in a way we felt like we

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640
address and in a way we felt like we
 

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.430
address and in a way we felt like we
managed to smuggle some sort of

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440
managed to smuggle some sort of
 

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.650
managed to smuggle some sort of
interactive behavior into something that

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:13.660
interactive behavior into something that
 

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.870
interactive behavior into something that
was by default condition was already

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880

kind of piece of commercial branding for

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240
kind of piece of commercial branding for
 

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.470
kind of piece of commercial branding for
this for this development so we sort of

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480
this for this development so we sort of
 

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.730
this for this development so we sort of
had some get some fun with that you know

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:26.740
had some get some fun with that you know
 

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.560
had some get some fun with that you know
we had some questions about it's sort of

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:28.570
we had some questions about it's sort of
 

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.050
we had some questions about it's sort of
commercial quality but in a way I think

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:31.060
commercial quality but in a way I think
 

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.480
commercial quality but in a way I think
that's how you get things done you have

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:33.490
that's how you get things done you have
 

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.520
that's how you get things done you have
to sort of find ways to find mechanisms

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:35.530
to sort of find ways to find mechanisms
 

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.740

developer that will support something

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.110
developer that will support something

like this the rd involves the

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720
like this the rd involves the
 

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.940
like this the rd involves the
development of the pixel here's a

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:44.950
development of the pixel here's a
 

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.840
development of the pixel here's a
two-sided pixel it's suspended on a on a

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:48.850
two-sided pixel it's suspended on a on a
 

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.270
two-sided pixel it's suspended on a on a
wire and the wire actually supports it

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280
wire and the wire actually supports it
 

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.460
wire and the wire actually supports it
it also provides power and it also

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:53.470
it also provides power and it also
 

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.770
it also provides power and it also
addresses it so it's sending a signal

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:55.780
addresses it so it's sending a signal
 

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.310
addresses it so it's sending a signal
and in a way it produces the screen and

00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320
and in a way it produces the screen and
 

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.350
and in a way it produces the screen and
into that screen we can broadcast in any

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360
into that screen we can broadcast in any
 

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.710
into that screen we can broadcast in any
content so once it's up we can sort of

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720
content so once it's up we can sort of
 

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.870
content so once it's up we can sort of
change its content a lot of the

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880
change its content a lot of the
 

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.210

development and I've gone by and I've

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:15.910
development and I've gone by and I've
 

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.760
development and I've gone by and I've
seen people sort of behaving strangely

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:17.770
seen people sort of behaving strangely
 

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.860
seen people sort of behaving strangely
in front of it they're sort of you know

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:19.870
in front of it they're sort of you know
 

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.320
in front of it they're sort of you know
trying to I'm trying to interact with

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:22.330
trying to I'm trying to interact with
 

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.330
trying to I'm trying to interact with
this piece so I kind of think that's in

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:24.340
this piece so I kind of think that's in
 

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.630
this piece so I kind of think that's in
a way sign of success the other part

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640
a way sign of success the other part
 

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.970
a way sign of success the other part
that like the sound Grove is the

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:29.980
that like the sound Grove is the
 

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.790
that like the sound Grove is the
stainless steel poles in this case we

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:32.800
stainless steel poles in this case we
 

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.230
stainless steel poles in this case we
didn't use infrared sensors is the

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240
didn't use infrared sensors is the
 

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.940
didn't use infrared sensors is the
capacity sensors so basically you're

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:35.950
capacity sensors so basically you're
 

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.580
capacity sensors so basically you're
your body has a kind of electrical

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:38.590
your body has a kind of electrical
 

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.530
your body has a kind of electrical
charge to it and that electrical charge

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:40.540
charge to it and that electrical charge
 

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.600
charge to it and that electrical charge
disrupts and causes the triggers a

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:42.610
disrupts and causes the triggers a
 

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.770
disrupts and causes the triggers a
sensor so we worked with a sound

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:46.780
sensor so we worked with a sound
 

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.510
sensor so we worked with a sound

composer to develop these different
 

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.960
composer to develop these different
sounds and within this we sort of

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:51.970
sounds and within this we sort of
 

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.060

invented ways to sort of communicate a

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.070

around we actually documented it very

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:40.289
around we actually documented it very
 

00:23:40.289 --> 00:23:43.399

seriously with a video camera but we

00:23:43.399 --> 00:23:43.409
seriously with a video camera but we
 

00:23:43.409 --> 00:23:45.789

went out there one day and found people

00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799
went out there one day and found people
 

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:47.719
went out there one day and found people
playing with it and actually I found

00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:47.729
playing with it and actually I found
 

00:23:47.729 --> 00:23:50.690
playing with it and actually I found
stuff on YouTube which is hilarious I'll

it stacked it like this and it produces

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:21.790
it stacked it like this and it produces
 

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.450
it stacked it like this and it produces
sort of panel in the lobby and then

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:24.460
sort of panel in the lobby and then
 

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.070
sort of panel in the lobby and then
every piece of glass is independently

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080
every piece of glass is independently
 

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.540
every piece of glass is independently
computer controlled with RGB lighting so

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:29.550
computer controlled with RGB lighting so
 

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.670
computer controlled with RGB lighting so
again a kind of custom circuit board

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:32.680
again a kind of custom circuit board
 

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.190
again a kind of custom circuit board
again some sort of programming of the

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200
again some sort of programming of the
 

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.740
again some sort of programming of the
behavior of this thing and then the end

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:37.750
behavior of this thing and then the end
 

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.900
behavior of this thing and then the end
it produces a kind of an animated

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:39.910
it produces a kind of an animated
 

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.660
it produces a kind of an animated
material so the material this is all

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:42.670
material so the material this is all
 

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:45.060
material so the material this is all
glass it's all n stacked leather stacked

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:45.070
glass it's all n stacked leather stacked
 

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:47.070
glass it's all n stacked leather stacked
up and then we're just sort of

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080
up and then we're just sort of
 

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.690
up and then we're just sort of
controlling a behavior of the lights as

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:48.700
controlling a behavior of the lights as
 

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.400
controlling a behavior of the lights as
it sort of scrolls up and down so again

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:50.410
it sort of scrolls up and down so again
 

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.100
it sort of scrolls up and down so again
this is pretty low res in terms of

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:53.110
this is pretty low res in terms of
 

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:56.670
this is pretty low res in terms of
behavior and it's pretty crude but in a

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:56.680
behavior and it's pretty crude but in a
 

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.490
behavior and it's pretty crude but in a
way I think the suggestion is that it

00:27:59.490 --> 00:27:59.500
way I think the suggestion is that it
 

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.580
way I think the suggestion is that it
could produce modes of sort of animating

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:02.590
could produce modes of sort of animating
 

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.520
could produce modes of sort of animating
animating space and material

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:05.530
animating space and material
 

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:06.890
animating space and material
something that we're sort of looking at

speed of rotation and it kind of the
 

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.470
speed of rotation and it kind of the
configuration of material and how it

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480
configuration of material and how it
 

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.560

that would be luminous and it would be
 

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:57.980
that would be luminous and it would be
lit with solar solar panels so the panel

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:57.990
lit with solar solar panels so the panel
 

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:59.899
lit with solar solar panels so the panel
would sort of charge during the day at

00:29:59.899 --> 00:29:59.909
would sort of charge during the day at
 

00:29:59.909 --> 00:30:01.279
would sort of charge during the day at
nighttime I would I would sort of

nighttime I would I would sort of
 

00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:02.960
nighttime I would I would sort of
consume the energy but it had sort of

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:02.970
consume the energy but it had sort of
 

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.210
consume the energy but it had sort of
stored up and in a way that would index

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220
stored up and in a way that would index
 

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.899
stored up and in a way that would index
the like quality during the day so this

00:30:08.899 --> 00:30:08.909
the like quality during the day so this
 

00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:11.810
the like quality during the day so this
is the flexible photovoltaic battery and

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820
is the flexible photovoltaic battery and
 

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:16.149

a rope light this was a new orleans and
the geometry was sort of sculpted such

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:19.049
the geometry was sort of sculpted such
 

00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:21.649
the geometry was sort of sculpted such
that it would face optimal orientation

shape is just to kind of loft and then

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440
shape is just to kind of loft and then
 

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.200

the bias is introduced to it oriented

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.210
the bias is introduced to it oriented
 

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.450
the bias is introduced to it oriented
so

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:48.460
so

see those solar panels there and then it

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:00.220
see those solar panels there and then it

responsive but it just sort of measured
 

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.220
responsive but it just sort of measured
and I think it broadcasted a kind of

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:10.230
and I think it broadcasted a kind of
 

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:14.490

locally so it was sort of starting to
 

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.990
locally so it was sort of starting to
think about how do we talk about issues

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000
think about how do we talk about issues
 

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.990
think about how do we talk about issues
of energy issues of space issues of

I wanted to talk a little bit about an
 

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.220

space projects part of that you know
 

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.080
space projects part of that you know
involves some R&amp;D in terms of technology

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.090
involves some R&amp;D in terms of technology
 

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.330
involves some R&amp;D in terms of technology
but also I think what's been interesting

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.340
but also I think what's been interesting
 

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.130
but also I think what's been interesting
for us is to engage the idea of the

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140
for us is to engage the idea of the
 

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.710
for us is to engage the idea of the
public realm as a project and how do we

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720
public realm as a project and how do we
 

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.110

as architects not just worried about the

as architects not just worried about the
 

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.130
as architects not just worried about the
buildings but actually worried about

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140
buildings but actually worried about
 

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.710
buildings but actually worried about
that space between the buildings and all

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720
that space between the buildings and all
 

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.310
that space between the buildings and all
the territory that comes with it so

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320
the territory that comes with it so

recently in Boston the Big Dig was
completed the Big Dig as you may know is

of parks and so we saw this thing we saw

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:42.090
of parks and so we saw this thing we saw
 

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.120
of parks and so we saw this thing we saw
the sort of construction sort of recede

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.130
the sort of construction sort of recede
 

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.070
the sort of construction sort of recede
and then we saw the emergence of this

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080
and then we saw the emergence of this
 

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.350
and then we saw the emergence of this
new public realm but we found it sort of

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360
new public realm but we found it sort of
 

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.940
new public realm but we found it sort of
underwhelming and so we sort of took on

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:49.950
underwhelming and so we sort of took on
 

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.730
underwhelming and so we sort of took on
this as a book project we sort of did

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740
this as a book project we sort of did
 

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.490
this as a book project we sort of did
some research about its history Boston

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500
some research about its history Boston
 

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.780
some research about its history Boston
and it's sort of evolving coastline this

00:33:59.780 --> 00:33:59.790
and it's sort of evolving coastline this
 

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.780

was the raised highway the two parts of

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:02.790
was the raised highway the two parts of
 

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.130
was the raised highway the two parts of
the city that was sort of split in two

the city that was sort of split in two
 

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.040
the city that was sort of split in two
and so we discovered something about our

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.050
and so we discovered something about our
 

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:10.430
and so we discovered something about our
own backyard in a way we didn't have to

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440

the feeling was that this would

00:34:30.059 --> 00:34:30.069
the feeling was that this would
 

00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:31.980
the feeling was that this would
reconnect the city but we felt that this

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:31.990
reconnect the city but we felt that this
 

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:35.069
reconnect the city but we felt that this
was somehow not sufficient and so it

00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079
was somehow not sufficient and so it
 

00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:36.450
was somehow not sufficient and so it
didn't acknowledge the fact that this

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:36.460
didn't acknowledge the fact that this
 

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.129
didn't acknowledge the fact that this
was an incredible sort of technological

00:34:38.129 --> 00:34:38.139
was an incredible sort of technological
 

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.540
was an incredible sort of technological
achievement this is actually

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:39.550
achievement this is actually

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:31.780
for the car but not for the pedestrian
 

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.950
for the car but not for the pedestrian
and so the surface sort of surface

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960
and so the surface sort of surface
 

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.390
and so the surface sort of surface
inhabitants we're sort of left out of

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400
inhabitants we're sort of left out of
 

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.150
inhabitants we're sort of left out of
that so we propose that kind of some

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160
that so we propose that kind of some
 

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.099

at the bent structures for exhausting
 

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.750
at the bent structures for exhausting
the tunnels and we proposed gather

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760
the tunnels and we proposed gather
 

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.780
the tunnels and we proposed gather

the funding evaporated so what could we

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:34.180
the funding evaporated so what could we
 

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.630
the funding evaporated so what could we
put there almost instantaneously and we

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640
put there almost instantaneously and we
 

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.640

was that when the funding actually comes

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:55.750
was that when the funding actually comes
 

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.240
was that when the funding actually comes

talk to you about mapping the immaterial

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:27.670
talk to you about mapping the immaterial

city Sarah's work I think definitively

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:33.940
city Sarah's work I think definitively

lies in that sort of zone where we as

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:36.670
lies in that sort of zone where we as
 

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:40.250
lies in that sort of zone where we as
architects used to do our mappings and

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260
architects used to do our mappings and
 

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.690
architects used to do our mappings and
categorize everything is unknowable and

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:42.700
categorize everything is unknowable and
 

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.059
categorize everything is unknowable and
therefore we did our mappings from

00:39:45.059 --> 00:39:45.069
therefore we did our mappings from
 

00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:49.230
therefore we did our mappings from
empirical data and usually based on

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240
empirical data and usually based on
 

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.180
empirical data and usually based on
preconceived ideas about the city and

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:51.190
preconceived ideas about the city and
 

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.400
preconceived ideas about the city and
then we went and designed a building

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:53.410
then we went and designed a building
 

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.230
then we went and designed a building
based on that same preconceived idea

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240
based on that same preconceived idea
 

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.450
based on that same preconceived idea
about the city and made sure that the

about the city and made sure that the
 

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.030
about the city and made sure that the
mapping verified the building and

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040
mapping verified the building and
 

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.559

sort of erasing the architects ability

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:10.660
sort of erasing the architects ability
 

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.859
sort of erasing the architects ability
to use our once highly powerful tool of

00:40:13.859 --> 00:40:13.869
to use our once highly powerful tool of
 

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:17.609
to use our once highly powerful tool of
smoke and mirrors so and now that now

00:40:17.609 --> 00:40:17.619
smoke and mirrors so and now that now
 

00:40:17.619 --> 00:40:19.079
smoke and mirrors so and now that now
that she's erased our ability to use

00:40:19.079 --> 00:40:19.089
that she's erased our ability to use
 

00:40:19.089 --> 00:40:21.000
that she's erased our ability to use
smoke and mirrors she has to show us how

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:21.010
smoke and mirrors she has to show us how
 

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:21.480
smoke and mirrors she has to show us how
to

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:21.490
to
 

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:26.750
to
to generate real data in real maps with

to generate real data in real maps with
 

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:42.240
to generate real data in real maps with
concrete results sir so as just said I

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:42.250
concrete results sir so as just said I

run the spatial information design lab

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640
run the spatial information design lab
 

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:51.930
run the spatial information design lab
here at Columbia and the lab focuses on

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:51.940
here at Columbia and the lab focuses on
 

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.050
here at Columbia and the lab focuses on
a methodological approached to use data

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:55.060
a methodological approached to use data
 

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.540
a methodological approached to use data
about places to expose social and

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:57.550
about places to expose social and
 

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.120
about places to expose social and
environmental issues that might not have

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:00.130
environmental issues that might not have
 

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:04.170
environmental issues that might not have
otherwise been seen and we do this

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:04.180
otherwise been seen and we do this
 

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.200
otherwise been seen and we do this
through something I have I think that's

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:07.210
through something I have I think that's
 

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:08.910
through something I have I think that's
a little bit different from some of the

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920
a little bit different from some of the
 

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.090
a little bit different from some of the
other labs here at Columbia really use

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:12.100
other labs here at Columbia really use
 

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.160
other labs here at Columbia really use
we're interested in quantitative

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:14.170
we're interested in quantitative
 

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.780
we're interested in quantitative
analysis geographic representation and

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:17.790
analysis geographic representation and
 

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.960
analysis geographic representation and
visualization so at the lab we really

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:21.970
visualization so at the lab we really
 

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:25.760
visualization so at the lab we really
try to take as just that actual data

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:25.770
try to take as just that actual data
 

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.710
try to take as just that actual data
quantify it and actually do spatial

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720
quantify it and actually do spatial
 

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.599
quantify it and actually do spatial
analysis statistical results but then

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:30.609
analysis statistical results but then
 

00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:32.580
analysis statistical results but then
actually make compelling visualizations

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:32.590
actually make compelling visualizations
 

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.859
actually make compelling visualizations
out of those so that we can be both

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:34.869
out of those so that we can be both
 

00:41:34.869 --> 00:41:39.120
out of those so that we can be both
scientific and that our data can uphold

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:39.130
scientific and that our data can uphold
 

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.020
scientific and that our data can uphold
a scientific rigor but also it can

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:42.030
a scientific rigor but also it can
 

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:46.590
a scientific rigor but also it can
present a compelling message so one of

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:46.600
present a compelling message so one of
 

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.270
present a compelling message so one of
the things I thought about when I heard

the things I thought about when I heard
that title for this lecture today is um

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:51.220
that title for this lecture today is um
 

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.609
that title for this lecture today is um
you know I'm originally trained as a

00:41:53.609 --> 00:41:53.619
you know I'm originally trained as a
 

00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:56.400
you know I'm originally trained as a
geographer and we always think about

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:56.410
geographer and we always think about
 

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.770
geographer and we always think about
problems as they relate to space and

00:41:58.770 --> 00:41:58.780
problems as they relate to space and
 

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.900
problems as they relate to space and
proximity that's kind of the basis of

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:00.910
proximity that's kind of the basis of
 

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.570
proximity that's kind of the basis of
what geographers are and more

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:03.580
what geographers are and more
 

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.010
what geographers are and more
importantly we think about how place

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:05.020
importantly we think about how place
 

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.390
importantly we think about how place
plays a role and how we develop society

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400
plays a role and how we develop society
 

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.950
plays a role and how we develop society
so I thought it would be interesting to

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960
so I thought it would be interesting to
 

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.200
so I thought it would be interesting to
put this quote up at the beginning of

put this quote up at the beginning of
 

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.950
put this quote up at the beginning of
the lecture to talk about actually I'm

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960
the lecture to talk about actually I'm

one of the famous geographers from the
 

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.800
one of the famous geographers from the
1800's said that Myrnin's and places are

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:22.810
1800's said that Myrnin's and places are
 

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.840
1800's said that Myrnin's and places are
not geography most people think

data but what can they tell us about
 

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.520
data but what can they tell us about
cause and effects in the city and so

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:21.530
cause and effects in the city and so
 

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.690

always reading the metropolis as I think
most of us are as architects and

most of us are as architects and

most of us are as architects and
planners and designers I think that's

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:51.840
planners and designers I think that's
 

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.390

that's why we're here but um and I think

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400
that's why we're here but um and I think
 

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.410
that's why we're here but um and I think
I'm pretty interactive too but but I

I'm pretty interactive too but but I
 

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.020
I'm pretty interactive too but but I
don't think that's why Josh asked me to

don't think that's why Josh asked me to

don't think that's why Josh asked me to
come speak so what I wanted to talk

come speak so what I wanted to talk
 

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.080
come speak so what I wanted to talk
about is a research area that I've been

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:25.800
information register by place that we
leave behind as we interact with the

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:25.810
leave behind as we interact with the
 

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:29.490
leave behind as we interact with the
digital environment and so when we swipe

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:29.500
digital environment and so when we swipe
 

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.550
digital environment and so when we swipe
our subway card we leave information

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560
our subway card we leave information
 

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:34.740
our subway card we leave information
about where we are when how long we were

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:34.750
about where we are when how long we were
 

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:37.920
about where we are when how long we were
there where we're going to when we use

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:37.930
there where we're going to when we use
 

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.599
there where we're going to when we use
our cell phone we're leaving bits of

00:44:39.599 --> 00:44:39.609
our cell phone we're leaving bits of
 

00:44:39.609 --> 00:44:41.370
our cell phone we're leaving bits of
information about who we called where we

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:41.380
information about who we called where we
 

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.859
information about who we called where we
call who were talking to and this is

00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:43.869
call who were talking to and this is
 

00:44:43.869 --> 00:44:47.310
call who were talking to and this is
becoming more prominent recently with

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:47.320
becoming more prominent recently with
 

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.880
becoming more prominent recently with
new cell phone applications that

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:49.890
new cell phone applications that
 

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.859
new cell phone applications that
specifically target positioning yourself

00:44:52.859 --> 00:44:52.869
specifically target positioning yourself
 

00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:55.290
specifically target positioning yourself
within the urban environment when we use

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:55.300
within the urban environment when we use
 

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:59.270
within the urban environment when we use
wireless internet we're connecting to

00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280
wireless internet we're connecting to
 

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.000
wireless internet we're connecting to
certain locations and we're doing this

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:03.010
certain locations and we're doing this
 

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.890
certain locations and we're doing this
in certain places and we're connecting

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:04.900
in certain places and we're connecting
 

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.599
in certain places and we're connecting
to a certain places at certain locations

00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:06.609
to a certain places at certain locations
 

00:45:06.609 --> 00:45:11.000
to a certain places at certain locations
etc these all have kind of a place-based

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.010
etc these all have kind of a place-based
 

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.190
etc these all have kind of a place-based
specificity surveillance cameras also

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200
specificity surveillance cameras also
 

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.240
specificity surveillance cameras also
mark and trace us as we move through the

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:18.250
mark and trace us as we move through the
 

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:22.710
mark and trace us as we move through the
urban environment and new location based

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720
urban environment and new location based
 

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.130
urban environment and new location based
services applications have been more

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:26.140
services applications have been more
 

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.980
services applications have been more
developed specifically to target this

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:28.990
developed specifically to target this
 

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.740
developed specifically to target this
kind of what I call spatial data traces

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:31.750
kind of what I call spatial data traces
 

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:36.930
kind of what I call spatial data traces
Foursquare or God go Willa or where are

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:36.940
Foursquare or God go Willa or where are
 

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:39.270
Foursquare or God go Willa or where are
all actually asking participants to

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280
all actually asking participants to
 

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.460
all actually asking participants to
actively leave their traces about

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:41.470
actively leave their traces about
 

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:46.170
actively leave their traces about
themselves so how can these spatial data

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:46.180
themselves so how can these spatial data
 

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.599
themselves so how can these spatial data
traces be used to analyze the cities is

00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:48.609
traces be used to analyze the cities is
 

00:45:48.609 --> 00:45:52.740
traces be used to analyze the cities is
what I'm interested in and one of the

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:52.750
what I'm interested in and one of the
 

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.960
what I'm interested in and one of the
things that I thought about when Josh

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:54.970
things that I thought about when Josh
 

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:57.150
things that I thought about when Josh
asked me to give the lectures is how do

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160
asked me to give the lectures is how do
 

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.730
asked me to give the lectures is how do
i how do i classify these different data

00:45:59.730 --> 00:45:59.740
i how do i classify these different data
 

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.560
i how do i classify these different data
types these different data traces is a

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:01.570
types these different data traces is a
 

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:04.050
types these different data traces is a
framework for for setting up the lecture

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:04.060
framework for for setting up the lecture
 

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:08.420
framework for for setting up the lecture
and I think there's three main types of

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:08.430
and I think there's three main types of
 

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:12.839
and I think there's three main types of
data there's process data I've curated

00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:12.849
data there's process data I've curated
 

00:46:12.849 --> 00:46:15.960
data there's process data I've curated
data and something I call self

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:15.970
data and something I call self
 

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.420
data and something I call self
registered data and I think each data

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:18.430
registered data and I think each data
 

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:21.270
registered data and I think each data
type allows you to talk or say something

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280
type allows you to talk or say something
 

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.160
type allows you to talk or say something
different about the city and so I'm

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:23.170
different about the city and so I'm
 

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:25.109
different about the city and so I'm
going to use examples from

00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119
going to use examples from
 

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:27.269
going to use examples from
research in the lab kind of explain what

00:46:27.269 --> 00:46:27.279
research in the lab kind of explain what
 

00:46:27.279 --> 00:46:31.650
research in the lab kind of explain what
I mean by that to process data is the

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:31.660
I mean by that to process data is the
 

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:36.180
I mean by that to process data is the
intent of the datas on the part of the

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:36.190
intent of the datas on the part of the
 

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:40.019
intent of the datas on the part of the
individual is very low so the collection

00:46:40.019 --> 00:46:40.029
individual is very low so the collection
 

00:46:40.029 --> 00:46:41.640
individual is very low so the collection
just kind of happens as you're moving

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:41.650
just kind of happens as you're moving
 

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:43.499
just kind of happens as you're moving
through the environment the individual

00:46:43.499 --> 00:46:43.509
through the environment the individual
 

00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:45.150
through the environment the individual
who's leaving their trace might not

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160
who's leaving their trace might not
 

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.150
who's leaving their trace might not
really be aware that that's happening

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160
really be aware that that's happening
 

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.650
really be aware that that's happening
the organization and collection is

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:49.660
the organization and collection is
 

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.440
the organization and collection is
systematic and highly automated and the

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:52.450
systematic and highly automated and the
 

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:54.870
systematic and highly automated and the
trace is hidden and the barrier to

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880
trace is hidden and the barrier to
 

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.789
trace is hidden and the barrier to
access is high and so I'm going to talk

00:46:56.789 --> 00:46:56.799
access is high and so I'm going to talk
 

00:46:56.799 --> 00:46:58.589
access is high and so I'm going to talk
about what I what I mean by that through

00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599
about what I what I mean by that through
 

00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:00.960
about what I what I mean by that through
through the projects and come back to it

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:00.970
through the projects and come back to it
 

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:04.650
through the projects and come back to it
but I think process data really equals

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:04.660
but I think process data really equals
 

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.950
but I think process data really equals
kind of the pulse of the city because

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960
kind of the pulse of the city because
 

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.660
kind of the pulse of the city because
it's it's kind of data that we're

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:09.670
it's it's kind of data that we're
 

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.160
it's it's kind of data that we're
leaving behind as we're moving through

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:11.170
leaving behind as we're moving through
 

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:13.519
leaving behind as we're moving through
the city and we're not necessarily aware

00:47:13.519 --> 00:47:13.529
the city and we're not necessarily aware
 

00:47:13.529 --> 00:47:17.069
the city and we're not necessarily aware
that we're leaving that information so a

00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.079
that we're leaving that information so a
 

00:47:17.079 --> 00:47:20.309
that we're leaving that information so a
great example is looking at the bits of

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319
great example is looking at the bits of
 

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:23.279
great example is looking at the bits of
information that we leave behind for

00:47:23.279 --> 00:47:23.289
information that we leave behind for
 

00:47:23.289 --> 00:47:27.089
information that we leave behind for
cell phones and this is a project that i

00:47:27.089 --> 00:47:27.099
cell phones and this is a project that i
 

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:29.130
cell phones and this is a project that i
actually did with the sensible cities

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:29.140
actually did with the sensible cities
 

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.410
actually did with the sensible cities
lab where we looked at cell phone data

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:31.420
lab where we looked at cell phone data
 

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.420
lab where we looked at cell phone data
and we had something that look like this

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:33.430
and we had something that look like this
 

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:36.569
and we had something that look like this
this is a cellphone record it has a ID

00:47:36.569 --> 00:47:36.579
this is a cellphone record it has a ID
 

00:47:36.579 --> 00:47:39.599
this is a cellphone record it has a ID
tower as a day of the week it has where

00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:39.609
tower as a day of the week it has where
 

00:47:39.609 --> 00:47:43.589
tower as a day of the week it has where
we were connected to this is a project

00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599
we were connected to this is a project
 

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.109
we were connected to this is a project
was done in milan italy and this is

00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:46.119
was done in milan italy and this is
 

00:47:46.119 --> 00:47:49.380
was done in milan italy and this is
actually an image of all the towers cell

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:49.390
actually an image of all the towers cell
 

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.410
actually an image of all the towers cell
phone towers in milan at the time that

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:52.420
phone towers in milan at the time that
 

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.190
phone towers in milan at the time that
we did the project and what we had were

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200
we did the project and what we had were
 

00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.210
we did the project and what we had were
was a database that told us each cell

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:00.220
was a database that told us each cell
 

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.279
was a database that told us each cell
phone user how they were connected to

00:48:04.279 --> 00:48:04.289
phone user how they were connected to
 

00:48:04.289 --> 00:48:07.259
phone user how they were connected to
different towers so these would

00:48:07.259 --> 00:48:07.269
different towers so these would
 

00:48:07.269 --> 00:48:10.170
different towers so these would
represent three different cell phone

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:10.180
represent three different cell phone
 

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.749
represent three different cell phone
towers and the angle in which they were

00:48:12.749 --> 00:48:12.759
towers and the angle in which they were
 

00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:16.140
towers and the angle in which they were
connected to that tower and what that

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:16.150
connected to that tower and what that
 

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.670
connected to that tower and what that
allowed you to do is actually to

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680
allowed you to do is actually to
 

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.099
allowed you to do is actually to
triangulate the position within 50

00:48:20.099 --> 00:48:20.109
triangulate the position within 50
 

00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:22.170
triangulate the position within 50
meters and so you could figure out the

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:22.180
meters and so you could figure out the
 

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.539
meters and so you could figure out the
position of the person using the cell

00:48:24.539 --> 00:48:24.549
position of the person using the cell
 

00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:26.700
position of the person using the cell
phone at that occasion we were able to

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:26.710
phone at that occasion we were able to
 

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:30.120
phone at that occasion we were able to
map those users and then create a series

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:30.130
map those users and then create a series
 

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.390
map those users and then create a series
of maps in the city of Milan and so this

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400
of maps in the city of Milan and so this
 

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.540
of maps in the city of Milan and so this
is actually

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:34.550
is actually
 

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:47.520
is actually
on train station at 4pm 5pm 6pm 7pm 8pm

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:47.530
 
 

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.950
 
and what you can see is that something

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960
and what you can see is that something
 

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.110
and what you can see is that something
we might already know the train station

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:53.120
we might already know the train station
 

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.760
we might already know the train station
is really busy during rush hour but I

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:57.770
is really busy during rush hour but I

what so what does this mean who cares
 

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.960
what so what does this mean who cares
like we mapped things that we already

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:55.970
like we mapped things that we already
 

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.240

four and eight and you can see how kind
 

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:11.160
four and eight and you can see how kind
of it's a kind of an inverse between the

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:11.170
of it's a kind of an inverse between the
 

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:13.800
of it's a kind of an inverse between the
two there's very similar project that I

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:13.810
two there's very similar project that I
 

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:15.870
two there's very similar project that I
just wanted to highlight because it was

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880
just wanted to highlight because it was
 

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.340
just wanted to highlight because it was
recently in the New York Times and

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:17.350
recently in the New York Times and
 

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:19.140
recently in the New York Times and
people might have seen it but in New

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:19.150
people might have seen it but in New
 

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:23.790
people might have seen it but in New
York City all the cabs have gps units in

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:23.800
York City all the cabs have gps units in
 

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.670
York City all the cabs have gps units in
them and the New York Times did a very

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680
them and the New York Times did a very
 

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.710
them and the New York Times did a very
similar kind of mapping which I think

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720
similar kind of mapping which I think
 

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.950
similar kind of mapping which I think

be both feet they were able to begin to
 

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:02.070
be both feet they were able to begin to
talk about some patterns that they they

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:02.080
talk about some patterns that they they
 

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.060
talk about some patterns that they they
saw so kind of what we all know is the

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:06.070
saw so kind of what we all know is the

highlight of that Bloomingdale's and so
it's kind of a proxy for understanding

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:18.730
it's kind of a proxy for understanding

of tulsi actually so process data can

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:30.310
of tulsi actually so process data can
 

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.680
of tulsi actually so process data can
help us understand process pattern

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:32.690
help us understand process pattern
 

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:36.130
help us understand process pattern
which which in turn can tell us about

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:36.140
which which in turn can tell us about
 

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:40.089
which which in turn can tell us about
human behavior how people operate so

00:52:40.089 --> 00:52:40.099
human behavior how people operate so
 

00:52:40.099 --> 00:52:44.829
human behavior how people operate so
another process oriented our data that I

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839
another process oriented our data that I
 

00:52:44.839 --> 00:52:47.290
another process oriented our data that I
would categorize as process oriented is

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:47.300
would categorize as process oriented is

things and this project we actually took

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480
things and this project we actually took
 

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.230
things and this project we actually took
the process data associated with the

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240
the process data associated with the
 

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.910
the process data associated with the
criminal justice system to tell us

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920
criminal justice system to tell us
 

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.559
criminal justice system to tell us
something about that and we had

00:53:11.559 --> 00:53:11.569
something about that and we had
 

00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:14.319
something about that and we had
information about all the dresses of

00:53:14.319 --> 00:53:14.329
information about all the dresses of
 

00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:16.420

where people lived before they went into
prison and how long they were going to

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:19.910
prison and how long they were going to
 

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.990
prison and how long they were going to
be incarcerated to get an idea of how

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000
be incarcerated to get an idea of how
 

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.359
be incarcerated to get an idea of how
much it costs to incarcerate people in

00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:25.369
much it costs to incarcerate people in
 

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:27.550
much it costs to incarcerate people in
the city so the data came to us like

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:27.560
the city so the data came to us like
 

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.250
the city so the data came to us like
this and we had addresses and we were

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:30.260
this and we had addresses and we were
 

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.970
this and we had addresses and we were
able to geo locate those addresses to

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:33.980
able to geo locate those addresses to
 

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.089
able to geo locate those addresses to
see where those people lived in the city

00:53:36.089 --> 00:53:36.099
see where those people lived in the city
 

00:53:36.099 --> 00:53:40.020
see where those people lived in the city
and then we added about buck laibach

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.030
and then we added about buck laibach
 

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:44.710
and then we added about buck laibach
sorry 359 million dollars to imprison

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720
sorry 359 million dollars to imprison
 

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.460
sorry 359 million dollars to imprison
people from Brooklyn in a year and we

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:48.470
people from Brooklyn in a year and we
 

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:53.010
people from Brooklyn in a year and we
mapped those block by block in the city

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:53.020
mapped those block by block in the city
 

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.839
mapped those block by block in the city
so this is prison expenditures in

00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:55.849
so this is prison expenditures in
 

00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:58.510
so this is prison expenditures in
specimens dollar so these red blocks

00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520
specimens dollar so these red blocks
 

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.059
specimens dollar so these red blocks
highlight those places where just in one

00:54:01.059 --> 00:54:01.069
highlight those places where just in one
 

00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:03.609

single city block over a million dollars

00:54:03.609 --> 00:54:03.619
single city block over a million dollars
 

00:54:03.619 --> 00:54:05.950
single city block over a million dollars
was spent to incarcerate people from

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960
was spent to incarcerate people from
 

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:09.339
was spent to incarcerate people from
that fat block so data in a geographic

00:54:09.339 --> 00:54:09.349
that fat block so data in a geographic
 

00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:11.020
that fat block so data in a geographic
contact shows that people in prison are

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:11.030
contact shows that people in prison are
 

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:12.940
contact shows that people in prison are
highly concentrated in neighborhood

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:12.950
highly concentrated in neighborhood
 

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.190
highly concentrated in neighborhood
areas while crime is more dispersed

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200
areas while crime is more dispersed
 

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.780
areas while crime is more dispersed
across the city this is actually a map

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:19.790
across the city this is actually a map
 

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:23.430
across the city this is actually a map
of prison emission density versus crime

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440
of prison emission density versus crime
 

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.410
of prison emission density versus crime
density that we developed out of this

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:26.420
density that we developed out of this
 

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.410

project from a democratic view this

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:29.420

spending facilitate a mass migration of

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240
spending facilitate a mass migration of
 

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.990
spending facilitate a mass migration of
people to prison 95% who eventually

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000
people to prison 95% who eventually
 

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.799
people to prison 95% who eventually
returned home and

00:54:37.799 --> 00:54:37.809
returned home and
 

00:54:37.809 --> 00:54:41.420
returned home and
and this drawing we actually took each

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:41.430
and this drawing we actually took each
 

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:45.269
and this drawing we actually took each
location of a prisoner and connected

00:54:45.269 --> 00:54:45.279
location of a prisoner and connected
 

00:54:45.279 --> 00:54:48.120
location of a prisoner and connected
them to the prison that they eventually

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:48.130
them to the prison that they eventually
 

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:52.620
them to the prison that they eventually
ended up in so this is the migration

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:52.630
ended up in so this is the migration
 

00:54:52.630 --> 00:55:01.559
ended up in so this is the migration
that you see so if you zoom in to some

00:55:01.559 --> 00:55:01.569
that you see so if you zoom in to some
 

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:06.179
that you see so if you zoom in to some
of these communities community district

00:55:06.179 --> 00:55:06.189
of these communities community district
 

00:55:06.189 --> 00:55:08.579
of these communities community district
16 has 3.5 percent of Britain's

00:55:08.579 --> 00:55:08.589
16 has 3.5 percent of Britain's
 

00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:10.499
16 has 3.5 percent of Britain's
population in eight point five percent

00:55:10.499 --> 00:55:10.509
population in eight point five percent
 

00:55:10.509 --> 00:55:13.289
population in eight point five percent
of his prison emissions so this is

00:55:13.289 --> 00:55:13.299
of his prison emissions so this is
 

00:55:13.299 --> 00:55:17.660
of his prison emissions so this is
community district 16 and when you see

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:17.670
community district 16 and when you see
 

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:22.979
community district 16 and when you see
these blocks you can see that almost 12

00:55:22.979 --> 00:55:22.989
these blocks you can see that almost 12
 

00:55:22.989 --> 00:55:25.920
these blocks you can see that almost 12
million dollars was spent to incarcerate

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:25.930
million dollars was spent to incarcerate
 

00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:29.390
million dollars was spent to incarcerate
people in 2003 and we call these

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400
people in 2003 and we call these
 

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.789
people in 2003 and we call these
million-dollar blocks and so on a

00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799
million-dollar blocks and so on a
 

00:55:32.799 --> 00:55:34.979
million-dollar blocks and so on a
financial scale prison is becoming the

00:55:34.979 --> 00:55:34.989
financial scale prison is becoming the
 

00:55:34.989 --> 00:55:36.900
financial scale prison is becoming the
predominant governing institution in the

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:36.910
predominant governing institution in the
 

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:39.120
predominant governing institution in the
neighborhood but for lack of investment

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.130
neighborhood but for lack of investment
 

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:41.729
neighborhood but for lack of investment
in resettlement up to forty percent of

00:55:41.729 --> 00:55:41.739
in resettlement up to forty percent of
 

00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:43.739
in resettlement up to forty percent of
those who come home or eventually return

00:55:43.739 --> 00:55:43.749
those who come home or eventually return
 

00:55:43.749 --> 00:55:47.519
those who come home or eventually return
to prison so what if more resources were

00:55:47.519 --> 00:55:47.529
to prison so what if more resources were
 

00:55:47.529 --> 00:55:49.769
to prison so what if more resources were
organized around settlement them around

00:55:49.769 --> 00:55:49.779
organized around settlement them around
 

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:51.660
organized around settlement them around
displacement how would these parts of

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:51.670
displacement how would these parts of
 

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:55.199
displacement how would these parts of
the city look different so in this case

00:55:55.199 --> 00:55:55.209
the city look different so in this case
 

00:55:55.209 --> 00:55:57.749
the city look different so in this case
we took process data I have turned it on

00:55:57.749 --> 00:55:57.759
we took process data I have turned it on
 

00:55:57.759 --> 00:56:00.989
we took process data I have turned it on
its head and we said what if we can

00:56:00.989 --> 00:56:00.999
its head and we said what if we can
 

00:56:00.999 --> 00:56:03.630
its head and we said what if we can
illustrate how much money is being spent

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640
illustrate how much money is being spent
 

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.779
illustrate how much money is being spent
to kind of send people away from prison

00:56:06.779 --> 00:56:06.789
to kind of send people away from prison
 

00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:09.809
to kind of send people away from prison
but what if when they returned home when

00:56:09.809 --> 00:56:09.819
but what if when they returned home when
 

00:56:09.819 --> 00:56:11.279
but what if when they returned home when
they return home they don't have the

00:56:11.279 --> 00:56:11.289
they return home they don't have the
 

00:56:11.289 --> 00:56:13.620
they return home they don't have the
resources so the same amount of money is

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:13.630
resources so the same amount of money is
 

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:16.169
resources so the same amount of money is
not being spent on education or job

00:56:16.169 --> 00:56:16.179
not being spent on education or job
 

00:56:16.179 --> 00:56:18.719
not being spent on education or job
training programs or housing or health

00:56:18.719 --> 00:56:18.729
training programs or housing or health
 

00:56:18.729 --> 00:56:20.729
training programs or housing or health
care for their kids what if just one

00:56:20.729 --> 00:56:20.739
care for their kids what if just one
 

00:56:20.739 --> 00:56:22.499
care for their kids what if just one
million dollars from those blocks was

00:56:22.499 --> 00:56:22.509
million dollars from those blocks was
 

00:56:22.509 --> 00:56:25.739
million dollars from those blocks was
spent to think about those city services

00:56:25.739 --> 00:56:25.749
spent to think about those city services
 

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:31.229
spent to think about those city services
and to kind of look at that and so

00:56:31.229 --> 00:56:31.239
and to kind of look at that and so
 

00:56:31.239 --> 00:56:33.150
and to kind of look at that and so
instead of migrating people to these

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160
instead of migrating people to these
 

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.529
instead of migrating people to these
prisons what about thinking about

00:56:34.529 --> 00:56:34.539
prisons what about thinking about
 

00:56:34.539 --> 00:56:38.940
prisons what about thinking about
resettlement patterns within the city

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:38.950
resettlement patterns within the city
 

00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:41.970
resettlement patterns within the city
so I'm going to move to what I call

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:41.980
so I'm going to move to what I call
 

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:45.990
so I'm going to move to what I call
curated data and in curated data we

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000
curated data and in curated data we
 

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.030
curated data and in curated data we
think about the tenth of the part of the

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:48.040
think about the tenth of the part of the
 

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.190
think about the tenth of the part of the

individual is guided by that of an
 

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:53.640
individual is guided by that of an
institution the organization and

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:53.650
institution the organization and
 

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.460
institution the organization and
collection is systematic and manual and

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:56.470
collection is systematic and manual and

collection is systematic and manual and
the trace is hidden or visible and the

the trace is hidden or visible and the
 

00:56:58.869 --> 00:57:02.190
the trace is hidden or visible and the
barrier to access is low to medium so

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200
barrier to access is low to medium so
 

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.760
barrier to access is low to medium so
what do I mean by that well a good

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:05.770
what do I mean by that well a good
 

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:10.410
what do I mean by that well a good
example is a curator is photographer who

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:10.420
example is a curator is photographer who
 

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.140
example is a curator is photographer who
collects images and what is the biggest

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:13.150
collects images and what is the biggest
 

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:16.200

are done redistributed to media outlets

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:23.650
are done redistributed to media outlets
 

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:27.300
are done redistributed to media outlets
and their main reason for curating data

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:27.310
and their main reason for curating data
 

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:29.819
and their main reason for curating data
is really to sell to the median so I

00:57:29.819 --> 00:57:29.829
is really to sell to the median so I
 

00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:31.680
is really to sell to the median so I
think it's an important point with when

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:31.690
think it's an important point with when
 

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:33.900
think it's an important point with when
you think about curated data is what is

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:33.910
you think about curated data is what is
 

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:36.660
you think about curated data is what is
the intent of the curation why are they

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:36.670
the intent of the curation why are they
 

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:38.099
the intent of the curation why are they
curating because it can tell you a lot

00:57:38.099 --> 00:57:38.109
curating because it can tell you a lot
 

00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:41.280
curating because it can tell you a lot
about what the results are so what we

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:41.290
about what the results are so what we
 

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:46.710
about what the results are so what we
did is actually we mined the Getty image

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720
did is actually we mined the Getty image
 

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:51.270
did is actually we mined the Getty image

categorize it into some kind of format
 

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.980
categorize it into some kind of format
and we were able to map these images

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:07.990
and we were able to map these images
 

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:11.700
and we were able to map these images

socialize using kind of the getty images
 

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.210
socialize using kind of the getty images
as our proxy to do that but what we

01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:55.220
as our proxy to do that but what we
 

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:58.570
as our proxy to do that but what we
actually realize is that we came up with

01:02:58.570 --> 01:02:58.580
actually realize is that we came up with
 

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.380
actually realize is that we came up with
the places that mass media markets as

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:01.390
the places that mass media markets as
 

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:04.150
the places that mass media markets as
for these places so if you look at

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160
for these places so if you look at
 

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.150
for these places so if you look at
Sunset Boulevard Hollywood beverly hills

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160
Sunset Boulevard Hollywood beverly hills
 

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.150
Sunset Boulevard Hollywood beverly hills
were kind of hotspots in LA Fifth Avenue

01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160
were kind of hotspots in LA Fifth Avenue
 

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.190
were kind of hotspots in LA Fifth Avenue
Midtown and the Meatpacking or hotspots

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:12.200
Midtown and the Meatpacking or hotspots
 

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:17.230
Midtown and the Meatpacking or hotspots
in New York City and what this is really

01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240
in New York City and what this is really
 

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.840
in New York City and what this is really
telling us is that the Getty image

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:19.850
telling us is that the Getty image
 

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:24.610
telling us is that the Getty image
database is really it highlights how

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:24.620
database is really it highlights how
 

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:28.750
database is really it highlights how
media uses space to sell products so

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760
media uses space to sell products so
 

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.370
media uses space to sell products so
most of these events are really about

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:30.380
most of these events are really about
 

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.670
most of these events are really about
selling a different kind of product and

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680
selling a different kind of product and
 

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.400
selling a different kind of product and
they use kind of the iconic nature of

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:36.410
they use kind of the iconic nature of
 

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:38.950
they use kind of the iconic nature of
the city to sell those products so why

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960
the city to sell those products so why
 

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.020
the city to sell those products so why
is time square so highlighted in these

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:41.030
is time square so highlighted in these
 

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:43.900
is time square so highlighted in these
maps because Times Square was what

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:43.910
maps because Times Square was what
 

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:46.240
maps because Times Square was what
represents New York to a global

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:46.250
represents New York to a global
 

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:50.710
represents New York to a global
marketplace and different products want

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720
marketplace and different products want
 

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.630
marketplace and different products want
to be associated with that global

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640
to be associated with that global
 

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.180
to be associated with that global
marketplace and so what I think was

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:55.190
marketplace and so what I think was
 

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:57.220
marketplace and so what I think was
really interesting about the Getty image

01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:57.230
really interesting about the Getty image
 

01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:59.650
really interesting about the Getty image
study is that it highlighted how media

01:03:59.650 --> 01:03:59.660
study is that it highlighted how media
 

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.289
study is that it highlighted how media
use spaces or how media uses

01:04:02.289 --> 01:04:02.299
use spaces or how media uses
 

01:04:02.299 --> 01:04:06.400
use spaces or how media uses
in the city um so curated data

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:06.410
in the city um so curated data
 

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.529
in the city um so curated data
highlights the interests of the data

01:04:08.529 --> 01:04:08.539
highlights the interests of the data
 

01:04:08.539 --> 01:04:12.699
highlights the interests of the data
collectors so in this case Getty and so

01:04:12.699 --> 01:04:12.709
collectors so in this case Getty and so
 

01:04:12.709 --> 01:04:14.650
collectors so in this case Getty and so
it really says how medium promoters have

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:14.660
it really says how medium promoters have
 

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:18.400
it really says how medium promoters have
an effect on space so event enclaves are

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:18.410
an effect on space so event enclaves are
 

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:20.620
an effect on space so event enclaves are
times square and the kodak theatre

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:20.630
times square and the kodak theatre
 

01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:23.019
times square and the kodak theatre
they're not maybe the places that New

01:04:23.019 --> 01:04:23.029
they're not maybe the places that New
 

01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:25.709
they're not maybe the places that New
Yorkers are from Los Angeles hang out in

01:04:25.709 --> 01:04:25.719
Yorkers are from Los Angeles hang out in
 

01:04:25.719 --> 01:04:29.259
Yorkers are from Los Angeles hang out in
but they do sell this city and they sell

01:04:29.259 --> 01:04:29.269
but they do sell this city and they sell
 

01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:31.509
but they do sell this city and they sell
the products that that want to be

01:04:31.509 --> 01:04:31.519
the products that that want to be
 

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:35.949
the products that that want to be
associated with that city in the terms

01:04:35.949 --> 01:04:35.959
associated with that city in the terms
 

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:39.880
associated with that city in the terms
of curated data curation can happen to

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:39.890
of curated data curation can happen to
 

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:42.819
of curated data curation can happen to
make a statement as well and so in this

01:04:42.819 --> 01:04:42.829
make a statement as well and so in this
 

01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:45.370
make a statement as well and so in this
project we actually collected our own

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:45.380
project we actually collected our own
 

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.759
project we actually collected our own
data and we collected data about air

01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:48.769
data and we collected data about air
 

01:04:48.769 --> 01:04:51.459
data and we collected data about air
quality these are some of the initial

01:04:51.459 --> 01:04:51.469
quality these are some of the initial
 

01:04:51.469 --> 01:04:54.549
quality these are some of the initial
traces that we collected and this was a

01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:54.559
traces that we collected and this was a
 

01:04:54.559 --> 01:04:57.549
traces that we collected and this was a
project that started when I was in

01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559
project that started when I was in
 

01:04:57.559 --> 01:05:01.179
project that started when I was in
Beijing in 2004 and this is the image

01:05:01.179 --> 01:05:01.189
Beijing in 2004 and this is the image
 

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:02.829
Beijing in 2004 and this is the image
that i saw on tanaman square and i

01:05:02.829 --> 01:05:02.839
that i saw on tanaman square and i
 

01:05:02.839 --> 01:05:03.999
that i saw on tanaman square and i
thought how are they going to have

01:05:03.999 --> 01:05:04.009
thought how are they going to have
 

01:05:04.009 --> 01:05:07.739
thought how are they going to have
olympics here with this type of smog so

01:05:07.739 --> 01:05:07.749
olympics here with this type of smog so
 

01:05:07.749 --> 01:05:12.489
olympics here with this type of smog so
this is actually beijing in 2008 very

01:05:12.489 --> 01:05:12.499
this is actually beijing in 2008 very
 

01:05:12.499 --> 01:05:16.089
this is actually beijing in 2008 very
similar slog conditions and so we wanted

01:05:16.089 --> 01:05:16.099
similar slog conditions and so we wanted
 

01:05:16.099 --> 01:05:19.569
similar slog conditions and so we wanted
to see how we could use data to expose

01:05:19.569 --> 01:05:19.579
to see how we could use data to expose
 

01:05:19.579 --> 01:05:21.249
to see how we could use data to expose
air quality issues or use kind of

01:05:21.249 --> 01:05:21.259
air quality issues or use kind of
 

01:05:21.259 --> 01:05:24.160
air quality issues or use kind of
mapping of data traces to expose the air

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:24.170
mapping of data traces to expose the air
 

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.979
mapping of data traces to expose the air
quality conditions in China so we teamed

01:05:26.979 --> 01:05:26.989
quality conditions in China so we teamed
 

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:30.910
quality conditions in China so we teamed
up with The Associated Press we created

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920
up with The Associated Press we created
 

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.759
up with The Associated Press we created
sensors that were attached to cell

01:05:33.759 --> 01:05:33.769
sensors that were attached to cell
 

01:05:33.769 --> 01:05:37.269
sensors that were attached to cell
phones and we measured air quality and

01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279
phones and we measured air quality and
 

01:05:37.279 --> 01:05:39.429
phones and we measured air quality and
we had the Associated Press reporters

01:05:39.429 --> 01:05:39.439
we had the Associated Press reporters
 

01:05:39.439 --> 01:05:42.429
we had the Associated Press reporters
actually measure the air quality for us

01:05:42.429 --> 01:05:42.439
actually measure the air quality for us
 

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:44.559
actually measure the air quality for us
because we weren't able to get into all

01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:44.569
because we weren't able to get into all
 

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:48.549
because we weren't able to get into all
the venues also The Associated Press had

01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559
the venues also The Associated Press had
 

01:05:48.559 --> 01:05:50.949
the venues also The Associated Press had
cell phones that they were given so we

01:05:50.949 --> 01:05:50.959
cell phones that they were given so we
 

01:05:50.959 --> 01:05:53.559
cell phones that they were given so we
were able to make a program that would

01:05:53.559 --> 01:05:53.569
were able to make a program that would
 

01:05:53.569 --> 01:05:56.289
were able to make a program that would
operate on all the presses cell phone so

01:05:56.289 --> 01:05:56.299
operate on all the presses cell phone so
 

01:05:56.299 --> 01:05:57.699
operate on all the presses cell phone so
that they could attach this answer to

01:05:57.699 --> 01:05:57.709
that they could attach this answer to
 

01:05:57.709 --> 01:06:00.279
that they could attach this answer to
any cell phones and then distribute the

01:06:00.279 --> 01:06:00.289
any cell phones and then distribute the
 

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:04.329
any cell phones and then distribute the
information this is actually another

01:06:04.329 --> 01:06:04.339
information this is actually another
 

01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:06.310
information this is actually another
reporter measuring

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:06.320
reporter measuring
 

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.270
reporter measuring
that green um so these mobile sensors

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:10.280
that green um so these mobile sensors
 

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.990
that green um so these mobile sensors
have a GPS component and a sensor

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000
have a GPS component and a sensor
 

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.050
have a GPS component and a sensor
component we measured particular matter

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:17.060
component we measured particular matter
 

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.830
component we measured particular matter
and carbon monoxide and we've measured

01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:20.840
and carbon monoxide and we've measured
 

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.900
and carbon monoxide and we've measured
the particular matter because of its

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:22.910
the particular matter because of its
 

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:26.560
the particular matter because of its
regional effects particular matter and

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:26.570
regional effects particular matter and
 

01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:28.750
regional effects particular matter and
also because it was of the highest

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760
also because it was of the highest
 

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.100
also because it was of the highest
concern for how for health issues with

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:33.110
concern for how for health issues with
 

01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:34.930
concern for how for health issues with
athletes particular that matter is the

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:34.940
athletes particular that matter is the
 

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:39.220
athletes particular that matter is the
fine dust that gets into athletes lungs

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:39.230
fine dust that gets into athletes lungs
 

01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:41.860
fine dust that gets into athletes lungs
and and is one of the biggest concerns

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:41.870
and and is one of the biggest concerns
 

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:45.490
and and is one of the biggest concerns
but also a particular matter can travel

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:45.500
but also a particular matter can travel
 

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.240
but also a particular matter can travel
long distances and so one of the things

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:49.250
long distances and so one of the things
 

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.950
long distances and so one of the things
that the Chinese government did during

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960
that the Chinese government did during
 

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.250
that the Chinese government did during
the Olympics as they shut down factories

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:54.260
the Olympics as they shut down factories
 

01:06:54.260 --> 01:07:00.310
the Olympics as they shut down factories
90 miles from outside Beijing and they

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:00.320
90 miles from outside Beijing and they
 

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.400
90 miles from outside Beijing and they
did a factory closures within the city

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:02.410
did a factory closures within the city
 

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:05.950
did a factory closures within the city
the carbon monoxide we chose because it

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960
the carbon monoxide we chose because it
 

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.990
the carbon monoxide we chose because it
had a more has a much more localized

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000
had a more has a much more localized
 

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.830
had a more has a much more localized
effect / muxo doesn't travel very far

01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:10.840
effect / muxo doesn't travel very far
 

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.540
effect / muxo doesn't travel very far
but they are also were specific mandates

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:13.550
but they are also were specific mandates
 

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:15.460
but they are also were specific mandates
that the Chinese government put in place

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:15.470
that the Chinese government put in place
 

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:18.610
that the Chinese government put in place
at that time they wanted to remove about

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:18.620
at that time they wanted to remove about
 

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:24.010
at that time they wanted to remove about
3.3 million cars from the road so all

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:24.020
3.3 million cars from the road so all
 

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.230
3.3 million cars from the road so all
these are components of smog we couldn't

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240
these are components of smog we couldn't
 

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.900
these are components of smog we couldn't
measure all the components of smog but

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:28.910
measure all the components of smog but
 

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:30.940
measure all the components of smog but
we decided to pick these two because we

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:30.950
we decided to pick these two because we
 

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:32.890
we decided to pick these two because we
felt like they would be most

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:32.900
felt like they would be most
 

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.520
felt like they would be most
representative of the regional and

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:36.530
representative of the regional and
 

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:39.430
representative of the regional and
localized effect of air quality and how

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440
localized effect of air quality and how
 

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.320
localized effect of air quality and how
Beijing responded to air quality was

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:43.330
Beijing responded to air quality was
 

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:46.930
Beijing responded to air quality was
during the Olympics so we set out to

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:46.940
during the Olympics so we set out to
 

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.420
during the Olympics so we set out to
measure daily at the Olympic Park

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:49.430
measure daily at the Olympic Park
 

01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:52.630
measure daily at the Olympic Park
tenement square tempo of heaven we also

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640
tenement square tempo of heaven we also
 

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.780
tenement square tempo of heaven we also
had the idea that our reporters would be

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:55.790
had the idea that our reporters would be
 

01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:58.470
had the idea that our reporters would be
just kind of mobile with these devices

01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480
just kind of mobile with these devices
 

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.110
just kind of mobile with these devices
throughout the Olympics but we had a

01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:02.120
throughout the Olympics but we had a
 

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.920
throughout the Olympics but we had a
problem with security for the press

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:05.930
problem with security for the press
 

01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:09.430
problem with security for the press
people and that they were being

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440
people and that they were being
 

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.200
people and that they were being
questions about the devices and so forth

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:11.210
questions about the devices and so forth
 

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:13.480
questions about the devices and so forth
so we had to because they were actually

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:13.490
so we had to because they were actually
 

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:18.530
so we had to because they were actually
illegal

01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540
 
 

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:20.820
 
I guess you're not you're not allowed to

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:20.830
I guess you're not you're not allowed to
 

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:25.050
I guess you're not you're not allowed to
have GPS units in that anyways so we had

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:25.060
have GPS units in that anyways so we had
 

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.140
have GPS units in that anyways so we had
to modify that a little bit and the

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:28.150
to modify that a little bit and the
 

01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:31.290
to modify that a little bit and the
press did one thing where they did a

01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:31.300
press did one thing where they did a
 

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.160
press did one thing where they did a
daily tour of the Olympic green and they

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:35.170
daily tour of the Olympic green and they
 

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:39.090
daily tour of the Olympic green and they
also did a daily picture this is

01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:39.100
also did a daily picture this is
 

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:41.340
also did a daily picture this is
actually a graphic that the associated

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:41.350
actually a graphic that the associated
 

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:45.270
actually a graphic that the associated
press created from the data that was a

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:45.280
press created from the data that was a
 

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.010
press created from the data that was a
result of that so they took a picture in

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:47.020
result of that so they took a picture in
 

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.530
result of that so they took a picture in
front of the green every year and then

01:08:49.530 --> 01:08:49.540
front of the green every year and then
 

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:53.910
front of the green every year and then
this is the Olympic dreams in this case

01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920
this is the Olympic dreams in this case
 

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.610
this is the Olympic dreams in this case
there was 600 micrograms per cubic meter

01:08:56.610 --> 01:08:56.620
there was 600 micrograms per cubic meter
 

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.280
there was 600 micrograms per cubic meter
the World Health standard is 50

01:08:59.280 --> 01:08:59.290
the World Health standard is 50
 

01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:03.000
the World Health standard is 50
micrograms and if you compare it to New

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:03.010
micrograms and if you compare it to New
 

01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:05.310
micrograms and if you compare it to New
York which is this yellow one in Los

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:05.320
York which is this yellow one in Los
 

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.450
York which is this yellow one in Los
Angeles you can see that the air quality

01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:09.460
Angeles you can see that the air quality
 

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.230
Angeles you can see that the air quality
is much higher this is another graphic

01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:13.240
is much higher this is another graphic
 

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.930
is much higher this is another graphic
we produce to try to kind of get at the

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:15.940
we produce to try to kind of get at the
 

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:19.140
we produce to try to kind of get at the
air quality just a few weeks before

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:19.150
air quality just a few weeks before
 

01:09:19.150 --> 01:09:21.480
air quality just a few weeks before
opening day there was five hundred and

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:21.490
opening day there was five hundred and
 

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.820
opening day there was five hundred and
eighty four micrograms sort of 18 high

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:23.830
eighty four micrograms sort of 18 high
 

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:26.820
eighty four micrograms sort of 18 high
times higher than New York City opening

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:26.830
times higher than New York City opening
 

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:30.020
times higher than New York City opening
day of the Olympics was 13 times higher

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:30.030
day of the Olympics was 13 times higher
 

01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:33.030
day of the Olympics was 13 times higher
just two days after opening days it was

01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040
just two days after opening days it was
 

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.430
just two days after opening days it was
25 times higher but then there was

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440
25 times higher but then there was
 

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.020
25 times higher but then there was
actually a day where it was lower than

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:37.030
actually a day where it was lower than
 

01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:39.090
actually a day where it was lower than
New York City and I don't know if you

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:39.100
New York City and I don't know if you
 

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.860
New York City and I don't know if you
guys remember the Olympics but it

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:40.870
guys remember the Olympics but it
 

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:43.470
guys remember the Olympics but it
started to rain towards the end and rain

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480
started to rain towards the end and rain
 

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.650
started to rain towards the end and rain
dissipates the particulate matter this

01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:46.660
dissipates the particulate matter this
 

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:50.490
dissipates the particulate matter this
is another chart of that same data and

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:50.500
is another chart of that same data and
 

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.420
is another chart of that same data and
you can see the low levels at the

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:54.430
you can see the low levels at the
 

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:57.360
you can see the low levels at the
Olympic start vs. towards the end where

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:57.370
Olympic start vs. towards the end where
 

01:09:57.370 --> 01:09:59.250
Olympic start vs. towards the end where
they were much lower but you can see

01:09:59.250 --> 01:09:59.260
they were much lower but you can see
 

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.850
they were much lower but you can see
that they're pretty consistently higher

01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860
that they're pretty consistently higher
 

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.890
that they're pretty consistently higher
than what you would see here in New York

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:04.900
than what you would see here in New York
 

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:09.420
than what you would see here in New York
City but we really wanted these devices

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:09.430
City but we really wanted these devices
 

01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:11.760
City but we really wanted these devices
to be mobile and although we had a lot

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:11.770
to be mobile and although we had a lot
 

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:13.560
to be mobile and although we had a lot
of security problems basically a lot of

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:13.570
of security problems basically a lot of
 

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:16.370
of security problems basically a lot of
the reporters that we gave these two

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380
the reporters that we gave these two
 

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.920
the reporters that we gave these two
were photographers and some of the

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:19.930
were photographers and some of the
 

01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:22.740
were photographers and some of the
photographers were known to take

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:22.750
photographers were known to take
 

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:23.840
photographers were known to take
pictures where they didn't

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:23.850
pictures where they didn't
 

01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:26.360
pictures where they didn't
too so they kept being taken in by some

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:26.370
too so they kept being taken in by some
 

01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:28.430
too so they kept being taken in by some
of the police and they were worried if

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440
of the police and they were worried if
 

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.490
of the police and they were worried if
they had these devices that they might

01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500
they had these devices that they might
 

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:36.080
they had these devices that they might
be arrested so we kind of limited some

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:36.090
be arrested so we kind of limited some
 

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:38.180
be arrested so we kind of limited some
of the things but we did we were able to

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:38.190
of the things but we did we were able to
 

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:41.510
of the things but we did we were able to
do one of our mobile things that we

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520
do one of our mobile things that we
 

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.580
do one of our mobile things that we
really wanted to see how the air quality

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:43.590
really wanted to see how the air quality
 

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:46.490
really wanted to see how the air quality
was along the marathon route so we set

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:46.500
was along the marathon route so we set
 

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.820
was along the marathon route so we set
out our reporter who this poor reporter

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:49.830
out our reporter who this poor reporter
 

01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:53.000
out our reporter who this poor reporter
became the last person who was really on

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:53.010
became the last person who was really on
 

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:55.370
became the last person who was really on
the prospect to make it did a lot of the

01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:55.380
the prospect to make it did a lot of the
 

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.980
the prospect to make it did a lot of the
mobile sensing his face does not look

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:57.990
mobile sensing his face does not look
 

01:10:57.990 --> 01:11:00.470
mobile sensing his face does not look
happy about leaving for another trip

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480
happy about leaving for another trip
 

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.930
happy about leaving for another trip
through Beijing in the muggy weather and

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:04.940
through Beijing in the muggy weather and
 

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:08.410
through Beijing in the muggy weather and
we did the same thing in New York City

01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:08.420
we did the same thing in New York City
 

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:11.000
we did the same thing in New York City
and we did the marathon route and this

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:11.010
and we did the marathon route and this
 

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:13.970
and we did the marathon route and this
is actually the result of that we did

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980
is actually the result of that we did
 

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.390
is actually the result of that we did
actually two in Beijing one before the

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400
actually two in Beijing one before the
 

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.580
actually two in Beijing one before the
car mandate was put in place and one

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:19.590
car mandate was put in place and one
 

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.040
car mandate was put in place and one
after and what we found was that there

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:22.050
after and what we found was that there
 

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.740
after and what we found was that there
was in some cases it decreased by half

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:24.750
was in some cases it decreased by half
 

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:29.030
was in some cases it decreased by half
of the carbon monoxide and we found that

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040
of the carbon monoxide and we found that
 

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.040
of the carbon monoxide and we found that
carbon monoxides were very similar to

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:31.050
carbon monoxides were very similar to
 

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:35.060
carbon monoxides were very similar to
those found in New York City and so some

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:35.070
those found in New York City and so some
 

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:39.500
those found in New York City and so some
ways we think that perhaps the local men

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:39.510
ways we think that perhaps the local men
 

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:42.890
ways we think that perhaps the local men
the removing cars from the road help to

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900
the removing cars from the road help to
 

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.400
the removing cars from the road help to
decrease carbon monoxide on the roads in

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:46.410
decrease carbon monoxide on the roads in
 

01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:48.650
decrease carbon monoxide on the roads in
Beijing and actually that mandate is

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:48.660
Beijing and actually that mandate is
 

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.860
Beijing and actually that mandate is
still in place today the Beijing

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:51.870
still in place today the Beijing
 

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:53.630
still in place today the Beijing
government was happy with it and

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640
government was happy with it and
 

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.050
government was happy with it and
actually citizens or disturbed by the

01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:57.060
actually citizens or disturbed by the
 

01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.490
actually citizens or disturbed by the
decrease in so they've actually kept

01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500
decrease in so they've actually kept
 

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.220
decrease in so they've actually kept
that mandate in place so it's hard to

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:01.230

weekend and this is last weekend so you

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140
weekend and this is last weekend so you
 

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.570
weekend and this is last weekend so you
can't see the air quality over the

01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580
can't see the air quality over the

this case we expose air quality by

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:26.270
this case we expose air quality by
 

01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:28.050
this case we expose air quality by
curating

emotion and I think what's interesting
 

01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:40.459
emotion and I think what's interesting
about self registered data is that the

01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:40.469
about self registered data is that the
 

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:43.490
about self registered data is that the
fact that it's a less tangible in terms

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:43.500
fact that it's a less tangible in terms
 

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.689
fact that it's a less tangible in terms
of accuracy allows it to it provides a

01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699
of accuracy allows it to it provides a
 

01:15:47.699 --> 01:15:49.640
of accuracy allows it to it provides a
more kind of emotional setting for the

of how these different data sets can
 

01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:07.490
of how these different data sets can
tell us about the emotional or social

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500

with all these other medium and I think

02:25:10.319 --> 02:25:10.329
with all these other medium and I think
 

02:25:10.329 --> 02:25:11.999
with all these other medium and I think
it means that your job is architects is

02:25:11.999 --> 02:25:12.009
it means that your job is architects is
 

02:25:12.009 --> 02:25:16.049
it means that your job is architects is
more important how you design forum
