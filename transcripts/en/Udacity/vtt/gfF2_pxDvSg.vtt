The F Table's pretty self-explanatory. Here we have numerator degrees of

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:13.017
freedom, which was 2. And here, denominator degrees of freedom, which was 9.

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:18.101
And we see that the f-critical value, cutting off 0.05 in the right tail, is

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.965
4.2565.
