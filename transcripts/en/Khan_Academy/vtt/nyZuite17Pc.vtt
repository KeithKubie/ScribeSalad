00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.890
In this video, we're going to
learn how to take the distance

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.640
between any two points in our
x, y coordinate plane, and

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.060
we're going to see, it's really
just an application of

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.780
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.040
So let's start with
an example.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.070
Let's say I have the point, I'll
do it in a darker color

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.950
so we can see it on
the graph paper.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.070
Let's say I have the point
3 comma negative 4.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.180
So if I were to graph it,
I'd go 1, 2, 3, and

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.480
then I'd go down 4.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.440
1, 2, 3, 4, right there,
is 3 comma negative 4.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.110
And let's say I also have
the point 6 comma 0.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.660
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then
there's no movement in the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.310
y-direction.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.610
We're just sitting
on the x-axis.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.086
The y-coordinate is 0,
so that's 6 comma 0.

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:55.810
And what I want to figure out is
the distance between these

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.410
two points.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.350
How far is this blue point away
from this orange point?

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.910
And at first, you're like, gee,
Sal, I don't think I've

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.570
ever seen anything about
how to solve for a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.440
distance like this.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.290
And what are you even talking
about the Pythagorean theorem?

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.180
I don't see a triangle there!

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.690
And if you don't see
a triangle, let

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.940
me draw it for you.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
Let me draw this triangle right
there, just like that.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.690
Let me actually do several
colors here, just to really

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.090
hit the point home.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.650
So there is our triangle.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.990
And you might immediately
recognize

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.950
this is a right triangle.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.810
This is a right angle
right there.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.520
The base goes straight left to
right, the right side goes

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.710
straight up and down, so we're
dealing with a right triangle.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.210
So if we could just figure out
what the base length is and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.350
what this height is, we could
use the Pythagorean theorem to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.690
figure out this long side, the
side that is opposite the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.700
right angle, the hypotenuse.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.890
This right here, the distance
is the hypotenuse of this

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.180
right triangle.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.180
Let me write that down.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.050
The distance is equal
to the hypotenuse

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.660
of this right triangle.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.480
So let me draw it a
little bit bigger.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.710
So this is the hypotenuse
right there.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.880
And then we have the side on the
right, the side that goes

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.070
straight up and down.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.500
And then we have our base.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.860
Now, how do we figure
out-- let's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.550
call this d for distance.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.540
That's the length of
our hypotenuse.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.640
How do we figure out the lengths
of this up and down

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.270
side and the base
side right here?

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.940
So let's look at the base first.
What is this distance?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.010
You could even count it on this
graph paper, but here,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.150
where x is equal to-- let
me do it in the green.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.530
Here, we're at x is equal to 3
and here we're at x is equal

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.800
to 6, right?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.550
We're just moving
straight right.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.570
This is the same distance as
that distance right there.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.910
So to figure out that distance,
it's literally the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.710
end x point.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.240
And you could actually go either
way, because you're

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.770
going to square everything, so
it doesn't matter if you get

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.230
negative numbers, so the
distance here is going to be 6

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.360
minus 3, right?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.680
6 minus 3.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.520
That's this distance right here,
which is equal to 3.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.140
So we figured out the base.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.610
And to just remind ourselves,
that is equal to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.200
the change in x.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.100
That was equal to your finishing
x minus your

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.890
starting x.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.020
6 minus 3.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.860
This is our delta x.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.990
Now, by the same exact line of
reasoning, this height right

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.640
here is going to be
your change in y.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.290
Up here, you're at
y is equal to 0.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.670
That's kind of where
you finish.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.360
That's your higher y point.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.900
And over here, you're at y
is equal to negative 4.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.460
So change in y is equal
to 0 minus negative 4.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.930
I'm just taking the larger
y-value minus the smaller

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.810
y-value, the larger x-value
minus the smaller x-value.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.870
But you're going to see we're
going to square it in a

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.830
second, so even if you did it
the other way around, you'd

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.410
get a negative number, but
you'd still get the same

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.030
answer, so this is equal to 4.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.890
So this side is equal to 4.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.370
You can even count it on the
graph paper if you like.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.310
And this side is equal to 3.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.040
And now we can do the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.730
This distance is the
distance squared.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.400
Be careful.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.270
The distance squared is going
to be equal to this delta x

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.649
squared, the change
in x squared plus

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.440
the change in y squared.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.620
This is nothing fancy.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.770
Sometimes people will call this
the distance formula.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.380
It's just the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.660
This side squared plus that
side squared is equal to

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.940
hypotenuse squared, because
this is a right triangle.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.260
So let's apply it with these
numbers, the numbers that we

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.410
have at hand.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.020
So the distance squared is going
to be equal to delta x

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.580
squared is 3 squared plus
delta y squared plus 4

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.080
squared, which is equal to 9
plus 16, which is equal to 25.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.050
So the distance is equal to--
let me write that-- d squared

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.550
is equal to 25.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.600
d, our distance, is equal to--
you don't want to take the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.160
negative square root, because
you can't have a negative

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.370
distance, So it's only the
principal root, the positive

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.020
square root of 25, which
is equal to 5.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.780
So this distance right
here is 5.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.130
Or if we look at this distance
right here, that was the

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.920
original problem.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.170
How far is this point
from that point?

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.180
It is 5 units away.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.930
So what you'll see here, they
call it the distance formula,

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.730
but it's just the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.000
And just so you're exposed to
all of the ways that you'll

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.770
see the distance formula,
sometimes people will say, oh,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.340
if I have two points, if I have
one point, let's call it

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.580
x1 and y1, so that's just
a particular point.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.880
And let's say I have another
point that is x2 comma y2.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.760
Sometimes, you'll see this
formula, that the distance--

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.940
you'll see it in
different ways.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.850
But you'll see that the distance
is equal to-- and it

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.170
looks as though there's this
really complicated formula,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.930
but I want you to see that
this is really just the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.370
Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:05.340
You see that the distance is
equal to x2 minus x1 minus x1

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:18.650
squared plus y2 minus
y1 squared.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.950
You'll see this written in
a lot of textbooks as the

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.200
distance formula.

00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:27.250
And it's a complete waste of
your time to memorize it

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.060
because it's really just the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.370
This is your change in x.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.710
And it really doesn't matter
which x you pick to be first

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.730
or second, because even if you
get the negative of this

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.470
value, when you square it,
the negative disappears.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.900
This right here is
your change in y.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.693
So it's just saying that the
distance squared-- remember,

00:06:44.693 --> 00:06:48.710
if you square both sides of
this equation, the radical

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.010
will disappear and this will
be the distance squared is

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.900
equal to this expression
squared, delta x squared,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.090
change in x-- delta means change
in-- delta x squared

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.540
plus delta y squared.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.190
I don't want to confuse you.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.170
Delta y just means
change in y.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.380
I should have probably said
that earlier in the video.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.290
But let's apply it to a couple
more, and I'll just pick some

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.030
points at random.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.850
Let's say I have the point,
let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.660
Negative 6 comma negative 4.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.430
And let's say I want to find the
distance between that and

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:32.290
1 comma 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and
the point 1 comma 7, so I

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.370
want to find this distance
right here.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.420
So it's the exact same idea.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.610
We just use the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.830
You figure out this distance,
which is our change in x, this

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.790
distance, which is
our change in y.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.955
This distance squared plus this
distance squared is going

00:07:45.955 --> 00:07:48.750
to equal that distance
squared.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.600
So let's do it.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.160
So our change in x, you
just take-- you

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.130
know, it doesn't matter.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.170
In general, you want to take the
larger x-value minus the

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.400
smaller x-value, but you
could do it either way.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.180
So we could write the distance
squared is equal to-- what's

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.430
our change in x?

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.650
So let's take the larger x minus
the smaller x, 1 minus

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.430
negative 6.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.960
1 minus negative 6 squared
plus the change in y.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.120
The larger y is here.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.530
It's 7.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.210
7 minus negative 4.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.550
7 minus negative 4 squared.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.430
And I just picked these numbers
at random, so they're

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.260
probably not going to come
out too cleanly.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.490
So we get that the distance
squared is equal to 1 minus

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.280
negative 6.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.000
That is 7, 7 squared, and you'll
even see it over here,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.169
if you count it.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.690
You go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.470
That's that number right here.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.400
That's what your
change in x is.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.530
Plus 7 minus negative 4.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.720
That's 11.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.010
That's this distance right here,
and you can count it on

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.490
the blocks.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.650
We're going up 11.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.860
We're just taking 7 minus
negative 4 to get

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.740
a distance of 11.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.750
So plus 11 squared is
equal to d squared.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.000
So let me just take the
calculator out.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.266
So the distance if we take 7
squared plus 11 squared is

00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:16.170
equal to 170, that distance is
going to be the square root of

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.920
that, right? d squared
is equal to 170.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:25.250
So let's take the square root
of 170 and we get 13.0,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.250
roughly 13.04.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.550
So this distance right
here that we tried to

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.920
figure out is 13.04.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.540
Hopefully, you found
that helpful.
