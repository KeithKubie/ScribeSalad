00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:13.961
I'm McKenna Pope.

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.362
I'm 14 years old.

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.612
And when I was 13,

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:19.162
I convinced one of the largest toy companies,

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:20.989
toy makers in the world, Hasbro,

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.362
to change the way that they marketed

00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:25.413
one of their best-selling products.

00:00:25.413 --> 00:00:27.030
So, allow me to tell you about it.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.704
So, I have a brother, Gavin.

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:30.957
When this whole shebang happened, he was four.

00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:32.571
He loved to cook.

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:34.822
He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:37.134
and mixing them into these, needless to say,

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:38.862
uneatable concoctions

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:41.403
or making invisible macaroni and cheese.

00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:45.036
He wanted to be a chef really badly.

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:47.035
And, so what better gift for someone,

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:48.446
for a kid who wanted to be a chef,

00:00:48.446 --> 00:00:50.037
than an Easy Bake Oven, right?

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:51.991
I mean, we all had those when we were little.

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:54.203
And he wanted one so badly.

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:56.527
But then, he started to realize something.

00:00:56.527 --> 00:00:59.037
In the commercials and on the boxes

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:00.820
for the Easy Bake Oven,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.487
Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls.

00:01:03.487 --> 00:01:05.030
And the way that they did this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.824
was they would only feature girls on the boxes

00:01:06.824 --> 00:01:08.277
or in the commercials,

00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:10.786
and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens,

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:13.487
and it would be in bright pink and purple.

00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:16.613
Very gender-specific colors to females, right?

00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:18.701
So, it kind of was sending a message

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:20.737
that only girls are supposed to cook.

00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:22.321
Boys aren't.

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:24.204
And this discouraged my brother a lot.

00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:26.553
He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:29.280
because that was something girls did.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.370
Girls cooked, boys didn't.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.446
Or so, the message that Hasbro was sending.

00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:35.195
And this got me thinking,

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.252
"God, I wish there was a way I could change this,

00:01:37.252 --> 00:01:40.695
that I could have my voice heard by Hasbro,

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:42.501
so I could ask them and tell them

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.861
what they were doing wrong

00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:45.320
and ask them to change it."

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.806
And that got me thinking about a website

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.377
that I had learned about a few months prior

00:01:48.377 --> 00:01:50.091
called Change.org.

00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:53.360
Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.111
where you can create a petition

00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:58.115
and share it across all these social media networks,

00:01:58.115 --> 00:01:59.492
through Facebook, through Twitter,

00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:01.029
through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:03.444
through whatever you can think of.

00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:04.785
And so, I created a petition,

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:07.833
along with a YouTube video that I added to the petition,

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.689
basically asking Hasbro to change

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.194
the way that they marketed it,

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.250
in featuring boys in the commercials and on the boxes,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.833
and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:23.366
So, this petititon started to take off,

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:26.487
like humongously fast, you have no idea.

00:02:26.487 --> 00:02:28.201
I was getting interviewed by all these

00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:31.801
national news outlets and press outlets,

00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.451
and it was amazing.

00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.202
In three weeks, maybe three and a half,

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:40.820
I had 46,000 signatures on this petition.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.820
(Applause)

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.784
Thank you.

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:47.367
So, needless to say, it was crazy.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:50.738
Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:52.200
to their headquarters

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.968
so they could go and unveil

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:55.904
their new Easy Bake Oven product to me,

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:57.951
in black, silver and blue.

00:02:57.951 --> 00:02:59.821
It was literally one of the best moments

00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:00.831
of my life.

00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:02.869
It was like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:04.819
That thing was amazing.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.369
What I didn't realize at the time, however,

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.321
was that I had become an activist.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:11.302
I could change something that, even as a kid,

00:03:11.302 --> 00:03:12.863
or maybe even especially as a kid,

00:03:12.863 --> 00:03:14.579
my voice mattered.

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:15.808
And your voice matters, too!

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:17.612
I want to let you know that it's not going to be easy,

00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:19.780
and it wasn't easy for me

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.448
because I faced a lot of obstacles.

00:03:21.448 --> 00:03:24.827
People online, and sometimes even in real life,

00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:28.826
were disrespectful to me and my family

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:30.069
and talked about how the whole thing

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.241
was a waste of time,

00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:32.406
and it really discouraged me.

00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:34.288
And actually, I have some examples

00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:35.371
because what's better revenge

00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:37.905
than displaying their idiocy?

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:39.903
So, let's see.

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:42.547
From username Liquidsword29,

00:03:42.547 --> 00:03:44.070
interesting usernames we have here,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.656
"Disgusting liberal moms making their son's gay."

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:52.489
Liquidsword29, really? Really?

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.737
Okay, how about from Whiteboy77AGS,

00:03:56.737 --> 00:04:00.405
"People always need something to 'female dog' about."

00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:02.987
From Jeffrey Gutierrez,

00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:04.988
"OMG shut up! You just want money and attention."

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:07.990
So, it was comments like these

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.863
that really discouraged me

00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:11.757
from wanting to make change in the future

00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:12.886
because I thought,

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:14.321
"People don't care.

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.192
People think it's a waste of time.

00:04:16.192 --> 00:04:18.320
And people are going to be disrespectful

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.024
to me and my family."

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:21.570
It hurt me.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.738
And it made me think,

00:04:22.738 --> 00:04:24.856
"What's the point in making change in the future?"

00:04:24.856 --> 00:04:27.488
But then I started to realize something.

00:04:27.488 --> 00:04:29.935
Haters gonna hate.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:31.255
Come on, say it with me!

00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:32.319
One, two, three,

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.653
Haters gonna hate!

00:04:34.653 --> 00:04:36.356
So let your haters hate, you know what!

00:04:36.356 --> 00:04:38.106
And make your change

00:04:38.106 --> 00:04:39.656
because I know you can.

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:41.085
I look out into this crowd,

00:04:41.085 --> 00:04:43.858
and I see 400 people who came out

00:04:43.858 --> 00:04:45.240
because they wanted to know

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.607
how they could make a change.

00:04:46.607 --> 00:04:47.855
And I know that you can,

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.106
and all of you watching at home can, too,

00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:51.774
because you have so much that you can do

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:52.821
and that you believe in.

00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:55.274
And you can trade it across all the social media,

00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:56.404
through Facebook, through Twitter,

00:04:56.404 --> 00:04:58.589
through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:00.421
through whatever else you can think of.

00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:01.945
And you can make that change.

00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:03.486
You can take what you believe in

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:05.488
and turn it into a cause and change it.

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:08.671
And that spark that you've been hearing about all day today

00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:11.070
you can use that spark that you have within you

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.780
and turn it into a fire.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.098
Thank you.

00:05:14.098 --> 00:05:16.410
(Applause)
