00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.010
Things that can make you sick:

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.620
allergens, contaminated food and water, and
racism!

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.450
Hey folks, welcome to Dnews.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.450
Laci Green here.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.220
My favorite commercials are those ones that
are like, "Did you know that stress is terrible

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.400
for your health?"

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400
Yea!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.880
Stress can lead to high blood pressure, and
supressed immune system, and diabetes.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.819
And then you're like, "Oh great!

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.239
Now I get to be stressed out about being stressed
out."

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.239
Man!

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.279
Stress is like a bad cycle.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.630
And it's a cycle that affects some folks more
than others.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.489
A new study published in the Journal of Sociological
Inquiry found that after analyzing data from

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.090
30,000 people, racial minorites had significatly
higher rates of stress.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.570
And it's symbolic of a great divide between
the health of the dominant race versus the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.949
minority race in countries around the world.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.609
It's well documented that minority groups
in the U.S. have way more stress, poor mental

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.600
health and poor physical health than white
Americans.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.210
Racial minorities get sick more, their illness
gets more severe, it happens at younger ages,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.830
and they die sooner than white people do.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.520
In the U.S., New Zealand, and Canada, the
average lifespan of male minorities is seven

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.550
years shorter than the white male average
in the country.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.810
In Australia, it's twenty one years shorter.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.510
So the big question here is, "Why?"

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.150
It's a tricky puzzle, peeps, with lotsa pieces,
more than a short YouTube video could ever

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.150
hope to place.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.720
But there are a few key factors here: racial
discrimination, class, and education level.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.750
A study at the University of Western Australia
found that aboriginal participants were five

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.340
times as likely to report negative treatment
based on their race and twice as likely to

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.500
have health problems.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.850
The American Journal of Public Health found
that even anticipating racism, which minorities

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.210
commonly experience with racial profiling
policies like "Stop and Frisk," is enough

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.680
to trigger a harmful stress response.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.290
The British Medical Journal published a study
finding that those who initially screened

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.560
a negative for all mental illnesses, were
twice as likely to have detereorating mental

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.180
health when they experience racial discrimination.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.660
So these are some of the reasons why scientists
are calling for racial prejudices, from interpersonal

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.260
type, like being suspicious of someone because
they're black, to systemic types, like providing

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.980
a little funding for schools in the "ghetto,"
can be addressed not only as a social justice

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.710
issue, but a public health issue.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.790
At a conference in Switzerland last week focused
on addressing racial health disparities, researchers

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.700
laid out what they think can be done about
this.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.310
The first, is to recognize that there's something
that's not quite right here.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.060
Second is to say, "Nu uh!

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.319
Inequality is not cool!"

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.500
And lastly, to make real changes that will
better the health of minority groups.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.850
So, next stop, end global poverty!

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.270
Thanks for joining me friends.
