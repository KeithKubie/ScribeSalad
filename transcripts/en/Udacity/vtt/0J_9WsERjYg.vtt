00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.260
We mentioned before that YouTube can be
a great platform to host videos as part

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.920
of your content marketing.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.090
Now YouTube could also be a great
place for paid marketing.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.990
It's still a young advertising place, so

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.760
you may find cheaper rates than
you would on, let's say, AdWords.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.430
Now there are a ton of different ad
formats on YouTube, and at least for

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.310
videos, you only have to pay for the ads
that people actually engage with.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.238
So if someone skips your ad,
you don't have to pay a cent.

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:28.218
Now, on the other hand, creating a high
quality video and hosting it for

00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:31.888
free on YouTube can generate buzz
around your product or service.

00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:35.780
And if you promote it on social media,
you can encourage virality.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.660
If you're considering advertising
on YouTube with videos,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.618
remember that the viewer's
attention span can be pretty short.

00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:44.440
So, you want to invest in
a high quality video that can

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.580
hook your users really quickly.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.290
So let's explore just a couple
of the different formats you

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.910
can use on YouTube because there
are ton of options available to you.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.930
Check out the link in the instructor
notes if you want to see all of them.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.150
One option is the desktop or
mobile video mastheads.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.970
These are video ads that
play on YouTube's homepage.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.515
On a desktop,
they play without any sound and

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:10.180
it'll end as a thumbnail of your video
or any other video from your channel.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.240
On mobile, the video thumbnails will be
available for your users to click on.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.450
You can even add a link
directly to your website.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.935
Let's look at what it does look like.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.515
So, here's the video masthead.

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:23.425
You can also have a rich media
masthead which would go here as well.

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:26.905
So the rich media mastheads
are seen in that same location.

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:30.775
You can do a ton with the custom
mastheads from carousels,

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:32.875
use cool videos or just images.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.590
There's a lot of options out there.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.200
That's surprising I know but
you can also have a video ad.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.870
I'm sure you've noticed these ads
playing before different videos that

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.680
you've seen on YouTube.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.982
Now there are different options for
the video ads.

00:01:43.982 --> 00:01:48.917
Nonskippable in-stream video ads
are videos that appear pre-mid or

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:53.120
post-roll when viewing
different content on YouTube.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.630
They could be around
15 to 30 seconds long.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.700
And the viewer must watch the entire
ad before they're able to watch their

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.900
selected video.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.451
Now, for the skippable ads,
you can go to the true view format.

00:02:04.451 --> 00:02:07.250
And there are a few different
types of true view ads.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.600
So you have the in-stream
that play before video,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.410
and you're allowed to
skip after five seconds.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.130
You could have display ads
that are suggested videos,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.080
in that suggested video list.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.460
Let's check that out.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.082
Here's an example of a display ad.

00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:23.360
And this is an example of
an in-stream overlay ad.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.030
There are a few more options for
true view ads.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.650
You can check the link in
the instructor notes for more.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.750
You can have your standard display ads,
which are similar to what you just saw.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.770
And you also saw
the in-video overlay ads.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.180
They pop up, then you can select them
while you're watching a video, or

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.770
you have the option of closing them.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.618
But as I said before, there
are a ton of ad options in YouTube.

00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:47.060
You can even do live streaming ads,
if you'd like, so

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.780
check out the documentation
to learn more.
