00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.220
Okay, it's time to do
a little bit of math.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.470
To start off with, we know we have
1920 hardware pixels across, and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.870
the device pixel ratio
of two tells us that for

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.880
every one CSS pixel,
there are two hardware pixels.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.880
Multiplying 1920 by one half
gives us 960 CSS pixels,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.319
so the correct answer here is 960.
