00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.260
We can create a new user by
using the adduser command.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.400
This is an administrator feature,
so we'll have to use sudo as well.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.280
Let's go ahead and
create a new user named student.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.140
We'll then be asked to enter
a password for the student.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.490
I just used the word student,
but as you can see,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.290
in these password fields,
you don't see what you're typing.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.580
We're then asked the number of
additional questions about the user.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.910
All of these are optional,
so you can ignore them.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.004
But I'm going to go ahead, and

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.656
add a bit more additional information
here in the Full Name section.

00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:37.430
And that's all there is to it.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.110
We can confirm this user was created
by using the finger command.
