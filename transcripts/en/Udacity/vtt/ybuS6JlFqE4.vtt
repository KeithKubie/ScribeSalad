00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.460
Now, one of the cool things is,
you can actually measure the center

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.580
surroundedness of a ganglion
cell while it's working, okay.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.080
I wouldn't recommend doing this to you
or to anybody else you have any care for

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.990
whatsoever, but basically,
the way you do recordings is here,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.630
here's a schematic of a neuron.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.540
So it has dendrites where they receive
inputs from the synapses, and when the,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.990
the inputs are correct, they will
generate a spike, a firing down here,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.140
and then these terminals impact the next
nerves that it's in contact with.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.320
And if you were to put
an electrode right over here,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.320
you would occasionally see these spikes.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.330
And neural coding, we tend to refer
to as the more spikes per second

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.350
is a higher level, so we've gone
essentially from analog to digital.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.530
Right?
In an analog system,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.870
the amount of the voltage tells you
how high it is or how low it is.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.680
In a digital system, there's something
discrete that tells us, okay, you know,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.800
there's 15 ones and two zeroes,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.670
that's a higher number than
all zeroes or, et cetera.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.950
Well in, in the neural system,
the way we do is,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.270
we look at how,
how often is the neuron firing.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.640
And you can actually go ahead and
do this.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.150
This is a picture of a a micropipette,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.670
an electrode getting ready
to record from a neuron.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.790
So you do these with neurons
that are still living, right?

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.282
This is why I said you wouldn't want to
do this to anybody you cared for,

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:27.220
all right?

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.780
And what you can do is,
you can then put different kinds of

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.870
stimuli at different locations in
the eye and see what happens, all right.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.010
And if you do that,
you can find areas, so here we have,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.700
when it's just black, this neuron
doesn't do things very much, okay?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.420
But when it's white in the middle,
okay, and black out here, all right.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.330
And, and what this is, oh, by the way,
this is time going this way.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.650
So this is when the,
the spot was turned on.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.400
You can see when it goes from the back,
this is called the background activity.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.060
When it goes from the background,
when it turns on,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.670
this thing starts firing crazy.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.220
And then you turn it off and
it stops again.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.330
Okay, fine.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.740
But what's then cool is,
if I then turn on a really bright spot.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.520
Okay?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.190
Nothing happens.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.640
It stays just like my background.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.820
And in fact, if I want to
turn the cell off even more,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.080
I turn on just the outside and
I make the middle black.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.090
And here what you can see is,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.580
it actually just shut down
the background altogether.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.290
And then when I turn the thing off,
it wakes back up again and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.210
then returns back to its normal.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.200
So this is an on cell.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.890
Okay.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.370
That is, its center is positive.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.650
Exact opposite cell here is negative.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.350
Okay.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.570
And both are found in the,
in the retina.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.510
The other thing that's found in
the retina are ganglion cells whose

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.940
size in terms of their
response Is different.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.376
So there are ones for very small,
for medium and larger.

00:03:01.376 --> 00:03:06.450
And your system is actually tuned to
have more of a particular size, and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.900
that tuning is what gives
you this phenomena.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.704
So, again,

00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:14.667
this is going to be a function of
how your monitor is calibrated.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:15.540
All right.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.850
But the, contrast sensitivity function,
so for me,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.505
so what this is is, this is
a sinusoid where the frequency gets,

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:29.958
goes up this way, and contrast goes up
as you get further down, all right?

00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.250
And the question is,
where can you see the bars?

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.500
And for me, I can see the bars
kind of like, oh, like that.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.940
Okay.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.150
So the question is,
why can't I see the stuff here, but

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.950
I can see the stuff there, for
the same level of contrast?

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.010
The answer is, my retina has more and

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.410
better tuned receptors at this size
frequency than at this size frequency.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.340
This phenomena that you're seeing
is a function of what goes on

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.600
inside your eyeball.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.660
And that can be graphed
out looking like this.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.083
Two things interesting about this graph.

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:10.380
First is,
this is a function of frequency.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.410
And, here they use
different luminance levels.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.550
So they make it brighter and,
or brighter and,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.779
it's sort of how sensitive you are.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:22.450
And then something, and for the PETA
folks amongst you, please ignore this.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.100
You'll notice that the human data and

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.950
the macaque, macaque is a type of
monkey, are very, very similar.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.200
Now, this is done, of course, without
doing anything to anybody, right?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.850
You just ask them what do you see,
et cetera.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.970
But what this data show is that the
vision system, the retinal vision system

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.920
of the macaque monkey is really
quite similar to the human.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.390
So if you were to do experiments on
primates measuring physiological things,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.400
remember those electrodes,
we have reason to believe that what

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.440
we learn there is the same,
would apply also to the human system.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.790
So, when you have psychophysical
experiments like this,

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.180
it shows you the similarity
between human and macaque.
