00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 align:start position:0%
wait and I like that I like that it's
 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.820 align:start position:0%
wait and I like that I like that it's
only<00:04:55.970><c> when</c><00:04:56.120><c> he</c><00:04:56.270><c> let</c><00:04:56.449><c> the</c><00:04:56.569><c> emotions</c><00:04:57.020><c> in</c><00:04:57.259><c> that</c><00:04:57.289><c> he</c>

only when he let the emotions in that he
 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.270 align:start position:0%
only when he let the emotions in that he
could<00:04:58.190><c> come</c><00:04:58.550><c> to</c><00:04:58.580><c> that</c><00:04:59.000><c> very</c><00:04:59.300><c> rational</c>

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
could come to that very rational
 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.980 align:start position:0%
could come to that very rational
conclusion<00:05:01.280><c> so</c><00:05:01.819><c> I</c><00:05:01.849><c> thought</c><00:05:02.599><c> that</c><00:05:02.750><c> was</c><00:05:02.810><c> good</c>

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 align:start position:0%
conclusion so I thought that was good
 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
conclusion so I thought that was good
that<00:05:03.199><c> was</c><00:05:03.289><c> a</c><00:05:03.349><c> good</c><00:05:03.729><c> evolution</c><00:05:04.729><c> there</c><00:05:04.909><c> that</c>

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 align:start position:0%
that was a good evolution there that
 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.749 align:start position:0%
that was a good evolution there that
that<00:05:05.210><c> was</c><00:05:05.270><c> a</c><00:05:05.419><c> good</c><00:05:05.569><c> journey</c><00:05:05.810><c> uh</c><00:05:05.960><c> and</c><00:05:06.860><c> I'm</c>

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
that was a good journey uh and I'm
 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.149 align:start position:0%
that was a good journey uh and I'm
trying<00:05:07.970><c> to</c><00:05:08.000><c> think</c><00:05:08.090><c> what</c><00:05:08.360><c> else</c>

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
