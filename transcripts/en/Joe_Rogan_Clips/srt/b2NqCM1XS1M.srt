1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,550
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,440
but the leg lock game so unexpected
because I always thought they were a good

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,490
technique if you can get it,
but it's not that high percentage in MMA.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,940
That was Kinda how I felt. You didn't
see too many of them. I don't know why.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,280
I think it was,
we didn't,

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,210
we had a few guys that were really good
in the early days like Olig Tuck tar off

7
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:25,410
and you know some other guys who are
really good but we didn't have the level

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,920
that you have. What? Like a Paul
Horace. Yeah. Dive in on things.

9
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:31,710
Transitioning from one thing to the next
and then locking you up in a position

10
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,110
where you had a tap quick. Cause if
you don't, you're gonna be screaming.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,380
Do you think a lot of the times there's
always guys like the other guy's fault

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,850
or does he really just hold too long?
He definitely holds too long. He has,

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,180
there's one fight from Brazil where it's
crazy. He's just not letting him go.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,000
He just holding onto something,
I forget what it was,

15
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,460
but he was not letting go and they were
trying to separate him when he was still

16
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:53,730
hanging onto it.
I think he came from a really,

17
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,140
really bad childhood and he's talked
about it in depth about growing up on a

18
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,600
farm and being forced to eat pig slop,
pig slop when he was a little boy,

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,960
that cut that he has on his chest, that
big scar here sealed that up with glue.

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,880
Yeah. Like crazy shit
man. Yeah, he's actually,

21
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:15,960
I've met him before a few
times. Like through a, yeah,

22
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:19,500
there's some friends and he
seems like a cool guy. Yeah,
he does. You know, genuine.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,240
I just think when he's killer
in competition, man, he, yeah,

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,510
he just doesn't want to let it go. Yeah.
He wants and they make come let it go.

25
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:28,291
And He tried,

26
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,620
even though he knew that they were
gonna get mad at him if he didn't let go

27
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,220
still in quite let go. Yeah. And
they're like, get the fuck Outta here.

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,330
They kicked him out of the UFC,

29
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:39,960
the first guy ever to get kicked out of
the UFC for holding on submissions. Oh,

30
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:43,440
he got kicked out? Yeah. Oh, okay. Do
you know who he, who he held it against?

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,560
I don't know, but I'm pretty,
I don't want, I want to
make sure that that's true.

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,090
I think it is that who some are.

33
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:52,170
Paul Harris was the first guy to ever
get kicked out of the UFC for and I think

34
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,740
the last one that got kicked out for
was like any normal person wouldn't even

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,900
gotten in trouble for that
one. Yeah. It was like normal.

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,740
I was like maybe a little bit too long,
but it was on that borderline edge.

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,850
But because it was him,
people like he nef,

38
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,660
you know he's, is that what
it was? It wasn't in the UFC,

39
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,540
but it was a controversial
submission victory ever.

40
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:16,590
Jake shields at the world series of
fighting tie. Yeah. Jake shields, I think.

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,410
Yeah, but I think he did that too. But
that was a Kamora. Yeah, that's right.

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,890
But I think before that he
got kicked out of the UFC,

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,710
released in 2013 Oh,
Mike Pierce had a yes.

44
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,630
Referee intervene. That's right.
Yep. So that's what it was. Yeah.

45
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,060
Okay.
That's what it was.

46
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,650
He was released after holding onto a
heel hook of my peers in 2013 yeah,

47
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,310
but look, man, that guy was pretty,

48
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,300
she was particularly scary when he fought
because he was so strong and his body

49
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,940
was so well designed for heel hooks.
Right.

50
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,200
He just could grab a hold of you and to
rip your shit apart. Man. Look at that.

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,100
Oh my God. Look at this now
look what he does here. See,

52
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:07,630
he grabs a hold of my peers.
Don't have that happens. Tapping.

53
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,230
Tapping is still holding. You still hold
that. But that's all in slow motion.

54
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,140
But it looked to me like he was
still ripping the knee apart,

55
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,310
even though he knew that the guy tapped.
Yeah, he had it. He knew he had it.

56
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,680
He's just punishing that guy.
You know?

57
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,070
He makes it scarier for other people and
it's, he's probably used to doing it.

58
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,090
You know, he had this
psychological block. Those,

59
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,470
they all say that he's like a
really, really nice guy. Yeah.

60
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,100
You just become that guy that nobody wants
to fight. You can't get in the moment.

61
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,620
But I think in the Jake shields fight,

62
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,020
there was other shit that was happening
too. I think there was, I pokes,

63
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,390
I'm pretty sure he said dirty fight.

64
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,270
What are you here?
Yeah.

65
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,263
What are we hearing?

66
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,620
There's something bleeding through into
our microphones. I've heard this before.

67
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:55,530
I've been trying to catch what it
was. Ghost Bro. Know what it's from.

68
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,640
It's some interference.
I see. This is like, um,

69
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,220
so I don't know if the people can hear it.

70
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,570
Can the people here right was
known as this? What is it?

71
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,740
What is it? The five club.
The fight, that sound, oh,

72
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:13,520
you left now it's very low.
It's just a little bit,

73
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,230
we just debunk ghost bro.
Which fight was it that you pulled up?

74
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,430
Uh, that, that fight that took, you know,
oh, what do you group tech guys near Park?

75
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,520
He was the first guy to be like super
scary and elite modern level with heel

77
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:31,280
hooks. Where did he start off?
Do you know what promotion? Well,

78
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:35,120
he's a [inaudible] guy. Okay.
So he came out of Brazil,

79
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,110
probably cage warriors. I don't
know man. I don't know where,

80
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,240
where he was fighting and in Brazil,

81
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,630
I don't remember seeing cage
warriors is the UK is it? Yeah,

82
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,850
that's where Anderson came from.
Wealth Anderson,

83
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:48,230
when he made the jump from pride,

84
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:52,010
he did cage warriors for a while and
then came over to the UFC and I think

85
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,990
that's when he started working with,
uh,

86
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,150
the Nogueira is when he started to
keep fighting and cage fighters. Oh.

87
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,410
So he fought in a bunch of fury.
Ifcs fought a bunch of stuff. Storms,

88
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:06,410
Samurai 12, Tom, Tom
[inaudible], Storm Samurai 12.

89
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:11,411
I want a t shirt for Storm
Samurai 12 damn throwback.

90
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,330
Yeah. Real throw backs.
Yeah, he had a great, um,

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,140
it goes to show you how good Gary tone
in his as a submission grapple to,

92
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,580
cause they had a great submission,
grappling match put, keep,

93
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,130
go back to his record there because
I think that was listed there.

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,110
I think it turned out in a draw and
Gary turnon is so much smaller than him.

95
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,680
Draw. Yeah. Gary Tone. Oh
yeah, that was reset. Yeah,

96
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,400
but that really 2016 I think it was,
cause I remember,

97
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,180
no, that was Craig Jones. 2018 was
Craig Jones. Yeah. Cause I lost her.

98
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:49,230
Craig jumbled was posting pictures
about like how he looks now. Tokyo deal.

99
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,170
He's got like,
he's got a fade.

100
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:55,190
I'd like this big mustache now and he's
all jacked off £1,000. Yeah, for sure.

101
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:59,630
So he's running through walls.
Yeah. Is He fighting MMA anymore?

102
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:02,030
Is he just doing grappling?
I think he might just be doing grappling.

103
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,830
I haven't heard of d MMA news.

104
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,340
That's something extra scary about
a guy will fuck your knee up. Yeah.

105
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,980
You know what's up?
Let me the size of him now.

106
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,380
He's with hic hickey monster holes.

107
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,920
You saw it or not wanting to get my,
my heel caught in that armpit.

108
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,570
Yeah. Look at those. That
picture above where he's
screaming. Look at that picture.

109
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:31,050
Like what in the fuck man.
Oh look at Craig Jones.

110
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,090
Just kill that is a body
designed to rip your legs apart.
