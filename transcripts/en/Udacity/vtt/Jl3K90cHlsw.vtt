00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.883
All right, you're done!

00:00:02.123 --> 00:00:04.306
Let's go take a look at my solution.

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:08.000
Now note, you won't be able 
to actually run this code

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.014
to test any of these solutions yet.

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:14.660
But don't worry, we'll be testing soon. 
Here's our solution.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.890
We begin with our unique table name.

00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.111
The rest of the inner class,
lists the columns we're going to use

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:22.098
to use to store our data.
