00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today's video is sponsored
by PUBG Mobile.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.000
In the game PUBG, the supply crates
are full of all sorts of goodies,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.340
ammo, Med kits,
and other accessories.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.200
Well today, we're going to try
building a miniature supply crate,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
stuffing it full of loot,
and then dropping it

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.380
from a couple hundred feet out of a drone.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.440
[Music]

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.800
The crate we're building,
I'm going to shoot

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.600
for approximately one foot cubed.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.500
In fact, it'll end up being
a little bit bigger than that

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
because the main box will be one foot,
and then we'll have little bits

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.532
of extra trim on the outside.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.380
Just trying to make it look more
like the one in the game.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.240
But to start out, we've got these boards
about a quarter of an inch thick,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.200
and we need to cut out
some one foot squares.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:01:14.040
[Music]

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.260
I've got a bunch of squares cut,
and I also have this one by two

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:18.600
board that I ripped down the middle.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.000
We're going to cut four one
foot lengths off of this,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600
and we're going to use that
as sort of the corner supports

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.100
to hold our cube together.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.140
[Music]

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.100
We're using wood glue,
and some finishing nails

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.220
just hold this all together,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.400
and these nails are not long enough
to go through the wood into the table.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.480
I promise.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:54.340
[Music]

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.800
We got five sides of our box.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.400
It is feeling pretty sturdy.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.800
Now, we need to add a lid.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.200
However, I want to be able to remove
this lid without destroying the box.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.600
This isn't the crate that
you actually are going

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.560
to need a pry bar to take apart.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.100
And so, the mechanism
that's going to hold this on

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.960
will be a little bit different.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.200
We're just going to have
four little pieces of wood

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.400
on the sides that will just fit
really snug down into there.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.962
So the lid will hold itself on,
but if you try and lift it off,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.600
it could come off fairly easily.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.500
Lid holds itself on,
but not so tightly

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.700
that you can't just lift it off.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.340
Now, the supply crates in PUBG
are not smooth walled,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.900
and I think they're actually made of metal.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.600
And while ours is made of wood,
we are going to try

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.700
and match the look a little bit.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.500
They have sort of a bumpy
pattern along each side,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.740
and so what  we're going to do
is take five strips

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.800
of are thinner wood
that all fit along the side,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.200
and we're going to taper them
so that they give this sort

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.900
of in and out look
that we have in the game.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.080
[Music]

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.400
These aren't currently attached yet
because we want to wait

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.252
for the spacing until we have
the side pieces on this well,

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:03.000
but here's what those
are going to look like,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.200
giving us that corrugated effect.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.200
Now, we need the sides,
and those are going to be

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.000
a little bit thicker.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.300
We're going to do those two layers thick
because they stick out farther

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.500
than these corrugations.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.700
So we're going to cut off
some more thin strips.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.820
We're going to glue two strips
together to get that thickness,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.100
and then we're going to bevel
one sides we can get two

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.900
of them to match up at the corners nicely.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.200
We want to attach those
to all four corners of our crate.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:40.700
[Music]

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.000
With our corner pieces
attached, we can now go

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.440
about spacing out the side bars.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:04:10.220
[Music]

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.700
Our crate is really
starting to take on

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.600
the look that I was hoping for.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.900
We've got the high edges.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.600
We've got the corrugation
in the middle.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.100
We've got top and
bottom rims on everything.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.000
I'm liking it.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.200
One more addition we do need to make is
that there are these little corner pieces

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200
that go over every one of these angles.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.820
So I've made 16 of those,
just out of some scrap pieces,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.260
and we're just going to glue
and nail those in place.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.800
[Music]

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.100
That is looking like a crate.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.000
Now, we need to do some painting
to get it to match.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.700
In the game, these are
sort of a faded red color.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.300
So we've got faded red paint.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.400
Although first, we're going
to use a little bit of wood putty

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400
and then some primer.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:05:12.080
[Music]

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.700
The supply crates are
not just a wooden box.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.560
They also have what appears
to be a blue tarp over them,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.420
as well as some black straps
wrapping around the whole thing.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.500
So this board here is
about the size of our lid,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.700
and we just need to leave
enough extra space on the sides

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.600
that we can get the hanging
over folded look that we're going for.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.020
That shouldn't actually
take too much.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.200
However, every picture I've seen
of the crate does make it look

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.120
like there's no finished edge on the tarp,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.060
or at least not much.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.300
There's no grommets
or anything like that.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.000
So we are just going to go for bare tarp,
something where there's no finishing,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.800
or seams, or grommets on it.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:59.440
[Music]

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.200
It is time to turn this supply crate
into a crate full of supplies.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.780
So what we've gone and done is
we have a bunch of PUBG t-shirts,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.700
and these are going to go
in the supply crate.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.800
And then assuming that everything works,
assuming this thing survives being dropped

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.100
as we hope it will,
we're going to send the crate

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.100
and the shirts to one lucky fan.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.800
Before I throw t-shirts in,
one more thing I'm going to do,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.400
I am going to sign this bad boy.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.200
Put some time
and effort into it.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:32.200
[Music]

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.420
With our crate all
loaded up with goodies,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.000
we can now put our tarp over it,
and wrap some straps around it.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.620
We've got ourselves some webbing here,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.400
and we need two bands going
each direction, so four bands total.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:07:04.200
[Music]

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.600
Our PUBG supply crate,
our airdrop is built.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.100
And that thing is looking great.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.540
That looks just like the one
in the game in my opinion.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.360
Although, of course,
much smaller.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.100
It can't fit--

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.360
We're doing mini version,
and that,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.600
that looks like a mini version
of the crate.

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:23.700
Now, it needs a parachute,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.200
and we're going to use the same design
and materials that Grant showed you how

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.400
to use in a previous video
of how to make the parachute

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.300
for the sky balls.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.200
So we're going to be using
the same materials that

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.000
dollar store tablecloth plastic.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.160
Although, it's gonna be quite a bit bigger
because this thing weighs about 7.5 pounds.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.900
3.38 kilos.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.600
So we are going to need a bit
more strength on our parachute.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.020
Here is my thought.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.300
I'm pretty sure that even this piece,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.380
if I were cut,

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.000
if I were to cut a square this wide,
I'm pretty sure that would still be

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.300
too small of a parachute.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.800
I want bigger than that.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.800
In fact, I want four
times bigger than that.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.300
So I'm going to take two
of these pieces,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.400
tape them together lengthwise,
and then make a square out of that.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.712
So it's going to be
a big old parachute.

00:08:08.992 --> 00:08:09.900
This table's not big enough.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:18.380
[Music]

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.320
Random fact: By the fifth day after D-Day,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.680
104,428 tons of supplies had been
dropped on the beaches of Normandy.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.900
[Music]

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.900
Let's do a quick test,
which will involve

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.702
me holding these strings and running.

00:08:37.442 --> 00:08:38.860
See if this parachute inflates.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:45.240
[Music]

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.000
Well, I'd say it's
parachuting pretty good.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.500
We'll just have to see how well it works
when we're actually hanging a box from it,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.500
and dropping it off a drone.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.200
There's a slight chance of the box
is just going to hit the ground,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.400
and the parachute won't open.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.400
That'd be exciting too.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.700
The four chords attaching
to our parachute will be connected

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.100
to this swivel hook,
and now, we need to attach

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.500
the swivel hook onto the box.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.300
And then to do that
using some elastic,

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.200
and hopefully, that will
give a little bit of give

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.300
if the parachute catches really suddenly.

00:09:14.592 --> 00:09:16.200
Now, we're going to have
an additional strand

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.900
of paracord attached to this hook,

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.000
and then extend sort of up in
between these chords all the way

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.832
through our parachute,
and then out the top,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.720
we'll have a very tiny hole.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.300
And we're just going
to fit our paracord

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.200
with a loop through that,
and that's what we're going

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.900
to use to attach it to our drone.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.700
Hopefully, by doing that,

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.500
we'll keep the parachute away from any

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.072
of the dangerous parts of the drone.

00:09:38.072 --> 00:09:39.700
It won't get in the blades
or anything like that.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.700
It just seems like that
might be a good way to do it.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.200
Have the crate hanging
below the parachute,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.700
lift it up, drop it.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:50.400
Obviously, a real supply drop parachute
is going to have its own bag,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.880
and it's going to pop open and...

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.172
But we are not making
that official of a replica here.

00:09:56.172 --> 00:10:04.620
[Music]

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.392
PUBG mobile,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.400
if you're not familiar with it,
tt's a battle royale game,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.700
which means it's you
versus everyone else out there.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.700
You can play with teammates,
but it's a small little squad

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.020
of up to four people.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.100
So you just go around,
you grab weapons,

00:10:16.112 --> 00:10:20.100
vehicles, armors, supplies, and you just
try and beat everyone else out there.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.700
It's last man or last
squad standing.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.200
So you've played PUBG
for a while, right?

00:10:26.432 --> 00:10:26.932
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:27.900
One of my--

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.352
It's my favorite game actually.

00:10:29.882 --> 00:10:31.600
&gt;&gt; Have you played it
on any other platform?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.400
Yeah.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.320
I've actually played it on Xbox.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.100
I prefer the mobile version
a little bit better.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.400
I'm much better at the controls
on mobile than I am on Xbox.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.300
&gt;&gt; I'm playing as a very
very new player right now,

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.200
but I mean, controls
seem pretty simple to get used to.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think it's really intuitive.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.500
It's...

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.800
You can pick it up really fast.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.300
Like, I've played this
with people who have

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.600
never played this style of game before,
and they picked it up really quick.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.700
&gt;&gt; You can customize
the controls quite a bit too.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.700
You can move around all the sites,
and your shoot button,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.000
or pick up button,
or just kind of jump button.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.600
Where exactly.
&gt;&gt; Wherever you want your thumbs to be.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.302
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's good.

00:11:08.562 --> 00:11:11.800
So, this game's got some pretty realistic
high-end top-of-the-line graphics

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.800
with Unreal Engine controlling everything.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It definitely
makes a difference.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.000
You can totally tell
that there's a lot

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
of detail in the graphics,
and the rendering that's going on.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.300
&gt;&gt; You suggested when I started playing
that I use some nice headphones,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.202
because it's got
like good audio built into them,

00:11:27.202 --> 00:11:28.400
and stuff like that too, right?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's actually a way better
experience having headphones

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.400
while playing this game,
cause you can hear where

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.680
people are around you.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.100
&gt;&gt; The sound is brought to you
with Truth 3D audio 7.1 channels,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.600
so you hear stuff just all around you.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.800
We're playing on one map now.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.700
How many maps are there?

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.400
&gt;&gt; There's three maps,
and they're really big,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.700
and they have a lot of detail.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.500
&gt;&gt; The game has a variety
of different modes available,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.000
including some faster paced arcade modes,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.500
and those include War mode,
mini zone, sniper training,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.620
and quick matches.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.180
Guys, join over 100 million players
currently playing PUBG Mobile.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.500
The game is completely
free to play.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.200
The download link is
in the description below.

00:12:05.932 --> 00:12:06.500
&gt;&gt; And we died.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.420
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.700
That's pretty cool. We did good.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.400
&gt;&gt; We've got our crate.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.100
We've got our giant drone,
and now we're going to see what happens

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.000
if we pick this thing up,
and drop it.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.640
Hopefully, the parachute will open,
and it will glide gently to the ground.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.900
If that parachute doesn't work,
then we are going to have

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.900
a red crate shaped missile
headed toward the ground,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.040
and I just hope it looks
cool when it explodes.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.320
[Music]

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.460
We're away.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.540
[Music]

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.800
Alright, hitting the switch.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.662
Three, two, one.

00:12:37.662 --> 00:12:40.380
[Music]

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.400
It opened.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.360
It's still coming in pretty quick,
but it opened.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.840
I'm going for it.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.680
[Music]

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.340
Whoo!

00:12:54.362 --> 00:12:54.862
Hoo!

00:12:56.202 --> 00:12:58.672
Supply crate, found.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.922
Intact and everything.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.320
GoPro attached.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.220
GoPro attached.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.880
Parachute, not 100% destroyed.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:09.900
Whoo!

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.180
Success.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:17.120
[Music]

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.740
Well, I think it's even
windier than last time.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:26.260
[Music]

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.140
Ooh.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.660
Parachute struggling
a little bit.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.940
Well, it's coming down hard.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.040
It stayed intact.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.100
Well, that had some force coming down,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.100
but I think it--

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.000
I think the box is okay.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.100
The parachute is not so okay.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.980
Our parachute has suffered.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.320
I'm going to call
that critical failure.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.480
This string is not really
attached too much anymore.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.580
I'm not sure if that happened before
or after we dropped it.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.060
But the box, I think
the box survived alright.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.280
I'm gonna say it means
I built it well.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:08.800
Very cool.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.420
So one very successful drop,
and one semi-successful drop.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.700
That did not completely destroy it,
so I'm calling that a win.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.840
And we are now
doing a giveaway.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.800
We have filled this thing with some loot,
and we're going to be sending it

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.820
to one lucky winner.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.800
Check the link
in the description for details.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.500
Guys, thanks for watching.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.200
But that's not all,
we've got more for you to see.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.100
That box up of the top
will transport you directly

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:28.900
to our last video.

00:14:28.912 --> 00:14:29.900
You should go check that out.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.600
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.880
you should be watching next,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.600
and if you aren't a subscriber,
just hit this bomb to get in the club.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.400
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.000
Talk to you then.
