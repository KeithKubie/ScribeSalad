[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:03.750
MALE SPEAKER 1: So
the thing I love

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.330
most about being a developer
is that I get to actually solve

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.070
real-world problems, and I can
do it without any special tool

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.570
then.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.084
So I can just open
up a text editor,

00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:14.000
put my code in, and then
start to actually see

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the problem being solved
in front of me as I go.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.180
MALE SPEAKER 2: What
I enjoy the most is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.200
the bleeding edge,
the speed at which we

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.517
deliver new technologies.

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:24.600
MALE SPEAKER 3: Our community
is based on sharing,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.820
and we do open source.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.020
And by passing our work back
and forth, we all get better.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.840
MALE SPEAKER 4: [NON-ENGLISH]

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.620
MALE SPEAKER 5:
Having every client

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.720
be connected to
the web at any time

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.319
is both a blessing and a curse.

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.610
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: The biggest
challenge developers face

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.690
is there is so much information.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.400
There are so many different
tools, technologies,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.540
and resources for
them to choose from,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.610
and they're not always
the easiest to find.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.280
MALE SPEAKER 6: Things
used to be a lot simpler.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.090
We used to write code and
we used to compile it,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.282
and then we would be done.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:00.570
Now, we've got the
web to worry about.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.091
We've got mobile to worry about.

00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:03.740
And then on each
of these platforms,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.699
there's separate tools.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.240
MALE SPEAKER 7: Some
days you're just

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.860
like, I just want
to build, and I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890
don't want to kind of
bridge all these gaps.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.514
MALE SPEAKER 2: Even
if you stay on top

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:13.470
of all the releases and
all the API changes,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.810
trying to figure out how
would a developer use

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.480
this to provide value
to users out there,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.880
that is also stressful.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.296
MALE SPEAKER 8:
What I really hope

00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:24.070
we see over the next,
maybe, five years

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.080
is that people get access to
good connectivity, cheaper

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.980
data.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.939
Through that, they get
access to the whole web.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.229
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: There are
millions more people coming

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.680
online throughout the world.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.080
And for developers, it
presents a huge opportunity not

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.680
just to expand, but
to think about how

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.930
to build custom experiences
that match the unique needs

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.805
of those new markets.

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:45.388
MALE SPEAKER 2: If
we're going to have

00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:47.670
the same pace of innovation,
there are no signs

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.990
that it's going to slow down.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.320
It's going to be a really,
really exciting future

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.820
out there.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.653
MALE SPEAKER 7: There's
so much opportunity,

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:56.470
and you see so many unexpected
things every single day.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.185
MALE SPEAKER 5: We connect
to everyone on the planet,

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.560
and that, to me,
is just amazing.
