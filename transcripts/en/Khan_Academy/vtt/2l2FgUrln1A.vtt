00:00:00.778 --> 00:00:01.710
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.543
Hello, Rosie.

00:00:02.543 --> 00:00:03.897
Hello, Paige.

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:04.730
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.791
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:07.069
- [Voiceover] Today, all three of us

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.543
are gonna be talking
about parallel structure.

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:12.123
And I've always had trouble
spelling the word parallel,

00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:13.211
but Rosie pointed out something

00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:14.899
just before we started recording

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:16.845
that is blowing my mind.

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:18.651
Rosie, how do you spell parallel?

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.402
- [Voiceover] Well, it's
fun because the two ls

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:22.296
that are together in the word are together

00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:23.524
in the middle of the word.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.358
- [Voiceover] Look at
that, they're parallel!

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.307
That's all.

00:00:26.307 --> 00:00:27.140
- [Voiceover] It's fun.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.863
- [Voiceover] That's just, that's amazing.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:33.586
Parallel structure is less
a consideration of grammar,

00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:36.586
it's really more about style, right.

00:00:38.808 --> 00:00:41.448
Parallel structure basically
means that when you're making

00:00:41.448 --> 00:00:43.679
some kind of list in a sentence,

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.341
if you're using a series of verbs

00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:48.874
or if you're using a series
of nouns, any series of words,

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:53.234
they should all roughly
line up with one another.

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:56.302
So let's say I was an outdoorsman

00:00:56.302 --> 00:00:59.727
and I said, "I love fishing,
skiing and rock climbing."

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:02.642
Now each one of these is a gerund, right,

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:06.418
it the ing form of a verb
we're using as a noun.

00:01:06.418 --> 00:01:10.167
And this sentence exhibits
parallel structure,

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:12.763
but, you know, sometimes
you'll see a sentence

00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:15.089
that'll mess that up, right?

00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:18.314
So let's say you were editing
someone's personal statement,

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:20.286
an athlete's personal
statement and they said,

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:24.556
"I love fishing, skiing,
and to climb rocks."

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:27.117
Now, there's nothing
grammatically incorrect

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:29.357
about this sentence, it makes sense,

00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:31.949
it is legal in the way
that it is composed,

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:36.234
but stylistically, it
just doesn't harmonize.

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:39.317
So this is not parallel, but this is.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.753
- [Voiceover] Some other
things to look out for

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:45.013
to make sure you're
making a sentence parallel

00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:49.180
is if everything is active
voice or passive voice,

00:01:51.054 --> 00:01:54.804
infinitive verbs versus
other forms of verbs,

00:01:55.878 --> 00:01:58.045
like to eat versus eating,

00:01:59.713 --> 00:02:03.880
and a string of individual
modifiers like adjectives

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:07.999
versus larger phrases.

00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:13.611
- [Voiceover] Let's put that into action.

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:18.258
Okay, so active versus passive voice.

00:02:18.258 --> 00:02:20.307
- [Voiceover] So an example
if we're not gonna have

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.074
parallel structure would be something like

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:26.355
the cake was baked, frosted,
and I put sprinkles on it.

00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:28.309
- [Voiceover] So what we're saying here is

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.774
that here is a passive thing
that happened to the cake,

00:02:30.774 --> 00:02:32.032
the cake was baked.

00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:33.696
Here's another passive thing
that happens to the cake,

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:36.207
the cake was frosted by someone else.

00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:38.349
And then that someone else
comes in and Paige says,

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.574
"I put sprinkles on it."

00:02:39.574 --> 00:02:44.333
But, if we're going to assume
that sprinkled is now a verb

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:47.776
that means to be covered
in sugary cake decorations,

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:51.943
we would say the cake was
baked, frosted, and sprinkled,

00:02:52.994 --> 00:02:54.941
or decorated with sprinkles,

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:56.944
but I kind of like sprinkled.

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.595
So that's active versus passive.

00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:02.574
We've already covered infinitive
versus other verb forms,

00:03:02.574 --> 00:03:04.907
so that's, you know, skiing,

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:09.419
well, that's to ski versus skiing,

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:12.527
so this is what we call
an infinitive form,

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:15.433
and this is another form
that's called a gerund.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:19.175
So make sure to keep those
separate in your lists.

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:22.853
And then lists of individual
terms versus longer phrases.

00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:24.965
So if you are describing something

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:27.552
with a string of adjectives,

00:03:27.552 --> 00:03:31.886
be careful when you follow
it up with a longer phrase.

00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:35.195
- [Voiceover] For
example, sharks are large,

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:36.862
damp, and dangerous.

00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.221
Those are all just short,
individual modifiers,

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.304
as opposed to sharks are large, damp,

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:49.122
and not to be trifled with.

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:50.800
- [Voiceover] And look,
again, we're not saying

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.543
this is not a grammatical sentence.

00:03:52.543 --> 00:03:53.438
It is.

00:03:53.438 --> 00:03:57.085
And sometimes you may want
to break parallel structure

00:03:57.085 --> 00:04:00.605
in order to have some
sort of particular effect.

00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:04.654
If you are trying to draw
attention to this last element,

00:04:04.654 --> 00:04:07.917
then, yeah, you might want
to break parallel structure,

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:10.568
but we want to make you aware

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:14.897
that there is just a sort
of general tendency towards

00:04:14.897 --> 00:04:17.814
making your sentences
harmonious in this way.

00:04:17.814 --> 00:04:22.157
Baked, frosted and sprinkled,
large, damp, and dangerous,

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:25.133
you know, and then when
you want to have access

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:27.800
to that ability, to really draw attention

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.114
to that last element, then you can say,

00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:31.305
"Oh, you know what?

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:34.051
"I'm gonna make this perpendicular."

00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:35.458
(girls chuckle)

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.115
Now, is perpendicularity,

00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:38.729
is that a thing that I
just made up right now?

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:39.900
Yes.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.332
Are we going with it?

00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:42.165
Maybe.

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:43.668
(girls chuckle)

00:04:43.668 --> 00:04:44.577
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I like it.

00:04:44.577 --> 00:04:45.410
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.243
- [Voiceover] It's not parallel.

00:04:46.243 --> 00:04:47.076
- [Voiceover] It's not parallel.

00:04:47.076 --> 00:04:47.909
- [Voiceover] It's not parallel.

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:48.742
- [Voiceover] Well, I suppose

00:04:48.742 --> 00:04:50.754
that just about covers parallel structure.

00:04:50.754 --> 00:04:53.504
So, for one last time with Paige,

00:04:55.727 --> 00:04:58.516
you can learn anything, David out.

00:04:58.516 --> 00:04:59.501
- [Voiceover] Rosie out.

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.334
- [Voiceover] Paige out.

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:01.167
- [Voiceover] You've
been a wonderful intern,

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.000
Paige, we'll miss you.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.833
- [Voiceover] We'll miss you.

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:04.177
- [Voiceover] Thank
you, I'll miss you, too.
