00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.490
 After taking a look a few weeks before what appeared to be 200 calories, the question arises: 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.039
 How can these calories be burned? When the average person runs for a period 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.379
 20 minutes will burn an average of 200 calories, but is this method the most fun 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.100
 To do that? For example, why not chew gum for 18 hours 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.400
 To burn those calories? But chewing gum contains about 10 calories per piece, 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.310
 So if you eat a new piece each hour, it will equal the amount you eat and the amount of burn it will. 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.660
 Do you like lipstick? Try to put it on your lips 1500 times to burn 200 calories. Why not use 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.840
 Those sparkling lips in two hours of kissing who you love? If things develop, 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.030
 You will only need an hour of sex to burn 200 calories. But before you do that, you may want to 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.899
 Clean your teeth 45 times. Do you prefer a more convenient way? What do you think 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.630
 Watching TV? Spend two and a half hours flipping the channels, and you will already 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.970
 Burn those calories. If you watch a comedy program, you will not need more than 4 episodes of a funny series 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.670
 And continuous laughter. If you feel bored and out of breath, you will need more 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.350
 3 hours to burn the same quantity. You burn calories even during your sleep! 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.560
 Instead of flipping channels, what do you think of surfing? You can shorten the time 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.130
 To just one hour of surfing and at the same time you will get the skin color you have long wished for. But if the water enters your mouth 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.200
 During that, do not worry. Because once you drink 8 glasses of fresh water you will burn 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 70 extra calories per day. Which means that after 3 days of drinking the amount of water recommended daily. 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.729
 You will burn 200 calories. But do not try to drink the full amount in one day 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.310
 Drinking large amounts of water can be dangerous to your life. If you do not want to wait for several days, try exercising 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.990
 Wrap the captive cord for 15 minutes. Or if you feel happy 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.830
 Why not express it by singing your favorite song 23 times? But if your voice is not appreciated 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.700
 Just a shower shower, what do you think of playing "chopsticks" on the piano 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.650
 For an hour and a half? Or use your fingers to print a short story of 4,800 words, 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.950
 Its theme is burning 200 calories. The amount of 200 calories is only a number we chose as an example, 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.450
 A pound of fat is about 3500 calories. So, keep burning calories! 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.569
 But it is important to always remember that the number of calories your body actually burns during exercise 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.140
 Depends on your height, weight, gender, and physical structure in general. 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.010
 Remember, AsapSCIENCE released black and white shirts! You'll find the links in the Description box.
