00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:11.080
If you look at a cookie or a soda versus an
apple, you can be less concerned about the

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.880
sugar in an apple.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.250
There's a lot of other things besides just
fructose.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.780
All sorts of bio active compounds, some of
them probably haven't even been discovered

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.320
yet, that do positive things to our health.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.640
The soda and the sugar sweetened beverages
have pretty much only one thing in them and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.210
that's the sugar.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.829
From many, many epidemiological studies, we
do know that the people who eat the most fruit

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.799
are the healthiest and have least risk for
metabolic disease.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:53.179
The other thing is, you have to eat a lot
of fruit to consume a comparable amount of

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.949
sugar as is in three cans of soda.

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.179
Or two cans of soda and two cookies.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.170
Chances are you're not going to be able to
overeat fruit to the point you're going to

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.899
have a high sugar diet just from fruit.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:14.219
Unless you eat a lot of honey, it's actually
heard to be on a high fructose diet if you

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.600
are depending on nature only to get your fructose.
