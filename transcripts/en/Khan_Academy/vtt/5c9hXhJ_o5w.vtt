00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.182
- [Voiceover] During the
dehydration experiment,

00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:06.213
ethene gas and unreacted ethanol

00:00:06.213 --> 00:00:09.501
passed through the tube into the water.

00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:13.089
The ethene was quantitatively
collected as a gas,

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.085
but the unreacted ethanol was not.

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:18.153
Explain this observation in terms

00:00:18.153 --> 00:00:21.125
of the intermolecular forces between water

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:23.145
and each of the two gases.

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:24.678
And just to be clear, what
they're talking about,

00:00:24.678 --> 00:00:27.464
we can go to the original
setup that they gave us

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:29.949
at the beginning of this problem.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.236
And what they're saying is is,

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:34.780
when they warm up, they'll react,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.241
the catalyst and the ethanol in here.

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:41.072
Some of that ethanol gets
converted into ethene,

00:00:41.072 --> 00:00:42.060
but not all of it does.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.024
In fact, part of this experiment,

00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:44.719
we saw that we don't have a perfect,

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.272
we have a 60-point-something
percent yield.

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:51.500
And so you have a combination
of ethanol and ethene gas

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.079
going through this tube.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.701
It cools down, then it
goes through this water.

00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:58.930
And they're saying it looks
like we're only seeing,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.600
or we're primarily seeing,
the ethene gas here.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.573
How come we're not seeing the ethanol gas?

00:01:04.573 --> 00:01:07.023
And the reason, and I'll
just paraphrase it right now,

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:10.518
and then I'll write it down,
is that the ethanol gas

00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:13.676
is much more dissolvable in the water,

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:16.277
because ethanol is a polar molecule,

00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.297
water is a polar solvent,

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:21.850
so it's going to dissolve
much better in water

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.867
than the ethene, which
isn't a polar molecule.

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:28.328
So let me write this down.

00:01:28.328 --> 00:01:30.487
So the ethene will kind of bubble through,

00:01:30.487 --> 00:01:33.808
while the ethanol can actually dissolve.

00:01:33.808 --> 00:01:36.687
So let's write this down.

00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:40.286
So, whoops, having trouble,
all right, there you go.

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:42.028
So explain this observation in terms

00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:43.842
of intermolecular forces between water

00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:45.839
and each of the two gases.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.006
So we could write ethanol.

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:49.969
Ethanol

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.245
is polar,

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:57.225
so it dissolves

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:02.779
in water

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:07.344
much better

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:14.541
than ethene,

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.062
which is

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:21.498
nonpolar.

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.772
And so we could say something like,

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:28.689
so ethanol,

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:30.648
ethanol

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:34.076
and water

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:38.481
will have hydrogen bonds,

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:40.564
will have hydrogen bonds.

00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:45.507
Hydrogen bonds.

00:02:45.507 --> 00:02:47.597
You could even diagram it out if you like.

00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:49.571
The ethanol is right over here.

00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:52.380
So you have your oxygen,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.470
and then you have your hydrogen,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.803
and then you have your C2H5.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:02.133
This side over here, this is
going to be partially negative.

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.617
This is going to be partially positive.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.659
Oxygen is more
electronegative than carbon.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.086
The difference is less than
between oxygen and hydrogen,

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:12.083
but this is also going
to be partially positive.

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:13.569
Maybe not as partially positive

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.706
as on this side right over here.

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:17.656
And so when you have water molecules,

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:20.141
so if this is a water molecule

00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:21.474
right over here,

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:25.552
where this was partially positive charges,

00:03:25.552 --> 00:03:27.802
partially negative charges,

00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:32.195
you're going to have the hydrogen bonds.

00:03:34.216 --> 00:03:36.155
Hydrogen bonds.

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:39.220
And so the ethanol is going
to dissolve much better.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.053
The ethene isn't polar

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:46.395
and will only have induced
dipole forces acting on it.

00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:47.319
So let me write this.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.152
Ethene,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.687
ethene is not polar.

00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:54.340
Is not polar.

00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:57.635
And so, or I could say,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.553
so will

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:02.419
only have

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:08.959
induced dipole interactions.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.209
Induced dipole.

00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:13.487
And maybe well I could say dipole,

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:15.654
'cause the water is polar,

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:20.082
and even though ethene
is a symmetric molecule

00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:21.591
and has that double bond,

00:04:21.591 --> 00:04:24.122
it has no net polarity.

00:04:24.122 --> 00:04:25.933
There are parts of the ethene molecule

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:26.990
that are going to be a little bit

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.058
more negative than others,

00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:32.693
in particular, when you look
at the carbons over here.

00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:34.204
They're a little bit more electronegative

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:35.597
than the hydrogens.

00:04:35.597 --> 00:04:38.128
And so ethene is not polar,

00:04:38.128 --> 00:04:41.240
wo will only have induced dipole,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.258
or I guess we could also say just dipole

00:04:44.258 --> 00:04:45.341
interactions,

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:48.959
interactions, interactions,

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:51.941
with

00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:52.941
polar water.

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:54.989
Polar water.

00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:58.780
And so this is why.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.591
So this is why

00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:02.797
ethene won't dissolve as well.

00:05:02.797 --> 00:05:03.797
Ethene won't

00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:07.415
dissolve

00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:10.015
as well

00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:13.241
and bubbles through.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.772
And bubbles through.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.608
Ethanol dissolves.

00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:20.839
Ethene bubbles through,

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.866
'cause it doesn't have strong
interactions with the water.
