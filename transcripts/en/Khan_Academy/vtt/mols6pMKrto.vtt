00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:03.053
- [Instructor] So we have
the graph of Y equals f of x

00:00:03.053 --> 00:00:04.850
right over here and we want to figure out

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.053
three different limits and like always

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:09.043
pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:11.800
on your own before we do it together.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.720
Alright now first let's
think about what's the limit

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.839
of f of x it's x approaches six.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.746
So as x, I'm gonna do this
in a color you can see,

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:22.469
as x approaches six from both sides

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:25.309
well as we approach six
from the left hand side,

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.436
from values less than six,

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:31.565
it looks like our f of
x is approaching one

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:35.732
and as we approach x equals
six from the right hand side

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:41.652
it looks like our f of x is
once again approaching one

00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:43.284
and in order for this limit to exist,

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:45.529
we need to be approaching the same value

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:47.756
from both the left and the right hand side

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.239
and so here at least graphically,

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.672
so you never are sure
with a graph but this is

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:56.838
a pretty good estimate, it looks
like we are approaching one

00:00:56.838 --> 00:00:59.972
right over there, in a darker color.

00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:02.077
Now let's do this next one.

00:01:02.077 --> 00:01:04.647
The limit of f of x is x approaches four

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:09.007
so as we approach four
from the left hand side

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:10.424
what is going on?

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.580
Well as we approach four
from the left hand side

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.387
it looks like our function,
the value of our function

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:20.803
it looks like it is approaching three.

00:01:20.803 --> 00:01:23.578
Remember you can have a
limit exist at an x value

00:01:23.578 --> 00:01:26.405
where the function itself is not defined,

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:28.964
the function , if you said
after four, it's not defined

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:31.711
but it looks like when we
approach it from the left

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.446
when we approach x
equals four from the left

00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:36.066
it looks like f is approaching three

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.982
and then we approach four from the right,

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:43.193
once again, it looks like our
function is approaching three

00:01:43.193 --> 00:01:48.127
so here I would say, at
least from what we can tell

00:01:48.127 --> 00:01:50.867
from the graph it looks like the limit

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:53.834
of f of x is x approaches four is three,

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:56.706
even though the function
itself is not defined yet.

00:01:56.706 --> 00:01:59.408
Now let's think about the
limit as x approaches two.

00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:04.306
So this is interesting the
function is defined there

00:02:04.306 --> 00:02:08.407
f of two is two, let's
see when we approach

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:12.574
from the left hand side
it looks like our function

00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:16.271
is approaching the value of two

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.923
but when we approach
from the right hand side,

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:22.267
when we approach x equals
two from the right hand side,

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:25.267
our function is getting
closer and closer to five

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:28.831
it's not quite getting
to five but as we go from

00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:33.367
you know 2.1 2.01 2.001
it looks like our function

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:36.159
the value of our function's
getting closer and closer

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.418
to five and since we are
approaching two different values

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:42.028
from the left hand side
and the right hand side

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:44.946
as x approached two
from the left hand side

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:47.137
and the right hand side we
would say that this limit

00:02:47.137 --> 00:02:49.887
does not exist so does not exist.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.631
Which is interesting.

00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:56.579
In this first case the
function is defined at six

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.069
and the limit is equal to
the value of the function

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.458
at x equals six, here the
function was not defined

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:05.798
at x equals four, but the limit does exist

00:03:05.798 --> 00:03:10.536
here the function is defined
at f equals, x equals two

00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:13.455
but the limit does not exist
as we approach x equals two

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:16.835
let's do another function
just to get more cases

00:03:16.835 --> 00:03:20.014
of looking at graphical limits.

00:03:20.014 --> 00:03:24.097
So here we have the graph
of Y is equal to g of x

00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:27.490
and once again pause this
video and have a go at it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.356
and see if you can figure
out these limits graphically.

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:32.621
So first we have the
limit as x approaches five

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:36.523
g of x so as we approach
five from the left hand side

00:03:36.523 --> 00:03:38.714
it looks like we are
approaching this value

00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:42.547
let me just draw a
straight Line that takes us

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:47.371
so it looks like we're
approaching this value

00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:50.665
and as we approach five
from the right hand side

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:54.031
it also looks like we are
approaching that same value.

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:58.294
And so this value, just
eye balling it off of here

00:03:58.294 --> 00:04:02.019
looks like it's about .4
so I'll say this limit

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.700
definitely exists just
when looking at a graph

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.500
it's not that precise

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.134
so I would say it's approximately 0.4

00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:13.288
it might be 0.41 it might be 0.41456789

00:04:13.288 --> 00:04:16.183
we don't know exactly
just looking at this graph

00:04:16.183 --> 00:04:19.227
but it looks like a value
roughly around there.

00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:21.587
Now let's think about the limit of g of x

00:04:21.587 --> 00:04:24.572
as x approaches seven so
let's do the same exercise.

00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:26.853
What happens as we approach from the left

00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:30.638
from values less than
seven 6.9, 6.99, 6.999

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:34.666
well it looks like the
value of our function

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:37.596
is approaching two, it doesn't matter

00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:40.445
that the actual function is
defined g of seven is five

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:42.963
but as we approach from the left,

00:04:42.963 --> 00:04:45.752
as x goes 6.9, 6.99 and so on,

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.810
it looks like our value of our function

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.626
is approaching two, and as
we approach x equals seven

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.514
from the right hand side it
seems like the same thing

00:04:55.514 --> 00:04:58.188
is happening it seems like
we are approaching two

00:04:58.188 --> 00:05:01.827
and so I would say that this
is going to be equal to two

00:05:01.827 --> 00:05:04.593
and so once again, the
function is defined there

00:05:04.593 --> 00:05:08.244
and the limit exists
there but the g of seven

00:05:08.244 --> 00:05:12.411
is different than the value
if the limit of g of x

00:05:13.507 --> 00:05:14.976
as x approaches seven.

00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:16.439
Now let's do one more.

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.687
What's the limit as x approaches one.

00:05:18.687 --> 00:05:20.463
Well we'll do the same thing,

00:05:20.463 --> 00:05:23.244
from the left hand side,
it looks like we're going

00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:27.327
unbounded as x goes .9,
0.99, 0.999 and 0.9999

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:33.515
it looks like we're just going
unbounded towards infinity

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:36.007
and as we approach from
the right hand side

00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:39.724
it looks like the same thing is happening

00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:42.781
we're going unbounded to infinity.

00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:45.462
So formally, sometimes
informally people will say

00:05:45.462 --> 00:05:47.318
oh it's approaching infinity
or something like that

00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:50.288
but if we wanna be formal
about what a limit means

00:05:50.288 --> 00:05:52.736
in this context because it is unbounded

00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:55.187
we would say that it does not exist.

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:56.437
Does not exist.
