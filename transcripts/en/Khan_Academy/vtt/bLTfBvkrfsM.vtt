00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.840
We're asked, what is the
greatest common divisor

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.679
of 20 and 40?

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:06.220
And they just say,
another way to say

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.840
this is the GCD, or greatest
common divisor, of 20 of 40

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.750
is equal to question mark.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.870
And greatest common divisor
sounds like a very fancy term,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.260
but it's really
just saying, what

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.900
is the largest number that is
divisible into both 20 and 40?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.680
Well, this seems like a pretty
straightforward situation,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.610
because 20 is actually
divisible into 40.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.630
Or another way to
say it is 40 can

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.090
be divided by 20
without a remainder.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.450
So the largest
number that is a-- I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.250
guess you could say-- factor of
both 20 and 40 is actually 20.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.902
20 is 20 times 1,
and 40 is 20 times 2.

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:47.360
So in this situation,
we don't even

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.730
have to break out our paper.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.550
We can just write 20.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.370
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.590
So we're asked, what is
the greatest common divisor

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.460
of 10 and 7?

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.780
So let's now break out
our paper for this.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.080
So our greatest common
divisor of 10 and 7.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.209
So let me write that down.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.460
So we have 10.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:15.120
We want to think about what
is our GCD of 10 and 7?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.130
And there's two ways that
you can approach this.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.990
One way, you could literally
list all of the factors--

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.710
not prime factors, just
regular factors-- of each

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.190
of these numbers and figure
out which one is greater

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.410
or what is the largest
factor of both.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.050
So, for example, you could
say, well, I got a 10,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:46.960
and 10 can be expressed
1 times 10 or 2 times 5.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.615
1, 2, 5, and 10.

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:51.450
These are all factors of 10.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.650
These are all, we could
say, divisors of 10.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.800
And sometimes this is called
greatest common factor.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.190
Seven-- what are
all of its factors?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.180
Well, 7 is prime.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.860
It only has two
factors-- 1 and itself.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.550
So what is the
greatest common factor?

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.360
Well, there's only one
common factor here, 1.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.570
1 is the only common factor.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.050
So the greatest common
factor of 10 and 7,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.470
or the greatest common divisor,
is going to be equal to 1.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.360
So let's write that down.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.290
1.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.490
Let's do one more.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.960
What is the greatest common
divisor of 21 and 30?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.430
And this is just another
way of saying that.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.270
So 21 and 30 are the two
numbers that we care about.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.370
So we want to figure out
the greatest common divisor,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.610
and I could have written
greatest common factor,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.070
of 21 and 30.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.050
So once again, there's
two ways of doing this.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.550
And so there's the way I did
the last time where I literally

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.800
list all the factors.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.850
Let me do it that
way really fast.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.110
So if I say 21, what
are all the factors?

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.220
Well, it's 1 and
21, and 3, and 7.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.030
I think I've got all of them.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:25.512
And 30 can be written as 1 and
30, 2 and 15, and 3-- actually,

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:26.720
I'm going to run out of them.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.170
Let me write it this way so
I get a little more space.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.880
So 1 and 30.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.160
2 and 15.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.100
3 and 10.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.710
And 5 and 6.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.210
So here are all of
the factors of 30.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.610
And now what are
the common factors?

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.130
Well, 1 is a common factor.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.490
3 is also a common factor.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.435
But what is the
greatest common factor

00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:58.500
or the greatest common divisor?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.020
Well, it is going to be 3.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.780
So we could write 3 here.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.800
Now, I keep talking
about another technique.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.300
Let me show you the
other technique,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.690
and that involves the
prime factorization.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.320
So if you say the prime
factorization of 21-- well,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.700
let's see, it's divisible by 3.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.399
It is 3 times 7.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:24.610
And the prime factorization
of 30 is equal to 3

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.550
times 10, and 10 is 2 times 5.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.310
So what are the
most factors that we

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.620
can take from both 21 and
30 to make the largest

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.920
possible numbers?

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.190
So when you look at the
prime factorization,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.540
the only thing that's common
right over here is a 3.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.440
And so we would say that
the greatest common factor

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.090
or the greatest common
divisor of 21 and 30 is 3.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.140
If you saw nothing in
common right over here,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.310
then you say the greatest
common divisor is one.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.630
Let me give you another
interesting example, just so

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.980
that we can get a
sense of things.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.470
So let's say these two
numbers were not 21 and 30,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.630
but let's say we care about
the greatest common divisor not

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.430
of 21, but let's
say of 105 and 30.

00:05:22.257 --> 00:05:24.090
So if we did the prime
factorization method,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.822
it might become a
little clearer now.

00:05:25.822 --> 00:05:28.280
Actually figuring out, hey,
what are all the factors of 105

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.080
might be a little bit
of a pain, but if you

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.610
do a prime factorization,
you'd say, well, let's see,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.460
105-- it's divisible
by 5, definitely.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.880
So it's 5 times 21,
and 21 is 3 times 7.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.360
So the prime
factorization of 105

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.620
is equal to-- if I write them
in increasing order-- 3 times

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.790
5 times 7.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.890
The prime factorization of
30, we already figured out

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.520
is 30 is equal to
2 times 3 times 5.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.650
So what's the most
number of factors

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.360
or prime factors that
they have in common?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.180
Well, these two both have a
3, and they both have a 5.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.040
So the greatest common factor
or greatest common divisor

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.770
is going to be a
product of these two.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.090
In this situation,
the GCD of 105 and 30

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.230
is 3 times 5, is equal to 15.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.480
So you could do it either way.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.120
You could just list out the
traditional divisors or factors

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.600
and, say, figure
out which of those

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.110
is common and is the greatest.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.470
Or you can break it down
into its core constituencies,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.700
its prime factors,
and then figure out

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.946
what is the largest set
of common prime factors,

00:06:39.946 --> 00:06:41.320
and the product
of those is going

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.135
to be your greatest
common factor.

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:48.541
It's the largest number that
is divisible into both numbers.
