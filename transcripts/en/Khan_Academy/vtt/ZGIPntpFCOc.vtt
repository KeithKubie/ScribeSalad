00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.471
- [Voiceover] Let's say that this is me

00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:04.076
in this column over here,

00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:06.892
and that this is you in
that column over there.

00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:09.834
And let's say that you are in possession

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:14.834
of a nice juicy, of a nice
juicy apple right over here.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.884
Let me draw this apple properly,

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.466
let me make the leaf in green.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.633
So you are in possession of this apple,

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:27.240
and I'm hungry, I would
like to have an apple.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.620
And I just assume while
you posses this apple,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.200
I assume that you own it,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.080
so I go up to you and say,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.823
"Hey, can I buy this apple from you?"

00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:36.209
And you say, "Okay, yeah.
I don't really need it,

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:37.742
"I'll sell it to you for a dollar."

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:40.556
And so I give you a dollar,

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:45.561
I give you one dollar, and
then you give me the apple.

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:49.607
Then you give me the
apple, so now I have it,

00:00:49.607 --> 00:00:51.848
so now I have the apple.

00:00:51.848 --> 00:00:53.206
Somehow the apple got smooshed

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:55.212
a little bit in the transaction.

00:00:55.212 --> 00:01:00.212
So now I have, I have,
now I have the apple.

00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:02.633
Now when I did that transaction,

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:04.600
there were some
assumptions that were made,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.497
I assumed that possession of the apple

00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:09.733
was equivalent to ownership of the apple.

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:14.733
I assumed, whoops, I assumed possession

00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:16.733
is equal to ownership.

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.081
And you might be thinking, "Wait, wait,

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:20.007
"under what cases would possession

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.002
"not be equal to ownership?"

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.461
Well what if you just picked this apple

00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.202
from your neighbors garden?

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:28.500
The rightful owner of that
apple is your neighbor,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.376
but you just picked it,

00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:31.594
maybe you swiped this
from the corner store.

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:33.433
Maybe you found this on a bench

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:36.066
and you said, "Okay, well it doesn't seem

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:36.966
"anyone else is claiming it.

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.661
"So I'm just going to claim this apple."

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:40.300
But maybe someone else
had left it on the bench,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.667
and then they come back an hour later,

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:42.867
said, "What happened to my apple?

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:44.376
"I'm the owner of that apple."

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:47.071
So you see that even in
the case of an apple,

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.366
possession might not
be equal to ownership.

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.530
So these two things
might not be equivalent.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.050
But for something as small as an apple as,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.700
I guess you could say financially

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.471
not as important,
something that's you know

00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:02.230
has a market value of a dollar.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.733
It might be too much trouble to kind of

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.633
do a background check on the apple

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:08.800
to see do a forensic analysis to see

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.333
who is guarding the apple came from

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.412
or to see is someone else had legal right,

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:15.569
legal title to the apple.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.333
And so for things like apples,

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.571
we tend to just transact just assuming

00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:22.276
that possession equals ownership.

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:25.602
Now let's take, let's up
the stakes a little bit.

00:02:25.602 --> 00:02:26.884
Instead of an apple, let's say we're

00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:28.373
talking about a house.

00:02:28.373 --> 00:02:30.566
So let's say that you are in possession

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:33.561
of this nice yellow house.

00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:36.533
So let me draw, we
definitely want to visualize

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.517
what a nice yellow house would look like.

00:02:38.517 --> 00:02:40.709
It's got some windows here,

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.068
so and there's some nice gardening.

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:49.035
There's, so you, you are in possession

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.266
of this nice house.

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:51.600
So what does possession
of the house means?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.466
Well, it means you're living in it,

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:54.933
you have the keys to the house,

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:57.363
your station wagon is in the driveway.

00:02:57.363 --> 00:03:00.409
Your stuff is in the
closet, your furniture.

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.600
You have pictures of you
and your family on the wall.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.118
So you seem to be in
possession of this house.

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:09.112
And you stick a for sale sign out on.

00:03:09.112 --> 00:03:12.833
So, for sale.

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:17.333
So you put a for sale sign
outside of this house,

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.973
and I'm new to town, and I need a place

00:03:19.973 --> 00:03:22.148
for me and my family to live.

00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:23.533
And so I say, "Hey, you know,

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:24.666
"I'd like to buy that house.

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:25.500
"How much is it?"

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.889
And you say, "It's $100,000."

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.777
You say, "Okay, it seems like a reasonably

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:31.368
"good deal compared to other houses

00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:32.399
"in this neighborhood.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:33.500
"I want to buy it."

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.946
And you say, "Great."

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:37.566
So I walk up to you, I write a check

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:42.325
for maybe I even have cash for a $100,000.

00:03:42.325 --> 00:03:45.700
So a little bit more serious transaction

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.417
than the apple transaction.

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:50.211
And then in exchange you give me

00:03:50.211 --> 00:03:52.035
the keys to the house.

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:54.384
So now I have the keys to the house.

00:03:54.384 --> 00:03:56.320
I'll draw some keys here.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.930
So keys to the house.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.133
And you say, "Give me an hour."

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:01.500
And you pack up all of your stuff,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.500
take your pictures off the wall,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.840
put them in your station
wagon, and you leave.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.850
And you say, "Okay well, I guess I'm just

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.638
"going to move in to the house."

00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:10.766
Now, you probably are thinking,

00:04:10.766 --> 00:04:12.484
"Something is suspicious here.

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:15.542
"Something is, makes us feel
a little less comfortable

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:16.925
"doing this transaction than this

00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:18.756
"transaction over here."

00:04:18.756 --> 00:04:21.925
Because this house,
just because the person

00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:23.933
happen to be in it and had the keys to it,

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:26.200
didn't mean that they owned the house.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.148
So once again, possession
does not necessarily

00:04:29.148 --> 00:04:30.263
equal ownership.

00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:32.099
We can think of a lot
of scenarios for a house

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.296
where possession does not equal ownership.

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:37.073
They might have been renting the house,

00:04:37.073 --> 00:04:38.730
they might have been renting.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.176
They might have been guest in the house.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.166
And maybe the owners, the real owners

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:46.600
were off to work and their
faces were in the pictures

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.233
just because they were
the owner's brother-in-law

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.000
or something.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.040
So maybe they were guest in the house.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.833
Maybe they were,

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:54.766
maybe they just saw a vacant house,

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:56.466
maybe this is someone
else's vacation house,

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:57.414
and said, "Hey you know what,

00:04:57.414 --> 00:04:58.633
"I know these people don't show up

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:00.633
"during the summer, so
I'm just going to go there

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.300
"change the locks, have the keys,

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.233
"and I'm going to pretend
like I live there.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:05.492
"And then I'm going to
try and find somebody

00:05:05.492 --> 00:05:07.505
"new to town and I'm going
to sell them the house

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:09.040
"for a $100,000."

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.435
And if you think all of these things

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:11.933
are kind of crazy scenarios,

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:13.460
they've all happened.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.966
Because as you can imagine

00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:16.861
there's some people for whom who have

00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:19.366
who are I guess a little
bit less scrupulous,

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:22.233
who's ethics are questionable,

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:23.934
who could be very tempted by this.

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.000
So you could imagine for,
when you're talking about

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
big dollar figures, people have tried

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.268
some fairly major scams.

00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:32.833
So how do you, and you
know, and once again,

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:34.100
just in the case of the apple,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.476
maybe someone left it on the bench,

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:37.033
and someone thought that it was their,

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:38.163
you know you thought it was your apple

00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:39.100
now that you found it.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.067
There could be, it doesn't
have to be just scamming,

00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:43.923
it could be, I thought
I inherited this house,

00:05:43.923 --> 00:05:46.300
but then some other relatives shows up,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.400
who is closer to the
previous owner of the house,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.699
and said, "No, no, wait, wait, wait.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.589
"You can give that
house to the son-in-law.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:57.933
"I am his younger brother or
I am his long lost child."

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:00.217
Or whatever else it might be.

00:06:00.217 --> 00:06:02.733
So you might have thought
that you own the house,

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:04.800
but there might have been
some other claim on it.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.113
And maybe you bought the house out right

00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:07.953
or you thought you bought it,

00:06:07.953 --> 00:06:10.400
but maybe the previous owner had you know

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.933
was in a dispute with their
brother or their sister

00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:13.953
over the house.

00:06:13.953 --> 00:06:16.313
So there could be other claims on it.

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:19.833
And so the way that, the
way in modern society

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:21.100
is that we deal with this,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.733
where we see who has ownership rights

00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:24.100
or another ways of thinking about it,

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.925
who has title?

00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:27.494
So this is an important word.

00:06:27.494 --> 00:06:29.809
Who has title?

00:06:30.163 --> 00:06:32.167
Or I guess you could say proof of title.

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:33.434
When I talk about title,

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:34.800
this is ownership rights,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.966
we're talking about real,
right to live in the house,

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:39.166
it's a right to do what you, you know,

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.167
garden around the house,

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:42.415
has the right to modify the house.

00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:45.942
So the question of who has
title or evidence of title,

00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:49.181
evidence of title, happens
through legal documents.

00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:51.897
Evidence of title.

00:06:51.897 --> 00:06:55.730
And these legal documents
are called deeds.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.451
So let me write them.

00:06:57.451 --> 00:06:58.809
So the legal type.

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:03.073
These legal documents are called deeds.

00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:06.301
And deeds, so when I,
so if I wanted to buy

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:07.892
this house from you,

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:12.076
you would, we would get an attorney,

00:07:12.076 --> 00:07:14.961
and then we would draft
a deed that transfers,

00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:18.648
that transfers the
property from you to me.

00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:19.523
But you're saying, "Wait, wait, wait,

00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:22.481
"that still doesn't you know prove to me

00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:25.025
"that the house is all good."

00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:27.600
And then that's why I would
do a title search on it.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.733
So there's actually companies
that do title searches,

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:32.200
and they're going to go
to the public records,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.928
to the city or county records,

00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:35.313
and they're going to
see, "Hey, what are all

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:37.966
"the deeds that have been
filed with the city?"

00:07:37.966 --> 00:07:39.266
And whenever there's a deed,

00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:40.924
if things have done properly,

00:07:40.924 --> 00:07:42.667
it needs to be made of public record,

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:45.450
it needs to be filed
with the city or county.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.618
And so when you do a title search.

00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:50.858
So when you do, let's
do in a different color.

00:07:50.858 --> 00:07:55.611
When you do a title search,

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:57.400
whoever is doing the title search

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.909
will look at the public records,

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:00.876
and they'll look at
all the previous deeds.

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:05.000
They'll look at the deed
that from the previous owner

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.166
of the house to you,
they'll look at the deed

00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:09.948
from the previous owner even before that,

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.766
and they'll make sure that all of the

00:08:11.766 --> 00:08:15.200
the titles, the title
transfer has been cleaned,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.536
that there hasn't been any
weird claims on the house,

00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:19.266
that there haven't been
liens on the house.

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.900
We'll talk more about what a lien is.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.100
A lien is essentially
a claim on the house,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.500
maybe three owners ago someone didn't pay

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.166
property taxes, and the
city is still saying,

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.004
"Hey, whoever owns this
house, owns us a $1000."

00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:33.800
Maybe four owners ago there was someone

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.067
who did an improvement to the house,

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:36.500
and said, "Hey, that owner never paid me

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.700
"for the new driveway.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.576
"I have a lien on this house.

00:08:39.576 --> 00:08:41.532
"Whoever is benefiting from this driveway,

00:08:41.532 --> 00:08:43.733
"who owns this house,
they still own me money

00:08:43.733 --> 00:08:47.009
"before I were to remove that lien."

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:50.442
So the way that we do it
in a modern society is,

00:08:50.442 --> 00:08:52.700
Okay, you say you're selling this house,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.748
but before I actually give you the money,

00:08:54.748 --> 00:08:56.033
I'm going to do a title search,

00:08:56.033 --> 00:08:57.278
I'm going to make sure that there aren't

00:08:57.278 --> 00:08:58.484
any other claims, I want to make sure

00:08:58.484 --> 00:09:00.502
that you are the real
owner of the property.

00:09:00.502 --> 00:09:03.915
And only then will money be transferred.
