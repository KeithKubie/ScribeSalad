00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.719
The idea of what you're looking for
in those initial employees,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.650
is it's a really important one.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.780
They have to be jacks of all trades and
they have to be passionate but

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.610
they also and, in fact, I think this is
just when you're looking for employees

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.410
in any whether it's a start up, whether
they're your first employee or hundreds.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.020
What you really want are people that
have a very specific skill, but

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.810
are willing, and
this is where the passion comes in,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.570
are willing to do whatever it takes,
whether it's their job,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.210
whether it's their specialty, whether
it's kind of outside their comfort zone.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.180
Because if you think about a start up
the grows is going, the people that

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.650
start, their rules are going to change
every six months, significantly.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.690
The first person that
handles marketing for

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.020
you could be your VP eng in a year and
a half.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.290
You never know what's
going to happen and

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.100
you need the most adaptable
people you can find.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.120
And I think that adaptability,
some of it's a core trait but

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.020
a lot of that is really
just willingness and

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.490
passion and an ability to learn fast
which is super important obviously.
