1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
Talk about positive.
Kevin,
how have you been?
Yeah,
I always liked that it's,

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:06.240
this is the phase that I look at that are so easy.

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.850
You're not just positive though.
You're like crazy ambitious.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.880
That's the thing that gets me about you and the rock for sure.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.030
It's like the ambitions off the charts.
Like I know you're rich as fuck.

6
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:18.060
Like when,
when do you think you got enough?
You don't have enough.
There's no,

7
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:22.260
doesn't know enough.
I don't have enough because it's not over.
It's not over.

8
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:24.220
It's not over.
So you know when,

9
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:29.221
when you put a cap on it yet you're putting a punctuation to it and the,

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.043
the,

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.470
the ambition comes from seeing what's out there that can be obtained.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.760
You know,
when you see what's out there.

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.910
Like what can you mean physical things like when you see what's out there,

14
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:49.911
when you see where people are really gaining wealth in knowledge from,

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.430
okay.
The business relationships that you're able to acquire,

16
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.790
the people that you're able to partner with and create certain things,

17
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.220
different revenue streams.

18
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.080
What I found is as a young black guy from North Philadelphia,

19
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.740
the biggest problem with the biggest problem within our community is knowledge.

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.570
We don't know debt debt is welcomed because it's celebrated.

21
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.880
That's all we know.
Yeah.
Nah I'm good.
That credit card on them.

22
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.420
Fuck that credit card up and it is what it is.
They got to figure that out.

23
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.870
I ain't got it after that.
Yeah.
Well you know what,
I'm getting student loans.

24
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:35.940
They gave it to me then after that shit it is what it is.

25
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:40.380
I'm figuring out and I put the capabilities.
Your name,
you put it in my name,

26
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.214
we could switch it up.

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.310
Whatever they do us to just put it in somebody else's name.
It's welcome.

28
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.410
The hustle is welcome.

29
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.810
The knowledge of banks and what you can do or can't do.
It's fucking,

30
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920
you don't even get it cause you go to check cashing places reasonably go check

31
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:57.840
cash place cause I don't want to go through that shift and banks,

32
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:00.360
I'll trust that go.
I did a check has place.
Let me get my,

33
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.250
let me get my now take $30 whatever.
Let me get it.
The knowledges and given.

34
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.990
So it's not to,
you obtain that knowledge and understanding that you go,
Oh shit,

35
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.270
oh this is why you put money up.
Oh this is,

36
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.390
this is how you increase vs decrease.

37
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.900
Oh this is how you earn on your money.
Oh Wow.

38
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.850
I can gain wealth by investing in what the stock world is.
What,

39
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.940
how many people partake in the stock world?

40
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.810
And is there a part that isn't necessarily gambling?
Is there a low risk part?

41
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.590
These,
the snap,
the information isn't there.
Right.
So it's not true.

42
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.660
I got to a certain level and a certain group,

43
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:43.530
people where I got it and now that I got it,
I want to give it.

44
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.240
So now I'm going to give it,

45
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.980
I'm going to give it to the people that I know need it most.
And for me,

46
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:54.180
that younger generation of black people that don't understand.

47
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:57.990
The cool thing is in financial longevity,

48
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.440
not in now,
it's not in the moment for jewelry,
not in the moment.

49
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:06.170
For the car it's in.
The longevity is in buildings.

50
00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:08.590
So at the end of the day you can say,
look at what I have,

51
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.330
look at what I worked for,
looking at what I have.
That's mind.
Monopoly is real,

52
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.560
but you have to have the financial understanding.
And I,
I teamed up,

53
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.470
I got chased on,
we do some called financial fitness.

54
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.390
Where's just about me educating people on money,
really how to manage money,

55
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.370
how to,
how to be smart with your money,

56
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:29.110
but it's coming from a person that fucked up money.

57
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.390
I didn't always understand it,

58
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.920
how old and taxes before because I didn't understand that in the beginning I've

59
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:40.690
had bad credit.
Credit cards wouldn't take me because I'm maxed out.
Whatever.

60
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.740
I've been there,
I've done it.

61
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.310
Thank God I was able to fix it and get on the right path.

62
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.700
And now that I have the knowledge I want to give it because we simply don't
know.

63
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.580
So when you say the end game,

64
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.960
the end game is getting to a point where I've taken all the knowledge that I've

65
00:03:55.961 --> 00:04:00.961
been able to get over these years and really applying it and providing family

66
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.640
wealth when it's all said and done.

67
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:05.500
The last name Hart is going to mean just more,

68
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.660
a lot more than just Kevin Hart and comedy hartbeat productions.

69
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.110
Hartbeat digital,
you got heartbeat ventures,
your heartbeat real estate.

70
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.130
There's so many things that the last name Hart will be attached to you.

71
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.850
So real estate,
Kevin Hart and sell real estate,
buy real estate.

72
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.570
I don't talk about yourself,
I'm sorry I don't sell it.

73
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.340
I buy it.
But the reason why is because investment investment.

74
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.620
But as you get older,
you learn this,
you learn it.
And,
and you know,

75
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:39.430
it's such a thing where you talk about um,
black versus white.
You know,

76
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:43.660
a lot of people do that and rightfully so.
Like there,
there is racism.

77
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:46.210
Racism exists.
I'm not unaware of that.

78
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.150
But there is a high volume of it that's,

79
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.850
that's nonexistent to people that have good people.

80
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.060
And when you can merge yourself with good people and follow the paths that you

81
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:01.390
see that these good,
successful people have taken,

82
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.920
you then become a part of a world and group that nobody expected you to be in.

83
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.091
So for me,

84
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:10.550
I now have the position to do that and take all of these relationships and all

85
00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:12.970
of this knowledge and take it back to the people that need the most.

86
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.640
I like to share,
I don't want it all by myself.
Now,

87
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.860
are you doing this in the financial stuff?

88
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:21.910
You're doing this in videos or you like release not a videos?
No,
we're starting,

89
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.970
we're going to start,
uh,
we're going to start financial fitness.
Like I said,

90
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:29.300
we'll chase JP Morgan,
chase,
um,
Jamie diamond,
very good guy,
uh,

91
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.770
to shine de as well.
They're there help leading in charge of just saying,

92
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.330
how can we get to the people that we feel need the financial information the

93
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:41.560
most?
So I said,
put me out there like,
let's,

94
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:46.450
let's go directly to the consumer.
So from colleges,
uh,

95
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.590
from high schools,
um,
senior classes,
junior classes,

96
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.620
going out and talking to people before they go into the next stages of their

97
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.310
life,

98
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.270
about the things that you should know before you're going to speak to them well,

99
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.450
and just share personal information.

100
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.080
Are you going to put this stuff online as well though?
Yeah,
yeah,

101
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.210
you'll be able to track and find content from it.
But I'm authentic.

102
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.690
So I said the best way to really do it because it put me in a position to be

103
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.500
heard.
I want to be heard like,
like it's a different story.

104
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:15.130
What I explained to,
uh,
the,

105
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.070
the people of JP Morgan Chase just when we were talking about this and as an

106
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:21.470
amazing board of people,
uh,
that,

107
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:25.310
that are just figuring this out in the best way to go and do it.
And I said,

108
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.500
you can't have,
uh,

109
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.560
the white guy that's never been to the hood or who's not from the hood or has no

110
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:39.410
idea how the economy works here and what the real troubles are.

111
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.850
You can't throw that man in the situation to talk to people because I'm not

112
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:46.670
listening to you from the gate because you don't relate.
I don't relate to you.

113
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.110
But throwing somebody in a situation that's lived it,
that's been in it,

114
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.540
that's been fucked up in it,
made it out of it and is now coming back to help.

115
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.280
Right.
It's a different ballgame.
And that's what I want to be.
And you know,

116
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:03.500
we have other voices outside of myself.

117
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.140
I'm very powerful voices that are going to do it as well.

118
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:09.710
But the purpose is to align ourselves to really make a change.

119
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.610
So you can either be the conversation about making change and you can be actual

120
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.470
a part of the action to do it.

121
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:18.260
I want to be a part of the action and and doing it.

122
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.270
You'll also be able to understand my drive.
You'll get why I do so much.

123
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.950
You'll get why my hand is in so much because I have access to it.

124
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:31.370
And the question should be why not?
Yeah.
The question shouldn't be,
Yo,

125
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:33.380
why is he doing everything?
It should be,
why aren't you,

126
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.560
why don't you try to do everything?
Why not?
